# Bridge: A Unified Framework to Knowledge Graph Completion via Language Models and Knowledge Representation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2411.06660
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06660
- **Reference count:** 34
- **Primary result:** Proposed Bridge framework achieves 24.7% increase in MRR on Wikidata5M-Trans compared to state-of-the-art baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of knowledge graph completion (KGC) by proposing a unified framework called Bridge that combines language models with knowledge representation learning. The framework strategically encodes entities and relations separately using pre-trained language models (PLMs) while employing a structural learning principle to enable structured representation learning. To bridge the gap between knowledge graphs and PLMs, Bridge uses a self-supervised representation learning method called BYOL to fine-tune PLMs with two different views of a triple, avoiding semantic alteration.

The proposed approach demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art models on three benchmark datasets. The framework achieves increases of 24.7% in MRR, 26.8% in Hits@1, 25.8% in Hits@3, and 22.7% in Hits@10 on Wikidata5M-Trans. An ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each module, with structural triple knowledge learning and BYOL-based fine-tuning contributing to the performance gains.

## Method Summary
The Bridge framework jointly encodes structural and semantic information of knowledge graphs by strategically encoding entities and relations separately using pre-trained language models (PLMs). This approach enables better utilization of semantic knowledge while maintaining structured representation learning capabilities. To bridge the gap between knowledge graphs and PLMs, the framework employs a self-supervised representation learning method called BYOL to fine-tune PLMs with two different views of a triple. This fine-tuning process avoids semantic alteration while enabling the PLMs to effectively represent knowledge graph structures. The framework demonstrates superior performance on knowledge graph completion tasks compared to existing methods that rely solely on either structural knowledge or semantic information.

## Key Results
- Bridge achieves 24.7% increase in MRR on Wikidata5M-Trans compared to best baseline
- Performance improvements of 26.8% in Hits@1, 25.8% in Hits@3, and 22.7% in Hits@10
- Ablation study confirms effectiveness of structural triple knowledge learning and BYOL fine-tuning modules

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by addressing the fundamental limitation of existing methods that only use either structural knowledge from knowledge graph embeddings or semantic information from pre-trained language models. By encoding entities and relations separately using PLMs, Bridge can leverage rich semantic knowledge while maintaining structured representation learning capabilities. The BYOL self-supervised learning method enables fine-tuning of PLMs with knowledge graph data without altering the semantic understanding of the models. This dual approach allows Bridge to capture both the relational structure of knowledge graphs and the semantic context provided by language models, resulting in more comprehensive and accurate knowledge graph completion.

## Foundational Learning

**Knowledge Graph Completion**: The task of predicting missing triples in knowledge graphs. Why needed: Forms the core problem that Bridge aims to solve. Quick check: Understanding the basic structure of triples (head, relation, tail) and evaluation metrics like MRR and Hits@k.

**Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs)**: Deep learning models trained on large text corpora that capture semantic relationships between words and phrases. Why needed: Provides the semantic understanding capability that Bridge leverages. Quick check: Familiarity with transformer architecture and how PLMs generate contextualized embeddings.

**Knowledge Graph Embeddings**: Vector representations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs that preserve structural information. Why needed: Represents the traditional approach that Bridge builds upon. Quick check: Understanding embedding methods like TransE, DistMult, and RotatE.

**Self-supervised Learning**: Learning paradigm where models generate their own training labels from input data. Why needed: BYOL uses this approach for fine-tuning PLMs with knowledge graph data. Quick check: Understanding contrastive learning and different views of data.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** PLMs (entity encoder, relation encoder) -> BYOL fine-tuning -> Structural learning module -> Knowledge graph completion

**Critical Path:** Entity/relation encoding -> BYOL fine-tuning -> Triple representation generation -> Score calculation for completion task

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational efficiency for accuracy by fine-tuning large PLMs, but achieves superior performance through joint encoding of structural and semantic information.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation may occur when knowledge graphs contain entities or relations not well-represented in PLM training data, or when the BYOL fine-tuning fails to effectively bridge the gap between text and graph representations.

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Compare Bridge performance against single-model baselines on benchmark datasets
2. Conduct ablation study to measure contribution of each module
3. Evaluate scalability by testing on progressively larger knowledge graph datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Computational cost associated with fine-tuning large pre-trained language models may limit scalability to larger knowledge graphs
- Effectiveness of BYOL self-supervised learning method needs validation across different types of knowledge graphs and domains
- Limited number of benchmark datasets used for evaluation may affect generalizability of results

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the proposed framework on a larger and more diverse set of knowledge graph completion datasets to assess generalizability
2. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the computational requirements and scalability of the approach for larger knowledge graphs
3. Investigate the effectiveness of alternative self-supervised learning methods for knowledge graph representation learning and compare their performance with the proposed BYOL approach
