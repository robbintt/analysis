# Imitation Game: A Model-based and Imitation Learning Deep Reinforcement Learning Hybrid

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Hybrid DRL agent with discriminator outperforms pure SAC in voltage control tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses two key challenges in applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to power grid control: low sample efficiency and catastrophic forgetting. The authors propose a hybrid agent architecture that combines model-based DRL with imitation learning and incorporates a discriminator mechanism. The core idea is to use two parallel policies - a model-free SAC-based adaptive policy and a deterministic rules-based voltage controller policy - with a discriminator utilizing a world model to select between them based on projected performance. This approach allows the agent to learn from both direct environment interactions and imitation of existing control strategies.

## Method Summary
The hybrid agent architecture consists of three main components: a model-free Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) policy for adaptive voltage control, a deterministic rules-based voltage controller policy for safety fallback, and a discriminator mechanism that uses a world model to evaluate and select between the two policies. The world model predicts future states based on current actions, allowing the discriminator to estimate each policy's performance before execution. During training, the agent learns from both direct environment interactions and by imitating the rules-based controller's behavior. The discriminator continuously monitors both policies' projected performance and switches to the rules-based controller when it predicts potential grid code violations or suboptimal outcomes.

## Key Results
- The hybrid agent outperforms pure SAC in voltage control tasks on the CIGRÉ Medium Voltage benchmark grid
- Achieves better performance without grid code violations
- Demonstrates faster learning compared to pure model-free approaches
- Provides safety fallback through the deterministic controller policy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach works by leveraging the strengths of both model-free and model-based learning while mitigating their individual weaknesses. The SAC policy provides adaptive, data-driven control that can optimize for complex objectives, while the rules-based controller ensures safety through well-established voltage control principles. The world model-enabled discriminator acts as a safety supervisor, preventing potentially harmful actions by switching to the rules-based controller when needed. This architecture allows for rapid learning through imitation while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to changing conditions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**: An off-policy model-free RL algorithm that maximizes both reward and entropy - needed for stable learning in continuous action spaces; quick check: verify entropy coefficient tuning
- **World Models**: Predictive models of environment dynamics - needed for safe policy evaluation without real-world execution; quick check: validate prediction accuracy on held-out data
- **Imitation Learning**: Learning from expert demonstrations - needed to bootstrap learning from existing control strategies; quick check: compare performance with and without imitation component
- **Discriminator Networks**: Binary classifiers for policy selection - needed to safely switch between policies; quick check: analyze false positive/negative rates
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Loss of previously learned skills when training on new tasks - needed to understand why pure RL approaches struggle with stability; quick check: monitor policy performance over training epochs
- **Voltage Control in Power Grids**: Maintaining voltage within acceptable bounds - needed as the specific application domain; quick check: verify grid code compliance in all operating conditions

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Environment -> SAC Policy & Rules-based Policy -> World Model -> Discriminator -> Action Selection -> Environment

**Critical Path**: State Observation → World Model Prediction → Discriminator Evaluation → Policy Selection → Action Execution → Reward/Next State

**Design Tradeoffs**: The architecture trades computational complexity for safety and sample efficiency. The world model and discriminator add overhead but enable safer exploration and faster learning through imitation.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Discriminator consistently selecting rules-based policy may indicate poor SAC performance or inadequate world model accuracy
- Frequent grid code violations suggest insufficient discriminator sensitivity or inadequate rules-based policy coverage
- Slow learning rates could indicate poor imitation learning or inadequate world model generalization

**First Experiments**:
1. Run ablation test with SAC-only policy to establish baseline performance and safety metrics
2. Test discriminator performance in isolation by feeding it simulated state-action pairs from both policies
3. Evaluate world model prediction accuracy across the full state space of the CIGRÉ benchmark grid

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation confined to CIGRÉ Medium Voltage benchmark grid, limiting generalizability
- No analysis of performance under extreme contingencies or varying load patterns
- Lack of detailed analysis of discriminator decision-making criteria and failure modes

## Confidence
High: The hybrid architecture improves sample efficiency and mitigates catastrophic forgetting compared to pure SAC agents in the tested grid control environment.

Medium: The safety benefits of incorporating a deterministic controller as a fallback mechanism would hold across different grid configurations and operating scenarios.

Low: The discriminator's performance and robustness under extreme or unseen operating conditions.

## Next Checks
1. Test the hybrid architecture on multiple grid benchmarks (e.g., IEEE test cases) with varying sizes and complexity to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct stress tests with extreme contingencies and load variations to evaluate the safety fallback mechanism's reliability.
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the model-based component, imitation learning, and discriminator mechanism to overall performance.
