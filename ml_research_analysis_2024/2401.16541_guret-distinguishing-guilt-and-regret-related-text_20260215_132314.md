# GuReT: Distinguishing Guilt and Regret related Text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.16541
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16541
- Reference count: 40
- Models tested: Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, XLNet, DistilBERT, ELECTRA, GPT-3.5-Turbo

## Executive Summary
This study introduces GuReT, a novel dataset for classifying guilt and regret in text, addressing the challenge of distinguishing these complex emotions that share significant lexical overlap. The authors employed three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost) and six transformer-based deep learning models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, XLNet, DistilBERT, ELECTRA) for binary classification. Additionally, they evaluated three large language models using zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and tree-of-thought reasoning approaches. The transformer-based models outperformed traditional machine learning classifiers, achieving a 90.4% macro F1 score compared to 85.3% for the best machine learning classifier. The AlBERT model demonstrated the highest performance among transformers.

## Method Summary
The authors created the GuReT dataset by preprocessing and unifying previously collected ReDDIT and VIC datasets, resulting in 1,688 balanced instances of guilt and regret. They employed a three-pronged approach: traditional machine learning models using FastText word vectors, transformer-based models with fine-tuning, and large language models with different prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and tree-of-thought). All models were evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation on the same dataset with metrics including macro F1, weighted F1, accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Key Results
- Transformer models achieved 90.4% macro F1 score, outperforming machine learning classifiers (85.3% macro F1)
- AlBERT model demonstrated the highest performance among transformer-based models
- LLM prompting strategies showed varying effectiveness, with few-shot chain-of-thought achieving the best results among LLM approaches
- The GuReT dataset successfully enabled models to distinguish between guilt and regret despite their lexical overlap

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transformer-based models outperform traditional machine learning classifiers in distinguishing guilt and regret due to their superior ability to capture complex contextual and semantic nuances in text.
- Mechanism: Transformer architectures leverage self-attention mechanisms to model long-range dependencies and contextual relationships within text, enabling them to better differentiate between subtle emotional markers that distinguish guilt from regret.
- Core assumption: The semantic complexity of guilt and regret, including contextual factors like moral self-blame, outcome predictability, and self-discrepancies, can be effectively captured through contextual embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The results indicate a clear performance edge for transformer-based models, achieving a 90.4% macro F1 score compared to the 85.3% scored by the best machine learning classifier, demonstrating their superior capability in distinguishing complex emotional states."
  - [section] "The transformer models, such as Bert, Roberta, Albert, Xlnet, Electra, and Distilbert, outperform the traditional machine learning models, achieving accuracy scores between 0.894 and 0.908."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The novel dataset GuReT, specifically designed for guilt and regret classification, provides sufficient labeled examples to train models to distinguish between these complex emotions that share significant lexical overlap.
- Mechanism: By curating a balanced dataset with 1,688 instances of guilt and regret, the study provides a focused training ground for models to learn the subtle linguistic and contextual differences between these emotions.
- Core assumption: The dataset contains a diverse range of examples that capture the various textual markers discussed in Section 2, including outcome of decision, focus of emotion, harm, self-discrepancies, future decision making, and moral self-blame.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The resulting dataset is distinguished by its balanced composition, affording parity between the various class categories. Table 2 shows the statistics of the dataset after pre-processing and unification."
  - [section] "We created a novel dataset for classifying guilt and regret (See Section 4)."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-Turbo can leverage reasoning capabilities to classify guilt and regret, but their performance varies significantly based on the prompting strategy used.
- Mechanism: By employing different prompting strategies such as zero-shot, few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), the study explores how LLMs can be guided to reason about the complex emotional nuances that distinguish guilt from regret.
- Core assumption: LLMs can be effectively prompted to engage in reasoning processes that mimic human cognitive steps for distinguishing between guilt and regret, leveraging their pre-trained knowledge.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We trained and validated the proposed dataset using three large language models (LLMs) reasoning capabilities: (i) Zero shot, (ii) Few shot Chain-of-thought (CoT), and (iii) Tree-of-thought (ToT))."
  - [section] "In the realm of emotion-related tasks, particularly regret and guilt classification, LLMs have been harnessed for their advanced reasoning abilities."

  2. Fine-tune transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT) on the GuReT dataset and compare their performance to the machine learning models.
  3. Experiment with different prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot CoT, ToT) for GPT-3.5-Turbo on the GuReT dataset and analyze the impact on classification performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do cultural differences impact the distinction between guilt and regret in textual data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that "guilt association with ought self-discrepancies may vary with culture" and reference studies showing cultural variations in guilt experiences.
- Why unresolved: While the authors acknowledge cultural influences, they do not explore or quantify how cultural differences manifest in textual expressions of guilt and regret.
- What evidence would resolve it: A cross-cultural analysis of the GuReT dataset, examining how guilt and regret markers differ across various linguistic and cultural contexts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between model complexity and interpretability for emotion classification tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors compare traditional machine learning models with transformer-based models and LLMs, noting that transformers achieve higher accuracy but do not discuss the trade-offs in terms of model interpretability.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on model performance but does not address how to balance the superior accuracy of complex models with the need for interpretable results in affective computing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of model performance against interpretability metrics, potentially exploring methods to extract interpretable reasoning from high-performing transformer models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the GuReT dataset be expanded to include more nuanced emotional states and their interactions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "In the future, we would like to extend the dataset by providing neutral instances and negative emotions that are distinct in their understanding but can overlap with the existing labels."
- Why unresolved: The current dataset focuses solely on guilt and regret, limiting its applicability to more complex emotional scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic expansion of the dataset to include additional emotional categories, along with a validation of the dataset's effectiveness in capturing the interplay between multiple emotions in text.

## Limitations

- Dataset Specificity: The GuReT dataset, while novel and balanced, is derived from Reddit posts which may introduce platform-specific linguistic patterns that limit generalizability to other text domains.
- LLM Experiment Transparency: The prompt templates for GPT-3.5-Turbo experiments are not provided, making exact replication difficult.
- Cross-Domain Validation: The study does not report performance when models trained on GuReT are tested on different datasets or real-world applications.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The transformer models outperforming traditional ML classifiers is well-supported by the reported metrics (90.4% vs 85.3% macro F1) and aligns with established literature on transformer capabilities.
- Medium Confidence: The AlBERT model achieving highest performance is based on reported results but lacks statistical significance testing across different runs or datasets.
- Low Confidence: The LLM reasoning capabilities are demonstrated but with limited transparency in methodology, making it difficult to assess the robustness of these findings.

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce ML baseline: Implement the exact preprocessing pipeline and ML training procedure using the provided FastText features to verify the reported 85.3% macro F1 baseline.

2. Prompt template audit: Request and test the exact LLM prompt templates used in the experiments to reproduce the 73.8-77.8% weighted F1 scores and analyze sensitivity to prompt variations.

3. Cross-dataset validation: Test the best-performing models on an independent guilt/regret dataset (not used in training) to assess generalization beyond the GuReT corpus.
