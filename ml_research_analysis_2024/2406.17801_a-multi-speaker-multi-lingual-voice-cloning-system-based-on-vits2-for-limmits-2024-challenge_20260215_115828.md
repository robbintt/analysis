# A multi-speaker multi-lingual voice cloning system based on vits2 for limmits 2024 challenge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.17801
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17801
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Speaker Similarity scores of 4.02 (Track 1) and 4.17 (Track 2) in LIMMITS'24 Challenge

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multi-speaker, multi-lingual voice cloning system for the LIMMITS'24 Challenge, built on the VITS2 architecture with modifications for Indic languages. The system supports seven Indian languages (Bengali, Chhattisgarhi, English, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Telugu) and achieves speaker similarity scores of 4.02 in Track 1 (no additional data) and 4.17 in Track 2 (with VCTK dataset). The approach uses phoneme inputs via espeak, multi-lingual ID conditioning, and BERT embeddings for enhanced language comprehension across both male and female speakers.

## Method Summary
The system implements a VITS2-based architecture enhanced with multi-lingual ID conditioning and BERT for language comprehension. For Track 1, the model is trained for 136K iterations on the challenge dataset only, while Track 2 includes additional pre-training on 136K iterations followed by 50K fine-tuning iterations on both challenge and VCTK datasets. Text is converted to phonemes using espeak for supported languages, with Chhattisgarhi mapped to Hindi using IPA rules. The system processes 560 hours of TTS data across 14 speakers in seven Indian languages, achieving voice cloning capabilities through few-shot adaptation on target speakers.

## Key Results
- Achieved Speaker Similarity score of 4.02 in Track 1 (no additional data)
- Achieved Speaker Similarity score of 4.17 in Track 2 (with VCTK dataset)
- Successfully supports voice cloning across seven Indian languages
- Demonstrates effective performance in both mono-lingual and cross-lingual scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages VITS2's flow-based variational autoencoder architecture, which enables high-quality speech synthesis through end-to-end training. The addition of multi-lingual ID conditioning allows the model to distinguish between different languages during synthesis, while BERT embeddings provide contextual semantic information that enhances the model's expressiveness across diverse Indic languages. This combination enables effective few-shot voice cloning by conditioning on speaker and language identities simultaneously.

## Foundational Learning
- **VITS2 architecture**: Flow-based variational autoencoder for end-to-end TTS - needed for high-quality speech synthesis; quick check: verify mel-spectrogram reconstruction quality
- **Phoneme conversion**: Text-to-phoneme mapping using espeak and IPA rules - needed for consistent linguistic representation; quick check: validate phoneme outputs across all seven languages
- **Multi-lingual ID conditioning**: Language-specific embeddings for speaker conditioning - needed to handle language switching during synthesis; quick check: test language ID discrimination in latent space
- **BERT embeddings**: Contextual semantic information integration - needed to enhance language comprehension and expressiveness; quick check: compare outputs with/without BERT embeddings
- **Few-shot voice cloning**: Adaptation on limited target speaker data - needed for personalized voice synthesis; quick check: measure speaker similarity with varying shot counts
- **IPA mapping**: Chhattisgarhi to Hindi conversion rules - needed for handling low-resource languages; quick check: validate pronunciation accuracy of mapped phonemes

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Text -> espeak phoneme conversion -> BERT embeddings + Multi-lingual ID -> VITS2 encoder -> latent space -> VITS2 decoder -> speech output

**Critical path**: The phoneme sequence flows through BERT for contextual embedding generation, combines with multi-lingual ID conditioning, passes through the VITS2 encoder to generate latent representations, and is decoded to produce the final speech waveform.

**Design tradeoffs**: The system trades computational complexity (BERT integration) for improved language comprehension and naturalness. Using phoneme inputs rather than character-level representations improves pronunciation consistency across languages but requires accurate phoneme conversion.

**Failure signatures**: Poor naturalness scores indicate issues with phoneme conversion or BERT integration; speaker similarity degradation suggests problems with speaker conditioning or language ID handling during training.

**First experiments**:
1. Test phoneme conversion accuracy across all seven languages using sample text
2. Verify BERT embedding generation and integration with phoneme sequences
3. Validate speaker conditioning by synthesizing speech with different speaker IDs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: How does the proposed system's performance compare to state-of-the-art single-speaker TTS models in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not provide a direct comparison with single-speaker TTS models, only mentioning the VITS2 architecture and its modifications.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the multi-speaker, multi-lingual aspects of the system and does not provide a benchmark against single-speaker models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating the proposed system against state-of-the-art single-speaker TTS models on the same dataset and metrics.

**Open Question 2**: How does the use of BERT embeddings affect the system's performance in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity compared to using only phoneme embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that BERT is used to provide contextual semantic information and enhance the model's expressiveness, but does not provide a quantitative comparison with and without BERT embeddings.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide an ablation study or quantitative comparison of the system's performance with and without BERT embeddings.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing the system's performance with and without BERT embeddings on the same dataset and metrics.

**Open Question 3**: How does the system handle out-of-vocabulary words or words that are not present in the IndicBERT training data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that IndicBERT is pre-trained on 23 major Indian languages and English, but does not discuss how the system handles out-of-vocabulary words.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide information on how the system handles out-of-vocabulary words or words not present in the IndicBERT training data.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of the system's performance on a dataset containing out-of-vocabulary words or words not present in the IndicBERT training data, along with a discussion of the system's behavior in such cases.

## Limitations
- Exact implementation details of multi-lingual ID conditioning and BERT integration are not fully specified
- IPA mapping rules for Chhattisgarhi to Hindi conversion lack detailed documentation
- Evaluation metrics are not contextualized against established benchmarks in multi-lingual voice cloning literature
- Performance on out-of-vocabulary words or unseen linguistic constructs is not addressed

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: System architecture (VITS2 with multi-lingual ID and BERT) and training procedures (136K iterations for Track 1, 136K + 50K for Track 2)
- **Medium Confidence**: Phoneme conversion process using espeak and IPA mapping
- **Low Confidence**: Integration of BERT embeddings with phoneme sequences and specific IPA mapping rules for Chhattisgarhi

## Next Checks
1. Verify phoneme conversion outputs for all seven Indian languages using espeak and the IPA mapping rules to ensure consistency with the paper's methodology
2. Implement and test the multi-lingual ID conditioning and BERT integration with phoneme sequences to replicate the reported Speaker Similarity scores
3. Conduct cross-lingual synthesis experiments to validate speaker similarity scores in both mono-lingual and cross-lingual scenarios, ensuring the system's performance aligns with the reported results
