# State of the art applications of deep learning within tracking and detecting marine debris: A survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.18067
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18067
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: YOLO family models outperform other methods in marine debris detection, but comprehensive underwater debris databases are critically lacking

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews 28 recent studies on deep learning applications for marine debris detection and tracking from 2017-2024. The research identifies YOLO family models as the most effective approach for object detection in underwater environments, outperforming other deep learning architectures. However, a critical finding across all reviewed studies is the absence of comprehensive, publicly available underwater debris datasets, which significantly constrains research progress. When testing YOLOv5 on a small manually curated dataset, the authors observed only 19% accuracy and 32% false positive rates, underscoring the urgent need for larger, diverse training data.

## Method Summary
The survey employed a systematic review methodology examining 28 peer-reviewed studies published between 2017 and 2024. The authors analyzed each study's deep learning architecture, dataset characteristics, performance metrics, and reported limitations. YOLOv5 was selected for experimental validation based on its demonstrated superiority in the literature. The testing involved a manually curated dataset of 30 underwater images containing marine debris, with performance evaluated using standard detection metrics including precision, recall, and false positive rates.

## Key Results
- YOLO family models consistently outperform other deep learning architectures for marine debris detection in underwater environments
- All 28 reviewed studies identified lack of comprehensive, publicly available underwater debris databases as a critical research barrier
- YOLOv5 testing on a small manually curated dataset yielded only 19% accuracy and 32% false positive rate, highlighting data scarcity constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Deep learning excels at marine debris detection through its ability to learn hierarchical feature representations from raw image data. Convolutional neural networks automatically extract spatial hierarchies of features, from simple edges and textures to complex object patterns, enabling robust detection across varying underwater conditions. The YOLO architecture's single-pass detection approach provides real-time performance essential for practical marine debris monitoring systems, while its anchor-based bounding box prediction handles the diverse shapes and sizes of debris objects.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Underwater Image Degradation** - Why needed: Understanding how light absorption, scattering, and color distortion affect image quality; Quick check: Assess visibility range and color spectrum in sample underwater images
2. **Object Detection Metrics** - Why needed: Evaluating model performance beyond simple accuracy; Quick check: Calculate precision, recall, and mAP for test dataset
3. **Dataset Annotation Protocols** - Why needed: Ensuring consistent labeling across diverse debris types; Quick check: Review annotation guidelines and inter-rater agreement scores
4. **Transfer Learning** - Why needed: Leveraging pre-trained models for limited underwater debris data; Quick check: Compare fine-tuning versus training from scratch
5. **Anchor Box Design** - Why needed: Optimizing bounding box predictions for debris shape diversity; Quick check: Analyze aspect ratio distributions in training data
6. **Computational Efficiency** - Why needed: Enabling real-time detection on resource-constrained underwater platforms; Quick check: Measure inference time and memory usage

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image Acquisition -> Preprocessing -> Feature Extraction -> Object Detection -> Post-processing -> Output

**Critical Path**: The most critical components are Feature Extraction and Object Detection, where the model learns to distinguish debris from background and accurately localize objects. The YOLO architecture's unified detection pipeline minimizes information loss between components.

**Design Tradeoffs**: YOLO prioritizes speed over accuracy compared to two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN, making it suitable for real-time applications but potentially less precise for small debris objects. The single-pass approach reduces computational overhead but may struggle with overlapping objects.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include poor performance on small debris objects, high false positives from marine life or sediment, and degraded accuracy in low-visibility conditions. Model performance typically drops significantly when test data distribution differs from training data.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline YOLOv5 training on existing marine debris dataset to establish performance benchmarks
2. Cross-dataset validation testing model generalization across different underwater environments
3. Ablation study removing various components to identify critical features for detection performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The survey's analysis is limited to 28 studies from 2017-2024, potentially missing emerging research in this rapidly evolving field
- YOLOv5 testing was conducted on a very small dataset (n=30 images), providing limited statistical power for definitive conclusions
- The absence of comprehensive underwater debris datasets creates significant constraints on model validation and comparison across different approaches

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- YOLO family models' superior performance is consistently reported across multiple independent studies
- The critical lack of publicly available underwater debris datasets is unanimously acknowledged by all reviewed research

**Medium Confidence**:
- The 19% accuracy and 32% false positive rate from YOLOv5 testing on a small dataset indicates data scarcity constraints but requires larger validation studies
- The 40+ future research recommendations are comprehensive but largely based on identified gaps rather than empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic literature review extending beyond 2024 to capture any emerging research on marine debris detection datasets
2. Perform controlled experiments testing YOLOv5 and other models on multiple small datasets to verify the relationship between dataset size and detection accuracy
3. Develop and release a pilot underwater debris dataset with standardized annotation protocols to assess real-world model performance across different environmental conditions
