# Combining Machine Learning and Ontology: A Systematic Literature Review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.07744
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07744
- Reference count: 40
- 128 studies combine machine learning and ontologies to integrate inductive and deductive reasoning

## Executive Summary
This systematic literature review analyzes 128 studies that combine machine learning and ontologies, identifying three main hybridization categories: learning-enhanced ontologies, semantic data mining, and learning and reasoning systems. The review reveals that neural networks are the most commonly used machine learning technique, while only 37% of studies employ non-hierarchical reasoning rules beyond simple subsumption. The research maps these categories to existing hybrid AI design patterns and neuro-symbolic taxonomies, identifying key challenges including improving ontology expressiveness and decidability, advancing explainable AI, and managing consistency during ontology learning and mapping.

## Method Summary
The study follows Kitchenham et al.'s systematic literature review protocol, searching three scientific databases (Web Of Science, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct) using specific keyword queries combining "ontology" with machine learning terms. The selection process applied strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, requiring studies to combine at least one ontology with at least one ML technique while excluding posters, duplicates, non-English papers, and existing surveys. Quality assessment considered institutional affiliation, publication venue quality, and clear motivation/contribution.

## Key Results
- Identified three main categories of ML-ontology hybridization: learning-enhanced ontologies, semantic data mining, and learning and reasoning systems
- Neural networks emerged as the most frequently used ML technique across all categories
- Only 37% of studies employed non-hierarchical reasoning rules beyond simple subsumption
- Key challenges identified include ontology expressiveness, explainable AI advancement, and consistency management during ontology operations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The review's systematic approach ensures comprehensive coverage of the ML-ontology hybridization landscape by using standardized search protocols and rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria. By mapping findings to existing design patterns and neuro-symbolic taxonomies, the study provides a structured framework for understanding how different hybridization approaches relate to each other. The large sample size (128 studies) and focus on recent literature (2016-2022) captures current trends and challenges in the field.

## Foundational Learning
- **Systematic literature review methodology**: Essential for ensuring comprehensive and unbiased coverage of research literature; quick check: verify protocol adherence and inclusion/exclusion criteria application
- **Ontology-ML hybridization concepts**: Critical for understanding how deductive and inductive reasoning can be integrated; quick check: confirm three main categories are clearly defined and distinguishable
- **Neuro-symbolic AI taxonomy**: Important for contextualizing hybridization approaches within broader AI research; quick check: validate mapping between study categories and existing taxonomies
- **Machine learning algorithms in semantic contexts**: Necessary for understanding practical implementation choices; quick check: verify algorithm distribution statistics are accurately reported
- **Knowledge representation formalisms**: Fundamental for understanding ontology structure and reasoning capabilities; quick check: assess coverage of different ontology languages and reasoning approaches
- **Explainable AI principles**: Relevant for understanding transparency requirements in hybrid systems; quick check: evaluate how explainable AI is addressed across different hybridization approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
ML Techniques -> Ontology Operations -> Reasoning Rules -> Hybrid System Categories

**Critical Path:**
Database search → Inclusion/exclusion filtering → Quality assessment → Categorization → Pattern mapping → Challenge identification

**Design Tradeoffs:**
Breadth vs. depth of coverage (three databases vs. comprehensive literature search), recent vs. historical perspective (2016-2022 focus), quantitative vs. qualitative analysis (statistical patterns vs. thematic insights)

**Failure Signatures:**
Incomplete database coverage leading to missing relevant studies, inconsistent application of inclusion/exclusion criteria resulting in biased sample, subjective categorization affecting reproducibility of results

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Replicate database searches to verify initial paper counts (373 + 70)
2. Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria to sample papers to test consistency
3. Attempt categorization of papers using provided framework to assess reproducibility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Exact search results from February 2022 update not specified, limiting dataset verification
- Quality assessment criteria beyond basic requirements not fully detailed
- Subjective interpretation required for study classification into categories
- Database coverage limited to three specific sources, potentially missing relevant studies

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Identification of three main hybridization categories and their mapping to existing design patterns
- Statistical distribution of machine learning techniques across the literature

**Medium Confidence:**
- Classification of reasoning rules usage (37% non-hierarchical)
- Identification of key challenges (ontology expressiveness, explainable AI, consistency management)

**Low Confidence:**
- Exact contribution distribution across categories
- Specific quality assessment outcomes and detailed methodology

## Next Checks

1. Replicate database search queries across Web Of Science, ACM Digital Library, and Science Direct to verify search result counts and assess database coverage consistency
2. Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria systematically to verify that selected papers meet both InC1 (combining ontology with ML) and InC2 (not just comparing them) while properly excluding papers under ExC criteria
3. Reconstruct the categorization process for the 128 studies to verify distribution across learning-enhanced ontologies, semantic data mining, and learning and reasoning systems categories, checking for consistency with reported statistics
