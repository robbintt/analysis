# Explainability in AI Based Applications: A Framework for Comparing Different Techniques

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.20873
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20873
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Framework for comparing post-hoc explainability techniques on Vision Transformers using IoU and Coverage Ratio metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of comparing post-hoc explainability techniques for Vision Transformers (ViTs) by proposing a standardized framework. The authors recognize that different explainability methods often produce varying results for the same model predictions, making it difficult to assess their reliability and effectiveness. Their solution involves generating attribution maps from multiple explainability techniques, binarizing them, and quantifying agreement using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Coverage Ratio (CR) metrics. The framework is specifically designed to work with image classification tasks and is evaluated on the Imagenette dataset using six leading explainability methods.

The study reveals significant disagreements among different explainability techniques, with higher agreement observed between similar methods like LIME and KernelSHAP. The proposed CR metric provides nuanced insights into method coverage characteristics, showing that Beyond Attention produces more compact maps while Attention Rollout offers broader coverage. The findings emphasize the importance of using diverse explainability methods to enhance interpretability and reliability of AI decisions, rather than relying on a single technique. This work contributes to the growing need for standardized evaluation frameworks in the explainability field, particularly as AI systems become more complex and their decisions increasingly impact critical domains.

## Method Summary
The framework generates attribution maps from various explainability techniques applied to Vision Transformers, then binarizes these maps to enable quantitative comparison. The binarization process involves applying a threshold to convert continuous saliency values into binary pixels, where values above the threshold are marked as 1 and others as 0. The framework quantifies agreement between methods using two metrics: Intersection over Union (IoU), which measures the overlap between attribution maps, and Coverage Ratio (CR), which captures the proportion of pixels explained by each method. The evaluation is conducted on the Imagenette dataset, a subset of ImageNet containing 10 classes and 12,000 images, using six explainability techniques including LIME, KernelSHAP, GradientSHAP, Integrated Gradients, Attention Rollout, and Beyond Attention.

## Key Results
- Significant disagreements exist between different explainability methods when applied to the same ViT predictions
- Higher agreement observed between similar techniques (LIME & KernelSHAP showed IoU of 0.63 vs. 0.11-0.29 for other pairs)
- Beyond Attention produces more compact attribution maps while Attention Rollout provides broader coverage
- The Coverage Ratio metric reveals nuanced differences in how methods distribute attribution across images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by standardizing the comparison process through binarization and metric quantification, which enables objective measurement of agreement between different explainability techniques. By converting continuous attribution maps into binary representations, the framework creates a common ground for comparison that is independent of the specific mathematical formulation of each explainability method. The IoU metric captures spatial overlap between methods, while the CR metric provides insights into coverage characteristics, together offering a comprehensive view of method agreement and differences.

## Foundational Learning
- **Attribution Maps**: Visual representations highlighting which input features contribute most to model predictions. Needed to understand how explainability methods communicate their insights. Quick check: Verify maps highlight relevant image regions corresponding to predicted classes.
- **Binarization Process**: Converting continuous saliency values to binary pixels using thresholds. Essential for standardizing comparisons across methods with different output scales. Quick check: Ensure consistent thresholding preserves meaningful information across all methods.
- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**: Metric measuring overlap between sets of pixels in attribution maps. Critical for quantifying spatial agreement between explainability methods. Quick check: IoU values should range from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap).
- **Coverage Ratio (CR)**: Metric capturing the proportion of pixels explained by each method. Important for understanding method-specific characteristics and coverage patterns. Quick check: Higher CR indicates more extensive attribution coverage.
- **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**: Transformer-based architectures adapted for computer vision tasks. Relevant context as the framework specifically targets ViT models. Quick check: Confirm the model uses self-attention mechanisms for feature extraction.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Attribution Map Generation -> Binarization -> IoU Calculation -> CR Calculation -> Result Aggregation
**Critical Path**: Attribution map generation is the critical path, as all subsequent analysis depends on the quality and characteristics of these initial outputs.
**Design Tradeoffs**: The binarization process simplifies comparison but may lose information from continuous saliency maps. The choice of threshold affects binarization quality and must be consistent across methods.
**Failure Signatures**: Low IoU values across all method pairs indicate fundamental disagreements in attribution strategies. Inconsistent binarization due to poor threshold selection can artificially reduce agreement metrics.
**First Experiments**:
1. Generate attribution maps for a single image using all six methods to verify framework functionality
2. Test different binarization thresholds to assess sensitivity of IoU and CR metrics
3. Calculate pairwise IoU values for all method combinations on a small validation set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework limited to Vision Transformers and image classification tasks
- Binarization may discard valuable information from continuous saliency maps
- Evaluation conducted on relatively small Imagenette dataset (10 classes, 12,000 images)

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mathematical framework for comparing explainability techniques using IoU and CR metrics is sound
- **Medium Confidence**: Method-specific characteristics (compact vs. broad coverage) are supported by metrics but may be influenced by binarization
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about practical applicability and real-world reliability require further validation

## Next Checks
1. Apply framework to other vision architectures (CNNs, MLP-Mixers) and non-vision domains to assess generalizability
2. Repeat analysis using continuous attribution maps without binarization to capture additional nuances
3. Conduct user studies to evaluate correlation between mathematical agreement and human interpretability
