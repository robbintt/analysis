# Revisiting the Integration of Convolution and Attention for Vision Backbone

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.14429
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14429
- Authors: Lei Zhu; Xinjiang Wang; Wayne Zhang; Rynson W. H. Lau
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GLNet achieves 83.7%/84.5%/85.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k while being more efficient than recent state-of-the-art models

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes GLMix, a novel integration scheme for combining convolutions and multi-head self-attention (MHSAs) in vision backbones. The key insight is to apply Convs and MHSAs at different granularities: Convs for local features on a fine-grained feature grid, and MHSAs for global features on a small set of semantic slots. A pair of soft clustering and dispatching modules bridges the grid and set representations. The resulting GLNet family demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet-1k classification and downstream tasks while maintaining efficiency advantages over recent state-of-the-art models.

## Method Summary
GLMix integrates convolutions and multi-head self-attention by operating at different feature granularities. Convolutions process local features on a dense feature grid, while MHSAs operate on a sparse set of semantic slots. The integration is achieved through a soft clustering module that groups grid features into semantic clusters, and a dispatching module that routes these clusters to the MHSA slots. This approach allows the model to leverage both local and global information efficiently. The GLNet architecture builds upon GLMix, demonstrating improved performance on ImageNet-1k classification and various downstream vision tasks.

## Key Results
- GLNet achieves 83.7%/84.5%/85.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k
- The model is more efficient than recent state-of-the-art models
- Strong performance demonstrated on downstream tasks: object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation
- Visualization shows soft clustering produces meaningful semantic grouping without direct dense supervision

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The GLMix integration scheme works by exploiting the complementary strengths of convolutions and attention mechanisms. Convolutions excel at capturing local patterns and spatial relationships, while MHSAs are powerful for modeling long-range dependencies and global context. By applying these operations at different granularities and bridging them through soft clustering and dispatching, the model can efficiently process both local and global information. The soft clustering module enables the model to learn semantic groupings of features without explicit supervision, potentially leading to more meaningful representations.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA): Why needed - captures long-range dependencies and global context in vision tasks. Quick check - verify attention weights show meaningful relationships between distant spatial locations.
- Soft Clustering: Why needed - groups features into semantic clusters without explicit supervision. Quick check - visualize cluster assignments to ensure they correspond to meaningful semantic groupings.
- Feature Dispatching: Why needed - routes clustered features to appropriate MHSA slots for global processing. Quick check - trace feature flow through dispatching module to confirm correct routing.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input -> Convs (local features) -> Soft Clustering -> Dispatching -> MHSAs (global features) -> Output
- Critical path: The flow from input through Convs, Soft Clustering, Dispatching, and MHSAs represents the core processing pipeline.
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing local and global processing, efficiency vs. representational power, explicit vs. implicit semantic grouping.
- Failure signatures: Poor clustering quality leading to ineffective global processing, inefficient routing causing information loss, or imbalance between local and global feature extraction.
- First experiments:
  1. Test basic GLMix integration on a simple classification task to verify local-global feature processing.
  2. Visualize soft clustering results to confirm meaningful semantic groupings.
  3. Compare performance with and without the GLMix integration on a downstream task to isolate its impact.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance improvements primarily demonstrated on ImageNet-1k classification with limited ablation studies
- Efficiency claims need more comprehensive FLOPs and parameter count comparisons across different input resolutions
- Soft clustering module's robustness to different initialization schemes and behavior on out-of-distribution data requires further analysis

## Confidence
- High confidence: ImageNet-1k classification results and basic architectural claims
- Medium confidence: Efficiency comparisons and downstream task performance
- Low confidence: Generalization properties of the soft clustering module and its semantic grouping without dense supervision

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the GLMix integration's contribution from other architectural modifications in GLNet
2. Perform extensive efficiency analysis including FLOPs, parameters, and memory usage across various input resolutions and batch sizes
3. Test the soft clustering module's semantic grouping capabilities on out-of-distribution datasets and with different initialization strategies to assess robustness
