# Task Adaptation of Reinforcement Learning-based NAS Agents through Transfer Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.01420
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01420
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Pretraining RL-based NAS agents significantly improves target task performance and reduces training time across computer vision tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates transfer learning for reinforcement learning-based neural architecture search (NAS) agents across different computer vision tasks. The authors evaluate three transfer learning regimes (zero-shot transfer, fine-tuning, and full retraining) using the Trans-NASBench-101 benchmark with four tasks: object classification, room layout, autoencoding, and semantic segmentation. Their experiments demonstrate that pretraining on one task consistently improves performance on another task in all but one case when considering final performance. Additionally, pretraining significantly reduces the required training time, suggesting transfer learning as an effective tool for mitigating the computational cost of training NAS agents from scratch.

## Method Summary
The authors use reinforcement learning agents trained with the Ape-X algorithm to search for optimal neural architectures across computer vision tasks. The Trans-NASBench-101 benchmark provides four distinct tasks: object classification, room layout, autoencoding, and semantic segmentation. For each task, agents are trained for 10M time steps with 32-fold environment vectorization. The transfer learning evaluation compares three regimes: zero-shot transfer (using pretrained agent directly), fine-tuning (1M additional steps), and full retraining (10M additional steps). Performance is measured on validation sets during training and test sets for final evaluation, with all transfer scenarios tested across all possible source-target task pairs.

## Key Results
- Pretraining on one task improves performance on another task in all but one transfer scenario when considering final performance
- Transfer learning reduces training time requirements across all successful transfer cases
- Transfer effects occur regardless of source or target task, though some task pairs show more pronounced benefits than others

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Transfer learning works for RL-based NAS agents because the learned policy for searching neural architectures captures transferable structural knowledge about effective design patterns that apply across related tasks. The Ape-X algorithm's distributed architecture enables learning robust search policies that generalize beyond the specific source task. The embedding and transformer components in the agent architecture facilitate capturing task-agnostic architectural features that can be fine-tuned or adapted to new tasks with minimal additional training.

## Foundational Learning

**Reinforcement Learning for NAS**
- Why needed: Enables automated discovery of optimal neural architectures through trial-and-error
- Quick check: Agent learns to improve validation accuracy over training episodes

**Transfer Learning in RL**
- Why needed: Leverages knowledge from source task to accelerate learning on target task
- Quick check: Fine-tuned agent outperforms randomly initialized agent on target task

**Ape-X Algorithm**
- Why needed: Distributed RL framework that stabilizes learning through prioritized experience replay
- Quick check: Multiple parallel actors improve sample efficiency and policy convergence

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Agent -> Ape-X Algorithm -> Prioritized Replay Buffer -> Multiple Parallel Actors -> Neural Architecture Space -> Task-specific Reward Function

**Critical Path**
Training Loop: Agent selects architecture → Evaluates on task → Receives reward → Updates policy via Ape-X → Stores experience in replay buffer → Samples prioritized experiences for next update

**Design Tradeoffs**
The choice of 32-fold environment vectorization balances computational efficiency with diverse exploration, while the 10M step baseline ensures thorough pretraining. The three transfer regimes (zero-shot, fine-tuning, full retraining) provide a spectrum of computational costs versus performance optimization. The use of validation sets for training metrics and test sets for evaluation prevents overfitting during transfer learning experiments.

**Failure Signatures**
Poor transfer performance typically manifests as initial reward plateaus during fine-tuning or failure to exceed baseline random architecture performance. Insufficient exploration may lead to convergence on suboptimal architectures that don't generalize well to new tasks.

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Verify baseline performance by training RL agent from scratch on each of the four tasks for 10M steps
2. Test zero-shot transfer by applying pretrained agents directly to target tasks without fine-tuning
3. Evaluate fine-tuning performance by training pretrained agents for 1M additional steps on target tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to four computer vision tasks from Trans-NASBench-101 benchmark, restricting generalizability to other domains
- Does not explore cross-domain transfer scenarios (e.g., NLP to vision or tabular to image tasks)
- Fixed hyperparameters for Ape-X algorithm without sensitivity analysis across different RL configurations

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Pretraining RL-based NAS agents improves target task performance in most transfer scenarios (empirical results across 16 transfer pairs)

**Medium confidence**: Transfer learning consistently reduces training time requirements (observed across all successful transfer cases)

**Low confidence**: Transfer effects are independent of source/target task selection (conclusion based on limited task diversity)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies varying RL algorithm hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, exploration parameters) to determine sensitivity to configuration choices

2. Test transfer learning across additional task pairs beyond computer vision, including cross-domain scenarios (e.g., NLP to vision or tabular to image tasks)

3. Implement advanced exploration strategies during fine-tuning to verify whether improved exploration further enhances transfer performance, particularly for challenging source-target task combinations
