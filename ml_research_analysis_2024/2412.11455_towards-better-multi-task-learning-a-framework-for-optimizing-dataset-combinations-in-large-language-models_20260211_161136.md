# Towards Better Multi-task Learning: A Framework for Optimizing Dataset Combinations in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.11455
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11455
- Reference count: 13
- Authors: Zaifu Zhan; Rui Zhang
- Key outcome: Novel framework using neural networks to predict optimal dataset combinations for multi-task learning, achieving significant efficiency gains

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of selecting optimal dataset combinations for multi-task learning in large language models. The authors propose a framework that uses a neural network to predict the best dataset combinations, iteratively refining the selection to improve efficiency. The framework is designed to be model-, dataset-, and domain-independent. Through experiments on 12 biomedical datasets across four tasks, the authors demonstrate that their approach effectively identifies better combinations and significantly improves efficiency compared to brute-force approaches.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a novel framework that uses a neural network to predict optimal dataset combinations for multi-task learning. The framework iteratively refines dataset selections by predicting performance and selecting promising combinations for training. The approach is designed to be generalizable across different models, datasets, and domains. The framework is evaluated on 12 biomedical datasets across four tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction, and text classification.

## Key Results
- Framework identifies better dataset combinations, even for seemingly unpromising tasks from a human perspective
- Achieves optimal combinations within a dozen iterations versus 2,048 possible combinations
- Demonstrates effectiveness across multiple biomedical tasks including NER, relation extraction, event extraction, and text classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its iterative refinement process. The neural network learns to predict which dataset combinations will yield optimal performance by analyzing patterns across multiple training iterations. Each iteration provides new information that helps the network refine its predictions, gradually converging on better combinations. This approach is particularly effective because it can identify non-obvious combinations that might be overlooked by human intuition or simpler heuristic methods.

## Foundational Learning
The framework builds upon foundational concepts in multi-task learning, where models are trained on multiple related tasks simultaneously to improve generalization and efficiency. It leverages the principle that certain dataset combinations can complement each other, leading to better overall performance than training on individual datasets. The neural network component represents an advancement over traditional multi-task learning approaches by automating the selection process rather than relying on manual or heuristic-based decisions.

## Architecture Onboarding
The neural network architecture used for dataset combination prediction appears to be a standard feedforward network that takes dataset features as input and outputs predicted performance scores. The framework integrates this prediction component with an iterative selection mechanism that progressively refines dataset choices based on performance feedback. The architecture is designed to be model-agnostic, meaning it can work with different base language models without requiring modifications to the underlying model architecture.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions regarding the framework's broader applicability. The authors acknowledge uncertainty about how well the framework would perform when transferred to different domains beyond biomedical applications. They also note the need for further investigation into whether the framework's advantages persist when applied to larger-scale datasets and more diverse task types. Additionally, the interpretability of the neural network's selection decisions remains an area for future research.

## Limitations
- Framework's effectiveness primarily demonstrated in biomedical domain, with generalizability to other domains remaining unverified
- Neural network-based selection introduces black-box element that limits interpretability
- Comparison to brute-force approaches doesn't explore whether simpler heuristic methods could achieve comparable results

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Computational efficiency claims are well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness in identifying better dataset combinations demonstrated, but generalizability beyond biomedical domain needs validation
- **Medium confidence**: Model-independence claim plausible but cross-model validation is limited

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework's performance across diverse domains (e.g., legal, financial, general web text) to validate domain-independence claims.

2. Compare the framework's performance against simpler heuristic selection methods (e.g., dataset size, task similarity metrics) to establish its relative advantage.

3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of the neural network's architecture and training process on selection accuracy, and test whether simpler models could achieve similar results.
