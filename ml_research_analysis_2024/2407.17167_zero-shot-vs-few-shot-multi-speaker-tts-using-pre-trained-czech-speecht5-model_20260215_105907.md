# Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Multi-Speaker TTS Using Pre-trained Czech SpeechT5 Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.17167
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17167
- Reference count: 28
- One-line primary result: Pre-trained Czech SpeechT5 achieves acceptable few-shot TTS quality with 1 minute of target speaker data

## Executive Summary
This paper explores zero-shot and few-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis using a pre-trained Czech SpeechT5 model. The authors pre-trained the model from scratch on large-scale unlabeled Czech speech and text data, then fine-tuned it on a diverse multi-speaker TTS dataset. They evaluated the model's ability to generate synthetic voices for publicly known Czech politicians and celebrities using zero-shot (no fine-tuning) and few-shot (10 seconds, 1 minute, or 5 minutes of target speaker data) approaches. Listening tests showed that zero-shot performance was poor in both quality and similarity to real voices, while few-shot performance improved significantly, with 1 minute of fine-tuning data yielding acceptable quality and similarity for most listeners.

## Method Summary
The researchers pre-trained a Czech SpeechT5 model from scratch on 120k+ hours of Czech speech and 125GB of cleaned text data. They then fine-tuned this foundation model on a large-scale robust multi-speaker TTS task using a curated dataset of 1,668 hours and over 1 million audio samples from various sources including ASR datasets, radio broadcasts, and in-house TTS data. For evaluation, they tested 15 voices from three categories (oration, interview, read speech) using zero-shot TTS and few-shot TTS with 10 seconds, 1 minute, and 5 minutes of target speaker data. Audio quality and speaker similarity were assessed through listening tests with 10 participants using a web-based framework.

## Key Results
- Zero-shot TTS performance was poor in both audio quality and similarity to real voices
- Few-shot TTS with 1 minute of fine-tuning data achieved acceptable quality and similarity for most listeners
- Adding more fine-tuning data (5 minutes) further improved similarity, particularly for less monotonous voices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SpeechT5 model pre-training enables zero-shot TTS through learned speaker embeddings that encode voice characteristics in a shared semantic space.
- Mechanism: During pre-training, SpeechT5 uses cross-modal vector quantization to align speech and text representations in a unified semantic space. Speaker embeddings (x-vectors) are input alongside audio during training, allowing the model to associate speaker identity with acoustic patterns. This enables zero-shot generation by providing an arbitrary speaker embedding vector.
- Core assumption: Speaker embeddings capture sufficient information about voice characteristics to generate realistic speech without fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The zero-shot TTS is achieved by inputting the speaker embedding along with the text to be synthesized."
  - [section]: "During both pre-training and fine-tuning on the TTS task, a speaker embedding derived from the target signal is also input along with each audio training example."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus shows related papers on zero-shot TTS but no direct evidence about SpeechT5's specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If speaker embeddings cannot capture critical voice characteristics (e.g., timbre, prosody) or if the semantic space mapping is insufficient, zero-shot performance degrades significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning on large-scale diverse multi-speaker data enables rapid adaptation to new speakers with minimal data.
- Mechanism: The model is fine-tuned on a diverse dataset containing various voices, speech styles, and domains. This broad exposure allows the model to learn generalizable speech synthesis patterns that can be quickly adapted to new speakers through parameter updates.
- Core assumption: The diversity of the fine-tuning dataset provides sufficient coverage of speech patterns to enable effective few-shot adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We pre-trained the foundation model from scratch and fine-tuned it on a large-scale robust multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) task."
  - [section]: "Since the pre-trained SpeechT5 model is trained only with self-supervised learning to predict missing pieces of input data, we needed to fine-tune the model to multi-speaker TTS task first."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains related few-shot TTS papers but no direct evidence about this specific fine-tuning approach.
- Break condition: If the fine-tuning dataset lacks diversity or contains biases, the model may not generalize well to new speakers, requiring more adaptation data.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Quality and similarity improvements from 10s to 1m fine-tuning data are due to better speaker embedding learning and acoustic modeling.
- Mechanism: With 10 seconds of data, the model has limited examples to learn speaker-specific characteristics. Increasing to 1 minute provides more acoustic variation and speaking patterns, enabling better speaker embedding learning and more accurate acoustic modeling.
- Core assumption: One minute of speech contains sufficient acoustic diversity to capture speaker identity effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our results showed that the SpeechT5 model can generate a synthetic voice for any speaker using only one minute of the target speaker's data."
  - [section]: "Based on two listening tests, we evaluated the synthetic audio quality and the similarity of how synthetic voices resemble real voices."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains related papers on few-shot TTS but no direct evidence about the specific 10s vs 1m comparison.
- Break condition: If the speaker's voice lacks acoustic diversity within one minute or if the model cannot effectively utilize the additional data, similarity improvements may plateau.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning for speech representation
  - Why needed here: SpeechT5 uses self-supervised learning during pre-training to learn speech representations from unlabeled data without requiring transcriptions.
  - Quick check question: How does self-supervised learning enable SpeechT5 to learn from large-scale unlabeled speech data?

- Concept: Cross-modal representation learning
  - Why needed here: SpeechT5 aligns speech and text representations in a unified semantic space, enabling it to generate speech from text input.
  - Quick check question: What role does cross-modal vector quantization play in SpeechT5's ability to synthesize speech from text?

- Concept: Speaker embedding learning
  - Why needed here: Speaker embeddings (x-vectors) are used to condition the model on speaker identity, enabling both zero-shot and few-shot voice cloning.
  - Quick check question: How do speaker embeddings enable SpeechT5 to generate speech in different voices?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Pre-nets: Process input speech/text into latent representations
  - Encoder-decoder Transformer: Shared network for sequence-to-sequence transformation
  - Post-nets: Generate output in speech/text modality
  - HiFi-GAN vocoder: Converts log Mel-filterbank representations to audio
  - Speaker embedding system: Provides voice identity conditioning

- Critical path:
  1. Input text → Pre-net → Encoder
  2. Speaker embedding + Encoder output → Decoder
  3. Decoder output → Post-net → HiFi-GAN → Audio output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pre-training vs. fine-tuning: Extensive pre-training provides strong foundation but requires careful fine-tuning to avoid catastrophic forgetting
  - Speaker embedding quality: Better embeddings improve zero-shot performance but may require more sophisticated extraction methods
  - Dataset diversity vs. size: More diverse data improves generalization but may be harder to collect

- Failure signatures:
  - Zero-shot failure: Poor quality and similarity when no fine-tuning data is provided
  - Overfitting: Model memorizes fine-tuning data but fails to generalize to new text
  - Mode collapse: Generated speech lacks variation or becomes repetitive

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test zero-shot generation with random speaker embeddings to verify pre-training effectiveness
  2. Fine-tune with 10 seconds of data and measure quality/similarity improvements
  3. Compare 1 minute vs 5 minute fine-tuning to identify optimal data amount for different speaker types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but based on the methodology and results, several important questions remain unaddressed regarding the model's performance and limitations.

## Limitations
- Zero-shot TTS performance is poor, limiting practical utility for scenarios without target speaker data
- Listening tests involved only 10 participants, potentially lacking statistical robustness
- Dataset composition details are incomplete, making exact reproduction challenging
- Evaluation is limited to Czech speakers, restricting generalizability to other languages

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core findings that few-shot TTS with 1 minute of data produces acceptable quality and similarity, and that performance improves with more data, are well-supported by the listening test results and the technical methodology described.
- **Medium confidence**: The zero-shot TTS results showing poor performance are reliable given the experimental design, but the specific causes (whether from speaker embedding quality, pre-training duration, or other factors) could benefit from more detailed analysis.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that adding more data particularly helps less monotonous voices is supported by the results but would benefit from more detailed speaker acoustic analysis to understand the specific factors driving this improvement.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a larger-scale listening test (30+ participants) with proper statistical power analysis to verify the perceptual quality and similarity ratings across different data amounts and speaker types.

2. Perform detailed acoustic analysis comparing generated speech characteristics (prosody, timbre, speaking rate) between different fine-tuning data amounts to identify specific acoustic factors driving quality improvements.

3. Test the model's generalization to non-Czech speakers and different speaking styles (conversational, emotional, accented speech) to assess cross-lingual and cross-style capabilities.
