# Ontology Embedding: A Survey of Methods, Applications and Resources

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10964
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10964
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey of over 80 papers on ontology embedding methods, applications, and resources

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic overview of ontology embedding, a technique for representing knowledge from ontologies as vectors. The paper categorizes embedding methods into three technical solutions: geometric modeling, sequence modeling, and graph propagation. It analyzes applications in knowledge engineering, machine learning augmentation, and life sciences, while introducing mOWL, a Python library for implementing and evaluating ontology embeddings. The survey identifies key challenges including extending geometric models to complex ontologies, leveraging large language models, and developing comprehensive benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes findings from over 80 papers on ontology embedding methods. It identifies three technical solutions for generating ontology embeddings: geometric modeling (constructing embeddings that correspond to geometric regions), sequence modeling (using word embedding techniques on extracted sequences), and graph propagation (leveraging neighborhood information through graph neural networks). The paper also introduces mOWL, a Python library designed to support ontology embedding implementation and evaluation with modular design patterns for neural-symbolic systems.

## Key Results
- Geometric modeling methods achieve high interpretability by constructing embeddings that directly correspond to geometric regions representing ontology concepts
- Sequence modeling methods incorporate both formal semantics and textual literals, capturing richer semantic relationships for better downstream task performance
- Graph propagation methods effectively embed concept hierarchies by leveraging neighborhood information through message passing in graph neural networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Geometric modeling achieves high interpretability by constructing embeddings that directly correspond to geometric regions representing ontology concepts, enabling human-readable inference.
- Mechanism: Methods like ELBE and Box 2EL map concepts to high-dimensional boxes and individuals to points, using containment relations to model subsumption. This preserves the underlying model structure of the ontology in a way that humans can understand geometrically.
- Core assumption: The geometric representation can be optimized to satisfy the axioms of the ontology, and the resulting model is faithful to the original semantic structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "These types of embeddings are highly interpretable since they induce geometric relations between geometric objects representing relations, concepts and individuals which align with ontology axioms."
  - [section]: "These models adopt highly interpretable balls and axis-aligned boxes as well as fuzzy sets and order embeddings, supporting constructs that are not covered by simple ontology embedding models"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on embeddings generally but lack specific geometric modeling analysis.
- Break condition: When the ontology contains constructs that cannot be represented faithfully with simple geometric shapes, or when the optimization cannot converge to a model satisfying all axioms.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sequence modeling methods achieve better performance in downstream tasks by incorporating both formal semantics and textual literals, capturing richer semantic relationships.
- Mechanism: Methods like OWL2Vec* and OPA2Vec extract sequences from ontologies that combine entity contexts and literals, then use word embedding techniques to learn representations that capture both structural and textual information.
- Core assumption: The extracted sequences preserve meaningful semantic relationships between entities, and the sequence learning model can effectively encode these relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Several complex embedding frameworks such as OPA2Vec [24] and OWL2Vec* [25] were also proposed to embed both formal semantics and textual literals, often upon sequence learning methods."
  - [section]: "Such learned ontology embeddings usually have limited generality, and can only be applied with another jointly trained model."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers discuss embeddings but lack detailed analysis of sequence modeling with literals.
- Break condition: When the sequence extraction fails to capture important semantic relationships, or when the sequence learning model cannot effectively encode the combined formal and informal semantics.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Graph propagation methods effectively embed concept hierarchies by leveraging neighborhood information through message passing in graph neural networks.
- Mechanism: Methods like MEDTO use graph convolutional networks to propagate initial word embeddings through the concept hierarchy, allowing nodes to incorporate information from their neighbors to form richer representations.
- Core assumption: The concept hierarchy graph structure contains sufficient information to learn meaningful embeddings through neighborhood aggregation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Graph propagation represents an ontology by a (multi-relation) graph with initial node representations, and then learns a graph propagation model for new node representations."
  - [section]: "Methods of this type are commonly interpretable to a limited degree since they preserve mainly the concept hierarchy."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers mention graph embeddings but lack specific analysis of graph propagation for ontologies.
- Break condition: When the concept hierarchy is too sparse or when important semantic information is not captured through neighborhood relationships.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Description Logic and OWL semantics
  - Why needed here: Understanding the formal semantics of ontologies is crucial for designing appropriate embedding methods and evaluating their faithfulness to the original knowledge.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the EL++ and ALC fragments of Description Logic, and how does this affect ontology embedding approaches?

- Concept: Vector space geometry and distance metrics
  - Why needed here: Geometric modeling methods rely on understanding how concepts can be represented as geometric objects and how relationships can be modeled through spatial relationships.
  - Quick check question: How do different distance metrics (Euclidean, hyperbolic, etc.) affect the representation of hierarchical structures in ontology embeddings?

- Concept: Natural language processing and sequence learning
  - Why needed here: Sequence modeling methods require understanding how to extract meaningful sequences from ontologies and how to use NLP techniques to learn representations from these sequences.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between contextual and non-contextual word embeddings, and how do these differences affect ontology embedding approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Ontology parsing and transformation (extracting graphs/sequences) -> Embedding learning (geometric modeling, sequence modeling, or graph propagation) -> Evaluation modules (for axiom prediction, reasoning, etc.)
- Critical path: Ontology → Transformation (graph/sequence extraction) → Embedding Learning → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Geometric modeling offers interpretability but limited expressivity; sequence modeling offers better performance but lower interpretability; graph propagation offers a middle ground but may not capture complex semantics.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on axiom prediction tasks, inability to generalize to unseen concepts, or embeddings that do not align with human understanding of the ontology structure.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple geometric modeling approach (e.g., box embeddings) for a small EL++ ontology and evaluate its ability to predict concept subsumptions.
  2. Implement a sequence modeling approach (e.g., OWL2Vec*) for the same ontology and compare its performance on the same task.
  3. Implement a graph propagation approach (e.g., using GCNs) and evaluate its ability to capture hierarchical relationships in the ontology.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can geometric modeling methods be extended to support more complex ontology features beyond EL++ and ALC, while maintaining faithfulness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of current geometric models, stating "quite a few geometric modeling methods in the Euclidean space have been proposed, but they are mostly limited to the main features (constructs) of DL EL++ and ALC."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need for extension but does not provide specific solutions for modeling additional DL features like at-least and at-most restrictions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of new geometric modeling techniques that can handle a wider range of DL constructs, demonstrating both faithfulness and practical applicability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can Large Language Models (LLMs) be effectively integrated with ontology embeddings for improved knowledge representation and reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the potential of LLMs and suggests "A promising idea is to embed ontologies, especially those with literals, using LLMs."
- Why unresolved: While the paper recognizes the potential, it does not provide concrete methods for integrating LLMs with ontology embeddings or addressing challenges like hallucination and black-box nature of LLMs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementations demonstrating improved knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities through LLM-ontology embedding integration, along with methods to mitigate LLM limitations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective strategies for benchmarking ontology embeddings across diverse tasks and domains beyond the current focus on concept subsumption inference and concept alignment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies a lack of systematic benchmarking resources, stating "This direction still lacks systematic benchmarking resources."
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights the need for broader evaluation but does not propose specific strategies or datasets for comprehensive benchmarking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of diverse benchmarks covering a wide range of ontology-related tasks (e.g., learning complex concept axioms, entity resolution, query answering) and domains, along with standardized evaluation metrics and protocols.

## Limitations

- Geometric modeling approaches show promise for interpretability but lack extensive empirical validation across diverse ontology types
- Sequence modeling methods' effectiveness heavily depends on the quality of extracted sequences and the availability of textual literals
- The survey identifies a gap in comprehensive benchmarking across different ontology fragments and applications, making direct performance comparisons challenging

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The categorization of ontology embedding methods into geometric modeling, sequence modeling, and graph propagation is well-supported by the surveyed literature and provides a clear framework for understanding the field.
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported applications in life sciences and knowledge engineering are based on published studies, but many applications lack extensive validation or comparison with alternative approaches.
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed challenges (extending geometric models, leveraging LLMs, developing benchmarks) are identified based on current literature gaps but require further research to validate their significance and feasibility.

## Next Checks

1. **Geometric Model Validation**: Implement and evaluate multiple geometric modeling approaches (ELBE, Box2EL) on a standardized set of EL++ ontologies with varying complexity to assess their scalability and faithfulness to original semantics.
2. **Benchmark Development**: Create a comprehensive benchmark suite that includes multiple ontology fragments (EL++, ALC, SROIQ), diverse applications (reasoning, classification, knowledge completion), and standardized evaluation metrics to enable fair comparison across methods.
3. **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: Design and implement a neural-symbolic system that combines ontology embeddings with neural models for a specific application (e.g., protein-protein interaction prediction) and evaluate its performance against purely symbolic or purely neural approaches.
