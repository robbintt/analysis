- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05758
- Reference count: 40
- This study comprehensively evaluates the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4 and Gemini, across 14 medical imaging datasets spanning five medical specialties and three radiology report datasets.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse medical imaging tasks, revealing distinct strengths and limitations of different model architectures. Gemini models excel at report generation and lesion detection, while GPT models demonstrate superior performance in lesion segmentation and anatomical localization. Both model families show promise in reducing physician workload, though substantial enhancements remain necessary before clinical deployment.

## Method Summary
The study employs zero-shot evaluation of 10 MLLMs (including Gemini-Pro/Flash, GPT-3.5/4-Turbo/o, Claude-3-Opus, Yi-Large/Turbo, Llama 3) across 14 medical imaging datasets spanning five specialties and three radiology report datasets. Standardized prompts are used for tasks including disease classification, lesion detection, anatomical localization, and report generation. Performance is measured using accuracy metrics, ROUGE scores for report generation, and character generation time for efficiency evaluation.

## Key Results
- Gemini models excel in report generation and lesion detection but struggle with disease classification and anatomical localization
- GPT models perform better in lesion segmentation and anatomical localization but have difficulties with disease diagnosis and lesion detection
- Both model families demonstrate commendable generation efficiency across tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MLLMs can reduce physician workload by automating routine diagnostic tasks across multiple medical specialties.
- Mechanism: The models process multimodal inputs (images and text) to generate diagnostic insights, lesion detection, and report generation, enabling clinicians to focus on complex cases.
- Core assumption: The models' performance in zero-shot settings is sufficient for clinical decision support without extensive fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "While both models hold promise in reducing physician workload, alleviating pressure on limited healthcare resources, and fostering collaboration between clinical practitioners and artificial intelligence technologies..."
  - [section] "Our experimental results demonstrated that Gemini-series models excelled in report generation and lesion detection but faces challenges in disease classification and anatomical localization."
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.467, average citations=0.0." (Weak corpus evidence - limited citations suggest this is emerging research area)
- Break condition: Model performance drops below clinical accuracy thresholds or introduces significant diagnostic errors in high-stakes medical scenarios.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different MLLM architectures (Gemini vs GPT) show complementary strengths across medical imaging tasks.
- Mechanism: Gemini models excel at report generation and lesion detection through their multimodal processing capabilities, while GPT models perform better at lesion segmentation and anatomical localization through their language understanding strengths.
- Core assumption: The architectural differences between Gemini and GPT models translate to consistent performance patterns across medical imaging domains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results show that Gemini models excel in report generation and lesion detection but struggle with disease classification and anatomical localization, while GPT models perform better in lesion segmentation and anatomical localization but have difficulties with disease diagnosis and lesion detection."
  - [section] "In Section 4.1.1, the GPT-series models excelled in this task, accurately determining patient health status without requiring additional prompt information. The Gemini-series models followed in performance..."
  - [corpus] "RetinalGPT: A Retinal Clinical Preference Conversational Assistant Powered by Large Vision-Language Models" (Supporting evidence of MLLM applications in specific medical domains)
- Break condition: Performance patterns vary significantly across different medical specialties or when models are evaluated under different conditions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Zero-shot evaluation reveals both the potential and limitations of current MLLMs for medical applications.
- Mechanism: Testing models without fine-tuning demonstrates their ability to generalize across diverse medical imaging tasks while highlighting areas requiring improvement before clinical deployment.
- Core assumption: Zero-shot performance is indicative of real-world utility and can identify specific areas for model enhancement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "substantial enhancements and comprehensive validations remain imperative before clinical deployment"
  - [section] "Our experimental results demonstrated that Gemini-series models excelled in report generation and lesion detection but faces challenges in disease classification and anatomical localization"
  - [corpus] "MIND: A Noise-Adaptive Denoising Framework for Medical Images Integrating Multi-Scale Transformer" (Shows ongoing work to improve medical image processing)
- Break condition: Zero-shot performance proves insufficient for clinical decision support, requiring extensive domain-specific fine-tuning.

  - Quick check question: What are the key differences in imaging modalities across dermatology, radiology, and ophthalmology?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image encoder (CNN/ViT) -> Text encoder (Transformer) -> Cross-attention fusion -> GPT-style decoder -> Task-specific heads
- Critical path: 1. Image and text input preprocessing, 2. Feature extraction through respective encoders, 3. Multimodal alignment and fusion, 4. Task-specific processing through LLM layers, 5. Output generation and post-processing
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Parameter efficiency vs. performance: Gemini models may use more parameters for multimodal processing but achieve better report generation
  - Speed vs. accuracy: GPT models show faster generation times but may sacrifice some accuracy in certain tasks
  - Generalist vs. specialist: Current models attempt general medical applications but may benefit from domain-specific fine-tuning
- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent performance across different medical specialties
  - Difficulty with anatomical localization despite good lesion detection
  - Report generation quality varies significantly between models
  - Generation speed bottlenecks in real-time clinical applications
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate zero-shot evaluation across all 14 datasets to verify reported performance patterns
  2. Test model performance with prompt engineering variations to assess sensitivity to input formulation
  3. Evaluate model calibration and uncertainty estimation to assess reliability for clinical decision support

## Limitations
- Zero-shot evaluation may overestimate real-world performance and doesn't account for clinical deployment requirements
- 14 medical imaging datasets represent a limited sample of clinical scenarios and don't address demographic bias
- Generation efficiency metrics don't capture practical utility factors like API costs and healthcare IT integration

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The comparative performance patterns between Gemini and GPT models across different tasks (report generation, lesion detection, disease classification, anatomical localization) are well-supported by the experimental results and consistent with the models' architectural differences.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that MLLMs can reduce physician workload is supported by the study's findings but requires additional real-world validation in clinical settings to confirm practical impact on healthcare workflows.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that zero-shot performance is indicative of clinical utility requires substantial validation through prospective studies and real-world implementation trials before deployment in healthcare settings.

## Next Checks
