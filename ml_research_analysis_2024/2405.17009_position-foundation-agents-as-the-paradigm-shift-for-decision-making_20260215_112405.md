# Position: Foundation Agents as the Paradigm Shift for Decision Making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.17009
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17009
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Foundation agents—unified, multimodal decision-making systems—represent a paradigm shift for AI, analogous to the impact of large language models, by achieving rapid adaptation across diverse tasks through self-supervised pretraining and LLM alignment.

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that foundation agents—unified, multimodal decision-making systems capable of adapting across diverse tasks and domains—represent a paradigm shift for AI, analogous to the impact of large language models in language and vision. The authors outline three core characteristics of foundation agents: unified representation of state-action spaces and dynamics, a common policy interface across domains, and interactive decision-making in both physical and virtual worlds. They propose a roadmap for building such agents, starting from large-scale interactive data collection (from the internet or simulators), followed by self-supervised pretraining using trajectory modeling, and finally alignment with large language models to integrate world knowledge and human values. Challenges include developing a unified representation of heterogeneous decision-making data, establishing theoretical guarantees for policy optimization, and enabling open-ended learning without catastrophic forgetting. A case study on robotic control and Atari games demonstrates the feasibility of training generalist agents via autoregressive sequence modeling, though computational demands are significant. The authors call for interdisciplinary research to address these open questions and unlock the full potential of foundation agents in real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes building foundation agents through a three-stage process: large-scale interactive data collection from diverse sources (internet, physical environments, simulators), self-supervised pretraining on trajectory data using transformer-based sequence modeling to learn unified representations, and alignment with large language models to integrate world knowledge and human values. The approach aims to overcome limitations of traditional reinforcement learning by enabling rapid adaptation across diverse decision-making domains through a common policy interface and unified representation of state-action spaces and dynamics.

## Key Results
- Foundation agents can achieve rapid adaptation across diverse tasks by learning a unified representation of state-action spaces and dynamics through self-supervised pretraining.
- Large-scale interactive data collected from the internet, physical environments, or simulators provides diverse experiences that enable robust reasoning capabilities and handling of environment stochasticity.
- Alignment with LLMs integrates world knowledge and human values into foundation agents, enhancing their reasoning, generalization, and interpretability.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Foundation agents achieve rapid adaptation across diverse tasks by learning a unified representation of state-action spaces and dynamics through self-supervised pretraining.
- Mechanism: The agent learns embeddings of trajectory data using a Transformer architecture that tokenizes raw trajectories into standardized tokens. This unified representation allows the agent to generalize knowledge across different domains and tasks.
- Core assumption: Diverse sequential decision-making tasks can be represented as sequences of tokens that capture the essential information for decision-making.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "three core characteristics of foundation agents: (1) a unified representation of state-action spaces and dynamics, (2) a common policy interface across domains"
  - [section] "self-supervised pretraining aims to learn a representation function g : T ∈ Rd → Z ∈ Rm (m ≪ d) to distill valuable knowledge from trajectory data"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers discuss multi-agent systems and LLM-based agents but don't specifically address unified representation through self-supervised pretraining
- Break condition: If the tokenization scheme fails to capture the essential information across domains, or if the unified representation becomes too abstract to be useful for specific tasks.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Foundation agents can reason about behaviors, handle environment stochasticity and uncertainty, and navigate multi-agent scenarios by pretraining on large-scale interactive data from diverse sources.
- Mechanism: Large-scale interactive data collected from the internet, physical environments, or simulators provides diverse experiences that the agent learns from during pretraining. This exposure to varied scenarios enables the agent to develop robust reasoning capabilities.
- Core assumption: Exposure to diverse interactive data during pretraining enables the agent to develop general reasoning capabilities that transfer to new scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "large-scale interactive data collection (from the internet or simulators), followed by self-supervised pretraining using trajectory modeling"
  - [section] "large-scale interactive data can be collected from the internet (e.g., YouTube videos, tutorials, audios, etc) and physical environments, or generated through real-world simulators"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers discuss data collection and simulation but don't specifically address reasoning about behaviors or handling stochasticity
- Break condition: If the collected data lacks diversity or if the agent overfits to specific patterns in the training data, limiting its ability to generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Alignment with LLMs integrates world knowledge and human values into foundation agents, enhancing their reasoning, generalization, and interpretability.
- Mechanism: LLMs serve as world models and information processors, providing the agent with access to extensive world knowledge and human-aligned values. This integration enables better planning and decision-making.
- Core assumption: LLMs contain sufficient world knowledge and human values that can be effectively transferred to foundation agents for improved decision-making.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "alignment with large language models to integrate world knowledge and human values"
  - [section] "LLMs acquire extensive world knowledge and are aligned with human values... we argue that LLMs enable foundation agents to align with the world model and human society created by languages"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers discuss LLM-based agents but don't specifically address alignment mechanisms
- Break condition: If LLMs hallucinate or provide incorrect information, or if the integration process fails to effectively transfer knowledge to the agent.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning for RL
  - Why needed here: Traditional RL requires reward signals and extensive exploration, which is inefficient for foundation agents that need to learn from large amounts of unlabeled data.
  - Quick check question: How does self-supervised pretraining differ from traditional RL in terms of learning objectives and data requirements?

- Concept: Sequence modeling of decision-making
  - Why needed here: Decision-making processes can be represented as sequences of states, actions, and rewards, allowing the use of powerful sequence modeling techniques like Transformers.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages of using sequence modeling approaches like Transformers for decision-making compared to traditional RL methods?

- Concept: Multi-modal data representation
  - Why needed here: Foundation agents need to process diverse data types (text, images, actions) from various sources, requiring a unified representation scheme.
  - Quick check question: How does the tokenization process handle different data modalities, and what challenges arise in creating a unified representation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Collection Module -> Self-Supervised Pretraining Module -> LLM Integration Module -> Adaptation Module -> Decision-Making Module

- Critical path:
  1. Data collection and preprocessing
  2. Self-supervised pretraining on unified representation
  3. LLM alignment for knowledge integration
  4. Downstream task adaptation
  5. Real-world deployment and evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. computational efficiency
  - Unified representation vs. task-specific optimization
  - Pretraining data diversity vs. domain relevance
  - LLM integration depth vs. potential hallucination risks

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor generalization across tasks
  - Inability to handle novel scenarios
  - Hallucinations or incorrect decisions due to LLM alignment
  - Catastrophic forgetting during continual learning

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test tokenization scheme on diverse trajectory data to ensure unified representation captures essential information
  2. Evaluate pretraining effectiveness by comparing zero-shot performance on unseen tasks vs. random initialization
  3. Assess LLM alignment by measuring reasoning quality and hallucination rates on benchmark decision-making tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal granularity and representation of trajectory data for training foundation agents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses different tokenization approaches (modality-level vs dimension-level) and pretraining objectives but acknowledges that the efficacy of these methods in compressing raw trajectories into compact tokens is uncertain.
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights that due to the multi-modal and heterogeneous characteristics of interactive data, uncertainties persist regarding the best way to represent trajectory data. It's unclear whether a single data modality can comprehensively represent interactive data and effectively convey its underlying information and knowledge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating different tokenization methods and data modalities on their ability to capture relevant information and improve agent performance across diverse tasks and domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can theoretical guarantees be established for policy optimization with foundation agents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that "the optimization of a generalist policy with foundation agents still lacks a solid theoretical foundation" and proposes defining pretraining and task-specific objectives, understanding the interplay between pretraining and task-specific optimization, and extending existing theoretical frameworks.
- Why unresolved: Traditional RL has well-established theoretical foundations like the Bellman optimality update, but foundation agents involve complex pretraining objectives and a unified policy interface across diverse tasks, making it challenging to adapt existing theories.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of new theoretical frameworks that account for the unique characteristics of foundation agents, including convergence properties, sample efficiency, and generalization bounds.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can foundation agents effectively learn from open-ended tasks without catastrophic forgetting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenges of continual learning and adaptation in open-ended tasks, highlighting the need for agents to handle an unlimited variety of goals and dynamically changing training objectives.
- Why unresolved: Current approaches to continual learning often struggle with catastrophic forgetting, and open-ended tasks introduce additional complexities like novelty detection and the need for creativity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating that foundation agents can learn new tasks and goals over time without forgetting previously acquired skills, while also exhibiting adaptability to novel situations and the ability to generate innovative solutions.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on unproven assumptions about the scalability of unified representations across heterogeneous decision-making domains
- Limited empirical validation of core mechanisms, particularly the integration of diverse data modalities into a coherent trajectory model
- Acknowledged but unquantified computational requirements for pretraining on large-scale interactive data

## Confidence
- High confidence: The identification of core challenges in current decision-making systems (poor generalization, catastrophic forgetting, lack of world knowledge integration)
- Medium confidence: The proposed roadmap structure (data collection → pretraining → alignment → adaptation) represents a logical progression, though specific implementation details remain underspecified
- Low confidence: Claims about the effectiveness of unified representations for cross-domain generalization, as the paper lacks empirical evidence demonstrating this capability across truly diverse tasks

## Next Checks
1. **Tokenization Validation**: Implement the proposed tokenization scheme on heterogeneous trajectory data (robotic control, Atari games, text-based decisions) and evaluate whether the unified representation captures task-relevant information while maintaining cross-domain compatibility. Measure information retention through reconstruction accuracy and downstream task performance.

2. **Pretraining Effectiveness Test**: Compare zero-shot performance of the pretrained foundation agent on unseen decision-making tasks against randomly initialized baselines and task-specific models. Use a diverse evaluation suite including sparse-reward environments, long-horizon reasoning tasks, and multi-agent scenarios to assess generalization claims.

3. **LLM Alignment Assessment**: Conduct controlled experiments measuring the impact of LLM integration on decision quality, hallucination rates, and interpretability. Compare foundation agents with and without LLM alignment on tasks requiring world knowledge, human value alignment, and reasoning under uncertainty.
