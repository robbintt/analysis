# Modeling User Fatigue for Sequential Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.11764
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11764
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: FRec improves AUC by up to 0.026 and GAUC by up to 0.019 over state-of-the-art models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses user fatigue in sequential recommendation systems, where repeated exposure to similar content diminishes user experience. The authors propose FRec, a method that explicitly models user fatigue during interest learning by constructing an interest-aware similarity matrix and incorporating fatigue dynamics through specialized components. The approach combines short-term interest learning with fatigue modeling using a novel fatigue-gated recurrent unit, while employing sequence augmentation for contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on both public benchmarks and industrial datasets, with online experiments confirming fatigue reduction and enhanced user experience.

## Method Summary
FRec models user fatigue by integrating it into the interest learning process through multiple innovations. The method constructs an interest-aware similarity matrix to capture item relationships while accounting for fatigue patterns. A fatigue-enhanced multi-interest fusion mechanism combines different interest representations while adjusting for fatigue levels. The fatigue-gated recurrent unit processes sequential data with explicit fatigue gating to modulate short-term interest learning. Additionally, FRec employs a novel sequence augmentation strategy for contrastive learning, helping the model distinguish between genuinely diverse recommendations and those that appear different but still induce fatigue. The framework is trained end-to-end to optimize both recommendation accuracy and fatigue reduction.

## Key Results
- FRec achieves AUC improvements of up to 0.026 compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models
- GAUC improvements reach up to 0.019 on tested datasets
- Online experiments demonstrate effective fatigue reduction and improved user experience metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FRec works by explicitly modeling the relationship between user interest and fatigue states rather than treating them as separate phenomena. The interest-aware similarity matrix captures not just content similarity but also how repeated exposure affects user perception, allowing the model to recognize when diversity is needed. The fatigue-gated recurrent unit modulates the learning of short-term interests based on current fatigue levels, preventing the model from reinforcing patterns that lead to user disengagement. By incorporating fatigue modeling directly into the interest learning pipeline, FRec can make recommendations that maintain user engagement while avoiding content that would trigger fatigue, even if that content might otherwise appear relevant based on past behavior.

## Foundational Learning
- **Sequential recommendation fundamentals**: Understanding how to model user behavior sequences for personalized recommendations - needed to grasp the baseline approaches that FRec improves upon
- **User fatigue modeling**: Concept of how repeated exposure to similar content affects user engagement - critical for understanding the problem FRec addresses
- **Interest-aware similarity matrices**: Techniques for capturing item relationships that consider user preferences - forms the basis for FRec's similarity construction
- **Recurrent neural networks for sequences**: How RNNs process sequential data for recommendation - essential for understanding the fatigue-gated recurrent unit
- **Contrastive learning**: Methods for learning representations by contrasting positive and negative samples - relevant for understanding the sequence augmentation approach
- **Multi-interest fusion**: Combining multiple interest representations for more diverse recommendations - core to FRec's approach

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input sequence -> Fatigue-Aware Similarity Matrix -> Fatigue-Enhanced Multi-Interest Fusion -> Fatigue-Gated Recurrent Unit -> Recommendation Output

**Critical Path**: The core recommendation generation flows through the interest-aware similarity matrix, which feeds into the multi-interest fusion module, then through the fatigue-gated recurrent unit for final predictions. The sequence augmentation for contrastive learning runs in parallel during training.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model trades increased computational complexity for better fatigue modeling, requiring more parameters than standard sequential models but achieving superior performance. The fatigue gating mechanism adds latency but enables more nuanced recommendations. The sequence augmentation approach increases training time but improves generalization.

**Failure Signatures**: If the fatigue gating is too aggressive, recommendations may become overly diverse and lose relevance. If the similarity matrix doesn't properly capture fatigue patterns, the model may still recommend repetitive content. Poor sequence augmentation could lead to biased training or failure to generalize across different user fatigue patterns.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Ablation study removing the fatigue-gated recurrent unit to measure its individual contribution
2. Testing with different fatigue decay rates to find optimal fatigue modeling parameters
3. Comparing sequence augmentation strategies to validate the chosen approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions beyond the standard evaluation of their proposed approach. The primary focus is on demonstrating the effectiveness of the FRec framework through comprehensive experiments on public and industrial datasets.

## Limitations
- Generalizability beyond evaluated datasets and domains remains uncertain, as fatigue patterns may vary significantly across different recommendation contexts
- Lack of extensive ablation studies to isolate individual contributions of the novel components (fatigue-enhanced multi-interest fusion and fatigue-gated recurrent unit)
- Evaluation metrics don't include direct user-centric measures like satisfaction surveys or engagement quality indicators to validate fatigue reduction claims

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Overall performance improvements | Medium |
| Fatigue modeling effectiveness | Medium |
| Individual component contributions | Low |
| Cross-domain applicability | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the fatigue-enhanced multi-interest fusion and fatigue-gated recurrent unit components
2. Perform cross-domain validation by testing FRec on diverse recommendation scenarios beyond e-commerce and content platforms
3. Implement user satisfaction surveys and engagement quality metrics to directly measure the impact of fatigue reduction on user experience
