core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of designing a control policy
  for an infinite-horizon discounted cost Markov decision process when only an approximate
  model is available. The main question is how well an optimal policy for the approximate
  model performs when used in the original model.

# Model approximation in MDPs with unbounded per-step cost
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.08813
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08813
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Provides bounds on the weighted norm of the difference between the value function of an approximate policy and the optimal value function in discounted cost MDPs with unbounded per-step costs.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of designing a control policy for an infinite-horizon discounted cost Markov decision process when only an approximate model is available. The authors provide bounds on the weighted norm of the difference between the value function of the approximate policy in the original model and the optimal value function of the original model. They introduce the concept of Bellman mismatch functionals and use them to derive these bounds. The results are extended to include affine transformations of the per-step cost, which can potentially lead to tighter bounds. The authors also provide upper bounds that explicitly depend on the weighted distance between cost functions and transition kernels of the original and approximate models.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze model approximation in discounted cost MDPs with potentially unbounded per-step costs. They introduce Bellman mismatch functionals to measure the discrepancy between the value functions of the approximate and original models. Using these functionals, they derive bounds on the weighted norm of the difference between the value function of an optimal policy for the approximate model when applied to the original model, and the optimal value function of the original model. The analysis is extended to incorporate affine transformations of the per-step cost function, allowing for potentially tighter bounds. The authors also provide upper bounds that explicitly depend on the weighted distance between the cost functions and transition kernels of the original and approximate models.

## Key Results
- Introduced Bellman mismatch functionals to measure the discrepancy between value functions of approximate and original models
- Derived bounds on the weighted norm of the difference between the value function of an approximate policy and the optimal value function
- Extended results to include affine transformations of the per-step cost, potentially leading to tighter bounds
- Provided upper bounds that explicitly depend on the weighted distance between cost functions and transition kernels of original and approximate models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind the results relies on the introduction of Bellman mismatch functionals, which capture the difference in the Bellman equations of the approximate and original models. By bounding these functionals, the authors can control the deviation of the value function of the approximate policy from the optimal value function of the original model. The use of weighted norms allows for a more refined analysis, particularly in cases where the per-step cost is unbounded. The extension to affine transformations of the cost function provides additional flexibility in tightening the bounds, as the transformation can be chosen to minimize the Bellman mismatch functionals.

## Foundational Learning
- **Weighted norms**: Needed to handle potentially unbounded per-step costs and provide a more refined analysis. Quick check: Ensure the weighting function is chosen appropriately for the specific problem.
- **Bellman mismatch functionals**: Key concept introduced to measure the discrepancy between the value functions of approximate and original models. Quick check: Verify that the Bellman mismatch functionals are correctly computed and bounded.
- **Affine transformations of cost functions**: Extension to potentially tighten the bounds by allowing for more flexible cost function approximations. Quick check: Ensure the affine transformation parameters are chosen to minimize the Bellman mismatch functionals.
- **Discounted cost MDPs**: The setting considered in the paper, where the goal is to minimize the expected discounted sum of costs over an infinite horizon. Quick check: Confirm that the discount factor is appropriately chosen for the problem at hand.
- **Model approximation**: The central problem addressed, where an optimal policy is designed based on an approximate model and then applied to the original model. Quick check: Assess the quality of the approximate model and its impact on the performance of the derived policy.
- **Weighted distance between transition kernels**: Used to quantify the similarity between the approximate and original models. Quick check: Verify that the weighted distance between transition kernels is appropriately bounded.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Original MDP -> Approximate MDP -> Bellman mismatch functionals -> Weighted norm bounds
- **Critical path**: Approximate MDP -> Bellman mismatch functionals -> Weighted norm bounds
- **Design tradeoffs**: Tighter bounds vs. computational complexity of computing Bellman mismatch functionals and weighted distances
- **Failure signatures**: Large Bellman mismatch functionals or weighted distances between cost functions and transition kernels may lead to looser bounds or invalid approximations
- **First experiments**:
  1. Evaluate the tightness of the derived bounds on a simple MDP with known optimal policy
  2. Investigate the impact of different weighting functions on the bounds
  3. Compare the performance of the approximate policy with and without affine cost transformations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on discounted cost MDPs limits direct applicability to average-reward or finite-horizon settings
- Analysis relies on weighted norms and Bellman mismatch functionals that may be difficult to compute or bound in practice
- Extension to affine transformations requires careful selection of transformation parameters to achieve tighter bounds
- Theoretical bounds provided, but computational tractability and empirical validation are not extensively addressed

## Confidence
- Theoretical results: **High** - rigorous mathematical framework and derivation of bounds
- Practical utility of bounds: **Medium** - effectiveness depends on ability to estimate or bound Bellman mismatch functionals and weighted distances
- Applicability to specific problem domains: **Medium** - illustrative examples provided but not exhaustive

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the tightness of the derived bounds on benchmark MDPs with known optimal policies to assess practical utility
2. Investigate the sensitivity of the bounds to the choice of weighting functions and affine cost transformations in representative control problems
3. Extend the analysis to average-reward MDPs or finite-horizon settings to broaden the scope of applicability
