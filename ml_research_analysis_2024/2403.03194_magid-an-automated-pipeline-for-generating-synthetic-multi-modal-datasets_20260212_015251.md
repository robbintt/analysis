# MAGID: An Automated Pipeline for Generating Synthetic Multi-modal Datasets

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2403.03194
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03194
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Primary result:** MAGID converts text-only dialogues into multi-modal ones using diffusion models and a quality assurance module, outperforming retrieval-based baselines in human and quantitative evaluations.

## Executive Summary
MAGID introduces a generative pipeline to convert text-only dialogues into multi-modal ones by identifying suitable utterances, generating aligned images using diffusion models, and incorporating a quality assurance module. This addresses limitations of retrieval-based approaches, ensuring privacy, diversity, and quality. Using prompt engineering and a feedback loop, MAGID produces high-quality, realistic dialogues. Evaluations show it outperforms baselines in human assessments and quantitative metrics, with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 achieving the best results. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the quality assurance module. MAGID offers a scalable alternative to traditional methods for creating multi-modal datasets.

## Method Summary
MAGID automates the generation of multi-modal dialogues from text-only datasets. It first identifies utterances in dialogues suitable for image generation, then employs a diffusion model to produce aligned images for those utterances. A quality assurance module evaluates and refines the generated content via a feedback loop. The pipeline leverages prompt engineering to enhance the realism and relevance of both images and dialogue context, ensuring the final dataset is both diverse and high-quality.

## Key Results
- MAGID outperforms retrieval-based baselines in human evaluations and quantitative metrics.
- GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 yield the best results as evaluators within MAGID.
- Ablation studies confirm the quality assurance module's contribution to improved dataset quality.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MAGID's generative approach allows for the creation of multi-modal dialogues that are both diverse and privacy-preserving, as it does not rely on
