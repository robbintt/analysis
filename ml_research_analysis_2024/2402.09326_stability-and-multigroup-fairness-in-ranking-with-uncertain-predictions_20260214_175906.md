# Stability and Multigroup Fairness in Ranking with Uncertain Predictions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.09326
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09326
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Uncertainty-Aware (UA) ranking functions achieve both anonymity and stability while naturally composing with multiaccurate predictors for multigroup fairness

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of designing fair and stable ranking functions when predictions are inherently uncertain. The authors establish that deterministic ranking functions cannot simultaneously satisfy anonymity (treating all individuals symmetrically) and stability (insensitivity to small perturbations in predictions). To overcome this limitation, they propose Uncertainty-Aware (UA) ranking functions that achieve both properties. The key theoretical contribution shows that UA rankings naturally compose with multiaccurate and multicalibrated predictors to achieve multigroup fairness, providing a principled way to handle uncertainty while maintaining fairness guarantees across subgroups.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware (UA) ranking functions that operate on probabilistic predictions rather than point estimates. These rankings treat all individuals symmetrically (anonymity) and are designed to be stable under small perturbations in the prediction distribution. The core mechanism involves using the uncertainty distribution directly in the ranking process, rather than relying on deterministic scores. The authors prove that when the underlying predictor is unbiased across a collection of subgroups, the UA ranking will be close to the ranking induced by the ground truth label distribution for those subgroups. This provides a framework for interpolating between individual and group-level fairness by varying the granularity of the subgroup collection.

## Key Results
- Deterministic ranking functions cannot achieve both anonymity and stability simultaneously
- UA rankings naturally compose with multiaccurate predictors to achieve multigroup fairness guarantees
- Experimental results show UA rankings are highly stable under noise injection and maintain reasonable utility compared to other methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by incorporating uncertainty directly into the ranking process rather than treating it as a post-processing step. By using probabilistic predictions instead of point estimates, UA rankings can maintain stability since small changes in the prediction distribution result in small changes in the final ranking. The anonymity property is preserved by treating all individuals symmetrically in the probabilistic ranking process. The multigroup fairness composition arises naturally because the UA ranking operates on the same probabilistic space where the multiaccurate predictor provides unbiased estimates across subgroups.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Anonymity in ranking functions**
   - Why needed: Ensures fair treatment of all individuals regardless of identity
   - Quick check: Verify ranking is invariant to individual reordering

2. **Stability under perturbation**
   - Why needed: Robustness to noise and uncertainty in predictions
   - Quick check: Measure ranking changes under small input perturbations

3. **Multigroup fairness composition**
   - Why needed: Enables fairness guarantees across multiple subgroups
   - Quick check: Validate fairness bounds across different subgroup collections

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Prediction model -> Uncertainty estimation -> UA ranking function -> Final ranked list

**Critical Path**: The ranking function is the core component that transforms uncertain predictions into stable rankings while maintaining fairness properties. This involves computing the expected rank under the uncertainty distribution and using this to produce the final ordering.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff is between granularity of subgroup collection (finer granularity provides better individual fairness but weaker group guarantees) and computational complexity (more subgroups require more computation).

**Failure Signatures**: Rankings may become unstable if uncertainty estimates are poorly calibrated or if the predictor is significantly biased across subgroups. The method may also struggle with very coarse subgroup collections that don't capture important variations in the data.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test UA ranking stability under synthetic noise injection across different noise levels
2. Evaluate multigroup fairness properties across varying subgroup granularities
3. Compare computational efficiency against deterministic ranking baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework assumes perfect knowledge of uncertainty distribution, which may not hold in practice
- Experimental validation relies on synthetic noise injection rather than real-world uncertainty scenarios
- Utility comparisons focus primarily on stability metrics rather than comprehensive fairness-utility trade-offs

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Theoretical impossibility of deterministic rankings achieving both anonymity and stability | High |
| Experimental results showing stability improvements under synthetic noise | Medium |
| Multigroup fairness guarantees depending on quality of uncertainty estimates | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate UA ranking approach on real-world datasets where uncertainty estimates come from actual prediction systems rather than synthetic noise
2. Test multigroup fairness properties across a wider range of subgroup granularities and distributions to understand limits of fairness guarantees
3. Compare computational efficiency and scalability of UA rankings against other uncertainty-aware ranking methods on large-scale datasets to assess practical viability
