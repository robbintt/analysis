## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of tool learning with large language models, addressing the rapid growth and fragmented nature of this emerging field. The survey systematically reviews existing literature through two primary lenses: the benefits of tool integration and the inherent benefits of the tool learning paradigm. It covers how tool learning is implemented across four key stages - task planning, tool selection, tool calling, and response generation - and provides detailed taxonomies and practical examples of both tuning-free and tuning-based methods.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews existing literature on tool learning with LLMs, categorizing methods into tuning-free and tuning-based approaches. It examines tool learning across four key stages: task planning (breaking down complex tasks), tool selection (choosing appropriate tools), tool calling (executing tool functions), and response generation (formulating final answers). The authors analyze recent advancements in each stage, summarize existing benchmarks and evaluation methods, and discuss current challenges including high latency, evaluation rigor, and safety concerns. The survey also proposes future research directions such as developing unified frameworks and real-world benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Tool learning enhances LLM capabilities by integrating external tools for complex tasks beyond their parametric knowledge
- Four-stage framework (task planning, tool selection, tool calling, response generation) provides systematic approach to tool learning
- Tuning-free methods offer cost-effectiveness while tuning-based methods provide better integration and customization
- Major challenges include high latency, evaluation rigor, safety concerns, and lack of unified frameworks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Tool learning with LLMs works by extending the model's capabilities beyond its parametric knowledge through integration with external tools and APIs. The mechanism involves a systematic approach where LLMs first plan tasks, select appropriate tools based on the task requirements, execute tool calls, and then generate responses that incorporate the tool outputs. This paradigm addresses the inherent limitations of LLMs such as outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and inability to perform certain operations like complex calculations or real-time data retrieval. The effectiveness stems from combining the reasoning and language understanding capabilities of LLMs with the specialized functions of external tools.

## Foundational Learning
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into manageable subtasks; needed for handling multi-step reasoning and complex queries; quick check: can the model identify when a task requires tool usage versus direct answering
- **Tool Selection**: Choosing appropriate tools from available options; critical for efficient problem-solving; quick check: accuracy of tool choice given specific task descriptions
- **Tool Calling**: Executing tool functions with correct parameters; ensures proper integration with external systems; quick check: success rate of tool API calls with various input formats
- **Response Generation**: Formulating coherent answers incorporating tool outputs; needed for maintaining conversation flow; quick check: coherence and relevance of final responses

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
LLM -> Task Planner -> Tool Selector -> Tool Executor -> Response Generator

### Critical Path
The critical path involves task planning determining if tools are needed, followed by tool selection choosing the most appropriate tool(s), then tool calling executing the selected tools, and finally response generation incorporating the tool outputs into a coherent answer. This sequential process ensures systematic handling of complex tasks.

### Design Tradeoffs
Tuning-free methods offer cost-effectiveness and faster deployment but may lack fine-grained control and optimization. Tuning-based methods provide better integration and customization but require more computational resources and data. The choice between these approaches depends on specific application requirements, available resources, and performance needs.

### Failure Signatures
Common failures include incorrect tool selection leading to irrelevant results, tool calling errors due to improper parameter formatting, and response generation failures when incorporating tool outputs. Additionally, latency issues can occur when multiple tools are called sequentially, and safety concerns may arise from tool misuse or inappropriate tool selection.

### First Experiments
1. Evaluate tool selection accuracy across different task types and complexity levels
2. Measure latency and success rates for various tool calling implementations
3. Compare response quality between tuning-free and tuning-based approaches on identical tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the input.

## Limitations
- Rapidly evolving field may make survey outdated as new methods emerge
- Categorization into tuning-free and tuning-based approaches may not capture all hybrid methods
- Focus on English-language tools and benchmarks may limit multilingual applicability

## Confidence
- High Confidence: General categorization of tool learning stages and distinction between tuning-free and tuning-based methods
- Medium Confidence: Detailed taxonomies and classifications within each stage, as they may evolve with new methodologies
- Medium Confidence: Identification of challenges and future directions, representing authors' synthesis of current research gaps

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a longitudinal analysis to track how proposed taxonomies hold up as new tool learning methods are published
2. Implement meta-analysis comparing effectiveness of tuning-free versus tuning-based approaches across same tasks
3. Develop standardized evaluation framework to assess completeness and consistency of survey's coverage of existing benchmarks
