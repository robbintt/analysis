# Explainable by-design Audio Segmentation through Non-Negative Matrix Factorization and Probing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2406.13385
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13385
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Proposes an explainable-by-design audio segmentation model using NMF that achieves F1-scores comparable to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing interpretable components

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an audio segmentation model that combines Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a pre-trained WavLM feature extractor to achieve multilabel classification of speech, music, noise, and overlapped speech. The model learns a sparse activation matrix that reconstructs the input spectrogram, with segmentation predictions obtained through a linear layer. The approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art black-box models while maintaining interpretability through the learned embedding matrix. The authors demonstrate that this matrix contains meaningful information across multiple audio tasks including phoneme and music genre classification.

## Method Summary
The proposed model uses a pre-trained WavLM feature extractor to obtain audio representations, which are then decomposed using NMF into a basis matrix and activation matrix. The basis matrix represents learned components while the activation matrix encodes their temporal activations. A linear layer processes the activation matrix to produce segmentation predictions across multiple classes. The model is trained end-to-end with sparsity constraints on the activation matrix to encourage interpretability. The authors employ probing techniques to analyze the learned basis matrix, demonstrating its informativeness for various downstream tasks and revealing hierarchical structure in the learned components.

## Key Results
- Achieves F1-scores comparable to state-of-the-art black-box models on multiple audio segmentation datasets
- Demonstrates that the learned NMF basis matrix contains meaningful information for phoneme and music genre classification tasks
- Shows the embedding matrix exhibits hierarchical structure with explanatory factors
- Validates the model's performance across different datasets, supporting good generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by combining the powerful feature extraction capabilities of WavLM with the inherent interpretability of NMF. WavLM provides rich, contextualized audio representations that capture complex acoustic patterns, while NMF decomposes these representations into interpretable basis components and their temporal activations. The sparsity constraints on the activation matrix ensure that only relevant components are activated for specific audio events, making the segmentation decisions traceable. The linear layer on top of the activation matrix allows for efficient multilabel classification while maintaining the interpretability of the underlying NMF decomposition.

## Foundational Learning
- **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**: A matrix decomposition technique that factorizes a non-negative matrix into two non-negative matrices, producing parts-based, interpretable representations. Needed for creating interpretable audio components; check by verifying non-negativity constraints in the implementation.
- **WavLM Feature Extractor**: A pre-trained transformer model for speech processing that provides contextualized audio embeddings. Needed for robust audio feature extraction; check by confirming the use of pre-trained weights and feature dimensionality.
- **Audio Segmentation**: The task of identifying and classifying different audio events within an audio stream. Needed as the primary application; check by verifying multilabel classification setup.
- **Sparsity Constraints**: Regularization techniques that encourage many elements in a matrix to be zero, enhancing interpretability. Needed to make NMF components more meaningful; check by examining L1 regularization terms in the loss function.
- **Probing Analysis**: Techniques for examining what information is captured in learned representations by training simple classifiers on top of them. Needed to validate interpretability claims; check by reviewing probing task implementations and results.
- **Multilabel Classification**: A classification scenario where multiple labels can be assigned to each sample simultaneously. Needed for detecting overlapping audio events; check by verifying sigmoid activation and binary cross-entropy loss.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** WavLM Feature Extractor -> NMF Decomposition (Basis + Activation Matrices) -> Linear Classification Layer -> Segmentation Predictions

**Critical Path:** Input audio -> WavLM features -> NMF basis matrix learning -> Activation matrix with sparsity constraints -> Linear layer classification -> Output segmentation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The use of pre-trained WavLM provides strong feature extraction but may introduce domain shift for segmentation tasks; NMF offers interpretability but requires careful tuning of component numbers; sparsity constraints improve interpretability but may slightly reduce performance.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor separation of overlapping speech events; inability to detect rare audio events due to sparsity constraints; performance degradation on out-of-domain audio; components that fail to capture meaningful patterns in the embedding matrix.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test model performance with varying numbers of NMF components (e.g., 32, 64, 128) to find optimal balance between interpretability and accuracy
2. Evaluate segmentation performance on datasets with different signal-to-noise ratios to assess robustness
3. Perform ablation study removing WavLM pre-training to measure the contribution of learned features versus learned basis components

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited interpretability of individual NMF components beyond qualitative probing analysis
- Potential domain shift issues when applying pre-trained WavLM features to segmentation
- Need for more rigorous validation of the "explainable-by-design" claim through expert human evaluation

## Confidence

**Model performance claims (High confidence):** The F1-scores reported are consistent with state-of-the-art results and the methodology is sound.

**Interpretability claims (Medium confidence):** While the probing analysis shows promising results, the interpretation of NMF components remains somewhat qualitative and could benefit from more systematic validation.

**Generalizability claims (Medium confidence):** Results across multiple datasets support good generalization, but the diversity of test conditions could be broader.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct expert evaluation where human annotators assess the semantic meaning of top NMF components to validate interpretability claims

2. Perform ablation studies systematically varying the number of NMF components and sparsity regularization to understand their impact on both performance and interpretability

3. Test the model on additional datasets with different acoustic conditions and noise profiles to better establish robustness and generalizability limits
