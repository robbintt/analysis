- Proposes first independent evaluation method for training maturity of functional modules in autonomous driving perception models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating the training maturity of functional modules in autonomous driving perception models. The method uses Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS) to quantitatively assess the convergence of output feature maps from the backbone network. A neural network called FMCE-Net is trained to predict FMCS values, providing an independent evaluation metric for training progress. The approach is validated on image classification tasks across multiple datasets and backbone architectures.

## Method Summary
The core methodology involves evaluating the convergence of output feature maps from the backbone using a quantitative metric called Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). This metric measures the maturity of training by analyzing the stability and focus of feature representations. To predict FMCS values, the authors train a neural network called FMCE-Net, which learns to estimate the convergence score from intermediate feature representations. The method is validated on image classification tasks using ResNet-50 and ShuffleNet v2 backbones across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet datasets.

## Key Results
- FMCE-Net achieves high predictive accuracy, with average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 97.5% across all FMCS-datasets
- Performance metrics reach over 99% on MNIST and Mini-ImageNet datasets
- Standard deviation of performance metrics is low (around 3.5%), indicating robust evaluation
- Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrate increasingly localized and focused feature maps as convergence increases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by quantifying the stability and convergence of feature representations in the network's backbone. As training progresses, feature maps become more focused and stable, indicating better feature extraction capabilities. The FMCS metric captures this convergence behavior, while FMCE-Net learns to predict these convergence patterns from intermediate features. This provides an independent evaluation signal that doesn't rely on task-specific performance metrics.

## Foundational Learning

**Feature Map Convergence**: Understanding how feature representations stabilize during training is crucial for evaluating model maturity. Quick check: Verify that feature map variance decreases as training progresses.

**Grad-CAM Visualization**: This technique helps visualize which regions of input images influence model predictions. Quick check: Ensure heatmaps become more focused on relevant features as convergence increases.

**Quantitative Convergence Metrics**: Developing numerical measures for qualitative concepts like "convergence" requires careful metric design. Quick check: Validate that FMCS correlates with actual model performance improvements.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Image -> Backbone Network -> Feature Maps -> FMCS Calculation -> FMCE-Net -> Convergence Score

**Critical Path**: The backbone network extracts features, which are then analyzed by the FMCS metric. FMCE-Net takes these features as input to predict the convergence score, providing the final evaluation output.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead for independent evaluation capability. While calculating FMCS and running FMCE-Net adds processing time, it provides valuable insights into training maturity without requiring task-specific labels.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor FMCS predictions may indicate: (1) unstable training dynamics, (2) insufficient model capacity, (3) data quality issues, or (4) architectural mismatches between backbone and FMCE-Net.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare FMCS predictions against actual validation accuracy curves to establish correlation strength
2. Test FMCS behavior across different learning rates to understand sensitivity to training dynamics
3. Evaluate feature map stability using different pooling strategies to optimize FMCS calculation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate FMCS and FMCE-Net performance on autonomous driving-specific perception tasks (object detection, semantic segmentation) using established benchmarks like KITTI or nuScenes.

2. Test the methodology across diverse backbone architectures including vision transformers and specialized autonomous driving networks to assess generalizability.

3. Conduct ablation studies examining FMCS behavior under varying training conditions (different learning rates, batch sizes, data augmentation strategies) to establish robustness boundaries.
