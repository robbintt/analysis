core_contribution: The paper introduces Group Justified Perspectives (GJP), extending
  the JP model to handle group belief operators including uniform belief, distributed
  belief, and common belief in multi-agent epistemic planning. The approach uses perspective
  functions and set operations to model how groups of agents form beliefs based on
  their observations and memory of past observations.

# Where Common Knowledge Cannot Be Formed, Common Belief Can -- Planning with Multi-Agent Belief Using Group Justified Perspectives

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.07981
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07981
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: GJP extends JP model to handle group belief operators with efficient performance on adapted benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Group Justified Perspectives (GJP), an extension of the Justified Perspectives (JP) model that enables epistemic planning with complex group belief operators including uniform belief, distributed belief, and common belief. The approach uses perspective functions and set operations to model how groups of agents form beliefs based on their observations and memory of past observations. The GJP model successfully handles problems with nested group beliefs that cannot be addressed by existing epistemic planning tools.

## Method Summary
The GJP model extends the JP framework by introducing group belief operators that can express beliefs about what groups know, uniformly believe, or commonly believe. It employs ternary semantics with perspective functions to evaluate group beliefs across possible worlds, using set operations (union, intersection) to model distributed and common beliefs respectively. The model distinguishes between knowledge (true in all worlds) and belief (true in some but not all worlds), enabling more nuanced epistemic reasoning. Implementation uses the Temporal Action Description Language (TADL) for planning problems and handles nested group beliefs through recursive evaluation.

## Key Results
- Successfully solves epistemic planning problems with nested group beliefs that existing tools cannot handle
- Demonstrates efficient convergence of common belief evaluation within a few iterations despite worst-case exponential complexity
- Shows practical performance on adapted benchmarks including Number, Grapevine, and Big Brother Logic domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The GJP model works by extending perspective functions to evaluate group beliefs through set operations. For distributed belief, it takes the union of individual agent perspectives; for common belief, it takes the intersection. This allows the model to naturally represent group-level epistemic states while maintaining the efficiency of the underlying JP framework. The ternary semantics enable precise evaluation of belief statements across possible worlds.

## Foundational Learning
- **Group belief operators** (uniform, distributed, common): Needed to express complex epistemic relationships between multiple agents. Quick check: Can model what a committee collectively knows vs what each member individually believes.
- **Perspective functions**: Map agents' observations to possible worlds. Essential for grounding beliefs in observable facts. Quick check: Given agent observations, can determine which worlds remain possible.
- **Set operations for belief aggregation**: Union for distributed belief, intersection for common belief. Critical for defining group epistemic states. Quick check: Distributed belief includes more worlds than common belief.
- **Ternary semantics**: Handles truth values across possible worlds with third "unknown" state. Necessary for epistemic reasoning. Quick check: Can distinguish between belief and knowledge.
- **Nested belief structures**: Allow beliefs about beliefs about groups. Enables complex epistemic planning. Quick check: Can express "agent A believes that group B commonly believes proposition P."
- **JP model foundation**: Provides efficient baseline for epistemic planning. Required for scalable implementation. Quick check: JP can handle single-agent justified belief efficiently.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Planning Problem -> TADL Parser -> GJP Evaluator -> Planner -> Solution
**Critical Path**: Problem specification flows through parser to GJP evaluator, which uses perspective functions and set operations to check belief preconditions before planner searches for valid action sequences.
**Design Tradeoffs**: Prioritizes expressiveness (nested group beliefs) over worst-case efficiency, but empirical results show practical performance. Uses ternary semantics for precision at cost of implementation complexity.
**Failure Signatures**: Problems with deeply nested beliefs may hit exponential complexity. Belief preconditions that are too weak may lead to invalid plans. Group belief evaluation may diverge for pathological cases.
**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Test distributed belief on simple multi-agent observation problem. 2) Verify common belief convergence on small committee problem. 3) Validate nested group belief handling on Big Brother domain variant.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited experimental scope to three adapted domains may not represent real-world complexity
- Worst-case exponential complexity analysis vs observed performance gap needs empirical validation
- Scalability to larger agent populations and more complex belief hierarchies untested

## Confidence
High confidence in formal correctness of GJP model extension and theoretical foundations. Medium confidence in practical effectiveness claims given limited experimental scope and complexity-performance gap. Low confidence in generalizability to more complex domains or larger agent populations.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct scalability experiments with increasing numbers of agents to empirically validate claimed convergence properties and identify practical limits.
2. Test GJP model on additional epistemic planning domains with more complex belief structures and longer temporal horizons.
3. Compare GJP performance against existing epistemic planning tools on problems that can be handled by multiple approaches, quantifying efficiency gains.
