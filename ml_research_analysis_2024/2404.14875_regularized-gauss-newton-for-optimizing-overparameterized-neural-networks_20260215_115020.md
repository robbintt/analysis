# Regularized Gauss-Newton for Optimizing Overparameterized Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.14875
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14875
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GGN with GSC regularization converges to target function that best interpolates training data with adaptive learning rate selection

## Executive Summary
This paper studies the convergence of a two-layer neural network optimized by a regularized Gauss-Newton (GGN) method with generalized self-concordant (GSC) regularization. The authors prove that under certain regularity conditions, GGN converges to a target function that best interpolates the training data set. The method provides an adaptive learning rate selection technique requiring little to no tuning, and experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show good generalization performance with a reasonable tradeoff between test error and training error.

## Method Summary
The method optimizes a two-layer neural network using the Gauss-Newton approach with generalized self-concordant regularization. The GGN approximation replaces the Hessian with a positive semi-definite matrix that preserves curvature information without becoming indefinite. The GSC regularization provides smooth approximations to commonly-used penalty terms, enabling adaptive learning rate selection based on the local geometry of the regularization function. The method is tested on synthetic datasets with known target functions and real-world datasets including MNIST, FashionMNIST, and UCI benchmark datasets.

## Key Results
- GGN with GSC regularization converges to target function that best interpolates training data
- The method provides adaptive learning rate selection requiring little to no tuning
- Experimental results show good generalization performance with reasonable tradeoff between test error and training error
- The approach achieves competitive results compared to standard gradient descent on various datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GGN approximates Newton method for large-scale problems using positive semi-definite curvature matrix that avoids over-approximation of second-order terms
- Mechanism: GGN replaces Hessian with positive semi-definite approximation preserving curvature information without becoming indefinite, allowing stable updates in overparameterized regime
- Core assumption: Loss function and neural network architecture allow GGN to be valid curvature approximation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) optimization method incorporates curvature estimates into its solution steps, and provides a good approximation to the Newton method for large-scale optimization problems."
  - [section 1] "One of the most appealing approximations to the Hessian matrix within the context of practical deep learning and nonlinear optimization in general is the generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) approximation of [10], which uses a positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix to model the curvature about an arbitrary convex loss function."
- Break condition: If loss function is non-convex or network architecture makes GGN approximation invalid

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GGN updates in overparameterized regime directly relate to neural tangent kernel (NTK) regression solution, providing closed-form solution that replaces gradient descent
- Mechanism: In infinite-width limit, GGN update can be expressed in terms of NTK matrix, effectively solving kernel ridge regression problem that gradient descent approximates iteratively
- Core assumption: Network is sufficiently overparameterized that linearization provides good approximation to true network function
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GGN has been found particularly interesting for practical training of deep neural networks, not only for its impressive convergence speed, but also for its close relation with neural tangent kernel regression."
  - [section 1] "An important feature of GGN for infinite-width NNs is its direct relation with the NTK regression solution in the overparameterized regime."
- Break condition: When network is not sufficiently overparameterized or NTK approximation breaks down

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Self-concordant regularization provides adaptive learning rate selection requiring little to no tuning for optimal performance
- Mechanism: Self-concordant property of regularization function controls local rate of change of second derivatives, enabling adaptive step-size selection based on curvature of regularization term
- Core assumption: Regularization function is self-concordant (Mg, ν)-GSC, allowing learning rate to adapt based on local geometry
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This approach provides an adaptive learning rate selection technique that requires little to no tuning for optimal performance."
  - [section 1] "we consider a class of generalized self-concordant (GSC) functions that provide smooth approximations to commonly-used penalty terms in the objective function of the optimization problem."
- Break condition: If regularization function is not properly self-concordant or parameter scaling is incorrect

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-concordant functions and their properties
  - Why needed here: Self-concordance is key property enabling adaptive learning rate selection and controlling local rate of change of second derivatives
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why self-concordance helps control rate at which Hessian of function changes locally?

- Concept: Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and its relation to overparameterized networks
  - Why needed here: NTK provides theoretical foundation for understanding why GGN works in overparameterized regime and how it relates to gradient descent
  - Quick check question: What is relationship between NTK matrix and Jacobian of neural network outputs?

- Concept: Generalized Gauss-Newton approximation and its properties
  - Why needed here: Understanding GGN is essential for implementing method and knowing when it provides valid approximation to Hessian
  - Quick check question: How does GGN approximation differ from true Hessian, and why is this difference beneficial?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input data pipeline (xi, yi pairs) -> Neural network forward pass (two-layer network with scaling) -> Jacobian computation (for both input and parameter directions) -> GGN update computation (using curvature approximation) -> Self-concordant regularization (smoothing of common regularizers) -> Adaptive learning rate selection (based on self-concordance)

- Critical path:
  1. Forward pass through network to compute outputs
  2. Compute Jacobian with respect to parameters
  3. Compute GGN curvature matrix
  4. Compute gradient of loss
  5. Update parameters using GGN update rule with adaptive learning rate
  6. Apply self-concordant regularization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Batch size vs. computation cost (GGN requires Jacobian computation)
  - Regularization strength (τ) vs. model complexity
  - Smoothing parameter (µ) vs. approximation accuracy
  - Overparameterization level vs. generalization

- Failure signatures:
  - Divergence during training (learning rate too high or regularization too weak)
  - Poor generalization (overfitting or underfitting)
  - Slow convergence (insufficient overparameterization or poor curvature approximation)
  - Numerical instability (singular matrices or ill-conditioned problems)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Simple synthetic dataset with known target function to verify convergence
  2. MNIST dataset with teacher-student setup to test generalization
  3. UCI benchmark datasets to compare with gradient descent in terms of convergence speed and accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is impact of using generalized self-concordant (GSC) regularization with neural tangent kernel (NTK) parameterization for overparameterized neural networks beyond two-layer case?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper focuses on two-layer neural network with explicit GSC regularization, suggesting future research could investigate regularization framework with wider and deeper neural networks
- Why unresolved: Theoretical analysis and experimental results limited to two-layer networks; extending analysis to deeper networks with NTK parameterization is complex task requiring further investigation
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results and theoretical analysis of GSC regularization with NTK parameterization for deeper neural networks would provide insights into effectiveness and generalization properties

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does choice of smoothing parameter µ in GSC regularization function affect convergence rate and generalization performance of GGN method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper discusses influence of smoothing parameter µ on performance of GGN-SCORE method in experiments, observing that larger values of µ yield better performance in terms of optimization and generalization
- Why unresolved: While experiments provide some insights, comprehensive theoretical analysis of impact of µ on convergence rate and generalization is still lacking
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis that quantifies relationship between µ and convergence rate, as well as experimental results demonstrating effect of µ on generalization performance across different datasets and network architectures

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are limitations of GGN method with GSC regularization in terms of choice of activation functions and loss functions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper assumes twice-differentiable activation function and squared loss function for theoretical analysis and experiments
- Why unresolved: GGN method with GSC regularization might have limitations or perform differently with other activation functions and loss functions; theoretical analysis and experimental results do not cover these cases
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis and experimental results exploring performance of GGN method with GSC regularization for different activation functions and loss functions would provide insights into limitations and potential improvements

## Limitations
- Analysis assumes neural network is sufficiently overparameterized for NTK approximation to hold, which may not be realistic for practical architectures
- Theoretical convergence guarantees rely on self-concordant property of regularization function, but paper doesn't thoroughly explore cases where this assumption breaks down
- Computational cost of GGN (requiring Jacobian computations) may limit scalability to very large networks or datasets

## Confidence
- High confidence: Relationship between GGN and NTK in overparameterized regime is well-established in literature and supported by paper's theoretical analysis
- Medium confidence: Convergence guarantees under self-concordant regularization are theoretically sound, but practical performance may vary depending on problem specifics
- Low confidence: Claim that GGN provides "impressive convergence speed" compared to gradient descent is primarily supported by experimental results rather than theoretical analysis, and may depend heavily on hyperparameter choices

## Next Checks
1. Test method on non-overparameterized network to verify whether NTK approximation still provides benefits or if method degrades to standard Newton-like behavior

2. Experiment with different self-concordant regularization functions to determine how sensitive adaptive learning rate selection is to choice of regularization form

3. Compare computational cost per iteration of GGN versus gradient descent on larger-scale problems to verify claimed efficiency advantages are meaningful in practice
