# LLM-SEM: A Sentiment-Based Student Engagement Metric Using LLMS for E-Learning Platforms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.13765
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13765
- Reference count: 29
- Introduces a novel method to measure student engagement on e-learning platforms using LLM-powered sentiment analysis

## Executive Summary
LLM-SEM introduces a novel method to measure student engagement on e-learning platforms by combining video metadata with sentiment analysis of user comments. It uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict sentiment and normalize key features such as views and likes. The system computes an engagement score integrating both qualitative and quantitative data, enabling a comprehensive assessment of student engagement. Experiments with models like TXLM-RoBERTa, LLama 3B, and Gemma 9B show that fine-tuned RoBERTa achieves the highest accuracy (0.86) and F1-score (0.84), demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-SEM in providing scalable and accurate engagement measurement.

## Method Summary
The LLM-SEM approach integrates video metadata (views, likes) with sentiment analysis of user comments using Large Language Models. The system normalizes engagement features and applies sentiment prediction models to user comments, combining both quantitative and qualitative indicators into a comprehensive engagement score. The method leverages fine-tuned language models to analyze sentiment in educational contexts, with experiments comparing multiple LLM architectures including TXLM-RoBERTa, LLama 3B, and Gemma 9B.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned RoBERTa achieved the highest accuracy (0.86) and F1-score (0.84)
- The approach effectively combines video metadata with sentiment analysis
- The method demonstrates scalable and accurate engagement measurement capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LLM-SEM approach works by leveraging the ability of large language models to understand nuanced sentiment in user comments while normalizing engagement metrics like views and likes. This dual approach captures both the emotional tone of student interactions and the quantitative engagement patterns, providing a more holistic view of student engagement than either metric alone.

## Foundational Learning
- Sentiment analysis fundamentals: Why needed - to extract emotional tone from user comments; Quick check - can classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral
- LLM fine-tuning techniques: Why needed - to adapt general language models to educational context; Quick check - can improve sentiment prediction accuracy on course-specific data
- Engagement metric normalization: Why needed - to make engagement indicators comparable across different videos and courses; Quick check - can handle varying scales of views and likes
- Video metadata integration: Why needed - to combine qualitative sentiment with quantitative engagement signals; Quick check - can create unified engagement scores
- Multi-modal feature combination: Why needed - to leverage both text and numerical engagement data; Quick check - can produce more accurate engagement scores than single-modality approaches

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Video Metadata -> Normalization -> Sentiment Analysis -> Engagement Score
- Critical path: User comments -> LLM sentiment prediction -> Feature normalization -> Final engagement score calculation
- Design tradeoffs: Balance between sentiment depth and computational efficiency; choice of fine-tuning vs prompt engineering for LLMs
- Failure signatures: Low comment volume leading to unreliable sentiment scores; model bias affecting sentiment classification; normalization errors for extreme engagement values
- First experiments to run: 1) Test sentiment analysis accuracy on a small sample of course comments; 2) Validate normalization approach on videos with known engagement patterns; 3) Compare engagement scores against instructor-assessed student performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance metrics come from experiments using only three specific LLM models, raising questions about generalizability
- Integration assumes views and likes are meaningful engagement indicators, potentially missing complexity of learning behaviors
- Reliance on user-generated comments may suffer from low volume or biased representation in real-world scenarios
- Does not address cultural or linguistic variations in sentiment expression across different e-learning contexts

## Confidence
- High confidence: The technical framework combining sentiment analysis with normalized engagement metrics is sound and well-described
- Medium confidence: The comparative performance of different LLM models (RoBERTa vs LLama 3B vs Gemma 9B) is supported by the reported experiments, though validation on larger, more diverse datasets would strengthen these findings
- Low confidence: Claims about the system's effectiveness across different e-learning contexts and content types lack supporting evidence

## Next Checks
1. Test the LLM-SEM framework on a larger, more diverse dataset spanning multiple courses, subjects, and learner demographics to assess generalizability
2. Conduct A/B testing comparing LLM-SEM engagement scores against instructor-assessed student performance or actual learning outcomes
3. Evaluate the system's performance on platforms with different comment volumes and engagement patterns, including low-activity courses where sentiment data may be sparse
