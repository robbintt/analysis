# Mistake, Manipulation and Margin Guarantees in Online Strategic Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.18176
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18176
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Three algorithms for online strategic classification with finite mistake and manipulation bounds under margin assumptions, converging to the maximum margin classifier

## Executive Summary
This paper studies online strategic classification where agents manipulate features to obtain positive labels while incurring costs. The authors propose three algorithms: Strategic Max-Margin (SMM), Gradient-based SMM, and Generalized Strategic Perceptron. These algorithms provide finite mistake and manipulation bounds under margin assumptions and converge to the non-strategic maximum margin classifier. Experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate that the new algorithms outperform prior work in terms of margin, manipulations, and mistakes, with SMM achieving the best results.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes three algorithms for online strategic classification. SMM solves a maximum margin problem on proxy data at each iteration to recover the optimal classifier. Gradient-based SMM approximates SMM by performing a single projected subgradient ascent step on a concave function. Generalized Strategic Perceptron generalizes the strategic perceptron to arbitrary norms with mistake guarantees under margin conditions. All algorithms use proxy data that corrects for agent manipulation to maintain separability invariants.

## Key Results
- Algorithms 1 and 2 converge to the non-strategic maximum margin classifier under separability and convexity assumptions
- Algorithm 3 achieves finite mistake bounds when d*>2/c for general norms or b*=0 with ℓ2-norm
- SMM method outperforms prior work on real loan data and synthetic data in terms of margin, manipulations, and mistakes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Algorithm 1 recovers the maximum margin classifier in the presence of strategic behavior.
- Mechanism: By maintaining the invariant that proxy data remain separable through y*⊤v(yt)≥0, Algorithm 1 solves a convex reformulation of the maximum margin problem at each iteration, ensuring convergence to (y*/∥y*∥*, b*/∥y*∥*) almost surely.
- Core assumption: Assumptions 3 (linear separability with positive margin), 4 (boundedness), and 6 (strict convexity of norms) hold, with agents following the response model.
- Break condition: If d*≤2/c, proxy data may become inseparable, breaking convergence (Example 2).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Algorithm 2 provides computationally efficient approximation to Algorithm 1 with finite bounds.
- Mechanism: Replaces full maximum margin problem with single projected subgradient ascent step on concave function gt(y), approximating optimal solution while maintaining separability invariant y*⊤v(yt)≥0.
- Core assumption: ℓ2-norm costs with Assumptions 3, 4, and 6 holding.
- Break condition: Non-ℓ2 norms may invalidate theoretical guarantees (Theorem 4 requires ℓ2).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Algorithm 3 generalizes strategic perceptron to arbitrary norms with finite mistake bounds.
- Mechanism: Projects perceptron updates onto convex cone L using proxy data s(At, yt, bt) instead of true features, achieving finite mistakes when d*>2/c or when b*=0 with ℓ2-norm.
- Core assumption: Assumptions 1, 2, and 4 hold, with either d*>2/c for general norms or b*=0 with ℓ2-norm.
- Break condition: If d*≤2/c and norm not ℓ2, Algorithm 3 may make infinitely many mistakes (Example 3).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Convex analysis and subdifferential calculus
  - Why needed here: Algorithms rely on convex function properties and subdifferentials to derive optimality conditions and update rules
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the subdifferential of the norm ∥·∥* equals {v : v⊤y = ∥y∥*, ∥v∥≤1}?

- Concept: Online convex optimization and regret analysis
  - Why needed here: Mistake bounds use online convex optimization techniques, specifically hinge loss and 0-1 loss relationship
  - Quick check question: How does the hinge loss upper bound the number of mistakes in perceptron-style updates?

- Concept: Strategic classification and agent response models
  - Why needed here: Algorithms must account for agents manipulating features to receive positive labels, requiring understanding of response function r(A,y,b) and proxy data s(A,y,b)
  - Quick check question: Why does proxy data s(A,y,b) correct for manipulation when true label is -1?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Algorithm selection -> Convergence monitoring -> Hyperparameter tuning

- Critical path: 1) Preprocess data to satisfy Assumptions 3 and 4, 2) Initialize algorithm (Algorithm 0 for Algorithm 1), 3) At each iteration: receive agent response, compute proxy data, update classifier, 4) Monitor convergence and performance metrics, 5) Stop when convergence criteria met or maximum iterations reached

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Algorithm 1: Exact convergence but computationally expensive (solves growing optimization problems)
  - Algorithm 2: Approximate but efficient (single subgradient step per iteration)
  - Algorithm 3: Simple updates but may require more iterations and depends on projection cone L

- Failure signatures: Non-convergence (distance plateaus above threshold), excessive mistakes (grows linearly with iterations), infinite manipulations (d*≤2/c and Algorithm 1/2 fail to converge)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify convergence on synthetic data with known (y*, b*) and d*>2/c
  2. Compare mistake counts on loan data with different margins ρ and cost parameters 2/c
  3. Test robustness to noise in agent responses (σ>0) and observe impact on Algorithm 1 vs 2 vs 3

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Under what conditions does Algorithm 1 outperform Algorithm 2 and 3 in terms of convergence to the maximum margin classifier and robustness to noise?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Algorithm 1 converges to maximum margin classifier while Algorithm 3 does not; Algorithm 1's performance deteriorates with noise while Algorithm 2 is more robust
- Why unresolved: Paper lacks comprehensive comparison under various conditions (different margin sizes, noise levels, data distributions)
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed empirical study comparing algorithms under range of conditions including different margin sizes, noise levels, and data distributions

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of norm in Assumption 1 affect the performance of Algorithm 3?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Algorithm 3 can handle different norms but theoretical analysis limited to specific norms like ℓ2 and weighted ℓ1
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't explore impact of different norm choices on Algorithm 3's performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical experiments testing Algorithm 3 with various norms (ℓ1, ℓ∞) and comparing performance to theoretical guarantees

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can Algorithm 2 be modified to achieve better convergence to the maximum margin classifier while maintaining computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Algorithm 2 is computationally efficient approximation of Algorithm 1 but converges slower and is less robust to noise
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't explore potential modifications to improve Algorithm 2's convergence properties while preserving efficiency
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing modifications to Algorithm 2, such as adjusting step size or incorporating additional data distribution information

## Limitations
- Analysis critically depends on Assumptions 3-7 holding exactly, which may not hold in practice due to noise or non-strategic behavior
- Finite mistake bounds require d*>2/c, a condition that may fail for certain cost parameters or margin distributions
- Limited experimental validation with only two datasets (real loan data and synthetic data) without ablation studies

## Confidence

- Theoretical framework and algorithm design: High
- Finite mistake bounds under margin conditions: Medium
- Practical performance claims: Low

## Next Checks

1. Test Algorithm 1's convergence on noisy agent responses (σ>0) to verify robustness and identify threshold where proxy data becomes inseparable

2. Conduct experiments varying cost parameter c and margin ρ to map region where d*>2/c holds and measure algorithm performance degradation when condition fails

3. Compare three algorithms on datasets with different dimensionalities and margin distributions to understand computational complexity scaling and identify best-performing algorithm under various conditions
