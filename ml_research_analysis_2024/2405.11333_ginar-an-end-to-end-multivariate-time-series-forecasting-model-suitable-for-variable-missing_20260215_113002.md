# GinAR: An End-To-End Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Model Suitable for Variable Missing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.11333
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11333
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: GinAR outperforms 11 SOTA baselines on MTSF with up to 90% missing variables, achieving lower MAE, RMSE, and MAPE across all settings

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses multivariate time series forecasting when some variables have entirely missing historical data. The proposed GinAR model introduces interpolation attention to recover missing variables using normal ones, and adaptive graph convolution to reconstruct spatial correlations dynamically. These components replace fully connected layers in a recursive unit, enabling end-to-end forecasting without relying on imputation. Experiments on five real-world datasets show GinAR maintains accuracy even with up to 90% missing variables, outperforming 11 SOTA baselines across all metrics.

## Method Summary
GinAR is an end-to-end framework for multivariate time series forecasting with variable missing data. The model uses interpolation attention (IA) to recover missing variables by selectively attending to normal variables, and adaptive graph convolution (AGCN) to dynamically reconstruct spatial correlations. These components replace fully connected layers in a simple recurrent unit (SRU) architecture. The model is trained directly on incomplete data without imputation, learning to forecast future values for all variables simultaneously. Training uses Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.006 and batch size 16.

## Key Results
- GinAR outperforms 11 SOTA baselines across all five datasets (METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, PEMS04, PEMS08, China AQI)
- Maintains strong performance with up to 90% missing variables, showing robustness to severe data loss
- Achieves lower MAE, RMSE, and MAPE compared to two-stage models that first impute then forecast

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Interpolation Attention (IA) recovers missing variables by selectively attending to normal variables, avoiding incorrect temporal dependencies from directly modeling missing sequences
- Core assumption: Strong spatial relationships exist between missing and normal variables for reliable reconstruction
- Evidence: [abstract] "interpolation attention to recover missing variables using normal ones" [section 3.3] "select the normal variables for induction and give the corresponding weight"
- Break condition: Weak spatial correlation or insufficient normal variables for reconstruction

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adaptive Graph Convolution (AGCN) dynamically reconstructs spatial correlations using both predefined and data-driven adaptive graphs
- Core assumption: Combining predefined and adaptive graphs captures spatial correlations more accurately than either alone
- Evidence: [abstract] "adaptive graph convolution to reconstruct spatial correlations dynamically" [section 3.4] "predefined graph cannot adequately model the spatial correlation"
- Break condition: Too sparse data or complex spatial structure for adaptive graph learning

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: End-to-end framework avoids error accumulation by integrating recovery and forecasting into single model
- Core assumption: Joint modeling is more effective than sequential processing
- Evidence: [abstract] "end-to-end forecasting without relying on imputation" [section 4.4] "end-to-end framework based on IA and STID can achieve good forecasting results"
- Break condition: Computational complexity outweighs benefits or irregular missing patterns

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and spatial-temporal data
  - Why needed: GinAR builds on GNN principles for spatial correlation modeling
  - Quick check: How do GNNs differ from traditional CNNs in handling irregular graph-structured data?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms in sequence modeling
  - Why needed: IA uses attention to selectively weight normal variables for reconstruction
  - Quick check: What is the primary advantage of attention over weighted averaging in sequence reconstruction?

- Concept: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and missing data limitations
  - Why needed: GinAR enhances RNN framework to handle missing variables
  - Quick check: Why do RNNs typically perform poorly with missing or outlier values?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input preprocessing → IA → AGCN → SRU → Hidden states → MLP decoder → Output
- Critical path: Input → IA → AGCN → SRU → Hidden states → MLP decoder → Output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - IA vs. imputation: Avoids error accumulation but may struggle with sparse normal variables
  - Adaptive vs. predefined graphs: Adaptive graphs improve accuracy but increase computational cost
  - End-to-end vs. two-stage: Avoids error propagation but may be harder to train
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance with >75% missing rates despite claims
  - Overfitting with large embedding sizes relative to dataset size
  - Degraded accuracy with weak predefined graph structure
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test IA component alone on synthetic dataset with known missing patterns
  2. Evaluate AGCN's adaptive graph learning vs. fixed predefined graphs across missing rates
  3. Benchmark end-to-end vs. two-stage approaches on different missing rates to quantify error accumulation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does GinAR's performance scale with missing rates exceeding 90%?
  - Basis: Paper reports results up to 90% missing variables
  - Why unresolved: Experiments stop at 90%, leaving uncertainty about performance degradation
  - What evidence: Experiments with 90-100% missing rates would clarify limits

- Question: What is IA's impact on computational efficiency in large-scale applications?
  - Basis: Paper mentions efficiency comparisons but lacks detailed computational analysis
  - Why unresolved: Computational overhead is not quantified
  - What evidence: Profiling studies comparing costs with and without IA

- Question: How sensitive is GinAR to hyperparameters across different datasets?
  - Basis: Hyperparameter experiment only on PEMS04 dataset
  - Why unresolved: Findings not generalized across all datasets
  - What evidence: Comprehensive hyperparameter tuning across all five datasets

## Limitations

- Lack of theoretical analysis explaining why interpolation attention and adaptive graph convolution work effectively together
- Performance with extreme missing rates (>90%) not thoroughly validated
- Computational complexity of adaptive graph convolution not discussed for real-time applications

## Confidence

- High confidence: Empirical results showing GinAR's superior performance across multiple datasets and missing rates
- Medium confidence: Claims about avoiding error accumulation through end-to-end modeling
- Medium confidence: Mechanism descriptions for interpolation attention and adaptive graph convolution

## Next Checks

1. Derive and prove error bounds for interpolation attention when reconstructing missing variables from normal ones

2. Conduct systematic experiments with missing rates exceeding 90% (e.g., 95%, 99%) to identify practical limits and failure modes

3. Measure and compare computational overhead of adaptive graph convolution versus standard GCN layers as variables and missing rates increase
