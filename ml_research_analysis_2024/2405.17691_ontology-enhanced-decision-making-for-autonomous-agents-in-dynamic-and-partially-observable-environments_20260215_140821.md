# Ontology-Enhanced Decision-Making for Autonomous Agents in Dynamic and Partially Observable Environments

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2405.17691
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17691
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** OntoDeM reduces traffic waiting time up to 33%, improves edge computing throughput by 6-26%, and heating error to 64% in dynamic, partially observable environments.

## Executive Summary
This thesis introduces OntoDeM, an ontology-enhanced decision-making model for autonomous agents operating in dynamic and partially observable environments. The core innovation lies in integrating ontological reasoning with reinforcement learning to address challenges of noisy data, unforeseen events, and limited observability. By enriching observations with inferred knowledge, adapting goals and rewards dynamically, and semantically filtering actions, OntoDeM achieves significant performance gains across traffic control, edge computing, job shop scheduling, and heating systems compared to standard RL baselines.

## Method Summary
OntoDeM embeds structured domain knowledge via ontologies to enhance RL in partially observable settings. It uses ontology-based observation enrichment (abstraction, expansion, masking, augmentation, sampling) to create robust state representations from noisy data. Adaptive goal and reward mechanisms detect environmental changes and dynamically adjust objectives using forward/backward chaining inference. Semantic action selection prunes infeasible actions and prioritizes promising ones using ontological constraints and concept-importance weighting. The architecture tightly integrates these modules with the RL policy, enabling real-time, context-aware decision-making.

## Key Results
- Traffic signal control: waiting time reduced by up to 33% vs. DQN, PPO, DDPG.
- Edge computing: processing throughput improved by 6-26% vs. baselines.
- Job shop scheduling: throughput increased by 12-38% compared to standard RL.
- Heating control: error reduced to 64% of baseline performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
### Mechanism 1: Observation Enrichment via Ontological Abstraction/Expansion
Ontological reasoning mitigates partial/noisy observations by inferring contextual knowledge, creating a semantically richer state vector. The agent maps raw data to ontology concepts, using hierarchical abstraction or forward-chaining expansion to fill gaps, improving state estimation. This assumes the ontology is a valid, stable model of the domain.

### Mechanism 2: Adaptive Goal Management via Ontology-Driven Rewards
Ontologies enable dynamic goal adaptation by detecting environmental shifts and interpreting contextual changes. The agent monitors state ontology for significant changes, selecting or generating new goals via logical rules, and reshapes the reward function using extracted propositional symbols. This assumes goal transformations are expressible via ontological logic.

### Mechanism 3: Semantic Action Filtering and Prioritization
Representing actions and constraints in an ontology allows pruning infeasible actions and prioritizing promising ones without exhaustive search. Action masking uses SWRL rules to encode impossibilities, while prioritization uses concept-importance weighting. This assumes the ontology exhaustively encodes known constraints and action semantics.

## Foundational Learning
### Concept: Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs)
**Why needed here:** OntoDeM targets RL in POMDP settings where full state observability is lacking; understanding belief-state updates and history-dependent policies is essential to appreciate why ontological augmentation helps.
**Quick check question:** How does a POMDP differ from a standard MDP, and what makes solving it harder?

### Concept: Ontological Reasoning (RDFS/OWL, SWRL rules)
**Why needed here:** Ontologies provide the structured knowledge and inference engine enabling observation enrichment, goal adaptation, and action filtering. Subsumption, property inheritance, and forward/backward chaining are operational.
**Quick check question:** What is the difference between forward-chaining (data-driven) and backward-chaining (goal-driven) inference in this context?

### Concept: Multi-objective Reward Design
**Why needed here:** Adaptive reward definition involves creating/shaping reward functions based on ontology-extracted beliefs and constraints, requiring understanding trade-offs between competing objectives and how to encode them numerically.
**Quick check question:** How does the ontology indicate which properties are "positive" or "negative" beliefs that become reward signals?

## Architecture Onboarding
### Component map:
Ontology-Based Environment Modeling -> Ontology-Enhanced Observation Processing -> Ontology-Driven Goal/Action Learners -> RL Policy

### Critical path:
1. Deploy domain ontology (OWL/RDFS) and action ontology in the system.
2. Initialize agent with ontology-based schema & concept-weighting initialization.
3. For each time step:
   a. Receive raw sensor input → map to ontology concepts → create observation vector.
   b. Invoke appropriate OntoDeM method(s) based on trigger signals.
   c. Enrich state, adjust goal/reward, or filter/prioritize actions using ontological reasoning.
   d. Pass modified state/reward/action-mask to RL policy → execute selected action.
   e. Monitor state-distance/reward–outcome → update thresholds/goals as needed.

### Design tradeoffs:
- **Static vs. Evolving Ontology:** Thesis assumes stable ontology; evolving ontology allows adaptation but requires versioning/consistent reasoning.
- **Rule Completeness:** Action/goal inference quality depends on SWRL/SPIN rule completeness; manual authoring is a bottleneck.
- **Latency vs. Accuracy:** Real-time inference on large ontologies can be costly; design chooses lightweight similarity/subsumer extraction and selective rule application.
- **RL Integration Depth:** Tightly couples ontological reasoning with RL; alternatively, could be a separate preprocessing layer, but then goal/action adaptation would be less reactive.

### Failure signatures:
- **Observation divergence:** Track normalized state-distance exceeding thresholds repeatedly; indicates ontology-based augmentation may be misrepresenting the state.
- **Reward collapse:** Monitor variance of reward signal; near-zero variance can indicate stale/frozen goal logic.
- **Action masking over-pruning:** If the agent frequently fails to find any feasible action, check semantic constraint rules for over-constraining.
- **Concept-weight stagnation:** Monitor weights of all concepts; a single concept dominating suggests weighting logic may be biased.

### First 3 experiments:
1. **Unit: Observation Augmentation** – In a controlled ITSC scenario with 50% undetectable vehicles, verify that the inferred waiting time for undetected Stationary vehicles matches the traffic signal phase elapsed time. Measure reduction in average waiting time vs. baseline.
2. **Unit: Action Masking** – In an edge computing task-offloading scenario with rate-limited edge servers, assert that the action mask excludes servers with `ServerWorkload = ServerLimit`. Quantify reduction in task failure rate vs. unmasked baseline.
3. **Integration: Goal Adaptation** – In a traffic scenario with an emergency vehicle, assert that the agent switches goals and creates a state-similarity reward to revert traffic to a non-congested state. Compare total waiting time reduction to non-adaptive RL.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance depends heavily on the completeness and stability of pre-authored ontologies; incomplete or outdated ontologies can introduce systematic bias.
- The approach is validated primarily in controlled simulation environments; real-world transfer, especially in safety-critical domains, remains unproven.
- Evaluation lacks statistical significance testing across runs, making it difficult to quantify the reliability of reported improvements.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The conceptual framework for integrating ontologies with RL is sound, and the modular architecture is clearly described.
- **Medium Confidence:** Performance improvements over baseline RL methods are plausible and well-demonstrated in simulation, but robustness to ontology incompleteness and real-world noise is uncertain.
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability to domains with rapidly evolving or highly novel dynamics, and scalability of ontology reasoning in complex real-time settings, are not sufficiently validated.

## Next Checks
1. **Ontology Robustness Test:** In a controlled simulation, systematically degrade the domain ontology (remove rules, introduce errors) and measure the impact on decision-making performance to quantify sensitivity to ontology quality.
2. **Statistical Significance:** Re-run the key experiments (traffic, edge computing, job shop) with a larger number of random seeds and conduct statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to confirm that reported performance gains are statistically significant and not due to chance.
3. **Real-World Pilot:** Implement a pilot test of OntoDeM in a simplified real-world environment (e.g., a small-scale traffic intersection or a lab-based robotics task) to assess its performance outside of simulation and identify any unforeseen practical challenges.
