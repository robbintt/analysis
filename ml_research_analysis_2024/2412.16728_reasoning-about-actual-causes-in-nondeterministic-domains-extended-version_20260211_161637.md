# Reasoning about Actual Causes in Nondeterministic Domains -- Extended Version

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Sound and complete regression mechanism for reasoning about certainly and possibly causes in nondeterministic domains without explicit execution enumeration

## Executive Summary
This paper extends the situation calculus framework to address reasoning about actual causes in nondeterministic domains where agents cannot control or fully observe environmental choices. The authors formalize two distinct notions of actual causes - certainly causes and possibly causes - to capture different levels of causal certainty in scenarios with nondeterministic outcomes. The key innovation is an extended regression operator that enables reasoning about these causal relationships without requiring explicit consideration of all possible execution paths, making the approach computationally tractable.

## Method Summary
The authors extend the situation calculus by developing formal definitions for certainly causes and possibly causes that account for nondeterministic environmental choices. They construct an extended regression operator that systematically reduces queries about causal relationships in a given situation to equivalent first-order formulas about the initial situation. This regression mechanism operates by tracing the effects of actions and environmental choices backward through the situation hierarchy, maintaining logical consistency without enumerating all possible execution paths. The approach leverages the expressive power of first-order logic within the situation calculus to capture the uncertainty inherent in nondeterministic domains while preserving the ability to reason about causal relationships.

## Key Results
- Formal definitions of certainly causes and possibly causes that distinguish between guaranteed and potential causal relationships in nondeterministic domains
- An extended regression operator that reduces causal queries to equivalent first-order formulas without explicit execution enumeration
- Soundness and completeness proofs demonstrating that the regression mechanism correctly captures causal relationships in all nondeterministic scenarios
- Theoretical computational tractability through the regression approach compared to brute-force execution enumeration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the situation calculus' ability to represent dynamic domains through situation terms and the formal semantics of first-order logic. The extended regression operator traces causal dependencies backward through the situation hierarchy, maintaining logical equivalence at each step. By avoiding explicit enumeration of all possible executions, the mechanism remains tractable even when the space of nondeterministic outcomes is large. The regression preserves the causal structure of the domain while abstracting away from specific execution paths, allowing for general reasoning about causes across all possible outcomes.

## Foundational Learning
- Situation calculus: A logical framework for representing and reasoning about dynamic domains; needed to formalize how situations evolve over time
- Regression operator: A technique for reasoning backward from a given situation to the initial state; needed to avoid forward simulation of all possible executions
- Nondeterministic domains: Environments where outcomes are not fully determined by actions; needed to model real-world uncertainty
- Certainly causes vs possibly causes: Two distinct notions of causation capturing different levels of certainty; needed to distinguish guaranteed from potential causal relationships
- First-order logic: A formal system for representing knowledge; needed to express the regression formulas and causal relationships
- Computational tractability: The property of algorithms that can solve problems efficiently; needed to justify the practical applicability of the approach

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Initial situation S0 -> Extended regression operator -> First-order formulas about causes
**Critical path**: Action execution in situation S -> Determine certainly/possibly causes -> Apply regression to S0 -> Obtain causal query result
**Design tradeoffs**: Explicit execution enumeration (complete but intractable) vs regression operator (efficient but requires formal correctness)
**Failure signatures**: Incomplete regression steps, logical inconsistencies in causal chains, inability to capture complex dependencies between nondeterministic choices
**First experiments**: 1) Verify regression operator correctness on simple deterministic domains, 2) Test certainly cause identification in domains with single nondeterministic choice, 3) Evaluate possibly cause detection in domains with multiple competing causes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes finite abstraction of nondeterministic outcomes without requiring enumeration of all execution paths
- Theoretical computational tractability claims require empirical validation on complex domains
- Completeness proofs rely on the correctness of the extended regression operator without empirical verification

## Confidence
- High: Formal definitions of certainly causes and possibly causes are mathematically sound within the situation calculus framework
- Medium: Regression operator's computational efficiency claims require empirical validation
- Medium: Completeness of regression mechanism for all nondeterministic scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Implement the regression operator and test it on benchmark nondeterministic planning problems with varying levels of complexity to verify computational tractability claims
2. Conduct formal verification of the soundness and completeness proofs using an automated theorem prover
3. Apply the framework to a real-world nondeterministic domain (e.g., robotics with uncertain sensor data) and compare its performance against explicit execution enumeration methods
