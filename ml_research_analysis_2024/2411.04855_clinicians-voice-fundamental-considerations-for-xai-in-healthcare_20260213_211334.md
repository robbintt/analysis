# Clinicians' Voice: Fundamental Considerations for XAI in Healthcare

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.04855
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04855
- Reference count: 40
- Clinicians viewed AI positively but had concerns about workflow integration and patient relationships

## Executive Summary
This study explores clinicians' perspectives on explainable AI (XAI) in healthcare through semi-structured interviews. While clinicians generally held positive views about AI's potential to improve clinical decision-making, they expressed concerns about workflow integration and maintaining patient relationships. The research identified key preferences for AI explanations, including visual formats, certainty scores, and comprehensive model background information. The findings emphasize the need for thoughtful implementation of XAI tools that balance technical sophistication with practical clinical utility.

## Method Summary
The study conducted semi-structured interviews with 8 clinicians to gather their perspectives on explainable AI in healthcare. Participants were presented with three explanation methods: feature importance, counterfactual explanations, and rule-based explanations. The interviews explored clinicians' understanding of these methods, their preferences for explanation formats, and concerns about AI integration into clinical practice. The research team analyzed interview transcripts to identify common themes and patterns in clinicians' responses.

## Key Results
- Clinicians preferred visual explanations and certainty scores for quick comprehension during clinical practice
- Participants emphasized the need for AI training to be integrated into medical education
- Multidisciplinary collaboration between AI developers, clinicians, and administrators was identified as crucial for successful XAI implementation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Clinicians prefer feature importance explanations due to their intuitive visual format and immediate comprehensibility, but this simplicity can undermine trust in complex medical decisions.
- Mechanism: Feature importance scores provide an at-a-glance understanding of which variables contributed most to a prediction, aligning with clinicians' need for quick decision support in high-stakes environments. The visual bar plot format removes language barriers and enables rapid interpretation without specialized AI training.
- Core assumption: Clinicians have limited time and cognitive capacity during clinical practice, making quick, visually accessible explanations more valuable than complex but potentially more accurate explanations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "They emphasized the need for AI training and desired explanations that provide model background information alongside predictions. Clinicians preferred visual explanations and certainty scores."
  - [section 4.4] "Interviewees generally agreed that they are intuitive, quick and easy to understand, as you can grasp them all with one glance."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus contains related work on XAI in healthcare but no direct evidence about feature importance preferences specifically.
- Break condition: If clinicians receive sufficient AI training to understand more complex explanations, or if the medical decision requires consideration of interactions between variables that feature importance cannot capture, they may reject these explanations as "not believable."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multidisciplinary collaboration between AI developers, clinicians, and healthcare administrators is essential for successful XAI implementation in clinical practice.
- Mechanism: Different stakeholders bring complementary expertise - AI developers understand model capabilities and limitations, clinicians understand practical workflow constraints and patient needs, and administrators understand resource allocation and regulatory requirements. This collaboration ensures that XAI tools are both technically sound and practically useful.
- Core assumption: Successful implementation requires addressing both technical requirements (model accuracy, explanation quality) and practical requirements (workflow integration, regulatory compliance, clinician training).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The research highlights the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration and thoughtful explanation method selection to ensure successful XAI implementation in healthcare practice."
  - [section 5.2] "More emphasis on multidisciplinary projects is needed for the development of (X)AI techniques."
  - [corpus] Strong evidence - the corpus includes multiple related papers on multidisciplinary approaches to XAI in healthcare, supporting the claim about collaborative requirements.
- Break condition: If collaboration is limited to only technical experts and clinicians, without including administrators who understand implementation constraints, the tools may fail to be adopted despite being technically sound.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Clinicians' concerns about AI increasing distance from patients can be mitigated by designing XAI tools that support rather than replace clinical judgment and patient interaction.
- Mechanism: When AI tools are designed to complement clinical expertise rather than substitute for it, clinicians maintain their central role in decision-making while benefiting from AI's ability to process complex data. This preserves the therapeutic relationship while enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
- Core assumption: The primary value clinicians provide is not just diagnostic accuracy but also the therapeutic relationship with patients, which includes understanding patient preferences, beliefs, and non-quantifiable factors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "clinicians generally viewed AI positively but had concerns about workflow integration and patient relationships"
  - [section 4.3] "All interviewees had mainly positive thoughts about AI-based DSTs, most of them (6/8) believing that AI can help them make the best decision."
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - while the corpus contains related work on human-AI collaboration, it lacks direct evidence about maintaining patient relationships specifically.
- Break condition: If AI tools become too prescriptive or are designed to make autonomous decisions rather than support clinician judgment, they may create the feared distance between clinicians and patients.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Glass-box vs. black-box models in XAI
  - Why needed here: Understanding this distinction is crucial for explaining why different explanation methods (feature importance, counterfactuals, rule-based) are used and their respective trade-offs in healthcare settings.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between glass-box and black-box models, and why might clinicians prefer one over the other in clinical decision-making?

- Concept: Counterfactual explanations and their relationship to human reasoning
- Concept: Feature importance methods (SHAP values) and their interpretation in medical contexts
  - Why needed here: These explanation methods were specifically tested with clinicians, and understanding their mechanics helps explain why clinicians had mixed reactions to them.
  - Quick check question: How would you explain to a clinician what a SHAP value represents, and what are the limitations of interpreting these values as causal relationships?

- Concept: Change management and resistance to new technology in healthcare
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses how trust develops over time and the importance of training, which relates to broader organizational change management principles.
  - Quick check question: What are the key psychological barriers to adopting new AI-based clinical decision support tools, and how might these be addressed through training and workflow integration?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion → Model prediction → Explanation generation → Visual presentation → Clinician interpretation → Clinical decision → Patient outcome
- Critical path: The most critical path is ensuring that explanations are generated quickly enough to be useful in time-sensitive clinical decisions while maintaining accuracy.
- Design tradeoffs: Simplicity vs. accuracy (feature importance is simple but may be misleading), real-time performance vs. explanation quality (complex explanations take longer to generate), and technical sophistication vs. clinician accessibility (advanced methods may be more accurate but harder to understand).
- Failure signatures: Clinicians over-relying on simple explanations despite their limitations, clinicians rejecting explanations as "not believable" when they conflict with clinical intuition, and clinicians failing to integrate explanations into workflow due to poor UI design or timing issues.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test feature importance explanation with clinicians using a simulated clinical scenario to measure comprehension speed and trust calibration.
  2. Compare clinician decision accuracy and confidence when using counterfactual explanations vs. feature importance explanations for complex cases.
  3. Evaluate the impact of including model certainty scores alongside explanations on clinician trust and decision-making behavior.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size (8 clinicians) limits generalizability across different clinical specialties and healthcare contexts
- Focus on hypothetical scenarios rather than real-world clinical use may miss critical implementation challenges
- Limited evaluation of XAI approaches, examining only specific methods without comprehensive comparison

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Clinicians prefer visual explanations with certainty scores
- Medium Confidence: Multidisciplinary collaboration is essential for successful implementation
- Medium Confidence: AI training needs to be integrated into medical education

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale study with clinicians from multiple specialties and healthcare systems to validate the generalizability of explanation preferences and workflow concerns
2. Implement a longitudinal field study where clinicians use XAI tools in real clinical settings over 6-12 months to observe actual adoption patterns and trust development
3. Perform comparative studies testing different explanation methods across various clinical decision types to determine which methods work best for specific medical specialties and decision contexts
