- Large language models can process endangered languages by incorporating linguistic descriptions into prompts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LINGO, a training-free approach that enables large language models (LLMs) to process and translate endangered languages by incorporating linguistic descriptions such as dictionaries, grammar books, and morphological analyzers into prompts. The method significantly improves translation quality from near-zero BLEU scores to 10.5 BLEU for 10 language directions, and enhances performance on mathematical reasoning, response selection, and word reordering tasks across 8 endangered or low-resource languages. The approach demonstrates that linguistic knowledge can enable LLMs to handle languages with limited training data.

## Method Summary
LINGO leverages in-context learning by providing LLMs with linguistic descriptions as part of the prompt, including dictionaries, grammar books, and morphological analyzers. The method employs an iterative instruction refinement mechanism that automatically optimizes the prompts based on translation results. This training-free approach avoids the need for extensive fine-tuning while still enabling LLMs to process endangered languages effectively. The system was tested across multiple endangered and low-resource languages using publicly available linguistic resources.

## Key Results
- Translation quality improved from near-zero BLEU scores to 10.5 BLEU for 10 language directions
- Consistent performance improvements across mathematical reasoning, response selection, and word reordering tasks
- Demonstrated effectiveness across 8 endangered or low-resource languages
- Training-free approach achieved significant gains without requiring model fine-tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by providing LLMs with structured linguistic knowledge through in-context learning. By incorporating dictionaries, grammar rules, and morphological information directly into prompts, the model gains access to the formal linguistic structures needed to process unfamiliar languages. The iterative instruction refinement mechanism allows the system to optimize prompt construction based on translation feedback, effectively teaching the LLM how to apply the linguistic rules. This mimics how human linguists approach language translation by first understanding the formal properties of a language before attempting translation.

## Foundational Learning
- **In-context learning**: Why needed - allows LLMs to adapt to new tasks without fine-tuning; Quick check - can the model perform translation with just prompt examples?
- **Linguistic description formats**: Why needed - provides structured knowledge about language rules; Quick check - does the model correctly apply dictionary entries?
- **Iterative refinement**: Why needed - optimizes prompts for better translation accuracy; Quick check - does performance improve across refinement iterations?
- **Morphological analysis**: Why needed - handles complex word structures in endangered languages; Quick check - can the model correctly segment compound words?
- **Cross-linguistic transfer**: Why needed - leverages knowledge from related languages; Quick check - does performance correlate with language family similarity?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Query -> Prompt Builder -> LLM Engine -> Evaluation -> Feedback Loop -> Prompt Optimizer -> Final Output

**Critical Path**: The system follows a cycle where user queries are transformed into prompts with linguistic descriptions, processed by the LLM, evaluated for quality, and then refined through feedback to improve subsequent translations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The training-free approach prioritizes flexibility and low resource requirements over maximum performance. While fine-tuning could potentially achieve higher accuracy, it requires extensive data and computational resources that may not be available for endangered languages.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance occurs when linguistic descriptions are incomplete or when the language has very limited documentation. The system may also struggle with highly irregular grammatical structures or when dictionary entries conflict with actual usage patterns.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test translation accuracy with varying completeness of linguistic descriptions, 2) Compare performance across languages with different documentation levels, 3) Evaluate the impact of different prompt structures on translation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions, though several implications emerge from the work. These include how the approach scales to languages with even less documentation, whether more comprehensive linguistic resources would yield greater improvements, and how well the method handles longer or more complex texts beyond the tested scenarios.

## Limitations
- Tested on only 8 endangered languages, limiting generalizability claims
- Translation improvements remain modest at 10.5 BLEU despite significant gains from baseline
- Does not explore optimal types or completeness levels of linguistic descriptions
- Limited evaluation of real-world utility beyond BLEU scores and benchmark tasks

## Confidence
- Translation quality improvements: Medium - statistically significant but modest BLEU scores
- Cross-task generalization: Medium - improvements observed across multiple task types but limited language diversity
- Scalability to other languages: Low - only 8 languages tested, unclear how approach performs with minimal documentation
- Practical real-world impact: Low - BLEU scores don't directly translate to usable translation quality

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach on additional endangered languages with varying levels of documentation to assess scalability limits
2. Compare performance using different types and completeness of linguistic descriptions to identify optimal resource types
3. Evaluate real-world translation quality through human evaluation on downstream tasks like document translation or conversational applications rather than BLEU scores alone
