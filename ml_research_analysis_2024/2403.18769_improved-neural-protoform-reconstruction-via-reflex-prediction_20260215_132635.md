# Improved Neural Protoform Reconstruction via Reflex Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.18769
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18769
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Reranking beam search candidates using reflex prediction scores significantly improves neural protoform reconstruction accuracy over state-of-the-art models on Romance and Sinitic datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to neural protoform reconstruction that addresses a key limitation of existing methods: they only model the unidirectional mapping from protoforms to reflexes, ignoring the comparative method's bidirectional constraint. The authors propose a multi-model system that first generates beam search candidates via a reconstruction model, then reranks them based on how well each candidate can predict the modern reflexes using a separate reflex prediction model. This approach achieves statistically significant improvements across multiple evaluation metrics on both Romance and Sinitic datasets, with reranking correcting errors made by probability-based ranking alone.

## Method Summary
The method involves a two-stage process: first, a reconstruction model (using GRU or Transformer architectures) generates k candidate protoforms for each cognate set via beam search. Second, a reflex prediction model evaluates each candidate by predicting all reflexes and scoring based on prediction accuracy. The final ranking combines the original probability scores with reflex prediction scores using a weighted sum, with the highest-scoring candidate selected as the reconstruction. The approach is trained and evaluated on WikiHan, WikiHan-aug, Hóu, and Romance datasets with specific hyperparameters including batch sizes, learning rates, and dropout rates.

## Key Results
- Statistically significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy across multiple metrics (TED, TER, FER, BCFS) on both Romance and Sinitic datasets
- Reranking successfully corrects probability-based ranking errors, with reflex prediction providing valuable independent information
- Positive correlation between reflex prediction performance and reranked reconstruction accuracy
- Best performance achieved with beam size k=5 and score adjustment weight λ=0.5

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reranking corrects probability-based ranking errors by using phonetic naturalness scores from a reflex prediction model
- Mechanism: The reconstruction model produces candidate protoforms with probability scores, but these scores don't account for whether the protoforms can generate the observed reflexes. The reflex prediction model provides an independent assessment of how well each candidate can predict the actual reflexes, allowing correction of probability-based errors
- Core assumption: Phonetic naturalness of a protoform (measured by its ability to predict correct reflexes) is a better ranking criterion than raw probability scores
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The reﬂex prediction component can often provide valuable information that may not have been captured by the reconstruction model’s probability distribution, thereby addressing certain reconstruction errors"
  - [section] "The reﬂex prediction model could only infer 2 (bold) of the 8 reﬂexes from the incorrect reconstruction pjet入, but correctly infers 7 of the 8 reﬂexes from the third candidate pit入"
- Break condition: If the reflex prediction model itself makes systematic errors that correlate with the reconstruction model's errors, the reranking won't help

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The comparative method's bidirectional constraint is better approximated when both reconstruction and reflex prediction are used together
- Mechanism: Traditional reconstruction treats the problem as one-directional (reflexes → protoform), but the comparative method requires that protoforms should also deterministically generate reflexes. By using both models, the system better approximates this bidirectional constraint
- Core assumption: The comparative method's full bidirectional constraint improves reconstruction accuracy
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We argue that this framework ignores one of the most important aspects of the comparative method: not only should protoforms be inferable from cognate sets (sets of related reflexes) but the reflexes should also be inferable from the protoforms"
  - [section] "We propose a multi-model reconstruction system that improves its reconstructions via reflex prediction—the task of predicting the reflexes given a protoform"
- Break condition: If the reconstruction model is already perfect at the unidirectional task, adding the bidirectional constraint won't improve accuracy

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Phonetically similar protoforms to reflexes are easier for reflex prediction models to handle, creating a bias that helps correct errors
- Mechanism: When the reconstruction model makes errors, it often produces protoforms that are phonetically closer to the reflexes than the true protoform. The reflex prediction model, trained to predict reflexes from protoforms, finds these similar forms easier to work with, allowing it to identify and rank the correct protoform higher
- Core assumption: Phonetic similarity between predicted and target protoforms correlates with reflex prediction accuracy
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We observe that, compared to the target protoform, the incorrectly predicted protoform often exhibits greater phonetic similarity, measured by both token edit distance and feature edit distance, to the reflexes"
  - [section] "It is likely that the reflex prediction models find it easier to derive correct reflexes from predicted protoforms that are more similar to the reflexes"
- Break condition: If the true protoform is phonetically distant from all reflexes (e.g., contains sounds lost in evolution), this mechanism won't help identify it

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sequence-to-sequence transduction
  - Why needed here: Both reconstruction and reflex prediction are framed as sequence-to-sequence tasks, requiring understanding of encoder-decoder architectures
  - Quick check question: What architectural modifications are needed to adapt a standard translation model to handle multiple target languages in reflex prediction?

- Concept: Beam search optimization
  - Why needed here: Beam search is used to generate candidate protoforms, and understanding its scoring mechanism is crucial for implementing reranking
  - Quick check question: How does length normalization in beam search affect the ranking of shorter vs longer protoform candidates?

- Concept: Edit distance metrics
  - Why needed here: Multiple evaluation metrics (TED, TER, FER) use different edit distance calculations to measure reconstruction accuracy
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between token edit distance and feature edit distance, and when would each be more appropriate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Reconstruction model (GRU with beam search) → generates k candidate protoforms with probability scores
  - Reflex prediction model → takes each candidate and predicts all reflexes, scoring based on accuracy
  - Reranking layer → combines probability scores and reflex prediction scores using weighted sum
  - Output → highest-scoring candidate after reranking

- Critical path:
  1. Input: Set of reflexes from cognate set
  2. Beam search generates k candidates from reconstruction model
  3. Each candidate passed through reflex prediction model for all daughter languages
  4. Reranking combines probability and reflex prediction scores
  5. Output best candidate

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Beam size k vs computation cost: Larger k gives more candidates but increases reflex prediction inference time
  - Score adjustment weight λ: Too high favors reflex prediction over probability; too low makes reranking ineffective
  - Model choice for reranker: GRU vs Transformer affects both accuracy and inference speed

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor reranking performance when both models make correlated errors
  - High variance in results when test sets are small (as seen with Hóu dataset)
  - Inability to recover protoforms with sounds lost in daughter languages

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test reranking with fixed beam size (k=5) and vary λ to find optimal weight
  2. Compare GRU vs Transformer as reranker while keeping reconstruction model fixed
  3. Evaluate reranking performance on augmented vs non-augmented datasets to assess data quality impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do cognate prediction, reflex prediction, and reconstruction models interact when integrated into a unified workflow, and what are the optimal configurations for combining these tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that "it is left to future work to address some of the challenges" and suggests exploring approaches to "integrate reconstruction and reflex prediction into one seamless model" rather than using the current multi-step reranking approach.
- Why unresolved: The current study uses a sequential pipeline (reconstruction → reranking with reflex prediction) and identifies this as potentially "complicated" due to its multi-step nature. The paper does not explore alternative integration strategies or evaluate their effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing various integration approaches (e.g., joint training, multitask learning, or end-to-end differentiable pipelines) against the current reranking method, measuring reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why does Hokkien exhibit the highest reflex prediction error rates across all reranking behavior categories, and what specific linguistic factors contribute to this pattern?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "we observe that the reranker model has the highest overall error rate when predicting Hokkien reflexes compared to other daughter languages on WikiHan" and suggests "a possible explanation is Karlgren's hypothetical subgrouping of Sinitic in which Hokkien is a descendant of a sister of Middle Chinese rather than Middle Chinese itself."
- Why unresolved: While the paper proposes a hypothesis about Hokkien's phylogenetic position, it does not empirically test this explanation or investigate other potential factors (e.g., phonological divergence, dataset size, or morphological complexity).
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic analysis comparing Hokkien's phonological divergence from Middle Chinese against other daughter languages, phylogenetic reconstruction experiments testing alternative subgrouping hypotheses, and ablation studies isolating the effect of Hokkien's unique characteristics on model performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of the reranking approach when protoforms contain phonemes lost during language evolution, and how can these limitations be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that "certain sound combinations in WikiHan's Middle Chinese forms, such as ju, je, and xwo, are absent in the daughter languages included in the dataset" and notes this as "a notable challenge of computational reconstruction—recovering phonemes lost during language evolution."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a challenge but does not propose solutions or test whether alternative reconstruction architectures (beyond reranking) might better handle lost phonemes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing reranking performance on cognate sets with and without lost phonemes, analysis of whether reranking disproportionately fails on such cases, and evaluation of reconstruction models with explicit mechanisms for phoneme loss recovery.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends on reflex prediction model accuracy; correlated errors between models limit reranking benefits
- Limited analysis of why reranking works, based on small sample rather than comprehensive error analysis
- Unclear generalizability to language families beyond Romance and Sinitic with different phonological systems

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The core finding that reranking beam search candidates using reflex prediction scores improves reconstruction accuracy
- Medium Confidence: The proposed mechanisms explaining why reranking works, particularly mechanism 3 about phonetic similarity
- Low Confidence: The generalizability of the approach to language families beyond Romance and Sinitic, and its performance with very different phonological systems or historical linguistic scenarios

## Next Checks
1. **Error correlation analysis**: Systematically analyze the correlation between reconstruction and reflex prediction errors across all test examples to quantify how often reranking successfully corrects probability-based ranking errors versus when it fails due to correlated errors

2. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Test the reranking approach on at least one additional language family (e.g., Indo-European beyond Romance, or Austronesian) to assess generalizability and identify any language-specific limitations

3. **Ablation study on beam size**: Conduct a more comprehensive analysis of how beam size interacts with reranking effectiveness, testing whether larger beams consistently improve results or if there's an optimal size beyond which reranking becomes less effective
