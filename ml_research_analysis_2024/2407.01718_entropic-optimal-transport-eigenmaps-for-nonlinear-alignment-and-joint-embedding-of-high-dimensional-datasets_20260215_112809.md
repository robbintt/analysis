# Entropic Optimal Transport Eigenmaps for Nonlinear Alignment and Joint Embedding of High-Dimensional Datasets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.01718
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01718
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Principled method for aligning and jointly embedding high-dimensional datasets using Entropic Optimal Transport eigenmaps

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) eigenmaps, a method for aligning and jointly embedding pairs of high-dimensional datasets that share underlying structures but may exhibit dataset-specific distortions. The approach leverages the leading singular vectors of the EOT plan matrix between two datasets to extract shared structures and align them in a common embedding space. The method is interpreted as an inter-data variant of Laplacian eigenmaps and diffusion maps, inheriting their favorable properties for nonlinear dimensionality reduction.

## Method Summary
EOT eigenmaps use entropic regularization of the optimal transport problem to compute a coupling matrix between two datasets. The method extracts shared structures by computing the leading singular vectors of this coupling matrix, which form a joint embedding that aligns the datasets. The approach handles translation, scaling, and noise-induced deformations by operating on the optimal transport plan rather than direct data matching. The method is theoretically grounded through connections to manifold learning and population-level operators.

## Key Results
- EOT eigenmaps effectively align datasets with shared manifold structure under translation, scaling, and noise
- The method inherits favorable properties of Laplacian eigenmaps including preservation of local geometry
- Outperforms existing alignment methods on simulations and single-cell omics data
- R code implementation is publicly available

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EOT eigenmaps work by computing the entropic optimal transport plan between two datasets, which naturally handles geometric distortions through its probabilistic coupling. The leading singular vectors of this coupling matrix capture the dominant shared structures between datasets, effectively aligning them in a common embedding space. The entropic regularization makes the optimization tractable while preserving the essential geometric relationships encoded in the transport plan.

## Foundational Learning
- Optimal Transport: Mathematical framework for comparing probability distributions; needed to understand the coupling matrix computation
  - Quick check: Verify the Kantorovich duality formulation
- Entropic Regularization: Adds entropy term to OT to make computation tractable via Sinkhorn algorithm
  - Quick check: Confirm convergence of Sinkhorn iterations
- Laplacian Eigenmaps: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction preserving local geometry
  - Quick check: Compare spectral properties with EOT eigenmaps
- Diffusion Maps: Related manifold learning technique using random walks
  - Quick check: Verify connection between EOT and diffusion operators
- Singular Value Decomposition: Matrix factorization revealing dominant modes
  - Quick check: Ensure numerical stability of SVD computation

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data preprocessing -> OT coupling matrix computation -> Sinkhorn iterations -> SVD computation -> Joint embedding

Critical path: The computation of the entropic optimal transport plan via Sinkhorn iterations is the computational bottleneck. SVD of the resulting coupling matrix follows directly and is relatively inexpensive.

Design tradeoffs: Entropic regularization balances computational efficiency against approximation accuracy of the true optimal transport plan. Higher regularization speeds computation but may lose fine-grained geometric details.

Failure signatures: Poor alignment occurs when shared structure is weak, noise levels are high, or datasets have fundamentally different geometries. Computational failure manifests as non-convergence of Sinkhorn iterations.

Three first experiments: (1) Verify EOT eigenmaps recover ground truth alignment on simple 2D synthetic data with known deformation; (2) Test sensitivity to regularization parameter on benchmark manifold datasets; (3) Compare alignment quality against classical OT without regularization on small datasets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly enumerate open questions, but several theoretical and practical considerations remain unaddressed, particularly regarding convergence guarantees under practical conditions and the impact of various types of dataset-specific distortions beyond those considered in the analysis.

## Limitations
- Computational cost scales poorly with dataset size due to Sinkhorn algorithm complexity
- Theoretical guarantees depend on assumptions about noise levels and deformation magnitudes that may not hold in practice
- Performance relative to deep learning-based alignment methods remains unexplored

## Confidence
- High confidence: EOT eigenmaps inherit favorable properties of Laplacian eigenmaps (supported by theoretical connections)
- Medium confidence: Superiority claims over existing alignment methods (based on specific simulations and single-cell data)
- Medium confidence: Interpretation as inter-data variant of diffusion maps (elegant but relies on shared manifold assumptions)

## Next Checks
(1) Test EOT eigenmaps on datasets with known non-linear deformations beyond translation and scaling, such as rotations or non-uniform stretching.
(2) Conduct ablation studies varying the regularization parameter to understand its impact on alignment quality and computational efficiency.
(3) Compare EOT eigenmaps against deep learning-based alignment methods on benchmark datasets to assess performance relative to representation learning approaches.
