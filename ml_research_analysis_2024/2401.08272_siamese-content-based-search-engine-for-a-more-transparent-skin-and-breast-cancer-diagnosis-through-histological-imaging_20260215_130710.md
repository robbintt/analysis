# Siamese Content-based Search Engine for a More Transparent Skin and Breast Cancer Diagnosis through Histological Imaging

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.08272
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08272
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Siamese network-based CBHIR system achieves 70% F1-score at top 1 retrieval for breast cancer and 67% precision improvement over CAE for skin cancer

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a Siamese network-based Content-Based Histopathological Image Retrieval (CBHIR) system to assist pathologists in breast and skin cancer diagnosis. The Siamese network serves as a feature extractor to capture histopathological patterns from image pairs, and a contrastive loss function is used to improve the discriminative capacity of the learned feature space. The system retrieves similar patches to a query image from a database, with the goal of providing a second opinion for pathologists.

## Method Summary
The proposed method utilizes a Siamese network architecture to learn a feature space where histopathological images of the same cancer type are closer together. The Siamese network consists of two identical subnetworks that share weights and process image pairs simultaneously. A contrastive loss function is used during training to minimize the distance between similar image pairs and maximize the distance between dissimilar pairs. The trained Siamese network is then used as a feature extractor to retrieve similar patches from a database for a given query image.

## Key Results
- Breast-twins model achieves 70% F1-score at top 1 retrieval on breast cancer data, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at higher K values (e.g., 400).
- Skin-twins model surpasses a recently proposed Convolutional Auto Encoder (CAE) by 67% in precision on skin cancer data.
- The system can effectively retrieve images of the same cancer type as the query, as demonstrated by comparisons with classification approaches.
- The proposed approach is the first to report high performance at top 1 retrieval for histopathological images, making it a more reliable tool for pathologists.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
1. Siamese Networks: Why needed - To learn a feature space where similar images are close together and dissimilar images are far apart. Quick check - Ensure the Siamese network architecture is correctly implemented with shared weights.
2. Contrastive Loss: Why needed - To train the Siamese network to minimize the distance between similar image pairs and maximize the distance between dissimilar pairs. Quick check - Verify the contrastive loss function is properly defined and applied during training.
3. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR): Why needed - To retrieve similar images from a database based on their visual content. Quick check - Confirm the retrieval process is correctly implemented using the learned feature space.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Image pairs -> Siamese network -> Feature extraction -> Contrastive loss -> Learned feature space -> Retrieval

Critical path: Image pairs are fed into the Siamese network, which extracts features and computes the contrastive loss. The learned feature space is then used to retrieve similar patches for a given query image.

Design tradeoffs: The Siamese network architecture allows for efficient learning of a discriminative feature space, but may require a large amount of training data. The contrastive loss function helps improve the discriminative capacity of the learned feature space, but may be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters.

Failure signatures: Poor retrieval performance may indicate issues with the Siamese network architecture, contrastive loss function, or insufficient training data. Low performance on new, unseen datasets may suggest a lack of generalization.

First experiments:
1. Verify the Siamese network architecture is correctly implemented with shared weights.
2. Test the contrastive loss function with different hyperparameter settings.
3. Evaluate the retrieval performance on a small, well-curated dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed Siamese network-based CBHIR system compare to traditional classification approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1-score?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that the proposed CBHIR model outperforms state-of-the-art classification approaches in terms of F1-score and accuracy on both breast and skin cancer datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison of the proposed CBHIR model with specific classification approaches on the same dataset and evaluation metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive comparison study between the proposed CBHIR model and various classification approaches on the same dataset using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed Siamese network-based CBHIR system perform on other types of cancer beyond breast and skin cancer?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses on breast and skin cancer datasets, but the proposed approach is based on a general Siamese network architecture that could potentially be applied to other types of cancer.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any results or analysis of the proposed approach on other types of cancer datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the proposed CBHIR system on various cancer types using appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics to assess its generalization capabilities.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed Siamese network-based CBHIR system vary with different hyperparameter settings, such as learning rate, batch size, and margin value?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that the Siamese network is trained with specific hyperparameter settings, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of how these settings affect the performance of the system.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not conduct a thorough hyperparameter sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of different settings on the performance of the proposed approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study of the effect of various hyperparameter settings on the performance of the proposed CBHIR system using techniques such as grid search or random search to identify the optimal settings.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation metrics reported (only F1-score and precision at specific K values)
- Lack of comparison with more recent state-of-the-art methods
- Potential domain shift when applying the Siamese network to new, unseen datasets

## Confidence
- High: The Siamese network's ability to retrieve similar patches and improve discriminative capacity.
- Medium: The reported performance metrics and comparison with state-of-the-art methods.
- Low: The generalizability and robustness of the model across different datasets and image qualities.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the model's performance on a larger, more diverse dataset with varying image qualities and preprocessing methods.
2. Conduct a comprehensive comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods, including those using different architectures or loss functions.
3. Investigate the interpretability of the learned feature space and the model's robustness to domain shifts and image variations.
