# Deduction Game Framework and Information Set Entropy Search

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.21178
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21178
- Authors: Fandi Meng; Simon Lucas
- Reference count: 15
- Key outcome: ISES algorithm outperforms SO-ISMCTS on deduction games under time constraints

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a game framework for deduction games that leverages Shannon entropy to analyze game states and a novel search algorithm called Information Set Entropy Search (ISES). The framework models single-player deduction games where players make queries to uncover a hidden secret, with state uncertainty measured via information entropy. The ISES algorithm searches for optimal actions by minimizing expected entropy after potential observations, with a sampled variant enabling time-constrained decision-making. Experiments across eight deduction games demonstrate ISES significantly outperforms the baseline SO-ISMCTS algorithm under limited decision time, solving games in fewer average steps.

## Method Summary
The framework uses Shannon entropy to measure state uncertainty in deduction games, where players make queries to uncover hidden information. The ISES algorithm evaluates actions by simulating their outcomes across sampled states and selecting the action that produces the lowest average entropy in the resulting information sets. A sampling variant enables practical computation within time constraints while maintaining near-optimal performance. The method is evaluated on eight deduction games with varying complexity, comparing ISES against Random Agent and SO-ISMCTS baselines.

## Key Results
- ISES significantly outperforms SO-ISMCTS on all eight tested deduction games under 0.1s decision time constraints
- Sampled ISES maintains near-optimal performance while enabling practical computation time
- Games with higher spatial and temporal entropy variation show greater engagement potential

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ISES algorithm achieves superior performance by minimizing expected entropy after potential observations
- Mechanism: The algorithm evaluates actions by simulating their outcomes across sampled states and selecting the action that produces the lowest average entropy in the resulting information sets
- Core assumption: Lower entropy in information sets corresponds to closer proximity to solving the game
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The ISES algorithm searches for optimal actions by minimizing expected entropy after potential observations"
  - [section] "The optimal action in single-player games should maximize average information gain"
- Break condition: If the game structure makes entropy reduction non-monotonic or if observations don't reliably update the information set

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sampling variant enables practical computation within time constraints while maintaining near-optimal performance
- Mechanism: By randomly sampling both states and actions, the algorithm can make decisions quickly without evaluating the full search space
- Core assumption: Random sampling of equivalent states/actions maintains representative coverage of the decision space
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The ISES algorithm, augmented with sampling techniques, allows agents to make decisions within controlled computational resources and time constraints"
  - [section] "the sampled version of ISES, even with a 0.1s decision time limit, closely mirrored the original ISES's efficacy"
- Break condition: When games have high combinatorial complexity where sampling fails to capture rare but critical states/actions

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Entropy variation provides both a performance metric and a measure of game design quality
- Mechanism: Games with high spatial and temporal entropy variation are more engaging because they require genuine strategic thinking rather than rote application of optimal strategies
- Core assumption: Player engagement correlates with uncertainty in outcomes even when optimal strategies are known
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "two factors make deduction games interesting: 1) Spatial - players' choices at decision points aren't equivalent. 2) Temporal - an optimal action's outcome remains uncertain after exploration"
  - [section] "Mastermind is more interesting despite both being strategic games: Mastermind has uncertain entropy changes and no definitive resolution"
- Break condition: If player engagement is driven more by narrative or social factors than strategic uncertainty

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Shannon entropy as a measure of uncertainty
  - Why needed here: The framework uses entropy to quantify information state uncertainty and guide decision-making
  - Quick check question: How does Shannon entropy differ from simple count of possible states?

- Concept: Information sets in imperfect information games
  - Why needed here: The framework models game states through information sets that represent what the player knows
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes an information set from a complete game state?

- Concept: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and its variants
  - Why needed here: ISES is compared against SO-ISMCTS, requiring understanding of MCTS principles
  - Quick check question: How does ISMCTS handle the imperfect information aspect differently from standard MCTS?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Game framework → Information set representation → Entropy calculation → ISES algorithm → Sampling mechanism → Performance evaluation
- Critical path: Information set → Entropy calculation → Action selection → State update → Repeat until termination
- Design tradeoffs: Exhaustive ISES provides optimal solutions but is computationally expensive; sampled ISES trades some optimality for practical runtime
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on games with exponential state space growth; degradation when sampling fails to capture critical states; incorrect entropy calculations for non-standard information representations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement Fake Coin Game with tabular entropy calculation and verify ISES solves it optimally
  2. Add Mastermind with combinatorial entropy calculation and compare ISES against random agent
  3. Implement sampling variant with time constraints and measure performance degradation vs exhaustive version

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the ISES algorithm be adapted to multiplayer deduction games where agents must maximize their own information while minimizing opponents' information gain?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "In future we aim to expand our framework to include multiplayer deduction games such as Cluedo. The dynamics of multiplayer deduction games involve maximising one's own information while minimising the information gain of our opponents..."
- Why unresolved: The current framework and ISES algorithm are designed specifically for single-player deduction games, with no consideration for adversarial information dynamics or opponent modeling.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified version of ISES that incorporates opponent modeling and competitive information entropy calculations, validated through experiments on multiplayer deduction games showing improved performance over existing methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical relationship between the sampling size in ISES and the probability of finding the optimal action, particularly for games with exponential state space growth?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that "As game complexity escalates, the sampled approach may falter" and discusses performance degradation in games like Fake Coin Game with exponential complexity growth, but doesn't provide theoretical guarantees about sampling adequacy.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates empirical results showing sampling effects, it doesn't establish theoretical bounds or provide a principled method for determining optimal sampling parameters based on game complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Mathematical proofs or empirical studies establishing the relationship between sampling parameters, game complexity, and solution quality, potentially leading to adaptive sampling strategies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can information entropy be used as a general metric for evaluating the "fun" or engagement potential of deduction games beyond the two factors (spatial variety and temporal uncertainty) identified in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses using entropy variation to analyze game appeal and mentions "two factors make deduction games interesting: 1) Spatial - players' choices at decision points aren't equivalent. 2) Temporal - an optimal action's outcome remains uncertain after exploration" but questions if these are sufficient.
- Why unresolved: The paper only identifies two factors and provides limited analysis of how entropy metrics relate to player engagement or game design principles beyond these factors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies correlating entropy metrics with player engagement data, or theoretical frameworks extending entropy analysis to capture additional aspects of game appeal such as surprise, satisfaction, or narrative elements.

## Limitations
- Framework's generalizability to more complex or dynamic deduction games remains untested
- Connection between entropy variation and player engagement lacks direct experimental validation with human players
- Sampling variant's performance degradation threshold is not rigorously defined

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of using Shannon entropy to measure state uncertainty and guide search decisions is well-established and correctly applied
- **Medium Confidence:** The empirical superiority of ISES over SO-ISMCTS is demonstrated but limited to the specific games tested
- **Medium Confidence:** The theoretical framework for analyzing game design through entropy variation is sound but requires further validation

## Next Checks
1. Test ISES on deduction games with larger state spaces (10x the current maximum) to evaluate scalability and sampling effectiveness
2. Conduct human subject experiments comparing engagement levels between games with high vs. low entropy variation to validate the engagement hypothesis
3. Implement a hybrid approach combining ISES with domain-specific heuristics to evaluate potential performance gains on specialized deduction games
