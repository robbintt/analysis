# SustainDC: Benchmarking for Sustainable Data Center Control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.07841
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07841
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Introduces SustainDC, Python environments for benchmarking MARL algorithms in data centers, showing significant potential for reducing carbon footprint, energy consumption, and water usage through collaborative control.

## Executive Summary
SustainDC is a Python-based benchmarking framework for evaluating multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in data center control. The framework supports custom data center configurations and tasks including workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and battery management. Unlike other environments that rely on external tools or precompiled binaries, SustainDC implements electrical and thermo-fluid dynamics directly in Python, making it easily customizable and fast. The authors evaluate various MARL algorithms across diverse data center designs, geographic locations, weather conditions, and workload patterns, demonstrating significant opportunities for improving data center sustainability through collaborative MARL approaches.

## Method Summary
SustainDC implements Python environments for data center control that directly model electrical and thermo-fluid behavior without external dependencies. The framework includes three distinct agents (workload scheduling, cooling optimization, battery management) with customizable reward sharing mechanisms. The evaluation uses real-world workload traces from Alibaba and Google data centers, weather data from EnergyPlus, and grid carbon intensity data from the EIA API. The paper benchmarks several MARL algorithms including IPPO, MAPPO, and various heterogeneous multi-agent approaches across multiple geographic locations (New York, Georgia, California, Arizona) and measures performance on carbon footprint, energy consumption, water usage, and task queue length.

## Key Results
- MARL algorithms can reduce data center carbon footprint by coordinating workload scheduling, cooling, and battery management
- Performance varies significantly across geographic locations due to differences in weather and grid carbon intensity
- Collaborative approaches with reward sharing generally outperform independent learning strategies
- The framework enables systematic comparison of MARL algorithms across diverse operating conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SustainDC allows researchers to benchmark multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms on realistic data center configurations without relying on external simulation tools.
- Mechanism: The environment directly implements electrical and thermo-fluid dynamics in Python using custom physics models for IT servers, HVAC cooling, and battery systems, avoiding dependency on compiled binaries like FMUs or external tools like EnergyPlus or Modelica.
- Core assumption: The Python models accurately capture the behavior of real-world data center components and interactions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SustainDC is a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC)...Unlike other environments that rely on precompiled binaries or external tools, SustainDC is easily end-user customizable and fast."
  - [section 2] "SustainDC allows users to simulate the electrical and thermo-fluid behavior of large DCs directly in Python. Unlike other environments that rely on precompiled binaries or external tools, SustainDC is easily end-user customizable and fast."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct citations to papers validating accuracy of SustainDC's physics models versus real systems.
- Break condition: If the physics models deviate significantly from real data center behavior, benchmark results will not translate to real-world improvements.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SustainDC supports heterogeneous multi-agent control where agents with different action and observation spaces collaborate to optimize overall data center sustainability.
- Mechanism: The environment provides three distinct agents (workload scheduling, cooling optimization, battery management) with customizable reward sharing via a weighting parameter, enabling both independent and collaborative learning.
- Core assumption: Agents can effectively learn to coordinate when given partial reward feedback from other agents' environments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other."
  - [section 4.4] "The goal of the multi-agent problem is to find policies that parameterize the corresponding policies AgentLS, AgentDC and AgentBAT, such that net CFP is minimized over a specified horizon N."
  - [section 6.3] "We evaluated and compared the relative performances of different MARL that includes PPO with independent actor critics (IPPO), centralized critic 332, heterogeneous multi-agent 332, +A2C, +DQN and +SAC."
  - [corpus] Missing. No citations showing prior work on MARL for heterogeneous data center control with this specific reward sharing mechanism.
- Break condition: If reward sharing is poorly tuned, agents may fail to coordinate or learning may diverge.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SustainDC's benchmarking capability enables systematic comparison of MARL algorithms across diverse geographic locations, weather conditions, and workload patterns.
- Mechanism: The environment includes configurable weather data, grid carbon intensity profiles for multiple regions, and open-source workload traces, allowing evaluation under varying conditions.
- Core assumption: The included datasets represent realistic variations in data center operating environments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements."
  - [section 4.2] "In addition, SustainDC includes weather data... Users can also specify their own weather files if needed."
  - [section 4.1] "Users can also customize the CI data... The carbon intensity files are extracted from EIA."
  - [section E.3] "The CI files should contain one year of data with an hourly periodicity... The file structure should have the following columns: timestamp, WND, SUN, WAT, OIL, NG, COL, NUC, OTH, and avg_CI."
  - [corpus] Missing. No citations validating that the included datasets capture the full range of real-world variations.
- Break condition: If datasets are unrepresentative, algorithm comparisons will not generalize to actual deployments.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
  - Why needed here: SustainDC is designed specifically for benchmarking MARL algorithms, so understanding how multiple agents learn to coordinate in shared environments is fundamental.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between independent critic methods (like IPPO) and centralized critic methods (like 332) in MARL?

- Concept: Data Center Cooling Systems
  - Why needed here: The environment models complex HVAC interactions including chillers, cooling towers, and CRAC units, so understanding these components is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: How does adjusting the CRAC supply air temperature affect both cooling energy consumption and IT equipment temperature?

- Concept: Carbon Intensity and Sustainability Metrics
  - Why needed here: The primary optimization objective is minimizing carbon footprint, requiring understanding of how energy consumption translates to carbon emissions across different grid sources.
  - Quick check question: How is the carbon footprint calculated from energy consumption and grid carbon intensity in the SustainDC reward function?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: EnvLS (Workload Scheduling) -> EnvDC (Data Center Operations) -> EnvBAT (Battery Management) -> RewardCreator
- Critical path:
  1. Load dc_config.json to configure data center parameters
  2. Initialize environment with chosen configuration
  3. Set up MARL agents with appropriate observation/action spaces
  4. Run training loop with reward calculation
  5. Evaluate performance across metrics (CFP, energy, water usage, task queue)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Python implementation vs. compiled binaries: Easier customization but potential performance trade-offs
  - Physics model complexity vs. simulation speed: More accurate models may be slower
  - Reward sharing vs. independent learning: Shared rewards enable coordination but add complexity
- Failure signatures:
  - Physics models producing unrealistic temperatures or energy values
  - Agents failing to learn or converging to poor policies
  - Reward shaping causing unintended behaviors or instability
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline experiment with single PPO agent controlling cooling setpoint only, compare to rule-based 36 guideline
  2. Test reward sharing ablation by varying the collaboration parameter and measuring impact on coordination
  3. Benchmark heterogeneous MARL algorithms (332, +332, +A2C) across different geographic locations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal reward-sharing mechanism (parameter $\alpha$) for heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning in data centers, and how does it vary across different geographical locations and workloads?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses reward-sharing mechanisms and conducts ablation experiments with different values of $\alpha$, but does not identify a definitive optimal value.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that different values of $\alpha$ affect performance, but does not determine the optimal value for various scenarios. The performance varies across different geographical locations and workloads, suggesting that the optimal $\alpha$ may be context-dependent.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments testing a wider range of $\alpha$ values across diverse data center configurations, locations, and workload types, along with analysis of the relationship between $\alpha$ and performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different multi-agent reinforcement learning architectures (e.g., IPPO, MAPPO, MAAC) compare in terms of their ability to generalize to new data center configurations and unseen weather/climate conditions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper benchmarks several multi-agent RL architectures but notes that performance varies significantly across different regions and weather conditions, and does not fully understand the reasons for these variations.
- Why unresolved: While the paper compares different architectures, it does not systematically evaluate their generalization capabilities to new, unseen data center configurations or weather/climate conditions beyond the tested locations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive testing of each architecture on a wide range of new data center configurations and weather/climate conditions, including those significantly different from the training data, along with analysis of their generalization performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of using simplified physics-based models (e.g., reduced-order models for pumps and cooling towers) in SustainDC, and how do these limitations impact the accuracy of RL agent performance evaluation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using simplified physics-based models for computational speed and notes that they could not exhaustively tune hyperparameters for all networks.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the use of simplified models but does not quantify their impact on the accuracy of RL agent performance evaluation or identify the specific limitations of these models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis comparing the performance of RL agents trained on simplified models versus more complex, high-fidelity models, along with quantification of the errors introduced by the simplified models.

## Limitations
- Physics model accuracy unverified: No validation against real data center measurements
- Dataset representativeness unclear: Limited testing across diverse geographic and climate conditions
- Hyperparameter tuning incomplete: Could not exhaustively tune all network architectures

## Confidence
- Medium: While the architecture and experimental setup are well-documented, the paper lacks validation of the underlying physics models against real data center measurements, and the included datasets' representativeness for diverse geographic conditions is not thoroughly established.

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark SustainDC's temperature and energy predictions against real-world data center monitoring data to validate physics model accuracy
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the reward sharing parameter across a wider range of data center configurations to assess robustness
3. Test MARL algorithms on data center scenarios outside the provided geographic regions and weather conditions to evaluate generalization capability
