# Tell Me More! Towards Implicit User Intention Understanding of Language Model Driven Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.09205
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09205
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Mistral-Interact achieves over 85% vagueness judgment accuracy and 96% intention coverage when integrated with XAgent framework

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of implicit user intention understanding in LLM-driven agents through the introduction of the Intention-in-Interaction (IN3) benchmark. The authors develop Mistral-Interact, a specialized model that proactively identifies task vagueness, inquires about user intentions, and refines them into actionable goals. When integrated into the XAgent framework, Mistral-Interact significantly improves instruction understanding, execution efficiency, and overall task completion rates compared to baseline models, while maintaining performance competitive with GPT-4.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a three-stage approach to implicit intention understanding: vagueness assessment to identify unclear instructions, intention inquiry to prompt users for clarification, and goal refinement to convert user responses into executable tasks. This methodology is embodied in Mistral-Interact, a model trained on synthetically generated data using a multi-stage pipeline that simulates realistic user-agent interactions. The model is evaluated using the IN3 benchmark, which provides a structured framework for assessing performance across multiple dimensions including accuracy, coverage, and efficiency metrics.

## Key Results
- Over 85% accuracy in vagueness judgment for identifying unclear instructions
- 96% intention coverage in understanding user goals
- Reduced unnecessary subtasks and fewer tool invocations compared to baseline models
- Performance competitive with GPT-4 while using a smaller architecture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from the proactive nature of intention understanding, where the agent doesn't simply execute commands but actively engages users to clarify ambiguities before proceeding. By identifying vagueness early in the interaction and seeking clarification through targeted inquiries, the system prevents cascading errors that would occur from misinterpreting poorly defined tasks. The goal refinement stage ensures that user intentions are translated into concrete, executable objectives that the agent can reliably accomplish.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vagueness Assessment**: Understanding when user instructions lack sufficient detail for execution - needed to prevent misinterpretation, quick check: accuracy rate on ambiguous vs clear instructions
- **Intention Inquiry**: Formulating appropriate questions to clarify user goals - needed to bridge communication gaps, quick check: relevance and specificity of generated questions
- **Goal Refinement**: Converting user responses into actionable tasks - needed to enable reliable execution, quick check: executability of refined goals by agent
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creating realistic training scenarios from seed instructions - needed to scale training data creation, quick check: diversity and realism of generated interactions
- **Multi-stage Evaluation**: Assessing performance across multiple dimensions (accuracy, coverage, efficiency) - needed for comprehensive validation, quick check: correlation between metrics

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Input -> Vagueness Assessment -> Intention Inquiry -> Goal Refinement -> XAgent Execution

**Critical Path**: The core workflow follows: instruction reception → vagueness detection → user clarification request (if needed) → goal refinement → task execution. Each stage must complete successfully for optimal performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system prioritizes proactive clarification over immediate execution, accepting potential delays for improved accuracy. The synthetic data approach enables scalable training but may miss real-world edge cases. The 7B parameter architecture balances performance with efficiency compared to larger models.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include false positives in vagueness detection (unnecessary clarification requests), ineffective inquiry questions that don't resolve ambiguity, and goal refinement that produces unexecutable tasks. The system may struggle with highly contextual or domain-specific instructions not well-represented in training data.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test vagueness assessment accuracy on a balanced set of clear and ambiguous instructions
2. Evaluate the quality and relevance of generated clarification questions
3. Measure execution success rate of refined goals compared to original instructions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies primarily on synthetic data that may not capture real-world interaction complexity
- Direct comparison with GPT-4 involves different underlying architectures, complicating absolute performance claims
- Limited exploration of multi-turn dialogue scenarios where user intentions evolve over extended interactions

## Confidence
- **Technical Implementation**: High - well-documented methodology and benchmark design
- **Performance Claims**: Medium - synthetic evaluation data and limited real-world validation
- **Scalability Claims**: Low - insufficient exploration of complex, multi-turn interaction scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Deploy the system in real-world user studies to assess performance with actual user interactions and natural language variability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (vagueness assessment, intention inquiry, goal refinement) to overall performance
3. Test the system's ability to handle multi-turn dialogues and evolving user intentions over extended interaction sequences
