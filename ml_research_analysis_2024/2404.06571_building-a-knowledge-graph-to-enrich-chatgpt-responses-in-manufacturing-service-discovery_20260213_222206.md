# Building A Knowledge Graph to Enrich ChatGPT Responses in Manufacturing Service Discovery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.06571
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06571

- This research introduces a Knowledge Graph (KG) and Large Language Model (LLM) integration to enhance manufacturing service discovery.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to enhance ChatGPT's capabilities in manufacturing service discovery by integrating a Knowledge Graph (KG) with a Large Language Model (LLM). The method extracts and organizes manufacturing data from over 13,000 websites to build a Manufacturing Service Knowledge Graph (MSKG) with four entity types and their relationships. By combining coarse filtration and label classification, the MSKG effectively captures domain-specific information. The graph embedding vectors derived from the MSKG support complex queries, improving reliability and interpretability. Evaluation metrics demonstrate high performance in data extraction and classification, with the MSKG-enriched QA system outperforming GPT-4 in addressing complex manufacturing queries.

## Method Summary
The method involves extracting text data from 13,085 manufacturers' websites in the US and Canada, Wikidata, and manufacturing textbooks using coarse filtration with key term matching followed by label classification with BART. The extracted entities (Manufacturer Name, Service, Certification, and Location) are organized into a Manufacturing Service Knowledge Graph (MSKG) with weighted relationships. Graph embedding techniques (Node2Vec and GraphSAGE) are applied to generate vector representations of manufacturers and services. An MLP model is trained for multi-label classification, and the MSKG is integrated with ChatGPT using LangChain to enhance QA responses in the manufacturing domain.

## Key Results
- The MSKG effectively captures domain-specific information from unstructured text sources through a combination of coarse filtration and label classification
- Graph embedding vectors derived from the MSKG support complex queries and improve reliability and interpretability in manufacturing service discovery
- The MSKG-enriched QA system outperforms GPT-4 in addressing complex manufacturing queries, offering precise and interpretable results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Knowledge Graph integration improves ChatGPT's accuracy and completeness in domain-specific queries by providing structured, up-to-date information.
- Mechanism: The MSKG acts as a structured data source that supplements ChatGPT's language model, enabling precise retrieval of manufacturing services, certifications, and locations through graph queries and embeddings.
- Core assumption: The MSKG accurately captures and represents the relationships between manufacturers, services, certifications, and locations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The Knowledge Graph and the learned graph embedding vectors are leveraged to tackle intricate queries within the digital supply chain network, responding with enhanced reliability and greater interpretability."
  - [section] "This work highlights a mechanism to extract domain specific text from several thousands of independent websites of small manufacturers, and suggests a solution to organize them, thereby enabling a more natural way of interacting with technical domain specific text for powering more natural QA types queries."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence for direct MSKG-LLM integration impact; corpus focuses on supply chain resilience and visibility, not KG-LLM integration.
- Break condition: If the MSKG is not regularly updated or if the extraction process introduces significant errors, the accuracy and completeness of the responses will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Graph embedding vectors enable similarity-based manufacturer recommendations and multi-label classification for rapid understanding of manufacturers' capabilities.
- Mechanism: Node2Vec and GraphSAGE are used to learn low-dimensional vector representations of manufacturers and services, capturing their relationships within the MSKG. These vectors are then used for dimensionality reduction, similarity calculations, and training multi-label classification models.
- Core assumption: The graph embedding methods effectively capture the semantic relationships and characteristics of manufacturers and services.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The Knowledge Graph and the learned graph embedding vectors are leveraged to tackle intricate queries within the digital supply chain network, responding with enhanced reliability and greater interpretability."
  - [section] "The KG and the learned graph embedding vectors are used to support QA in ChatGPT. Leveraging the transformation between human natural language and graph query language, the knowledge can be retrieved from MSKG to answer the questions from ChatGPT's clients in the manufacturing industry."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; corpus focuses on supply chain optimization and resilience, not graph embedding techniques.
- Break condition: If the graph embedding methods fail to capture meaningful relationships or if the dimensionality reduction process loses critical information, the similarity-based recommendations and classification will be inaccurate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining coarse filtration and label classification improves the accuracy and efficiency of information extraction from unstructured text sources.
- Mechanism: Coarse filtration uses key term matching to quickly identify relevant N-grams, while label classification with BART refines the extraction by considering context and semantic understanding. This two-step approach balances efficiency and accuracy.
- Core assumption: The key terms selected for coarse filtration are comprehensive and the BART model effectively captures the nuances of manufacturing-related text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The Knowledge Graph (KG) and Large Language Model (LLM) integration to enhance manufacturing service discovery. The method extracts and organizes manufacturing data from over 13,000 websites, building a Manufacturing Service Knowledge Graph (MSKG) with four entity types and their relationships."
  - [section] "To populate the MSKG, text data from the front pages of manufacturers' websites (Total = 17,230) in the US and Canada, Wikidata, and standard manufacturing textbooks are extracted using the predefined ontology that categorizes entities into Manufacturer Name, Service, Certification, and Location."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; corpus focuses on supply chain transparency and resilience, not text extraction techniques.
- Break condition: If the key terms are not comprehensive or if the BART model is not well-suited for manufacturing-related text, the extraction process will miss relevant information or introduce errors.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text Knowledge Extraction -> Knowledge Graph Design -> Graph Embedding -> Knowledge-driven QA
- Critical path: Text Knowledge Extraction → Knowledge Graph Design → Graph Embedding → Knowledge-driven QA
  The extracted and organized data from the Text Knowledge Extraction component is used to build the MSKG, which is then used to learn graph embeddings and support the Knowledge-driven QA system.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Coarse filtration vs. label classification: Coarse filtration is faster but less accurate, while label classification is more accurate but computationally expensive. The two-step approach balances efficiency and accuracy.
  - Graph embedding methods: Node2Vec captures global structure, while GraphSAGE is inductive and can handle new nodes. The choice depends on the specific requirements of the application.
  - MSKG update frequency: More frequent updates ensure up-to-date information but increase computational overhead. The update frequency should be balanced based on the rate of change in the manufacturing industry.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision or recall in text extraction: Indicates issues with key term selection or the BART model's performance.
  - Poor clustering or classification results: Suggests that the graph embedding methods are not effectively capturing the relationships or that the dimensionality reduction process is losing critical information.
  - Inaccurate or incomplete responses from the QA system: May indicate issues with the MSKG construction, graph embedding, or the integration with ChatGPT.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the performance of coarse filtration and label classification separately on a small subset of the data to identify the optimal combination of key terms and BART model parameters.
  2. Compare the performance of Node2Vec and GraphSAGE on a sample of the MSKG to determine the best graph embedding method for the specific characteristics of the manufacturing data.
  3. Test the integration of the MSKG with ChatGPT on a set of simple queries to assess the improvement in response accuracy and completeness compared to standalone ChatGPT.
