## Quick Facts

- Presents a framework for repairing ontology networks using weakening and completing operations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for repairing networks of $\mathcal{EL_\perp}$ ontologies by combining basic operations like debugging, weakening, and completing. The framework uses combination operators that allow users to choose between different autonomy levels of ontologies and alignments, as well as different operation sequences. The approach aims to remove unwanted axioms while preserving correct knowledge, providing a flexible blueprint that can extend previous work and systems using existing algorithms for basic operations.

## Method Summary
The framework operates on ontology networks by applying combination operators that integrate basic repair operations (debugging, weakening, completing) in various sequences and configurations. These operators reflect choices about autonomy levels - whether ontologies or alignments should be treated as independent or interdependent during repair. The system materializes intermediate results to evaluate repair quality through validation work measurements, allowing users to select different repair strategies based on their specific requirements.

## Key Results
- Framework successfully repairs ontology networks by combining basic operations through flexible combination operators
- Validation work ranges from 6% to 40% higher for materialized versions compared to non-materialized ones
- Experiments on 5 ontology networks demonstrate the influence of combination operators on repair quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing ontology network repair into manageable components - basic operations that handle specific repair tasks. By providing combination operators that orchestrate these operations, the framework can adapt to different repair scenarios while maintaining consistency across the network. The materialized approach allows for intermediate validation, enabling better quality control and user-directed repair strategies.

## Foundational Learning
- **Combination operators**: Why needed - to integrate multiple repair operations into coherent strategies; Quick check - can different autonomy configurations be expressed through these operators?
- **Materialization**: Why needed - to enable intermediate validation and quality assessment; Quick check - does materialization significantly improve repair outcomes?
- **Autonomy levels**: Why needed - to reflect real-world requirements where ontologies may have different independence constraints; Quick check - can the framework handle varying degrees of ontology interdependence?

## Architecture Onboarding
The framework consists of basic repair operations (debugging, weakening, completing) as atomic components, combination operators that sequence and configure these operations, and a validation module that measures repair quality. The critical path flows from input network through selected combination operator to output repaired network, with materialization points for validation. Design tradeoffs include flexibility versus complexity - more combination options provide better adaptation but increase user decision burden. Failure signatures include inconsistent repairs when autonomy levels are mismatched with network structure. Three first experiments: 1) Compare different autonomy configurations on a simple network, 2) Test materialization impact on validation metrics, 3) Evaluate repair quality across networks with varying complexity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Only 5 ontology networks used in experiments, limiting generalizability
- No empirical evidence about which combination operators perform best in specific scenarios
- Assumes basic operations are available as black boxes, limiting reproducibility

## Confidence
- High: Framework structure and combination operators are well-defined
- Medium: Experimental results show measurable differences between approaches
- Low: Claims about practical applicability and extension potential

## Next Checks
1. Conduct larger-scale experiments with diverse ontology networks to validate generalizability
2. Perform statistical analysis on the 6-40% validation work difference to determine significance
3. Implement the framework with at least one existing ontology repair system to test the "blueprint" claim
