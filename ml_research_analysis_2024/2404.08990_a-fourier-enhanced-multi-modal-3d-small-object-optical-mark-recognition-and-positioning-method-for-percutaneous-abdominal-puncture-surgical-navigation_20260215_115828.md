# A Fourier-enhanced multi-modal 3D small object optical mark recognition and positioning method for percutaneous abdominal puncture surgical navigation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08990
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08990
- Reference count: 0
- This paper proposes a method that improves positioning accuracy from 0.973682037 mm to 0.133580156 mm standard deviation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of high-precision positioning of small medical markers (24mm diameter hollow rings) in thoracoabdominal puncture surgery. The proposed method combines Fourier transform enhancement, single-step object detection, and point cloud refinement to achieve improved accuracy. By leveraging frequency domain processing to enhance small object features, multi-modal fusion of 2D and depth information, and geometric cone fitting for point cloud refinement, the method demonstrates significant improvements in positioning accuracy and stability for surgical navigation applications.

## Method Summary
The method employs a multi-stage pipeline: first, 2D images are enhanced using fast Fourier transform to emphasize high-frequency edge details; second, a YOLOv5-based object detection network trained on the enhanced dataset identifies the region of interest (ROI); third, the corresponding depth map region is extracted using the detected ROI mask; finally, the 3D point cloud is refined through cone fitting and Tukey loss-based registration to achieve precise positioning. The approach was validated on a dataset of 350 annotated 2D images and 330 multi-modal 3D point clouds collected under various laboratory and clinical conditions.

## Key Results
- Positioning accuracy improved from 0.973682037 mm to 0.133580156 mm standard deviation
- Multi-modal fusion approach combines enhanced 2D images with depth maps for complementary information
- Point cloud refinement using cone fitting and Tukey loss-based registration achieves high-precision positioning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) enhances small object features by converting spatial domain to frequency domain, allowing selective filtering to emphasize edges and details.
- Mechanism: FFT decomposes the image into frequency components. Gaussian filters with different sigma values are applied to create a difference image that highlights high-frequency details (edges, contours) while suppressing low-frequency noise.
- Core assumption: Small medical markers have distinct high-frequency edge information that can be isolated and enhanced through frequency domain processing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "leverages Fourier transform enhancement technology to augment the dataset, enrich image details, and enhance the network's capability"
  - [section]: "Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a An algorithm in digital signal processing changes in the frequency domain: Fourier transform splits the signal in the spatial domain into signals in different frequency bands"
- Break condition: If the marker lacks sufficient high-frequency content (e.g., uniform texture), FFT enhancement provides minimal benefit.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-modal fusion of enhanced 2D images and depth maps provides complementary information that improves small object detection accuracy.
- Mechanism: Enhanced 2D images provide better feature extraction for ROI detection, while depth maps provide 3D spatial information for point cloud generation and refinement.
- Core assumption: The ROI detected in 2D space maps accurately to the corresponding region in the depth map, and combining both modalities captures information that either alone would miss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "multi-modal 3D small object medical marker detection method"
  - [section]: "A high-quality dataset is the foundation... we collected and created a diverse range of real-shot data under laboratory and hospital CT room environments, featuring various angles and simulated situations"
- Break condition: Misalignment between 2D ROI and depth map regions due to calibration errors or camera perspective distortion.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Point cloud refinement through cone fitting and Tukey loss-based registration achieves high-precision positioning by optimizing the geometric model of the marker.
- Mechanism: The marker's ring shape is modeled as a cone in 3D space. RANSAC fitting extracts the cone parameters, while Tukey loss registration provides robust alignment that is less sensitive to outliers.
- Core assumption: The marker's geometry can be accurately represented by a cone model, and the point cloud contains sufficient points to enable reliable fitting and registration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "refines the point cloud using cone fitting and Tukey loss-based registration"
  - [section]: "Since the mark is a donut shape, it is connected to the environment to form a cone. Therefore, the shape of the point cloud can be relatively ideal using the cone fitting."
- Break condition: Insufficient point density in the ROI point cloud or significant environmental interference that prevents accurate cone modeling.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fast Fourier Transform and frequency domain processing
  - Why needed here: FFT is used to enhance small object features by emphasizing high-frequency edges and details that are often lost in small objects
  - Quick check question: What happens to the FFT spectrum when you apply a high-pass filter?

- Concept: Point cloud processing and geometric fitting
  - Why needed here: Point clouds provide 3D spatial information that enables precise positioning, and geometric fitting (cone fitting) models the marker's shape for accurate localization
  - Quick check question: How does RANSAC handle outliers during geometric fitting?

- Concept: Multi-modal data fusion
  - Why needed here: Combining enhanced 2D images with depth maps leverages the strengths of both modalities for improved detection and positioning
  - Quick check question: What calibration steps are needed to ensure accurate mapping between 2D ROI and depth map regions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image acquisition → FFT enhancement → Multi-modal dataset creation → YOLOv5 detection → ROI masking → Depth map cropping → Point cloud conversion → Cone fitting → Tukey loss registration → Final positioning
- Critical path: The detection accuracy depends critically on the quality of the enhanced 2D images and the accuracy of the ROI-to-depth map mapping
- Design tradeoffs: Higher FFT enhancement may introduce artifacts; more complex point cloud processing increases accuracy but also computation time
- Failure signatures: Detection failures indicate issues with 2D image quality or network training; poor positioning indicates problems with depth map mapping or point cloud refinement
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test FFT enhancement on sample images with and without markers to verify edge enhancement effectiveness
  2. Validate ROI detection accuracy on enhanced vs. original images using ground truth annotations
  3. Measure point cloud fitting accuracy on synthetic marker point clouds with varying levels of noise

- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on a specific 24mm ring marker, but mentions potential applications to other surgical scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested on one marker type and size, leaving performance on variations unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the method on markers of various sizes, shapes, and materials in different surgical contexts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between acquisition speed and positioning accuracy in different surgical scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses trade-offs between different camera modes (static vs dynamic) affecting speed and accuracy.
- Why unresolved: While trade-offs are mentioned, optimal settings for different surgical contexts are not determined.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of positioning accuracy and acquisition time across various camera settings in different surgical scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the method to different lighting conditions and environmental interference in real surgical settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions testing in different lighting conditions (130-750LX) but doesn't comprehensively evaluate environmental robustness.
- Why unresolved: The study provides limited information on performance under varying environmental conditions common in operating rooms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive testing across a wider range of lighting conditions, with various potential environmental interferences present.

## Limitations

- Dataset Generalization: Limited dataset size (350 2D images, 330 3D point clouds) may affect generalization across different clinical settings
- Computational Overhead: Multi-stage processing pipeline increases complexity, though runtime metrics are not provided
- Model Dependency: Heavy reliance on YOLOv5 performance and cone fitting assumptions may lead to degradation in adverse conditions

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The mechanism of FFT frequency domain enhancement for edge detection (Mechanism 1) is well-established in signal processing literature.
- Medium Confidence: The multi-modal fusion approach (Mechanism 2) shows promise but requires validation on larger, more diverse datasets.
- Medium Confidence: The cone fitting and Tukey loss registration (Mechanism 3) provides theoretical advantages but implementation-specific details affect real-world performance.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-Validation on Independent Datasets: Test the complete pipeline on independently acquired datasets from different clinical environments to assess generalization performance and identify failure conditions.

2. Computational Performance Benchmarking: Measure end-to-end processing time for the complete pipeline (enhancement, detection, refinement) and evaluate whether it meets real-time surgical navigation requirements (typically <100ms per frame).

3. Robustness Testing Under Adverse Conditions: Systematically evaluate performance degradation when markers are partially occluded, viewed at extreme angles (>60°), or in presence of strong environmental reflections that could interfere with structured light depth sensing.
