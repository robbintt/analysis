# Rethinking Skill Extraction in the Job Market Domain using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.03832
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03832

- LLMs achieve lower performance than supervised models for skill extraction, but handle complex skill mentions better

## Executive Summary
This paper benchmarks six datasets for skill extraction in job postings using large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning. The authors propose two prompting strategies—EXTRACTION-STYLE and NER-STYLE—to adapt LLMs for skill extraction and implement a feedback loop for post-processing. While LLMs underperform compared to supervised models, they demonstrate superior handling of complex skill mentions such as conjoined skills. The study provides insights into the challenges of adapting named entity recognition tasks to generative LLMs and highlights limitations in current skill extraction approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates six skill extraction datasets using LLMs with in-context learning. Two prompting strategies are proposed: EXTRACTION-STYLE, which frames skill extraction as a direct extraction task, and NER-STYLE, which adapts traditional named entity recognition prompts for LLMs. A feedback loop is implemented for post-processing to refine extracted skills. The study compares LLM performance against supervised models and conducts error analysis to identify limitations in skill definitions, conjoined skills, and span extraction.

## Key Results
- EXTRACTION-STYLE prompting outperforms NER-STYLE on average across datasets
- kNN-retrieval of demonstrations improves extraction performance
- LLMs handle complex skill mentions (e.g., conjoined skills) better than supervised models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of the proposed methods stems from adapting LLMs' generative capabilities to the skill extraction task through carefully designed prompting strategies. The EXTRACTION-STYLE approach leverages LLMs' strength in direct text generation, while the feedback loop helps refine ambiguous extractions.

## Foundational Learning

1. **In-context learning**: Why needed - Enables LLMs to perform tasks without fine-tuning; Quick check - Verify model can handle few-shot examples correctly
2. **Skill extraction evaluation metrics**: Why needed - Provides standardized comparison across methods; Quick check - Ensure metric calculations match established definitions
3. **Conjoined skill recognition**: Why needed - Identifies complex skill mentions that require special handling; Quick check - Test on examples with explicit conjunctions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Datasets -> Prompting Strategies (EXTRACTION-STYLE, NER-STYLE) -> LLM Models -> Evaluation Metrics -> Error Analysis

**Critical path**: Prompt design → In-context demonstration retrieval → LLM inference → Post-processing feedback loop → Evaluation

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Generative vs extractive approaches
- Few-shot learning vs parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- Post-processing complexity vs raw model performance

**Failure signatures**: 
- Incorrect skill boundaries
- Missed conjoined skills
- Ambiguous skill definitions
- Retrieval failures for demonstrations

**First experiments**:
1. Compare EXTRACTION-STYLE vs NER-STYLE on a single dataset
2. Test kNN-retrieval impact on demonstration quality
3. Evaluate feedback loop effectiveness on error reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to English datasets, restricting generalizability
- Small sample size in error analysis may not represent all error types
- Feedback loop concept lacks empirical validation of effectiveness

## Confidence
- High confidence: EXTRACTION-STYLE outperforms NER-STYLE
- Medium confidence: LLMs handle complex skill mentions better
- Low confidence: Limitations in skill definitions and span extraction

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate prompting strategies and feedback loop on multilingual and domain-specific datasets
2. Conduct systematic error analysis on larger sample to identify common error types
3. Compare computational efficiency and latency between LLM-based and supervised approaches
