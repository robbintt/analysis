# Discerning and Characterising Types of Competency Questions for Ontologies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.13688
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13688
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: Introduces a formal model categorizing competency questions into five distinct types (SCQ, VCQ, FCQ, RCQ, MpCQ) with a repository of 438 annotated examples

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the lack of systematic guidance in formulating and assessing competency questions (CQs) for ontology development. The authors introduce the Question Ontology (QuO) model that categorizes CQs into five distinct types based on their purposes and structural characteristics. Each type serves specific functions in ontology development, from scoping and validation to foundational alignment and metaproperty checking. The model is demonstrated through a coffee ontology use case and integrated into the NeOn methodology. To support research and practice, the authors created ROCQS, a FAIR-compliant repository containing 438 annotated CQs.

## Method Summary
The authors analyzed questions, their uses, and ontology development tasks to derive a formal model for competency questions. They identified five CQ types through systematic analysis of question purposes and constituent elements, then formalized these types using logical notation. The model was illustrated with a user story involving coffee ontology development and integrated into the NeOn methodology. A repository of 438 annotated CQs was created following FAIR principles to enable research and practice.

## Key Results
- Five distinct CQ types identified: Scoping (SCQ), Validating (VCQ), Foundational (FCQ), Relationship (RCQ), and Metaproperty (MpCQ)
- Formal logical definitions provided for each CQ type with identifiable constituent elements
- ROCQS repository created containing 438 annotated CQs categorized by type
- Integration demonstrated with NeOn methodology showing where each CQ type applies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The formal categorization of CQs into five distinct types addresses the systematic guidance problem by providing clear structural and purposeful distinctions. By defining each CQ type with specific purposes and constituent elements, ontology engineers can better formulate, assess, and apply CQs at appropriate stages of development.

Core assumption: Different ontology development tasks require fundamentally different types of CQs, and these differences are meaningful enough to warrant separate categorization.

### Mechanism 2
The Repository of Ontology Competency QuestionS (ROCQS) with 438 annotated CQs provides a FAIR-compliant foundation for research and practice that enables reuse and further analysis. By making CQs findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, ROCQS creates a shared resource that accelerates research and reduces duplication of effort.

Core assumption: A centralized, well-structured repository of CQs will be actively used by the ontology engineering community and will facilitate knowledge transfer.

### Mechanism 3
The integration of CQ types into the NeOn methodology provides a practical framework for applying the theoretical model to real ontology development processes. By mapping specific CQ types to methodology stages and tasks, the model becomes actionable rather than purely theoretical.

Core assumption: The NeOn methodology is widely used or at least representative enough that integration into it will provide practical value to many ontology engineers.

## Foundational Learning

- **Formal semantics and logical formalization of questions**: The paper relies heavily on formal definitions of CQ types using logical notation. Quick check: Can you explain what the formal expression ∀x(FCQ(x) → ∃y,z(ref erent(x,y,z) ∧ FoundOnto(y) ∧ Element(z) ∧ (containsVocab(y,z)∨∃w(containsVocab(y,w)∧hasProperty(w,z))))) means in plain English?

- **Ontology development methodologies (specifically NeOn)**: The paper maps CQ types to stages in the NeOn methodology, requiring understanding of how ontology development processes work. Quick check: What are the key stages in the NeOn methodology, and how might different CQ types be applied at each stage?

- **Foundational ontologies and their role in domain ontology alignment**: Foundational CQs (FCQs) are specifically designed for aligning domain entities to foundational ontology entities, which requires understanding of what foundational ontologies are and how alignment works. Quick check: What is the difference between a domain ontology and a foundational ontology, and why is alignment between them important?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: The system consists of three main components: (1) the formal QuO model defining five CQ types with their structural properties, (2) the ROCQS repository containing 438 annotated CQs categorized by type, and (3) integration examples showing how CQ types map to ontology development methodologies like NeOn.

- **Critical path**: The development workflow follows this sequence: (1) identify the ontology development task or stage, (2) determine which CQ types are relevant for that task, (3) consult ROCQS for examples or templates, (4) formulate specific CQs using the structural guidelines for the relevant type, (5) apply CQs for scoping, validation, or other purposes, and (6) iterate based on answers.

- **Design tradeoffs**: The model trades completeness for practicality - it identifies five main CQ types but acknowledges more may exist. The formal logical definitions provide precision but may be harder to understand for non-experts compared to the EER notation and controlled natural language approaches.

- **Failure signatures**: Common failure modes include: (1) using the wrong CQ type for a given task, (2) formulating CQs that are too ambiguous or imprecise to be answerable, (3) attempting to formalize CQs beyond the expressiveness of the target ontology language, (4) failing to align CQs with the actual development methodology being used, and (5) not properly distinguishing between domain-level and ontological-level CQs.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Take a simple domain ontology (like the African Wildlife Ontology) and formulate one example of each CQ type following the structural guidelines provided in the paper.
  2. Select a real ontology development project and map its current development stage to the appropriate CQ types using the NeOn methodology mapping provided.
  3. Browse the ROCQS repository and attempt to categorize 10 randomly selected CQs by type, then verify your categorization against the repository's annotations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can automated generation and evaluation of Foundational Competency Questions (FCQs) be effectively implemented to improve alignment between domain and foundational ontologies? The paper notes that existing methods like CLaRO are derived from domain ontologies and may not be suitable for FCQs, and that the complexity of aligning entities across different ontological frameworks presents challenges for automation.

### Open Question 2
What is the relative impact of different types of Competency Questions (CQs) on ontology quality and usability across various ontology development methodologies? While the paper demonstrates the existence and use of different CQ types, it does not provide empirical data comparing their effectiveness in improving ontology quality or development efficiency.

### Open Question 3
How can the Repository of Ontology Competency QuestionS (ROCQS) be expanded and structured to support dynamic updates and community contributions while maintaining FAIR principles? The paper outlines future plans for ROCQS but does not provide details on implementation, governance, or quality control mechanisms for community contributions.

## Limitations

- The five CQ types represent a pragmatic categorization rather than an exhaustive taxonomy and may not capture all possible CQ variations
- The ROCQS repository, while substantial at 438 annotated CQs, represents a specific selection of ontologies and domains that may not be fully representative of all ontology development contexts
- The integration with NeOn methodology demonstrates practical application but may not generalize to other ontology development approaches or methodologies

## Confidence

- **High**: The identification of distinct CQ purposes (scoping, validating, foundational alignment, relationship querying, metaproperty checking) is well-supported by the logical definitions and examples provided
- **Medium**: The formal logical definitions for each CQ type are precise but may be challenging to apply in practice without additional guidance or tooling
- **Medium**: The FAIR compliance of ROCQS follows established principles, but actual usability and adoption by the community remains to be demonstrated

## Next Checks

1. Apply the QuO model to a real ontology development project outside the coffee domain and document which CQ types are most useful at different stages, comparing the results to the NeOn methodology mapping.

2. Have ontology engineers unfamiliar with the model attempt to formulate CQs for a specific domain using ROCQS as a reference, then evaluate the quality and appropriateness of their resulting CQs.

3. Test whether the five CQ types map effectively to at least two other popular ontology development methodologies beyond NeOn, documenting any gaps or mismatches in the mapping.
