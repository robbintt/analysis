# SC2: Towards Enhancing Content Preservation and Style Consistency in Long Text Style Transfer

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.04578
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04578
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Primary result**: Achieves 28.6% document-level style transfer accuracy and 51.4% geometric mean of style transfer accuracy and BertScore F1 for Chinese long text style transfer tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of long text style transfer, aiming to preserve semantic content while varying style across multiple sentences. The proposed SC2 method introduces a multilayer Joint Style-Content Weigher (JSCW) module that simultaneously evaluates style and content attributes within tokens to learn lossless content representations. Additionally, a Style Consistency loss ensures generated sentences maintain consistent target style polarity. The method also incorporates a denoising non-autoregressive decoder to accelerate training. Experiments on Chinese and English datasets show significant improvements over competitive baselines, with SC2 achieving state-of-the-art results in both content preservation and style consistency.

## Method Summary
The SC2 method employs an encoder-decoder framework with a multilayer Joint Style-Content Weigher (JSCW) module that evaluates style and content attributes within tokens to learn lossless content representations. A Style Consistency loss is introduced to ensure generated sentences maintain consistent target style polarity across multiple sentences. The method also utilizes a denoising non-autoregressive decoder to accelerate training. The model is trained using style-oriented, content-oriented, NAR decoder-oriented, and disentanglement-oriented losses. The approach is evaluated on Chinese and English datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in both content preservation and style consistency compared to competitive baselines.

## Key Results
- Achieves 28.6% document-level style transfer accuracy for Chinese long text style transfer tasks
- Obtains 51.4% geometric mean of style transfer accuracy and BertScore F1 for Chinese datasets
- Demonstrates consistent improvements over competitive baselines in both Chinese and English experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The JSCW module works by simultaneously evaluating style and content attributes within tokens, allowing the model to learn lossless content representations that preserve semantic meaning while enabling style transfer. The Style Consistency loss function ensures that generated sentences maintain consistent target style polarity across multiple sentences, addressing the challenge of long text generation. The denoising non-autoregressive decoder accelerates training by allowing parallel generation of tokens, reducing the time complexity compared to autoregressive models. The combination of these components enables the model to effectively handle the complexities of long text style transfer, balancing content preservation with style variation.

## Foundational Learning

**Style-Content Weigher Module**
- Why needed: To simultaneously evaluate style and content attributes within tokens for learning lossless content representations
- Quick check: Verify that the module can effectively distinguish between style and content attributes in tokens

**Style Consistency Loss**
- Why needed: To ensure generated sentences maintain consistent target style polarity across multiple sentences
- Quick check: Confirm that the loss function effectively penalizes style inconsistencies in generated texts

**Denoising Non-Autoregressive Decoder**
- Why needed: To accelerate training by allowing parallel generation of tokens
- Quick check: Measure the reduction in training time compared to autoregressive models

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Text -> JSCW Module -> Style Fusion Module -> Encoder -> Decoder -> Output Text

**Critical Path**: The JSCW module is the critical component, as it enables the simultaneous evaluation of style and content attributes, which is essential for learning lossless content representations and achieving effective style transfer.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The use of a non-autoregressive decoder accelerates training but may sacrifice some generation quality compared to autoregressive models. The Style Consistency loss adds an additional training objective but improves the coherence of style transfer across long texts.

**Failure Signatures**: Inadequate content preservation due to improper evaluation of content attributes in multiple words, and inconsistent style across generated sentences due to challenges in maintaining style polarity.

**First Experiments**: 1) Evaluate the JSCW module's ability to distinguish between style and content attributes in tokens. 2) Test the Style Consistency loss function's effectiveness in maintaining style polarity across multiple sentences. 3) Compare the training speed and generation quality of the denoising non-autoregressive decoder against autoregressive models.
