# Fundamental Components of Deep Learning: A category-theoretic approach

## Quick Facts

- Develops category-theoretic framework using actegories and weighted optics to unify deep learning theory and practice

## Executive Summary
This thesis addresses the fundamental problem of deep learning's lack of unified mathematical foundation by developing a category-theoretic framework that models neural networks and their derivatives through parametric weighted optics. The work establishes a lens-theoretic axiomatization of differentiation that applies across both smooth and Boolean settings, providing a mathematical language for compositionally representing major architectures including feedforward, recurrent, graph, GAN, and Transformer layers. The framework unifies models, losses, learning rates, and optimizers into a closed parametric lens representing one complete update step, offering an end-to-end prescriptive approach to deep learning theory and practice.

## Method Summary
The thesis constructs a unified mathematical foundation for deep learning using category theory, specifically through actegories to model parameterization and weighted optics for bidirectionality. These components are combined into parametric weighted optics, a versatile construction that represents neural networks and their derivatives. The framework provides categorical models for major architectures and a compositional account of supervised learning where all learning components integrate into a single closed parametric lens. This approach enables automatic derivation of backpropagation rules from categorical specifications and establishes a uniform mathematical language for representing learning phenomena.

## Key Results
- Develops parametric weighted optics as a versatile construction representing neural networks and their derivatives
- Provides lens-theoretic axiomatization of differentiation covering both smooth and Boolean settings
- Creates compositional account of supervised learning integrating models, losses, learning rates, and optimizers into closed parametric lens

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging category theory's compositional nature to model the bidirectional flow of information in neural networks. Actegories capture how parameters transform inputs into outputs, while weighted optics handle the backward propagation of gradients. The parametric weighted optics construction unifies these aspects, allowing automatic derivation of differentiation rules and backpropagation algorithms from categorical specifications. This compositional approach ensures that complex architectures can be built from simpler components while maintaining mathematical rigor and consistency across different types of neural networks.

## Foundational Learning

**Category Theory**: Mathematical framework for studying abstract structures and relationships between them; needed to provide compositional language for neural network components; quick check: understand objects, morphisms, functors, and natural transformations.

**Actegories**: Categories with an action of a monoidal category; needed to model parameterization of neural networks; quick check: grasp how objects can be transformed by monoidal actions.

**Optics**: Bidirectional data accessors; needed to handle forward and backward propagation in neural networks; quick check: understand how lenses compose and transform bidirectional data flow.

**Weighted Optics**: Optics with additional structure for weighting transformations; needed to incorporate loss functions and gradient scaling; quick check: see how weights modify the bidirectional transformation.

**Parametric Weighted Optics**: Combination of parameterization and weighted optics; needed to unify model parameters with learning dynamics; quick check: verify how parameters and weights interact in the unified structure.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Category Theory Framework -> Actegories (Parameterization) -> Weighted Optics (Bidirectionality) -> Parametric Weighted Optics (Unified Model) -> Categorical Models (Architectures) -> Compositional Learning (Update Steps)

**Critical Path**: Define categorical structures -> Implement actegories for parameterization -> Build weighted optics for bidirectionality -> Combine into parametric weighted optics -> Apply to specific architectures -> Derive learning algorithms automatically

**Design Tradeoffs**: Theoretical elegance and unification vs. practical implementation complexity; broad applicability across architectures vs. potential oversimplification of specialized components; automatic differentiation derivation vs. computational efficiency considerations.

**Failure Signatures**: Framework may not capture architectures with non-standard control flows or non-differentiable operations; Boolean differentiation setting may lack empirical validation; certain emerging architectures might not fit neatly into categorical structures.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement feedforward neural network using parametric weighted optics and verify backpropagation derivation
2. Apply framework to recurrent neural network and compare categorical specification with traditional implementation
3. Test Boolean differentiation setting on binary neural network to assess practical utility
