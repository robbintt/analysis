# Finding Structure in Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.16433
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16433
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Language models encode abstract grammatical knowledge but this is bounded by training data and model design

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether language models acquire deep, abstract grammatical knowledge comparable to humans. Through a suite of interpretability techniques including structural priming paradigms, filtered corpus training, controlled synthetic grammar evaluation, and feature interaction detection, the research demonstrates that LMs exhibit behavioral signatures of structural knowledge and can generalize to unseen constructions. However, performance strongly correlates with training data statistics and varies across architectures, suggesting these representations are substantial but limited abstractions rather than universal linguistic competence.

## Method Summary
The study employs multiple interpretability approaches to probe LM representations of syntax. Structural priming paradigms test for abstract syntactic representations by measuring how exposure to one construction influences production of another. Filtered corpus training examines generalization from indirect evidence by controlling what constructions models observe during training. Controlled synthetic grammars provide clean evaluation environments where grammatical relationships are precisely defined. Feature interaction detection methods attempt to recover hierarchical structure from neural activations. These complementary techniques aim to triangulate whether LMs encode genuine abstract grammatical knowledge versus surface-level statistical patterns.

## Key Results
- Models show behavioral signatures of structural knowledge through structural priming effects in dative alternations
- LMs can generalize to unseen constructions without direct exposure, but performance correlates with training data statistics like adjective order frequency
- Synthetic PCFG experiments reveal significant differences in faithfulness among feature attribution methods, with results varying across architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's interpretability framework works by combining multiple complementary approaches that probe different aspects of syntactic knowledge. Structural priming provides behavioral evidence of abstract representations by showing systematic transfer between related constructions. Filtered training reveals whether models can induce rules from incomplete evidence, suggesting rule-like rather than purely memorized knowledge. Synthetic grammars offer controlled environments where grammatical relationships are precisely defined, allowing clean measurement of representational capacity. Feature interaction detection attempts to map neural activations back to hierarchical linguistic structures. Together, these methods provide converging evidence about the nature and limitations of syntactic representations in LMs.

## Foundational Learning

### Structural Priming
- Why needed: Tests whether models have abstract representations by measuring transfer effects between related constructions
- Quick check: Does exposure to one dative construction increase likelihood of producing another dative variant?

### Filtered Corpus Training
- Why needed: Determines whether models can generalize from indirect evidence rather than memorizing specific patterns
- Quick check: Can models produce grammatical constructions they never saw directly during training?

### Synthetic PCFGs
- Why needed: Provides controlled environment with precisely defined grammatical relationships for clean evaluation
- Quick check: Do attribution methods accurately recover known hierarchical structures in synthetic data?

### Feature Attribution Methods
- Why needed: Attempts to map neural activations back to interpretable linguistic features
- Quick check: How well do different attribution methods recover ground-truth feature importance?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input Text -> Encoder Layers -> Feature Attribution -> Interpretability Analysis -> Behavioral Evaluation

### Critical Path
The critical path flows from input text through encoder layers where syntactic representations are formed, to feature attribution methods that attempt to interpret these representations, ultimately leading to behavioral evaluations that test whether the interpreted features correspond to actual linguistic knowledge.

### Design Tradeoffs
The paper balances between interpretability (using techniques that provide clear linguistic interpretations) and faithfulness (ensuring methods accurately capture what models actually compute). Synthetic grammars offer interpretability but may not reflect real language complexity. Feature attribution provides detailed analysis but different methods yield varying results, raising questions about which best captures true representations.

### Failure Signatures
Strong correlations between performance and training data statistics suggest models may be exploiting statistical regularities rather than abstract rules. Variability across architectures indicates representations are not universal. Synthetic PCFG results showing method-dependent faithfulness reveal that attribution techniques may not reliably capture true feature importance.

### First 3 Experiments to Run
1. Conduct ablation studies systematically removing specific training data patterns
2. Compare model representations against human behavioral and neuroimaging data
3. Develop and validate novel interpretability techniques for direct visualization of hierarchical structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Interpretability methods provide indirect behavioral signatures rather than direct visualization of internal representations
- Strong correlation between performance and training data statistics suggests statistical pattern matching may explain apparent abstraction
- Variability across architectures and bounded generalization indicate representations are neither universal nor complete

## Confidence

**Major Claim Confidence Assessment:**

- **Abstract grammatical knowledge in LMs**: Medium confidence. Behavioral evidence is strong, but attribution to true abstraction versus statistical pattern matching remains contested.
- **Effectiveness of interpretability methods**: Medium confidence. Synthetic PCFG experiments show method-dependent results, highlighting sensitivity to evaluation approach.
- **Boundedness by training data and architecture**: High confidence. Empirical correlations and controlled experiments consistently demonstrate these limitations.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies systematically removing specific training data patterns to test whether apparent syntactic generalizations truly require abstract representations or can be explained by statistical shortcuts.
2. Compare model representations against human behavioral and neuroimaging data using identical syntactic paradigms to assess whether LMs capture the same underlying structures.
3. Develop and validate novel interpretability techniques that provide direct visualization of hierarchical structure rather than relying solely on indirect behavioral proxies.
