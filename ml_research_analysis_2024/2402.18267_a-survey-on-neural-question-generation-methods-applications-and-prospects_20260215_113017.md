# A Survey on Neural Question Generation: Methods, Applications, and Prospects

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.18267
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18267
- **Reference count**: 1
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey categorizing Neural Question Generation approaches into structured, unstructured, and hybrid types, analyzing neural network models, datasets, evaluation metrics, and future research directions.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of Neural Question Generation (NQG), a field focused on automatically generating questions from various input modalities such as knowledge bases, texts, and images using neural network techniques. The survey systematically categorizes NQG approaches into three main types: structured NQG (utilizing organized data sources), unstructured NQG (focusing on loosely structured inputs like texts or visual content), and hybrid NQG (drawing on diverse input modalities). It provides an in-depth analysis of the distinct neural network models tailored for each category, discussing their strengths and limitations.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically analyzes existing NQG approaches through literature review and categorization. It examines three main categories of NQG based on input modalities: structured (knowledge bases), unstructured (texts and images), and hybrid (multi-modal). For each category, the paper discusses relevant neural network architectures, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The methodology involves comprehensive analysis of existing research, identification of trends, and synthesis of findings across different NQG approaches.

## Key Results
- NQG can be effectively categorized into structured, unstructured, and hybrid approaches based on input modalities
- Pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance NQG performance through semantic knowledge transfer
- Automatic evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore) provide quantitative measures of question quality across n-gram similarity, diversity, and semantic similarity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Neural Question Generation (NQG) works by leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to generate questions from diverse input modalities.
- Mechanism: The models use encoder-decoder architectures to encode input data (knowledge bases, texts, images) and decode them into natural language questions, with PLMs/LLMs providing semantic richness through pre-training on large corpora.
- Core assumption: The semantic knowledge acquired during pre-training is transferable to the question generation task, and the models can effectively learn the mapping from input modalities to questions through fine-tuning or in-context learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The ascendance of pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as T5 and BART, represents a significant advancement. These models, pre-trained on extensive corpora, possess a wealth of semantic knowledge, which significantly enhances performance in various NLP tasks upon fine-tuning."
  - [section]: "With the continuous scaling of PLMs in terms of parameter size and training corpus volume, the field has witnessed the evolution of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Llama2. These models surpass PLMs in semantic richness, offering remarkable improvements across a wide array of NLP tasks."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers with average neighbor FMR=0.51, indicating moderate relatedness to the topic of neural question generation.
- Break condition: If the pre-training corpus lacks diversity or relevance to the target question generation domain, the transfer of semantic knowledge may be limited, leading to poor performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: NQG models can be categorized based on input modalities: structured, unstructured, and hybrid NQG.
- Mechanism: Each category employs different neural network architectures and techniques tailored to the specific input type. Structured NQG uses knowledge bases, unstructured NQG uses texts and images, and hybrid NQG combines multiple modalities.
- Core assumption: The input modality significantly influences the choice of neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the question generation process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The survey systematically categorizes NQG approaches into three main types: structured NQG (utilizing organized data sources), unstructured NQG (focusing on loosely structured inputs like texts or visual content), and hybrid NQG (drawing on diverse input modalities)."
  - [section]: "Structured NQG is designed to create pertinent questions based on structured data sources. Within these, the knowledge base stands out as the most typical data source. This section primarily focuses on knowledge base question generation (KBQG)."
  - [corpus]: The corpus includes papers on document parsing and knowledge-oriented retrieval-augmented generation, supporting the relevance of categorizing NQG based on input modalities.
- Break condition: If the input modality is not clearly defined or if the model architecture is not well-suited for the specific modality, the question generation quality may suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The effectiveness of NQG models is evaluated using automatic metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore.
- Mechanism: These metrics assess the n-gram similarity, diversity, and semantic similarity between the generated questions and ground-truth questions, providing quantitative measures of question quality.
- Core assumption: The automatic metrics are reliable indicators of question quality and can effectively compare different NQG models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We present automatic metrics across three categories, including n-grams-based, diversity, and semantic similarity metrics."
  - [section]: "N-gram-based Metrics. We showcase three classical evaluation metrics that assess the n-gram similarity between the ground-truth and the generated questions."
  - [corpus]: The corpus includes papers on adversarial training and graph condensation, which may have relevance to the evaluation of NQG models using automatic metrics.
- Break condition: If the ground-truth questions are not diverse or if the automatic metrics do not capture the nuances of question quality, the evaluation results may not accurately reflect the model's performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Encoder-decoder architectures
  - Why needed here: NQG models rely on encoder-decoder architectures to encode input data and decode them into questions. Understanding these architectures is crucial for implementing and improving NQG models.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the encoder and decoder in an encoder-decoder architecture?

- Concept: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs)
  - Why needed here: PLMs and LLMs provide the semantic richness necessary for effective question generation. Familiarity with these models is essential for leveraging their capabilities in NQG.
  - Quick check question: How do PLMs and LLMs differ in terms of their pre-training and fine-tuning processes?

- Concept: Input modalities (structured, unstructured, hybrid)
  - Why needed here: NQG models are categorized based on input modalities, and each category requires different approaches and architectures. Understanding these modalities is key to developing effective NQG solutions.
  - Quick check question: What are the characteristics of structured, unstructured, and hybrid input modalities in the context of NQG?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer -> Encoder -> Decoder -> PLM/LLM backbone -> Evaluation module
- Critical path: 1. Input data preprocessing and encoding, 2. Latent representation learning using encoder, 3. Question generation using decoder, 4. Evaluation and refinement of generated questions
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Complexity vs. interpretability: More complex architectures may yield better performance but can be harder to interpret and debug
  - Pre-training vs. fine-tuning: Extensive pre-training can provide better semantic understanding but may require more computational resources
  - Single-modal vs. multi-modal: Multi-modal approaches can handle diverse inputs but may be more challenging to implement and train
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor question quality: May indicate issues with input encoding, latent representation learning, or question generation
  - Overfitting: May occur if the model is too complex or if the training data is limited
  - Semantic drift: May happen if the model generates questions that are semantically different from the ground-truth questions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic NQG model using a simple encoder-decoder architecture and evaluate its performance on a small dataset
  2. Experiment with different pre-trained language models (e.g., T5, BART) and compare their effectiveness in generating questions
  3. Investigate the impact of input modality on question generation quality by training separate models for structured, unstructured, and hybrid inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What evidence would resolve it: Research papers presenting novel approaches for integrating VL-PTMs into multi-modal question generation models, along with evaluations of their performance compared to traditional methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can subjective human factors such as sentiment and style be effectively incorporated into question generation models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that certain studies overlook subjective human factors in question generation, focusing instead on the influence of the input and the target answer.
- Why unresolved: The impact of subjective human factors on question generation is not well understood, and there is a lack of research on how to model and incorporate these factors into question generation models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies that investigate the relationship between subjective human factors and question generation, along with the development and evaluation of models that can effectively incorporate these factors.

## Limitations
- The survey relies heavily on automatic metrics for evaluation, which may not fully capture question quality aspects like answerability or semantic relevance
- While the paper extensively discusses the potential of PLMs and LLMs for NQG, it doesn't provide empirical comparisons showing how much these models actually improve over traditional encoder-decoder architectures
- The categorization of NQG into structured, unstructured, and hybrid modalities is conceptually clear but lacks discussion of edge cases where inputs don't fit neatly into these categories

## Confidence
- High confidence: The systematic categorization of NQG approaches and identification of major research directions
- Medium confidence: Claims about the effectiveness of PLMs/LLMs and the reliability of automatic evaluation metrics
- Medium confidence: The proposed taxonomy of NQG types based on input modalities

## Next Checks
1. Implement a controlled experiment comparing traditional Seq2Seq models with PLM-based approaches on the same NQG task to quantify the actual performance gains
2. Conduct a human evaluation study alongside automatic metrics to validate whether BLEU/ROUGE scores correlate with question quality as perceived by humans
3. Test the proposed categorization scheme on a diverse set of real-world NQG datasets to identify cases where the structured/unstructured/hybrid distinction breaks down
