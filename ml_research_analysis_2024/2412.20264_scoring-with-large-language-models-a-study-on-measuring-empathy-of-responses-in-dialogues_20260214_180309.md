# Scoring with Large Language Models: A Study on Measuring Empathy of Responses in Dialogues

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.20264
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20264
- Authors: Henry J. Xie; Jinghan Zhang; Xinhao Zhang; Kunpeng Liu
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: LLMs can score empathy in dialogues using interpretable, explicit features, achieving performance comparable to fine-tuned models.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluate empathy in dialogues, focusing on motivational interviewing contexts. The authors introduce a novel framework that approximates LLM empathy scoring using interpretable features, aiming to enhance transparency in social science applications. By leveraging dialogue embeddings, the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Code, and 15 explicit subfactors of empathy, the study demonstrates that classifiers using these features can match the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. This approach provides a more transparent and interpretable method for empathy scoring, addressing the black-box nature of traditional LLM-based evaluations.

## Method Summary
The study employs a novel framework to evaluate and explain LLM empathy scoring by approximating their performance with explicit, interpretable features. The authors trained classifiers using three main components: dialogue embeddings, the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Code, and 15 explicit subfactors of empathy derived from three dimensions of empathy. The classifiers were optimized via feature selection to enhance interpretability. The framework was tested on motivational interviewing dialogues, comparing the performance of classifiers using only embeddings, the MITI Code combined with subfactors, and fine-tuned LLMs. The results showed that the explicit feature-based approach achieved comparable accuracy to fine-tuned LLMs, providing a transparent alternative for empathy scoring.

## Key Results
- Classifiers using only dialogue embeddings achieved accuracy close to generic LLMs.
- Classifiers using the MITI Code combined with explicit subfactors, optimized via feature selection, matched the performance of fine-tuned LLMs.
- The study provides a transparent and interpretable approach to empathy scoring in social science applications.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed framework works by approximating LLM empathy scoring with interpretable features, such as the MITI Code and explicit subfactors of empathy. By training classifiers on these features, the model can capture the nuanced aspects of empathetic responses in dialogues. The use of feature selection further optimizes the performance, ensuring that the most relevant factors are prioritized. This approach reduces the reliance on the black-box nature of LLMs, providing a more transparent and interpretable method for empathy scoring.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Dialogue Embeddings**: Representations of dialogues that capture semantic and contextual information. *Why needed*: To provide a baseline for LLM performance. *Quick check*: Compare embedding-based classifiers with LLM-based scorers.
2. **Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Code**: A standardized coding system for evaluating motivational interviewing skills. *Why needed*: To provide a structured framework for empathy assessment. *Quick check*: Validate MITI-based features against human-coded empathy scores.
3. **Explicit Subfactors of Empathy**: 15 subfactors derived from three dimensions of empathy. *Why needed*: To capture nuanced aspects of empathetic responses. *Quick check*: Perform ablation studies to assess the impact of individual subfactors.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Dialogue Embeddings + MITI Code + Explicit Subfactors -> Feature Selection -> Classifier -> Empathy Score

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves training classifiers on the combined features (dialogue embeddings, MITI Code, and subfactors) and optimizing them via feature selection to achieve performance comparable to fine-tuned LLMs.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The tradeoff involves balancing interpretability and performance. Using explicit features enhances transparency but may limit the model's ability to capture complex patterns compared to fine-tuned LLMs.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include overfitting to the specific dataset, missing nuanced empathetic responses, and limited generalizability to other conversational contexts.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test the framework on diverse dialogue datasets outside motivational interviewing to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the relative importance of each explicit subfactor in empathy scoring.
3. Evaluate the model's performance across different cultural or demographic groups to identify potential biases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The performance claims rely on comparisons across different evaluation setups, introducing uncertainty about the true upper bounds of the proposed approach.
- The study focuses on empathy scoring in motivational interviewing dialogues, which may limit generalizability to other conversational contexts or domains.
- The selection and weighting of features may not capture all nuances of empathetic responses, particularly in more complex or culturally diverse dialogues.

## Confidence
- High: The methodological contribution of using interpretable features for empathy scoring is clearly demonstrated.
- Medium: The results are promising but contingent on the specific dataset and evaluation metrics used.
- Low: The generalizability of the findings beyond the studied domain is uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on diverse dialogue datasets outside motivational interviewing to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the relative importance of each explicit subfactor in empathy scoring.
3. Evaluate the model's performance across different cultural or demographic groups to identify potential biases.
