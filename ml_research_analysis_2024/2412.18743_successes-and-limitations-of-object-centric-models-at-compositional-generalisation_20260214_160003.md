core_contribution: This paper investigates compositional generalization in object-centric
  models, focusing on their ability to combine object properties (like shape and color)
  in novel ways. The authors hypothesize that object-centric models like Slot Attention
  (SA) may overcome limitations of disentangled models in combinatorial generalization
  by segmenting images into objects and parts.

# Successes and Limitations of Object-centric Models at Compositional Generalisation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.18743
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18743
- Authors: Milton L. Montero; Jeffrey S. Bowers; Gaurav Malhotra
- Reference count: 14
- Key outcome: Object-centric models like FgSeg achieve strong compositional generalization on novel shape-rotation combinations (P-MSE of 2.15 vs 10.55 for WAE) but learn representations tied to low-level features rather than abstract concepts

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates compositional generalization in object-centric models, specifically testing whether Slot Attention (SA) and a simplified Figure-Ground Segmentation (FgSeg) model can combine object properties in novel ways not seen during training. The authors find that while SA succeeds at combining novel shape-color pairs, it struggles with novel shape-rotation combinations due to missing local features. To address this limitation, they create a Pentomino dataset where all low-level features are present across shapes. Their simplified FgSeg model achieves superior performance on novel shape-rotation combinations and even extrapolates to completely new shapes, though probing reveals the learned representations are not highly abstract and rely on specific image-level features rather than truly compositional understanding.

## Method Summary
The authors test compositional generalization by training object-centric models on datasets where certain combinations of properties (like shape-color or shape-rotation) are held out during training. They use Slot Attention as a baseline object-centric model and develop a simplified Figure-Ground Segmentation (FgSeg) model that segments images into objects and parts. The models are tested on dSprites and 3DShapes datasets initially, then on a custom Pentomino dataset designed to preserve all local features across shapes. Reconstruction accuracy on held-out combinations serves as the primary metric, with probing tasks using linear classifiers to assess the abstractness of learned representations. The FgSeg architecture simplifies the segmentation process while maintaining the core object-centric approach.

## Key Results
- FgSeg achieves P-MSE of 2.15 on novel shape-rotation combinations compared to 10.55 for WAE baseline
- FgSeg successfully extrapolates to three completely new shapes with P-MSE of 2.63
- Linear classifiers fail to predict shapes from test data, indicating learned representations are not highly abstract
- SA succeeds on novel shape-color combinations but fails on shape-rotation due to missing local features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The object-centric approach works by segmenting images into distinct objects and parts, allowing the model to learn compositional representations where properties can be recombined independently. This contrasts with disentangled models that struggle to combine independently learned properties. The key mechanism is that object-centric models preserve local features (lines, angles) across different objects, enabling them to generalize to novel combinations when these features are present in the training data. However, the models appear to learn representations that are still tied to specific image-level features rather than truly abstract concepts, as evidenced by the failure of linear probes to extract shape information from test representations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Compositional Generalization**: The ability to combine learned concepts in novel ways not seen during training. Why needed: Central to human-like learning and reasoning, allowing models to handle infinite combinations from finite examples. Quick check: Can the model reconstruct objects with properties combined in ways absent from training data?
- **Object-centric Representation**: Models that explicitly segment and represent individual objects rather than treating images as undifferentiated wholes. Why needed: Enables modular manipulation of object properties and better handling of occlusion and viewpoint changes. Quick check: Does the model produce distinct representations for different objects in the same scene?
- **Disentangled Representations**: Representations where different factors of variation (e.g., color, shape, position) are encoded separately. Why needed: Allows independent manipulation of different properties and better generalization. Quick check: Can changing one property (like color) be done without affecting others in the representation?
- **Representation Abstractness**: How far representations have moved from low-level pixel features to high-level conceptual understanding. Why needed: More abstract representations enable better transfer and generalization across different visual domains. Quick check: Can simple linear classifiers extract meaningful concepts from the representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Image -> Encoder -> Slot Attention/FgSeg Segmentation -> Object Representations -> Decoder -> Reconstructed Image

### Critical Path
The critical path for compositional generalization flows through: Encoder captures visual features → Slot Attention/FgSeg segments objects → Object representations encode compositional properties → Decoder reconstructs novel combinations. The segmentation step is crucial as it determines whether local features are preserved for recombination.

### Design Tradeoffs
The simplified FgSeg architecture trades some segmentation complexity for better preservation of local features compared to full Slot Attention. This tradeoff enables better compositional generalization on shape-rotation tasks but may sacrifice some capability on more complex scenes with occlusion or clutter. The choice between preserving local features versus learning more abstract representations represents a fundamental tension in designing object-centric models.

### Failure Signatures
Models fail when local features required for novel combinations are absent from training data (as with SA on shape-rotation). Failure also occurs when representations remain too tied to specific image-level features rather than becoming truly compositional. Linear probe failures indicate representations haven't achieved the desired level of abstraction, while high reconstruction error on held-out combinations indicates poor compositional generalization.

### 3 First Experiments
1. Train FgSeg on Pentomino with shape-color combinations held out, then test reconstruction of novel color-shape pairs
2. Remove specific local features (like certain angles or line orientations) from training shapes and test if models can still generalize to novel combinations
3. Apply the same FgSeg architecture to a natural image dataset with multiple object categories to assess real-world applicability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several emerge from the results. The most significant is whether object-centric models can develop truly abstract representations that generalize beyond the specific visual features they were trained on. The failure of linear classifiers to extract shape information suggests the representations remain tied to image-level features. Additionally, the paper raises questions about how these models would perform with more diverse object categories, in three-dimensional scenes, or when required to perform higher-level reasoning tasks beyond simple reconstruction.

## Limitations
- The Pentomino dataset, while carefully designed, is still highly simplified compared to real-world visual scenes with natural complexity and clutter
- The evaluation relies primarily on reconstruction accuracy, which may not fully capture whether models have learned truly compositional understanding
- The probing methodology using linear classifiers may be too simplistic to detect more nuanced forms of abstract representation
- The study focuses on synthetic datasets and doesn't test performance on natural images with multiple object categories and complex backgrounds

## Confidence

### High confidence
- FgSeg's quantitative performance advantage on Pentomino dataset (P-MSE measurements of 2.15 vs 10.55 for WAE)

### Medium confidence
- The hypothesis that local feature preservation enables compositional generalization

### Low confidence
- Claims about the abstractness of learned representations based on linear classifier probing alone

## Next Checks
1. Test the models on a more complex dataset with natural images and multiple object categories to assess real-world applicability
2. Implement probe tasks beyond linear classification (e.g., few-shot learning, relational reasoning) to better evaluate representation abstractness
3. Conduct ablation studies systematically removing specific local features to quantify their individual contributions to compositional generalization performance
