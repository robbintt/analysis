## Executive Summary
This review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) by categorizing biases into intrinsic (originating from training data, architecture, and design) and extrinsic (emerging during downstream task performance). The paper systematically evaluates bias detection methods spanning data-level, model-level, and output-level approaches, while examining mitigation strategies including pre-model, intra-model, and post-model techniques. The authors highlight significant ethical concerns and legal challenges arising from biased LLMs, particularly representational and allocational harms affecting marginalized groups.

## Method Summary
This paper is a comprehensive literature review rather than a traditional machine learning method. It systematically synthesizes current knowledge from 40 references on bias in LLMs, categorizing sources of bias, evaluation approaches, and mitigation strategies. The review organizes existing research into a structured framework that distinguishes between intrinsic biases (from training data and architecture) and extrinsic biases (emerging during task-specific applications). The methodology involves identifying and classifying bias evaluation methods across five categories (data-level, model-level, output-level, human-involved, and domain-specific) and mitigation strategies across three approaches (pre-model, intra-model, post-model).

## Key Results
- Bias in LLMs is categorized as intrinsic (from training data and architecture) or extrinsic (emerging during task performance)
- Five main categories of bias evaluation methods are identified: data-level, model-level, output-level, human-involved, and domain-specific approaches
- Three main categories of bias mitigation strategies are presented: pre-model (data preprocessing), intra-model (architecture/training modifications), and post-model (output calibration)
- The review highlights ethical concerns including representational harms (negative attitudes toward groups) and allocational harms (unequal resource distribution)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Intrinsic biases originate from training data, model architecture, and design, while extrinsic biases emerge during downstream task performance
- Mechanism: The model learns patterns from biased training data and propagates them through its architecture, leading to inherent (intrinsic) biases. When applied to specific tasks, these biases manifest as task-specific (extrinsic) biases based on the context and requirements of each task
- Core assumption: The biases present in the training data are learned and encoded by the model during the training process
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We categorize biases as intrinsic and extrinsic, analyzing their manifestations in various NLP tasks."
  - [section]: "Intrinsic biases originate from the training data, as well as the architecture and underlying assumptions made during model design."
  - [corpus]: "Found 25 related papers... Top related titles: A Comprehensive Survey of Bias in LLMs: Current Landscape and Future Directions, Simulating a Bias Mitigation Scenario in Large Language Models, Survey of Bias In Text-to-Image Generation: Definition, Evaluation, and Mitigation."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bias evaluation methods are categorized into data-level, model-level, output-level, human-involved, and domain-specific approaches
- Mechanism: Each evaluation method targets a different stage of the model lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model training, output generation, and real-world application, allowing for comprehensive bias detection
- Core assumption: Biases can be effectively detected and quantified at different stages of the model lifecycle
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The review critically assesses a range of bias evaluation methods, including data-level, model-level, and output-level approaches."
  - [section]: "We categorize bias evaluation methods into data-level, model-level, output-level, human-involved, and domain-specific approaches."
  - [corpus]: "Found 25 related papers... Average neighbor FMR=0.505, average citations=0.0."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Bias mitigation strategies are categorized into pre-model, intra-model, and post-model techniques
- Mechanism: Pre-model techniques address biases in the training data, intra-model techniques modify the model architecture or training process, and post-model techniques adjust the model outputs after generation
- Core assumption: Biases can be effectively mitigated at different stages of the model lifecycle
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We further explore mitigation strategies, categorizing them into pre-model, intra-model, and post-model techniques."
  - [section]: "methods for mitigating biases can be categorized into three distinct approaches: (1) preprocessing the input data prior to training LLMs; (2) changing the model's architecture and/or picking the best model based on the predefined bias evaluation metrics; (3) improving unbiasedness by calibrating the outputs at the decision-making stage."

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Bias origin analysis -> Bias evaluation methods -> Bias mitigation strategies
- Critical path: Analyze training data for biases → Evaluate model outputs using fairness metrics → Implement appropriate mitigation techniques → Validate bias reduction
- Design tradeoffs: Different evaluation and mitigation methods involve tradeoffs between fairness and model performance; automated metrics may miss subtle contextual biases requiring human judgment
- Failure signatures: Representational harms (negative attitudes or misrepresentation of groups) and allocational harms (unequal resource allocation favoring certain groups)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Analyze the training data for potential biases using data distribution analysis and stereotype detection techniques
  2. Evaluate the model's outputs for biases using fairness metrics, interpretability tools, and counterfactual fairness testing
  3. Implement bias mitigation strategies such as data-level interventions, model-level adjustments, or post-processing corrections, and evaluate their effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the most effective combination of bias evaluation methods (data-level, model-level, output-level, human-involved, domain-specific) for detecting subtle biases in LLMs across diverse cultural contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides a comprehensive review of various bias evaluation methods but does not determine which combination is most effective for detecting subtle biases across diverse cultural contexts
- Why unresolved: While the paper categorizes and describes different evaluation methods, it does not empirically compare their effectiveness in detecting subtle biases across diverse cultural settings
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of different combinations of bias evaluation methods in detecting subtle biases across diverse cultural contexts, including both quantitative and qualitative assessments

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can causal inference techniques be effectively integrated into LLM training and debiasing processes to reduce both intrinsic and extrinsic biases?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions causal inference methods as a potential approach for bias mitigation but does not explore their practical integration into LLM training and debiasing processes
- Why unresolved: While causal inference is discussed as a theoretical framework, the paper does not provide specific guidance on how to implement these techniques in real-world LLM development
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or empirical research demonstrating the practical application of causal inference techniques in LLM training and debiasing, with measurable improvements in bias reduction

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the long-term societal impacts of biased LLMs in critical domains such as healthcare and criminal justice, and how can these impacts be quantified and mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the ethical concerns and potential harms of biased LLMs in critical domains but does not explore the long-term societal impacts or provide methods for quantifying and mitigating these impacts
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the potential harms of biased LLMs, it does not delve into the long-term consequences or provide strategies for measuring and addressing these impacts over time
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking the societal impacts of biased LLMs in critical domains, along with the development and evaluation of mitigation strategies to address these impacts

## Limitations

- The categorization of biases as intrinsic versus extrinsic may oversimplify complex interactions between data, architecture, and task-specific contexts
- Many evaluation methods and mitigation strategies are still in early development stages, limiting empirical validation
- Effectiveness of mitigation strategies often involves tradeoffs between fairness and model performance that are not fully quantified

## Confidence

- High confidence: The categorization of bias evaluation methods (data-level, model-level, output-level) and mitigation strategies (pre-model, intra-model, post-model) is well-established and consistently applied across the literature
- Medium confidence: The mechanisms by which intrinsic biases propagate to extrinsic task-specific biases are theoretically sound but may vary significantly across different LLM architectures and applications
- Medium confidence: The ethical and legal implications of biased LLMs are well-documented, but the practical implementation of fairness guidelines remains challenging due to contextual and cultural variations

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical studies comparing the effectiveness of different bias evaluation methods across multiple LLM architectures and tasks to identify which combinations provide the most comprehensive bias detection
2. Perform systematic evaluation of mitigation strategy tradeoffs, measuring both bias reduction and performance impact across diverse downstream applications
3. Implement longitudinal studies tracking bias evolution in deployed LLMs to understand how biases emerge or diminish during real-world use and fine-tuning scenarios
