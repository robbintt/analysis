# Analyzing the Roles of Language and Vision in Learning from Limited Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.19669
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19669
- Authors: Allison Chen; Ilia Sucholutsky; Olga Russakovsky; Thomas L. Griffiths
- Reference count: 5
- Key outcome: Language models without visual input can recover over 75% of VLM performance when retaining full language capabilities

## Executive Summary
This study systematically investigates the relative contributions of language and vision in visual understanding by comparing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with their language-only counterparts. Through a series of ablation experiments, the researchers demonstrate that language plays a substantial role in visual understanding, with language models recovering over 75% of VLM performance using only text descriptions of images. The study reveals that prior knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and training examples are all necessary and approximately equally important components for effective visual understanding without visual input.

## Method Summary
The researchers conducted a systematic ablation study comparing VLMs with language-only models using the ImageNet Captions dataset. They implemented different model variants including full VLMs (Vision-Knowledge-Reasoning), language-only models (Knowledge-Reasoning-Examples), and vision-only models (Vision-Knowledge-Examples, Vision-Examples). The study used GPT-4V for full VLMs, GPT-4 for language-only models, and ResNet50 for vision-only models. Performance was measured through classification accuracy on a test set of 2500 samples across 103 classes with balanced samples.

## Key Results
- Language models without visual input can recover over 75% of VLM performance when retaining full language capabilities
- When any one language component (prior knowledge, reasoning, or training examples) is missing, performance drops significantly
- Vision-only models, while capable of some performance with prior knowledge, fall significantly short of full language models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Language models can recover 75% of VLM performance by leveraging semantic representations of images through text descriptions
- Mechanism: When given semantically meaningful text representations (tags, captions) instead of raw pixels, LLMs use their stored knowledge and reasoning capabilities to map these descriptions to correct classifications
- Core assumption: Text descriptions of images contain sufficient semantic information to enable accurate classification when combined with strong prior knowledge and reasoning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "language models without visual input can recover over 75% of VLM performance, provided they retain full language capabilities including prior knowledge, reasoning mechanisms, and training examples"
  - [section] "we used semantically meaningful text representations of each image (rather than the pixel-based image)"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors focus on VQA and visual understanding but don't directly address text-only image classification performance
- Break condition: If text descriptions become insufficiently descriptive or contain too much noise, the performance gap between LLM and VLM would widen significantly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prior knowledge, reasoning, and training examples are equally necessary components for effective visual understanding without visual input
- Mechanism: Each component contributes unique capabilities - prior knowledge provides semantic associations, reasoning enables task adaptation, and training examples provide distribution information
- Core assumption: The three language components work synergistically rather than redundantly
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "when any one of the language components is missing, performance drops significantly, indicating each one is necessary"
  - [section] "the synergy of all three language components mentioned above is necessary to achieve this performance; removing any one severely hinders the model's abilities"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't discuss the relative importance of these specific components
- Break condition: If one component becomes disproportionately stronger than others, the equal importance assumption would break down

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Vision models without language capabilities perform significantly worse than language models missing one component
- Mechanism: Vision models rely heavily on prior knowledge encoded during pre-training, and without language to provide semantic context and reasoning capabilities, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution
- Core assumption: Language provides essential semantic context that vision models cannot access through visual processing alone
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "vision-only models, while capable of some performance when equipped with prior knowledge, fall significantly short of full language models"
  - [section] "When prior knowledge is removed, the model only achieves 0.84% (SEM=0 .18%, p < 0.001) – approximately random chance"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors focus on VQA and visual understanding but don't directly compare vision-only vs language-only performance
- Break condition: If vision models could access external knowledge sources or if visual representations became more semantically rich, this performance gap might narrow

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semantic representations of visual data
  - Why needed here: The study relies on using text tags and captions as semantic representations of images
  - Quick check question: How might the quality and descriptiveness of text representations affect the performance of language models in visual understanding tasks?

- Concept: Cognitive architecture ablations
  - Why needed here: The methodology involves systematically removing components from models to understand their contributions
  - Quick check question: What would be the implications if removing visual processing had no significant effect on performance?

- Concept: Few-shot learning with language models
  - Why needed here: The study uses few-shot learning approaches with LLMs
  - Quick check question: How does providing training examples affect the performance of language models in visual classification tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image → Vision processing → Feature extraction → Classification, or Text → Language processing → Semantic understanding → Classification
- Critical path: Text → Semantic understanding → Classification for language models; Image → Feature extraction → Classification for vision models
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing model size, pre-training data, and inference costs against performance gains
- Failure signatures:
  - Performance drops to random chance when prior knowledge is removed
  - Consistent accuracy drops when any single component is ablated
  - High variance in performance across different text representation qualities

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare VLM performance with LLM using identical training examples and semantic text representations
  2. Systematically ablate each language component (knowledge, reasoning, examples) from the LLM baseline
  3. Implement vision-only variants with and without prior knowledge to establish performance bounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do VLMs trained on different dataset scales and qualities perform in visual understanding tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that their vision-only model uses a smaller ResNet50 classifier pre-trained on the PASS dataset, which may be limiting its performance
- Why unresolved: The study acknowledges this limitation and suggests that using image models on comparable amounts of data to VLMs could provide more accurate results
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing VLM and vision-only model performance using models trained on datasets of similar scale and quality would clarify the relative contributions of vision and language

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the contribution of language to visual understanding be replicated with open-source models like LLaMA and LLaVA?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they acknowledge the limitations of solely running evaluations on GPT models due to their closed nature and plan to repeat experiments on open-source models
- Why unresolved: The current study only uses GPT models, limiting the generalizability of findings to other language models
- What evidence would resolve it: Repeating the ablation experiments with open-source models like LLaMA and LLaVA would determine if the observed language contributions are model-specific or generalizable

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the quality and descriptiveness of text representations affect the performance of language models in visual understanding tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that the text data from ImageNet Captions varies in descriptiveness and acknowledge this as a limitation
- Why unresolved: The study uses existing tags from the dataset without controlling for their quality or descriptiveness
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with text representations of controlled quality and descriptiveness would clarify the impact of text quality on performance

## Limitations
- The study relies on GPT models, limiting generalizability to other language models
- Text descriptions from ImageNet Captions vary in descriptiveness, potentially affecting results
- The vision-only model uses a smaller ResNet50 classifier pre-trained on a smaller dataset, which may underestimate the contribution of prior knowledge in the vision case

## Confidence

### Confidence assessments:
- High confidence: The systematic ablation methodology and statistical significance testing provide robust evidence for the relative contributions of different components
- Medium confidence: The 75% performance recovery claim is well-supported, but depends on the quality of text representations which wasn't extensively validated
- Low confidence: The equal importance claim for the three language components requires more rigorous testing across different tasks and model scales

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments varying the quality and descriptiveness of text representations to establish performance bounds and identify break points
2. Replicate the ablation study using different vision models (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and language models (e.g., Claude, Llama) to test architecture dependence
3. Perform additional ablations testing other components like inference parameters, temperature settings, and prompt engineering techniques to identify secondary effects
