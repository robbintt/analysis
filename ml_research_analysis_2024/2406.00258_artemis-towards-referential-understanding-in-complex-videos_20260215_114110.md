# Artemis: Towards Referential Understanding in Complex Videos

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.00258
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00258
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Artemis achieves BERTScore of 0.9135 and BLEU-4 score of 15.5 on HC-STVG test set for video-based referring tasks.

## Executive Summary
Artemis addresses the challenge of video-based referential understanding by extracting compact, target-specific video features through spatiotemporal RoI tracking and selection. The model employs a three-stage training procedure that gradually learns video-text alignment from coarse to fine, enabling robust description of user-specified targets in complex videos. Trained on the newly established VideoRef45K dataset, Artemis significantly outperforms existing models and can be integrated with video grounding and summarization tools for more complex video understanding scenarios.

## Method Summary
Artemis extracts compact, target-specific video features by tracking and selecting spatiotemporal regions of interest (RoIs) across video frames. The model employs a three-stage training procedure: first pre-training on video-text pairs, then fine-tuning on instruction-based video-text data, and finally fine-tuning specifically on video-based referring tasks using the VideoRef45K dataset. RoI tracking is performed using the HQTrack algorithm, followed by K-means clustering to select a diverse subset of RoIs that maximize information entropy. These RoIs are aligned and fed as compact features into the multimodal LLM for answer generation.

## Key Results
- Achieves BERTScore of 0.9135 and BLEU-4 score of 15.5 on HC-STVG test set
- Outperforms existing models in video-based referring tasks
- Demonstrates successful integration with video grounding and summarization tools

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Artemis extracts compact, target-specific video features by tracking and selecting spatiotemporal regions of interest (RoIs), which enables efficient video understanding.
- Core assumption: The compactness and diversity of selected RoIs are sufficient to represent the target's behavior across the full video, and the RoI tracking is accurate.
- Break condition: If RoI tracking fails or is inaccurate, or if the clustering fails to select informative RoIs, the model will lose critical information about the target's actions.

### Mechanism 2
- Artemis's three-stage training schedule gradually learns video-text alignment from coarse to fine, enabling robust video-based referring.
- Core assumption: Gradual, staged fine-tuning is more effective than direct training on the target task, and the staged data provides appropriate intermediate representations.
- Break condition: If intermediate stages are skipped or poorly designed, the model may fail to learn the necessary video-text alignment or referring ability.

### Mechanism 3
- Artemis can be integrated with video grounding and text summarization tools to handle more complex video understanding scenarios beyond video-based referring.
- Core assumption: The outputs of Artemis (target descriptions and RoIs) are sufficiently informative and accurate to serve as inputs to other modules for complex tasks.
- Break condition: If Artemis's outputs are inaccurate or incomplete, downstream modules will produce poor results in complex tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spatiotemporal feature extraction from videos
  - Why needed here: Artemis needs to represent the target's actions across time and space, not just in a single frame.
  - Quick check question: How does the RoI tracking and selection mechanism ensure that the selected RoIs capture both spatial and temporal information of the target's behavior?

- Concept: Multimodal instruction tuning
  - Why needed here: Artemis must learn to map video features and natural language queries to accurate textual descriptions.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between the three training stages in Artemis, and why is each stage necessary?

- Concept: Video grounding and summarization
  - Why needed here: Artemis's referring outputs can be used as inputs to grounding and summarization modules for complex tasks.
  - Quick check question: How do the integration examples in Section 4.2 demonstrate Artemis's ability to serve as a building block for complex video understanding?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Video clip (raw frames) + natural language question with bounding box
  -> CLIP ViT-L/14 encoder → frame-wise features → spatial (FSV) and temporal (FTV) features
  -> HQTrack model → bounding boxes for all frames
  -> K-means clustering → compact list of representative RoIs
  -> RoIAlign → target-specific features (FRV)
  -> Vicuna-7B + MLP projection → answer generation
  -> GroundingDINO, GPT-3.5-Turbo for complex tasks

- Critical path: Video → CLIP features → RoI tracking → RoI selection → RoI alignment → LLM input → answer

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using compact RoI features vs. dense video features: compactness reduces computational cost and improves training stability, but risks losing information if RoIs are poorly chosen.
  - Three-stage training vs. direct training: staged training is more efficient and robust, but requires more resources and time.
  - Integration with external tools vs. end-to-end training: modularity allows reuse of strong tools, but introduces dependencies and potential error propagation.

- Failure signatures:
  - Inaccurate RoI tracking or selection → incomplete or incorrect target descriptions.
  - Insufficient training data or poor intermediate stages → poor video-text alignment or referring ability.
  - Integration failures → errors in multi-round dialogues or long video understanding.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate RoI tracking and selection: Run Artemis on a few test videos and inspect the RoIs and their diversity; check if they cover the target's actions.
  2. Test three-stage training: Train Artemis with and without one or more stages, and compare performance on video-based referring.
  3. Evaluate integration with external tools: Use Artemis's outputs as inputs to grounding and summarization modules, and check if the final results are accurate and coherent.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would more sophisticated feature selection algorithms perform compared to K-means clustering for RoI selection in Artemis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that with stronger video foundation models, more sophisticated feature selection algorithms could make a larger difference.
- Why unresolved: The paper only used K-means clustering for RoI selection and did not explore other algorithms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing Artemis with different feature selection algorithms (e.g., spectral clustering, hierarchical clustering) and comparing their performance to K-means clustering.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of Artemis scale with larger language models (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that a stronger LLM (e.g., with a larger number of parameters) brings marginal improvement because at the current stage, video understanding does not rely on strong language modeling abilities.
- Why unresolved: The paper only used Vicuna-7B v1.5 as the LLM and did not test with larger models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training Artemis with different LLM sizes and comparing their performance on video-based referring tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is Artemis to inaccurate tracking results from the HQTrack algorithm?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that Artemis relies on the HQTrack algorithm to generate RoIs, but the tracking algorithm may produce inaccurate results and can confuse Artemis.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of Artemis's performance when the tracking results are inaccurate.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing Artemis with different tracking algorithms or injecting noise into the tracking results to evaluate its robustness.

## Limitations

- Performance depends heavily on the accuracy of RoI tracking, which may fail in complex scenarios with occlusion or rapid motion.
- Three-stage training schedule requires significant computational resources and careful design of intermediate datasets.
- Integration with external tools introduces dependencies and potential error propagation, limiting end-to-end performance.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The effectiveness of compact RoI features for reducing computational complexity and improving training stability, supported by quantitative results on HC-STVG.
- **Medium confidence**: The staged training approach's superiority over direct training, as the paper shows improvements but lacks ablation studies comparing different training schedules.
- **Low confidence**: The model's robustness in real-world scenarios with severe occlusion, rapid motion, or long videos, as the evaluation focuses on controlled datasets.

## Next Checks

1. **RoI tracking accuracy test**: Run Artemis on videos with known target trajectories and measure tracking error rates across different motion patterns and occlusion levels.
2. **Staged training ablation**: Train Artemis variants skipping one or more stages and compare performance degradation to quantify each stage's contribution.
3. **Long video generalization**: Test Artemis on videos longer than those in the training dataset to evaluate feature aggregation and memory limitations.
