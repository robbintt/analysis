# FPN-fusion: Enhanced Linear Complexity Time Series Forecasting Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.06603
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06603
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves 16.8% MSE and 11.8% MAE improvement over DLiner across 8 datasets

## Executive Summary
FPN-fusion is a novel time series forecasting model that achieves linear computational complexity while delivering superior forecasting accuracy. The model introduces a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) that captures time series characteristics without traditional decomposition into trend and seasonal components. Through a multi-level fusion structure that integrates deep and shallow features, FPN-fusion outperforms existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The FPN-fusion model combines a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) with a multi-level fusion architecture to capture time series patterns efficiently. The FPN structure processes time series data through multiple scales, extracting features at different resolutions without explicit decomposition into trend and seasonal components. The multi-level fusion mechanism integrates information from both deep and shallow layers, allowing the model to leverage both high-level abstract features and low-level detailed patterns. This design achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining high forecasting accuracy across diverse datasets.

## Key Results
- Outperforms DLiner in 31 out of 32 test cases across eight datasets
- Achieves average 16.8% reduction in MSE and 11.8% reduction in MAE
- Uses only 8% of computational load compared to transformer-based PatchTST while achieving 10 best MSE and 15 best MAE results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model's effectiveness stems from its ability to capture multi-scale temporal patterns without explicit decomposition. By using FPN to process time series at different resolutions and fusing features across levels, the model maintains both local and global temporal dependencies. The linear complexity architecture ensures scalability while the multi-level fusion allows for rich feature integration that captures complex time series characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

### Feature Pyramid Networks
- Why needed: Captures multi-scale features essential for time series forecasting
- Quick check: Verify FPN outputs maintain temporal resolution across scales

### Multi-level Fusion
- Why needed: Combines deep semantic features with shallow detailed features
- Quick check: Confirm feature alignment before fusion operations

### Linear Complexity Design
- Why needed: Enables scalable forecasting for long time series
- Quick check: Validate computational complexity remains O(n) with sequence length

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input -> FPN Backbone -> Multi-level Fusion -> Output Layer

### Critical Path
Time series input → FPN feature extraction → Multi-scale fusion → Forecast generation

### Design Tradeoffs
The architecture trades some potential representational power for computational efficiency, avoiding expensive attention mechanisms while maintaining performance through feature pyramid design and multi-level fusion.

### Failure Signatures
Potential issues include feature misalignment during fusion and loss of temporal resolution through downsampling operations in FPN.

### First Experiments
1. Validate linear complexity through runtime measurements across varying sequence lengths
2. Test feature pyramid outputs at different scales for temporal consistency
3. Evaluate fusion layer performance with different feature combinations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited benchmarking against the full range of established time series forecasting methods
- Computational complexity claims lack comprehensive empirical runtime validation across hardware configurations
