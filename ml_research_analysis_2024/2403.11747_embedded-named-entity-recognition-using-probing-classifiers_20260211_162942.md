# Embedded Named Entity Recognition using Probing Classifiers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.11747
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11747
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: EMBER achieves 80-85% F1 on NER datasets with <1% latency overhead during streaming text generation

## Executive Summary
EMBER introduces a method for performing named entity recognition (NER) during streaming text generation with minimal computational overhead. The approach uses two probing classifiers: one for token-level entity typing using frozen decoder-only language model hidden states, and another for span detection using attention weights. This design avoids fine-tuning the language model while leveraging its internal representations for NER tasks.

## Method Summary
EMBER employs two probing classifiers trained on frozen decoder-only language model representations to perform NER during streaming text generation. The token-level classifier uses hidden states from the decoder, while the span-level classifier analyzes attention weights. Both classifiers are trained without modifying the underlying language model, requiring minimal additional parameters. The method processes text in a streaming fashion, enabling real-time entity annotation with less than 1% additional latency compared to baseline generation.

## Key Results
- EMBER achieves F1 scores of 80-85% on CoNLL2003 and Ontonotes5 NER datasets
- Streaming generation latency increases by only ~1% compared to baseline (43.64% for baseline without EMBER)
- Requires less than 1% additional model parameters compared to the base language model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting the rich internal representations already present in frozen decoder-only language models. These models have learned entity-related patterns during pretraining, which the probing classifiers can extract without requiring full fine-tuning. The token-level classifier captures entity types from hidden states, while the span-level classifier identifies entity boundaries using attention patterns. This dual-probe approach enables comprehensive NER without the computational cost of traditional fine-tuning approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Probing classifiers**: Why needed - to extract entity information without modifying the base model; Quick check - can be trained on frozen representations with minimal data
- **Attention weights**: Why needed - to identify entity boundaries and relationships; Quick check - attention patterns reveal structural information about spans
- **Streaming generation**: Why needed - to enable real-time NER during text production; Quick check - processing tokens as they are generated
- **Decoder-only architecture**: Why needed - provides sequential token generation with accessible internal states; Quick check - hidden states and attention available at each generation step
- **Frozen model assumption**: Why needed - to avoid expensive fine-tuning while maintaining generation quality; Quick check - representations remain stable during probing classifier training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input text -> Language Model (frozen) -> Hidden states & Attention weights -> Token classifier + Span classifier -> NER output

**Critical Path**: Streaming token generation → Hidden state extraction → Token-level classification → Attention weight analysis → Span detection → NER output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The frozen LM approach trades potential fine-tuning performance gains for significantly reduced computational overhead and training time. Using only 10% of training data for probing classifiers balances efficiency with performance but may miss edge cases.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor entity recognition on domain-specific terms, degraded performance on entity types underrepresented in the 10% training sample, potential latency increases if probing classifiers are not properly optimized for streaming.

**First Experiments**: (1) Measure F1 scores on CoNLL2003 with varying probing classifier architectures; (2) Benchmark latency overhead with different streaming configurations; (3) Test robustness to out-of-distribution entity types using the 10% training subset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Frozen LM assumption may not hold for all model architectures or domains
- Probing classifiers trained on only 10% of data may miss edge cases or domain-specific entity types
- Method focuses on English NER datasets, leaving multilingual applicability unexplored

## Confidence
- High: F1 scores on standard NER benchmarks, latency measurements
- Medium: Efficiency claims relative to other streaming NER methods
- Low: Generalization to non-English datasets and different language model architectures

## Next Checks
(1) Test EMBER on multilingual NER datasets to evaluate cross-lingual robustness
(2) Compare EMBER's streaming performance against other streaming NER architectures beyond the single baseline used
(3) Evaluate the impact of varying the fraction of training data used for probing classifiers (beyond the fixed 10%) on final NER performance
