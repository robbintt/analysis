# FaithEval: Can Your Language Model Stay Faithful to Context, Even If "The Moon is Made of Marshmallows"

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.03727
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03727
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: FaithEval benchmark reveals state-of-the-art models struggle with faithfulness in counterfactual and unanswerable contexts, with no clear performance advantage from larger model sizes.

## Executive Summary
FaithEval is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the faithfulness of large language models when confronted with challenging contexts including unanswerable questions, inconsistent information, and counterfactual scenarios. The benchmark comprises 4.9K high-quality problems created through a rigorous four-stage framework involving LLM-based context generation and human validation. Evaluation across 18 diverse models reveals that even state-of-the-art systems fail to maintain faithfulness to provided contexts, particularly struggling with counterfactual and unanswerable scenarios. Surprisingly, model size does not correlate with improved faithfulness, and common techniques like chain-of-thought prompting provide only marginal benefits.

## Method Summary
The benchmark was created using a four-stage framework that combines LLM-based context generation with human validation to ensure quality. The evaluation covers three challenging task types: unanswerable questions where no answer exists in the context, inconsistent contexts containing conflicting information, and counterfactual scenarios presenting factually incorrect premises. The benchmark tests 18 open-source and proprietary models across different scales and architectures. Performance is measured across multiple dimensions of faithfulness, including the ability to correctly identify unanswerable questions, resolve inconsistencies, and handle counterfactual statements appropriately.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art models consistently fail to remain faithful to provided contexts, particularly in counterfactual and unanswerable scenarios
- Larger models do not demonstrate improved faithfulness compared to smaller models
- Chain-of-thought prompting and non-deterministic decoding provide only marginal improvements in faithfulness scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive coverage of edge cases that challenge model reasoning and context adherence. By explicitly testing unanswerable, inconsistent, and counterfactual scenarios, FaithEval exposes fundamental limitations in how models process and respond to information that contradicts their training or contains logical impossibilities. The human-validated context generation ensures that the challenges presented are both meaningful and representative of real-world difficulties in maintaining faithfulness to source material.

## Foundational Learning
- **LLM-based context generation**: Creating diverse, challenging contexts using language models provides scalable benchmark creation while maintaining variety and complexity. Quick check: Verify generated contexts cover the full spectrum of intended difficulty levels.
- **Human validation protocols**: Ensuring benchmark quality through human oversight catches errors and biases in automated generation. Quick check: Measure inter-annotator agreement rates across validation tasks.
- **Faithfulness metrics**: Quantifying model adherence to provided context requires carefully designed evaluation criteria that distinguish between correct reasoning and hallucination. Quick check: Test metric sensitivity to subtle variations in model responses.
- **Counterfactual reasoning**: Models must recognize and appropriately handle factually incorrect premises without defaulting to learned associations. Quick check: Evaluate model responses to increasingly subtle counterfactual modifications.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Context Generation -> Human Validation -> Problem Creation -> Model Evaluation -> Faithfulness Scoring

**Critical path**: The benchmark creation process follows a sequential pipeline where LLM-generated contexts undergo human validation before being transformed into evaluation problems, which are then presented to models and scored for faithfulness.

**Design tradeoffs**: The study balances comprehensive coverage of challenging scenarios against the practical limitations of human validation time and cost. Using LLM generation increases scalability but requires careful human oversight to maintain quality.

**Failure signatures**: Models typically fail by either hallucinating answers to unanswerable questions, inconsistently resolving contradictory information, or treating counterfactual premises as factual when generating responses.

**First experiments**:
1. Test baseline model performance on each task type separately to identify specific weakness patterns
2. Compare human vs. LLM-generated context performance to validate generation quality
3. Evaluate the impact of different temperature settings on faithfulness across model families

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Human validation protocols and inter-annotator agreement metrics are not fully detailed, creating uncertainty about benchmark reliability
- Model size-performance relationships lack granularity, making definitive conclusions about scaling effects difficult
- Specific implementation details for chain-of-thought prompting and decoding strategies are not fully described

## Confidence

**High confidence**:
- State-of-the-art models struggle with faithfulness in counterfactual and unanswerable contexts

**Medium confidence**:
- Larger models do not necessarily show improved faithfulness
- Chain-of-thought prompting and non-deterministic decoding provide only marginal improvements

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of context generation methods versus human validation in benchmark quality
2. Test additional model families and scales, particularly focusing on intermediate sizes to better understand the relationship between model parameters and faithfulness
3. Evaluate the impact of different decoding strategies and temperature settings across a wider range of values to establish more robust conclusions about non-deterministic decoding effects
