# Safety-Oriented Pruning and Interpretation of Reinforcement Learning Policies

## Quick Facts

- VERINTER integrates model checking with neural network pruning to interpret and safely prune reinforcement learning policies

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VERINTER, a method that combines model checking with neural network pruning to interpret and safely prune reinforcement learning policies. The approach quantifies the impact of pruning on safety by measuring changes in probabilistic computation tree logic properties, enabling identification of non-essential features and connections while maintaining policy safety. VERINTER successfully prunes input features and connections across multiple benchmark environments without compromising safety performance, though results show varying impacts depending on the specific feature or layer pruned.

## Method Summary
VERINTER integrates probabilistic model checking with neural network pruning techniques to create interpretable and safe RL policies. The method uses PCTL properties to formally specify safety requirements and measures the impact of pruning operations on these properties. By systematically removing features and connections while monitoring safety metrics, VERINTER identifies which components of the policy network are non-essential for maintaining safety guarantees. The approach provides both pruning capabilities and interpretability by revealing which inputs and connections can be removed without violating safety constraints.

## Key Results
- Successfully prunes input features and connections across Taxi, Freeway, Crazy Climber, Avoidance, and Stock Market benchmarks
- Maintains safety performance while reducing policy complexity
- Shows varying pruning impacts across different features and layers, demonstrating task-specific sensitivity
- Effectively provides interpretability by identifying non-essential policy components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by combining formal verification techniques with neural network pruning. PCTL properties provide a formal language to specify safety requirements that can be quantitatively measured. By pruning network components and measuring the resulting change in PCTL property satisfaction, VERINTER can determine which parts of the policy are essential for safety. This dual approach of pruning and verification ensures that safety is not compromised while interpretability is enhanced through the identification of non-essential features.

## Foundational Learning
- Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL): A formal language for specifying probabilistic properties of systems, needed to formally define and verify safety requirements; quick check: verify PCTL properties hold before and after pruning
- Neural Network Pruning: Techniques for removing network weights or neurons while preserving performance, needed to reduce policy complexity; quick check: ensure pruned network still satisfies safety metrics
- Reinforcement Learning Policy Networks: Neural networks that map states to actions in RL, needed as the target for pruning and interpretation; quick check: validate policy performance on training environments

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
VERINTER -> RL Policy Network -> PCTL Properties -> Pruning Operations

Critical Path:
1. Define safety properties using PCTL
2. Train RL policy network
3. Apply VERINTER pruning while monitoring PCTL property satisfaction
4. Evaluate pruned policy on safety and performance metrics

Design Tradeoffs:
- Granularity vs safety: More aggressive pruning increases interpretability but may compromise safety guarantees
- Computational cost vs verification thoroughness: More extensive PCTL checking provides better safety guarantees but increases runtime
- Interpretability vs performance: Removing more components increases interpretability but may reduce policy performance

Failure Signatures:
- Safety property violations after pruning indicate excessive component removal
- Performance degradation suggests removal of essential policy components
- Inconsistent pruning effects across different features may indicate sensitivity to pruning order

First Experiments:
1. Apply VERINTER to a simple gridworld environment to verify basic functionality
2. Test pruning on individual input features to identify most critical inputs
3. Evaluate layer-wise pruning to determine which network layers are most robust to pruning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to relatively simple benchmark environments that may not reflect real-world complexity
- Safety guarantees under distribution shift or in complex environments remain unclear
- Relationship between pruned components and actionable interpretability insights needs further exploration

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Safety guarantees through PCTL monitoring | Medium |
| Interpretability through feature identification | Medium |
| Scalability to complex environments | Low |
| Robustness under distribution shift | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test VERINTER on continuous control environments (e.g., MuJoCo tasks) to evaluate performance in high-dimensional action spaces and assess scalability.
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the PCTL property specifications to determine sensitivity of pruning decisions to different safety definitions.
3. Implement cross-dataset validation by training policies on one environment variant and testing VERINTER's pruning effectiveness on a related but distinct variant to evaluate generalization of safety guarantees.
