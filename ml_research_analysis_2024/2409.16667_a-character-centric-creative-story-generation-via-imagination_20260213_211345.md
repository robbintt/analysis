# A Character-Centric Creative Story Generation via Imagination

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2409.16667
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16667
- **Authors**: Kyeongman Park; Minbeom Kim; Kyomin Jung
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Novel CCI framework for creative story generation using image-guided imagination and multi-writer models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CCI (Character-centric Creative story generation via Imagination), a novel framework for creative story generation that addresses limitations in diversity and character depth of existing models. The framework employs two key modules: IG (Image-Guided Imagination) that uses AI-generated images to create visual representations of story elements, and MW (Multi-Writer model) that generates multiple persona-description candidates to enrich character complexity. CCI was evaluated through statistical analysis, human and LLM evaluations, showing significant improvements in creative storytelling aspects and supporting interactive multimodal story generation.

## Method Summary
The CCI framework addresses the limitations of existing story generation models by employing two innovative modules: Image-Guided Imagination (IG) and Multi-Writer (MW). The IG module generates AI images to represent story elements, which are then converted into detailed textual descriptions to enhance creativity and specificity. The MW module generates multiple persona-description candidates and selects the best one to insert into the story, enriching character complexity and narrative depth. The framework integrates these components to produce more diverse and character-rich narratives compared to traditional approaches.

## Key Results
- Significant improvements in character depth and narrative creativity through IG and MW modules
- Enhanced diversity in story generation compared to existing models
- Successful demonstration of interactive multimodal story generation capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages multimodal inputs (images) to stimulate creative imagination, which helps break through the limitations of text-only generation. By using AI-generated images as creative prompts, the system can generate more specific and vivid story elements. The multi-writer approach allows for diverse character perspectives and descriptions, creating richer narrative depth. The combination of visual imagination and multiple character perspectives addresses the core challenge of generating diverse, character-driven narratives that avoid repetitive patterns common in traditional language model approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Image-to-text conversion techniques**: Needed to transform AI-generated images into descriptive text that can be integrated into stories; quick check: validate image-to-text quality with human evaluators
- **Multi-writer persona generation**: Required for creating diverse character descriptions and perspectives; quick check: measure diversity of generated personas
- **Multimodal story integration**: Essential for combining visual and textual elements coherently; quick check: assess narrative coherence with mixed media
- **Interactive story generation**: Enables human-LLM collaboration in the creative process; quick check: evaluate user satisfaction in interactive sessions
- **Character depth metrics**: Necessary for quantitative evaluation of character development quality; quick check: compare character depth scores across models

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Image Generator -> IG Module -> Text Converter -> MW Module -> Story Generator -> Output

Critical path: User input -> Image Generator -> IG Module (Image-to-text conversion) -> MW Module (Multiple persona generation) -> Story Generator (Integration) -> Final story output

Design tradeoffs: The framework balances creativity with coherence by using images as creative stimuli while maintaining narrative structure through the multi-writer selection process. The tradeoff between generation diversity and narrative consistency is managed by selecting the best persona-description candidates rather than using all generated options.

Failure signatures: Common failures include irrelevant image generation leading to off-topic story elements, inconsistent character descriptions from the multi-writer module, and narrative incoherence when integrating multimodal elements. The system may also struggle with maintaining long-term story consistency across multiple interactive sessions.

First experiments:
1. Test IG module with various image generation models to assess impact on narrative creativity
2. Evaluate MW module performance with different numbers of persona candidates
3. Conduct ablation study removing each module to measure individual contribution to overall performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Human evaluation sample size and demographic distribution not specified, limiting generalizability
- Quality and relevance of AI-generated images may affect narrative consistency
- Potential narrative flow disruption from inserting multiple persona-description candidates
- Evaluation methodology may introduce bias through LLM-based assessments

## Confidence

**High**: The framework's novel integration of visual imagination and multi-writer approaches for character development.

**Medium**: The quantitative improvements in diversity and character depth metrics.

**Low**: The generalizability of results across different story genres and cultural contexts.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a large-scale human evaluation with diverse demographics and story genres to assess the framework's robustness and generalizability.

2. Perform a detailed qualitative analysis of generated stories to identify potential narrative inconsistencies introduced by the MW module.

3. Test the framework's performance with alternative image generation models and assess the impact on narrative quality and creativity.
