# Employee Turnover Analysis Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.03905
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03905
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: AdaBoost achieves highest accuracy (84-88%) in predicting employee turnover

## Executive Summary
This study applies three supervised learning algorithms—AdaBoost, SVM, and RandomForest—to predict employee turnover using a 30-feature IBM HR dataset. After preprocessing and feature selection, models are trained and evaluated for accuracy and ROC-AUC. AdaBoost outperforms the others with 84-88% accuracy and 0.84 AUC, making it the most effective for HR decision-making and workforce retention strategies.

## Method Summary
The paper uses a preprocessed IBM HR dataset with 30 features after removing 5 non-predictive columns. Three classifiers—AdaBoost (1000 estimators, learning rate 0.1), SVM (linear kernel, C=1), and RandomForest (100 estimators)—are trained on stratified train/test splits. Performance is evaluated using accuracy and ROC-AUC metrics. AdaBoost shows superior performance, especially at lower TPR thresholds, while RandomForest and SVM lag slightly behind.

## Key Results
- AdaBoost achieves highest accuracy (84-88%) and ROC-AUC (0.84) for employee turnover prediction
- SVM with linear kernel matches accuracy but underperforms in ROC analysis
- RandomForest shows competitive accuracy but is slightly less effective than AdaBoost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
AdaBoost outperforms SVM and RandomForest by iteratively correcting misclassified samples through sequential training of weak classifiers. Each new classifier focuses on instances misclassified by previous ones by adjusting their weights, concentrating learning on hard cases and improving overall accuracy. This requires weak learners with accuracy slightly above random guessing and uncorrelated errors.

### Mechanism 2
SVM with linear kernel captures turnover patterns by maximizing the margin between classes in a transformed feature space. The algorithm maps input vectors to a higher-dimensional space where a separating hyperplane is found that maximizes distance to nearest points (support vectors), improving generalization. This assumes the relationship between features and turnover is approximately linearly separable in the transformed space.

### Mechanism 3
RandomForest achieves competitive accuracy by aggregating predictions from diverse decision trees, reducing variance without heavy tuning. Multiple trees are trained on bootstrapped samples with random feature subsets; final prediction is majority vote, smoothing individual tree errors. This requires trees to be sufficiently diverse and individual tree overfitting to be controlled by ensemble averaging.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Supervised classification workflow**
  - Why needed here: The study compares three classifiers on labeled HR data; understanding data flow (preprocess → train → validate) is essential to reproduce or extend results.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main phases in a supervised ML pipeline?

- **Concept: Ensemble learning trade-offs**
  - Why needed here: AdaBoost and RandomForest are ensembles; knowing bias-variance balance helps choose hyperparameters and interpret performance gaps.
  - Quick check question: How do boosting and bagging differ in handling bias and variance?

- **Concept: ROC and AUC interpretation**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses ROC curves to compare models; interpreting TPR/FPR trade-offs guides threshold selection for deployment.
  - Quick check question: What does an AUC of 0.84 imply about a classifier's discriminative ability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data ingestion → preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, normalization) → feature selection → model training (AdaBoost, SVM, RandomForest) → evaluation (accuracy, ROC-AUC) → comparison
- **Critical path**: Clean and encode features → split data → train all three models in parallel → evaluate with cross-validation → plot ROC curves → select best-performing model
- **Design tradeoffs**: AdaBoost offers highest accuracy but can be sensitive to noise; SVM with linear kernel is simpler and faster but may underfit; RandomForest is robust but less accurate and slower to train
- **Failure signatures**: AdaBoost overfits if base learners are too complex; SVM linear kernel fails if data is not linearly separable; RandomForest loses diversity if feature correlation is high
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train all three models on the same 70/30 train/test split; record accuracy and AUC.
  2. Vary AdaBoost estimators (500, 1000, 1500) and learning rate (0.1, 0.5) to find optimal accuracy.
  3. Replace linear kernel with RBF in SVM; compare accuracy and training time to assess kernel impact.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of machine learning models for employee turnover prediction change when using more recent or diverse datasets? The paper uses a static IBM HR dataset and does not explore model performance on different or updated datasets, limiting understanding of model generalizability. Comparative studies using multiple HR datasets from different industries, company sizes, and time periods would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
What is the long-term predictive validity of these machine learning models in real-world HR decision-making? The paper evaluates model performance on historical data but does not assess how well predictions hold up over time in actual organizational settings. Longitudinal tracking of model predictions versus actual turnover events over several years, along with ROI analysis from HR interventions, would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How do different feature engineering strategies (e.g., interaction terms, polynomial features) affect model performance in employee turnover prediction? The paper uses raw and normalized features but does not explore advanced feature engineering techniques. Systematic experiments comparing baseline models with those using engineered features would show improvements or trade-offs in accuracy and interpretability.

## Limitations
- Preprocessing pipeline (categorical encoding, normalization) is underspecified, affecting reproducibility
- No mention of hyperparameter tuning or cross-validation folds, leaving model selection opaque
- Class imbalance in attrition labels could inflate accuracy; only ROC-AUC partially addresses this

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: AdaBoost, SVM, and RandomForest can be applied to HR attrition prediction; accuracy and AUC metrics are standard and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: AdaBoost's superior performance (84-88% accuracy, 0.84 AUC) is supported by results but depends on unmentioned preprocessing choices
- **Low confidence**: The proposed mechanisms (boosting correction, linear margin maximization, ensemble averaging) are stated but not empirically validated within the paper

## Next Checks
1. Verify preprocessing consistency: apply the same encoding and normalization pipeline, then retrain models to confirm reported accuracies
2. Conduct stratified k-fold cross-validation to assess model stability and guard against class imbalance bias
3. Perform ablation studies: remove each feature group to test their individual contribution to AdaBoost's performance advantage
