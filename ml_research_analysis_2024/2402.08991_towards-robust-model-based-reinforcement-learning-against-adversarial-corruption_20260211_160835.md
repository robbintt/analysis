# Towards Robust Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Against Adversarial Corruption
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.08991
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08991
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First provably robust model-based RL algorithms against adversarial corruption in both online and offline settings

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of adversarial corruption in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where an adversary can manipulate transition dynamics. The authors introduce a novel uncertainty weighting technique based on total-variation (TV)-based information ratios for maximum likelihood estimation of transition models. They propose CR-OMLE for the online setting, achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T} + C)$, where $C$ is the cumulative corruption level, and prove this bound is optimal. For the offline setting, they introduce CR-PMLL, which achieves suboptimality worsened by $\mathcal{O}(C/n)$ under a uniform coverage condition, nearly matching the lower bound.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a novel uncertainty weighting technique specifically for model-based RL that differs from model-free approaches. The key innovation is using TV-based information ratios to weight observations during maximum likelihood estimation of transition models. For the online setting, CR-OMLE is proposed, which achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T} + C)$. For the offline setting, CR-PMLL is introduced, which achieves suboptimality worsened by $\mathcal{O}(C/n)$ under a uniform coverage condition. The authors establish connections between TV-based information ratios and eluder dimension for online learning, and extend the technique to offline learning with a coverage condition.

## Key Results
- Proposes CR-OMLE achieving regret bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T} + C)$ in online setting
- Introduces CR-PMLL achieving suboptimality worsened by $\mathcal{O}(C/n)$ in offline setting
- Proves the online regret bound is optimal by constructing a matching lower bound

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The TV-based information ratio weighting technique provides robustness against adversarial corruption by down-weighting observations that are likely to be corrupted. This approach differs from model-free methods by specifically addressing the model estimation phase of MBRL, which is crucial since corruption in the model directly impacts policy learning.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Total-variation (TV) information ratios** - Used to measure the information content of observations while accounting for uncertainty; needed to weight observations appropriately during MLE; quick check: verify TV distance computation between transition distributions
2. **Eluder dimension** - Generalization of linear dimension for capturing complexity of function classes; needed to bound the information ratio; quick check: compute eluder dimension for specific function classes
3. **Maximum likelihood estimation under corruption** - Modified MLE that incorporates uncertainty weighting; needed to obtain robust transition models; quick check: compare standard MLE vs weighted MLE under known corruption
4. **Uniform coverage condition** - Assumption about state-action visitation in offline setting; needed to ensure all relevant transitions are observed; quick check: measure state-action coverage in dataset
5. **Adversarial MDP framework** - Formalization of corruption in transition dynamics; needed to analyze robustness guarantees; quick check: verify corruption constraints in experiments
6. **Regret analysis** - Framework for analyzing online learning performance; needed to establish optimality of CR-OMLE; quick check: compute regret decomposition

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data buffer -> TV-weighting module -> Weighted MLE estimator -> Transition model -> Policy optimizer -> Action selector

Critical path: The TV-weighting module is critical as it directly determines the robustness of the learned transition model. The weighted MLE estimator is the next most critical component, followed by the policy optimizer.

Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between robustness (achieved through aggressive weighting) and statistical efficiency (requiring sufficient weight on clean data). The authors balance this by using information-theoretic measures that naturally down-weight corrupted data without completely ignoring it.

Failure signatures: Underfitting occurs when the TV-weighting is too aggressive, leading to high bias in the transition model. Overfitting occurs when corruption is severe and the weighting fails to sufficiently mitigate its impact. Both manifest as degraded policy performance that worsens with increasing corruption levels.

First experiments:
1. Implement CR-OMLE in a tabular MDP with synthetic corruption to verify regret bounds
2. Test CR-PMLL on a linear MDP with corrupted offline data to validate suboptimality guarantees
3. Compare both algorithms against baseline MBRL methods under varying corruption levels and patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Practicality of implementing TV-based information ratio weighting in high-dimensional or continuous state-action spaces
- Assumption of bounded corruption magnitude C may not hold in many real-world scenarios
- Uniform coverage condition required for offline setting may be difficult to verify or satisfy in practice

## Confidence
- Online regret bounds: High (matching lower bound construction)
- Offline suboptimality guarantees: Medium (idealized coverage condition)
- Practicality in real-world settings: Low-Medium (unclear scalability and robustness to unbounded corruption)

## Next Checks
1. Implement CR-OMLE in a high-dimensional continuous control environment (e.g., MuJoCo) to assess scalability and identify practical challenges not captured in the theoretical analysis
2. Conduct experiments varying the corruption magnitude and pattern (including unbounded corruption) to test the robustness claims beyond the theoretical C-bound
3. Evaluate the algorithm's performance under partial observability or non-stationary environments where the coverage condition may be violated
