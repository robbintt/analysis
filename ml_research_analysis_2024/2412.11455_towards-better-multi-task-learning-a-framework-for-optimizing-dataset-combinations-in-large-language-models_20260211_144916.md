# Towards Better Multi-task Learning: A Framework for Optimizing Dataset Combinations in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.11455
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11455
- Authors: Zaifu Zhan; Rui Zhang
- Reference count: 13
- One-line primary result: Novel framework uses neural network to predict optimal dataset combinations for multi-task learning, achieving significant efficiency gains over brute-force search while maintaining performance across biomedical tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of selecting optimal dataset combinations for multi-task learning in large language models. The authors propose a novel framework that uses a neural network to predict the best dataset combinations, iteratively refining the selection to improve efficiency. The framework is designed to be model-, dataset-, and domain-independent, making it broadly applicable across different learning scenarios.

Through experiments on 12 biomedical datasets across four tasks—named entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction, and text classification—the authors demonstrate that their approach effectively identifies better combinations, even for tasks that may seem unpromising from a human perspective. The framework significantly improves efficiency compared to a brute-force approach, achieving optimal combinations within a dozen iterations instead of 2,048 possible combinations.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework employs a neural network to predict optimal dataset combinations for multi-task learning. The system iteratively refines dataset selections based on predicted performance, using a combination of task-specific and dataset-specific features as inputs. The neural network learns to identify synergies between datasets and tasks, allowing it to recommend combinations that may not be obvious through traditional heuristic approaches. The iterative process continues until convergence or a stopping criterion is met, significantly reducing the computational burden compared to exhaustive search methods.

## Key Results
- Framework achieves optimal dataset combinations within a dozen iterations versus 2,048 combinations in brute-force approach
- Successfully identifies effective combinations for tasks that appear unpromising from human perspective
- Demonstrates effectiveness across four biomedical tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction, and text classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the neural network's ability to learn complex patterns in dataset-task relationships that are not easily discernible through human analysis. By iteratively refining predictions based on actual performance feedback, the system can identify non-obvious synergies between datasets that may complement each other in ways that enhance overall multi-task learning performance. The neural network component serves as a learned heuristic that generalizes across different task types and dataset characteristics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Features -> Neural Network Predictor -> Dataset Combination Recommendation -> Performance Evaluation -> Feedback Loop -> Updated Neural Network

**Critical Path:**
Feature extraction and neural network prediction are the critical components, as they directly determine the quality of dataset combination recommendations. Performance evaluation and feedback mechanisms are also crucial for iterative refinement.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational efficiency vs. prediction accuracy in neural network architecture selection
- Iteration count vs. convergence quality in the refinement process
- Feature complexity vs. generalization capability in the prediction model

**Failure Signatures:**
- Neural network overfitting to specific biomedical patterns, reducing generalizability
- Slow convergence or oscillation in iterative refinement process
- Poor performance on tasks outside the biomedical domain

**First Experiments:**
1. Test framework on a small, well-understood multi-task problem to validate basic functionality
2. Compare iteration convergence rates with different neural network architectures
3. Evaluate performance degradation when applying framework to non-biomedical datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Domain independence claims lack validation beyond biomedical applications
- Neural network architecture and training methodology details are insufficient for replication
- Computational overhead of neural network component not fully characterized

## Confidence

**High confidence** in efficiency claims relative to brute-force search, as the comparison methodology is straightforward and the iteration count (dozen vs 2,048) is clearly demonstrated

**Medium confidence** in the framework's effectiveness for dataset combination selection within biomedical domain, supported by experimental results across four task types

**Low confidence** in the claimed domain-independence and generalizability to non-biomedical applications due to lack of validation in other domains

## Next Checks
1. Apply the framework to non-biomedical domains (e.g., general NLP, computer vision, or speech processing) to test domain-independence claims and assess performance consistency
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the neural network component to quantify its contribution versus simpler heuristic approaches and determine computational overhead
3. Perform sensitivity analysis across different neural network architectures, learning rates, and iteration stopping criteria to establish robustness boundaries
