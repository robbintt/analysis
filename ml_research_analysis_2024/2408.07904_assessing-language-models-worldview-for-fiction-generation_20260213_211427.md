# Assessing Language Models' Worldview for Fiction Generation

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07904
- Reference count: 7
- Nine LLMs tested for fiction generation capability using 885 statements across six categories

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates whether large language models can maintain a consistent worldview necessary for fiction generation. Through systematic testing of nine LLMs (ranging from 7B to 100B+ parameters) with 885 statements across six categories, the authors find that only two models (zephyr-7b-alpha and GPT-4-Turbo) demonstrate reliable consistency and robustness in maintaining their stated worldview. When generating stories based on these statements, all four tested models produce strikingly similar, formulaic narratives, suggesting a fundamental limitation in current LLMs' ability to represent and manipulate story worlds for creative fiction generation.

## Method Summary
The authors test nine LLMs using a dataset of 885 statements across six categories (Fact, Conspiracy, Controversy, Misconception, Stereotype, Fiction). Each model receives four prompt variations (P0-P4) to assess consistency across differently worded prompts and robustness to opposite claims. Responses are manually analyzed for consistency and robustness. The top-performing models are then used to generate stories based on selected statements, with narrative patterns analyzed for evidence of creative reasoning versus formulaic generation.

## Key Results
- Only two models (zephyr-7b-alpha and GPT-4-Turbo) demonstrate reliable consistency and robustness in maintaining their stated worldview
- All four tested models produce highly similar, formulaic narratives when generating stories, regardless of the input statement
- Generated stories consistently follow identical patterns (e.g., "X doesn't exist until someone discovers it") suggesting lack of genuine creative reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Large language models can maintain a fixed state of the world for fiction generation if they demonstrate consistent and robust responses to factual queries. The paper tests models with multiple variations of the same factual statement (P0-P3) and opposite claims (P4) to check if the model's internal knowledge representation is stable enough to support story world creation. A model that gives consistent answers across differently worded prompts and can robustly handle opposite claims has a stable enough "worldview" to support fiction generation.

### Mechanism 2
Story generation quality depends on a model's ability to treat a given statement as a fixed truth and build narrative around it. The paper tests this by prompting models to write stories where a specific statement is true, then analyzing whether the generated narratives actually incorporate and build upon that truth as a fundamental constraint.

### Mechanism 3
Current LLMs lack genuine creative reasoning and instead produce formulaic narratives based on training data patterns. The paper observes that all four tested models produce strikingly similar stories with identical narrative patterns, suggesting they are regurgitating training data rather than reasoning creatively about the story world.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Consistency checking in model responses
  - Why needed here: To determine if models can maintain a stable worldview across differently worded prompts, which is essential for fiction generation
  - Quick check question: If a model answers "Yes" to "Is X true?" but "No" to "Is X true in the real world?" with the same X, what does this indicate about its consistency?

- Concept: Robustness to prompt variations
  - Why needed here: To test if models can handle opposite claims while maintaining their internal knowledge representation, which is crucial for story world manipulation
  - Quick check question: If a model answers "Yes" to "I believe X is true" and also "Yes" to "I believe X is false" with the same X, what does this reveal about its robustness?

- Concept: Narrative pattern analysis
  - Why needed here: To identify whether generated stories show genuine creative reasoning or just formulaic regurgitation of training data patterns
  - Quick check question: If multiple models generate stories with identical narrative structures (e.g., "X doesn't exist until someone discovers it"), what does this suggest about their creative capabilities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: TruthEval dataset -> Nine LLMs (Mistral-7B-v0.1, Mistral-7B-OpenOrca, zephyr-7b-alpha, Llama-2-13b-chat-hf, Llama-2-70b-chat-hf, text-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, gpt-4-0613, gpt-4-1106-preview) -> Four prompt variations (P0-P4) -> Manual analysis -> Story generation -> Narrative pattern analysis

- Critical path: Load dataset of statements -> Apply four prompt variations to each model -> Manually analyze responses for consistency and robustness -> Select top-performing models for story generation -> Generate stories using selected statements -> Analyze narrative patterns across generated stories

- Design tradeoffs: Manual vs. automated evaluation (nuanced understanding vs. time-consuming), prompt variations (reliability vs. complexity), statement selection (comprehensive testing vs. focus)

- Failure signatures: Inconsistent responses across P0-P3 indicate unstable knowledge representation, inability to handle P4 suggests lack of robust worldview, uniform narrative patterns indicate lack of creative reasoning, stories that ignore or contradict the given statement reveal inability to maintain fixed truth

- First 3 experiments: 1) Test a single model with all four prompt variations on a simple factual statement to establish baseline consistency, 2) Test the same model with opposite claims (P3 vs P4) on a controversial statement to assess robustness, 3) Generate a story using the best-performing prompt variation from experiments 1-2 and analyze whether the model incorporates the given statement as a fixed truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What specific architectural or training modifications could enable LLMs to maintain a consistent worldview for fiction generation? The authors state future work will require ways to teach models to retain state and write creatively, including explicit state maintenance or fine-tuning for story generation. This remains unresolved as the paper identifies the problem but doesn't propose specific solutions.

### Open Question 2
Is there a minimum model size or specific architectural feature required for LLMs to achieve reliable consistency and robustness in worldview maintenance? The study found zephyr-7b-alpha (a relatively small model) performed better than larger models, suggesting size alone isn't the determining factor. The paper tested only nine models without systematically investigating which features correlate with better performance.

### Open Question 3
How do LLMs' limitations in worldview consistency affect their performance on other reasoning tasks that require maintaining and manipulating abstract representations? The authors note these models cannot separate truth from fiction raises questions about their ability to represent world state in other domains where this is a precondition of success. This remains unresolved as the study focused specifically on fiction generation.

## Limitations
- Manual evaluation approach introduces subjective bias and difficulty extracting direct responses
- 885-statement sample size may not fully represent the diversity of statements encountered in real-world fiction generation
- Paper doesn't address potential cultural or linguistic biases in the dataset that could affect model performance across different worldviews

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The finding that current LLMs produce formulaic, uniform narratives when generating fiction is well-supported by clear patterns observed across all four tested models.

**Medium Confidence**: The conclusion that only zephyr-7b-alpha and GPT-4-Turbo demonstrate reliable worldview consistency is supported by data but could benefit from additional testing with more diverse statement types.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that uniform narrative patterns definitively indicate a lack of creative reasoning could be challenged, as alternative explanations aren't fully explored.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Test the consistency and robustness evaluation framework with statements and narratives from diverse cultural contexts to assess whether worldview consistency is universal or culturally dependent.

2. **Long-Form Story Generation**: Extend the study to evaluate whether models that demonstrate short-term worldview consistency can maintain that consistency across longer narrative arcs, testing if observed patterns hold for multi-chapter or novel-length stories.

3. **Alternative Creative Metrics**: Develop and apply additional metrics beyond narrative pattern uniformity to assess creative reasoning, such as semantic diversity, plot complexity, or character development consistency, to triangulate whether uniform patterns truly indicate lack of creativity.
