# Towards Predicting the Success of Transfer-based Attacks by Quantifying Shared Feature Representations
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.05351
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05351
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First method to predict transfer attack success on black-box models without attack/model knowledge using shared feature representations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to predict the success of transfer-based adversarial attacks on black-box models by quantifying shared feature representations between surrogate and target models. The method projects feature vectors onto a common low-dimensional manifold and measures structural similarities using the Hausdorff distance. Experiments demonstrate a moderate negative correlation (ρ = -0.56) between manifold similarity and attack success across multiple model pairs and datasets, suggesting that shared feature representations influence vulnerability to transfer-based attacks.

## Method Summary
The core method identifies shared feature representations between surrogate and target models by projecting their feature vectors onto a common low-dimensional manifold. Structural similarities between these projections are then quantified using the Hausdorff distance metric. This approach enables prediction of transfer attack success without requiring knowledge of the specific attack method, model weights, or architectural details of the target model.

## Key Results
- Moderate negative correlation (ρ = -0.56) between manifold similarity and attack success across multiple model pairs and datasets
- First method to predict transfer attack success on black-box models without attack, model weights, or architecture knowledge
- Demonstrates that shared feature representations influence vulnerability to transfer-based attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by capturing structural similarities in how different models represent the same input data. When surrogate and target models share similar feature representations, adversarial examples crafted on the surrogate model are more likely to transfer successfully to the target model. By projecting these representations onto a common manifold and measuring their geometric proximity using Hausdorff distance, the method quantifies this shared representational space and correlates it with transfer attack success rates.

## Foundational Learning
- **Transfer-based adversarial attacks**: Understanding how adversarial examples crafted on one model can affect other models is crucial for assessing model robustness in real-world black-box scenarios.
- **Feature representation spaces**: Models encode inputs into high-dimensional feature vectors; shared representations between models indicate similar decision boundaries.
- **Manifold learning**: Projecting high-dimensional features onto lower-dimensional spaces preserves essential structural relationships while enabling meaningful distance calculations.
- **Hausdorff distance**: A metric that measures the maximum distance between two sets of points, useful for quantifying structural similarity between feature distributions.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Feature extractor -> Manifold projection -> Hausdorff distance calculation -> Success prediction
**Critical path**: Input image → Feature extraction (both models) → Dimensionality reduction → Hausdorff distance computation → Correlation with attack success
**Design tradeoffs**: The method balances computational efficiency (through dimensionality reduction) against potential information loss from projection, and uses a geometric metric that may not capture all relevant aspects of feature similarity.
**Failure signatures**: Low correlation between similarity and attack success, high variance in predictions, or poor performance across diverse model architectures would indicate limitations.
**First experiments**:
1. Test correlation between manifold similarity and attack success across multiple attack types (PGD, CW, FGSM)
2. Evaluate performance across diverse model architectures beyond standard CNNs
3. Conduct ablation studies varying manifold dimensionality and distance metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the input.

## Limitations
- Moderate correlation strength (ρ = -0.56) suggests the method captures only partial aspects of transfer vulnerability
- Assumes shared feature representations are the primary determinant of transfer attack success, potentially overlooking other critical factors
- Projection onto a common low-dimensional manifold may introduce distortions affecting Hausdorff distance measurements

## Confidence
- Confidence in core claim that shared feature representations influence transfer attack vulnerability: Medium
- Confidence in method's practical utility for predicting attack success: Low to Medium
- Confidence in generalizability across different threat models and attack scenarios: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the method across a broader range of adversarial attack types (e.g., PGD, CW, FGSM) and targeted vs. untargeted scenarios to assess robustness of the correlation.
2. Validate the approach on diverse model architectures beyond standard CNNs, including transformers and vision transformers, to evaluate cross-architecture generalizability.
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of manifold dimensionality, feature extraction layers, and distance metrics on prediction accuracy and correlation strength.
