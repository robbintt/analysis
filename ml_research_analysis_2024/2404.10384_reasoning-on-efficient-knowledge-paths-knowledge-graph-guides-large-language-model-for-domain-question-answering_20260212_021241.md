# Reasoning on Efficient Knowledge Paths:Knowledge Graph Guides Large Language Model for Domain Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.10384
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10384
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: RoK achieves better results with fewer LLM calls compared to previous state-of-the-art models in domain-specific QA

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of domain-specific question answering with large language models (LLMs), which often suffer from hallucination due to insufficient training on relevant domain corpora. The proposed RoK method integrates structured knowledge graphs (KGs) to provide domain background knowledge and reduce dependency on LLM calls. By using a chain-of-thought approach to expand questions and derive candidate key entities, RoK effectively mitigates the hallucination problem and improves the accuracy of domain-specific QA tasks. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RoK achieves better results with fewer LLM calls compared to previous state-of-the-art models.

## Method Summary
The RoK method combines structured knowledge graphs with large language models to enhance domain-specific question answering. It employs a chain-of-thought approach to expand questions and identify candidate key entities, which are then linked to the KG. The method selects the most relevant reasoning paths from the KG using PageRank and incorporates neighbor branching paths to ensure comprehensive background information. This approach effectively reduces the dependency on LLM calls while maintaining or improving the accuracy of domain-specific QA tasks.

## Key Results
- RoK achieves better results with fewer LLM calls compared to previous state-of-the-art models
- The method effectively mitigates the hallucination problem in domain-specific QA tasks
- Experiments on three datasets (GenMedGPT-5k, WebQuestions, and CMCQA) demonstrate improved accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The RoK method works by integrating structured knowledge graphs to provide domain-specific background knowledge, which helps reduce the dependency on LLM calls and mitigates the hallucination problem. By using a chain-of-thought approach to expand questions and identify key entities, RoK can leverage the structured information in KGs to guide the reasoning process. The selection of relevant reasoning paths using PageRank and the incorporation of neighbor branching paths ensure comprehensive background information, leading to improved accuracy in domain-specific QA tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge Graphs (KGs): Structured representations of domain knowledge, essential for providing background information and guiding reasoning in domain-specific QA.
  - Why needed: KGs offer a reliable source of domain-specific knowledge that can reduce LLM dependency and improve accuracy.
  - Quick check: Verify the availability and quality of domain-specific KGs for the target domain.
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT): A reasoning approach that expands questions and derives candidate key entities, crucial for effective integration with KGs.
  - Why needed: CoT helps in identifying relevant entities and reasoning paths in the KG, enhancing the QA process.
  - Quick check: Ensure the CoT approach is well-tuned for the specific domain and question types.
- PageRank: An algorithm for selecting the most relevant reasoning paths from the KG, important for focusing on the most informative paths.
  - Why needed: PageRank helps in identifying the most relevant paths in the KG, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the QA process.
  - Quick check: Validate the effectiveness of PageRank in selecting relevant paths for the given domain.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Question -> CoT Expansion -> Entity Linking -> KG Path Selection (PageRank) -> Neighbor Branching -> LLM Integration -> Answer Generation
- Critical path: The integration of KGs with LLMs through CoT expansion and path selection is critical for reducing LLM calls and improving accuracy.
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing the reduction in LLM calls with the need for comprehensive background information and reasoning depth.
- Failure signatures: Over-reliance on KGs may lead to incomplete or biased answers if the KG is incomplete or noisy.
- First experiments:
  1. Test RoK on additional, diverse domain-specific datasets to assess generalizability.
  2. Evaluate the impact of KG incompleteness or noise on QA performance.
  3. Investigate the scalability of RoK with larger, more complex KGs to determine its applicability in real-world scenarios.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation focuses on three specific datasets, which may not fully represent the diversity of real-world domain QA scenarios.
- The reliance on structured knowledge graphs assumes the availability of high-quality, domain-specific KGs, which may not be readily accessible in all domains.
- The paper does not extensively explore the scalability of RoK when dealing with larger or more complex KGs.

## Confidence
- High: Effectiveness of RoK in reducing LLM calls and improving accuracy.
- Medium: Generalizability of results across diverse domains.
- Low: Scalability and robustness of the method in real-world applications.

## Next Checks
1. Test RoK on additional, diverse domain-specific datasets to assess generalizability.
2. Evaluate the impact of KG incompleteness or noise on QA performance.
3. Investigate the scalability of RoK with larger, more complex KGs to determine its applicability in real-world scenarios.
