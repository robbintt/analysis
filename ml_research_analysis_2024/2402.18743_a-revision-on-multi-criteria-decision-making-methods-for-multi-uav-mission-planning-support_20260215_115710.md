# A revision on Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods for Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods for Multi-UAV Mission Planning Support

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.18743
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18743
- Reference count: 4
- Key outcome: Fuzzy MCDM methods, especially Fuzzy VIKOR, outperform classical methods in ranking multi-UAV mission plans based on expert operator evaluations

## Executive Summary
This work proposes a Decision Support System (DSS) to assist operators in selecting the best mission plan for multi-UAV cooperative missions. The DSS integrates a knee-point based MOEA to generate a limited set of high-quality solutions, then applies fuzzy MCDM methods to rank them according to operator preferences. A filtering system removes redundant, similar solutions using a similarity threshold. Experimental results with expert operators show that fuzzy methods generally achieve better average scores, particularly Fuzzy VIKOR, and the filtering system effectively reduces solution set size while preserving solution quality.

## Method Summary
The DSS uses a knee-point based MOEA to generate mission plans, then applies fuzzy MCDM methods (AHP, VIKOR, TOPSIS, MultiMOORA, WASPAS) to rank them based on operator profiles expressed as fuzzy weights. A similarity-based filtering system removes redundant solutions using a distance function that compares mission variables like task assignments, flight profiles, and sensors. The threshold for filtering is tuned to balance solution reduction against hypervolume preservation. Classical MCDM methods are used for comparison to validate the benefits of the fuzzy approach.

## Key Results
- Fuzzy MCDM methods achieve better average scores than classical methods in expert operator evaluations
- Fuzzy VIKOR consistently ranks highest among the fuzzy methods tested
- The filtering system effectively reduces solution set size with minimal hypervolume loss
- A threshold value of 1 provides optimal balance between solution reduction and quality preservation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The DSS reduces operator workload by ranking mission plans using fuzzy MCDM methods.
- **Mechanism:** The DSS takes solutions from a MOEA and applies fuzzy MCDM methods to rank them based on operator preferences. Fuzzy methods handle imprecise linguistic preferences better than crisp methods, leading to rankings that better match human judgment.
- **Core assumption:** Operator preferences can be represented as fuzzy numbers (triangular fuzzy numbers) and these capture the true decision intent better than crisp weights.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "fuzzy methods generally achieve better average scores, particularly Fuzzy VIKOR"
  - [section 4.2]: "fuzzy MCDM methods are more appropriate to deal with this kind of problem"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence of operator preference handling.
- **Break condition:** If operator preferences are inherently crisp or the linguistic terms do not map well to TFNs, the fuzzy approach loses its advantage.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The filtering system reduces the number of similar solutions without significant loss of solution quality.
- **Mechanism:** A distance function computes similarity between solutions based on differences in task assignments, flight profiles, sensors, etc. Solutions below a threshold distance are considered too similar, and the lower-ranked one is removed. The threshold is tuned to maximize similarity removal while minimizing hypervolume loss.
- **Core assumption:** The distance function captures meaningful differences in mission plans that affect operator choice.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.3]: "the filtering of the solutions is performed in order to remove very similar solutions from the final list presented to the operator"
  - [section 4.3]: Empirical tuning shows threshold of 1 balances hypervolume retention and solution reduction
  - [corpus]: Weak - no evidence of operator validation of similarity definition.
- **Break condition:** If the distance function does not align with what operators consider "similar," the filtering may remove relevant solutions or keep too many.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Using knee-point based MOEA reduces the solution set before DSS processing, improving efficiency.
- **Mechanism:** The knee-point MOEA focuses search on solutions that represent significant tradeoffs between objectives, rather than returning the full Pareto front. This reduces the number of solutions passed to the DSS while maintaining solution quality.
- **Core assumption:** Knee points represent the most practically useful solutions for operator selection.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.1]: "the approach focuses the search on knee points, so only a limited set of the most significant solutions are returned"
  - [section 3.1]: "the number of solutions is highly reduced while the decrease of hypervolume is not very high"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no comparison with full Pareto front results.
- **Break condition:** If knee points miss solutions that operators would prefer, or if the MOEA fails to find all relevant knee points, the DSS receives an incomplete or suboptimal solution set.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs)**
  - Why needed here: The mission planning problem has multiple conflicting objectives (cost, time, risk, etc.), and MOEAs find Pareto-optimal solutions efficiently.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a Pareto-optimal solution and a knee point in MOEA output?

- **Concept: Fuzzy Set Theory and Triangular Fuzzy Numbers**
  - Why needed here: Operator preferences are often expressed in linguistic terms (high, medium, low) that are imprecise and better modeled as fuzzy numbers.
  - Quick check question: How does a triangular fuzzy number (a1, a2, a3) represent a linguistic term like "medium"?

- **Concept: Distance Functions for Solution Similarity**
  - Why needed here: The filtering system needs to quantify how similar two mission plans are to remove redundant options.
  - Quick check question: Why is a weighted sum of variable differences used instead of a simple Euclidean distance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** MOEA module -> DSS module (ranking subsystem, filtering subsystem) -> HMI module
- **Critical path:** 1) MOEA generates solutions 2) DSS ranks solutions using fuzzy MCDM 3) DSS filters similar solutions 4) HMI displays final list
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Fuzzy vs crisp MCDM: Fuzzy handles imprecise preferences but adds complexity
  - Threshold tuning: Higher threshold removes more solutions but risks losing quality
  - Distance function weights: Must balance importance of different mission variables
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Rankings don't match operator choices
  - Too few or too many solutions after filtering
  - Long processing times for large solution sets
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Compare fuzzy vs crisp MCDM ranking accuracy on a small mission set
  2. Test different threshold values and measure hypervolume loss
  3. Validate that filtered solutions are truly redundant by operator review

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the filtering system vary with different threshold values across diverse mission planning scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the best threshold value for the MCMPP is 1, but also notes that for some missions, a higher threshold could be used without significant loss of hypervolume.
- Why unresolved: The study tested thresholds from 0 to 5, but did not explore all possible values or consider the impact of mission complexity on the optimal threshold.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with a wider range of threshold values and analyzing the impact on different mission scenarios would provide a clearer understanding of the optimal threshold for the filtering system.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the operator profile affect the performance of fuzzy MCDM methods in the ranking system?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that balanced operator profiles are harder to solve for most MCDM algorithms, but does not provide detailed analysis on how different profiles impact the performance of specific fuzzy MCDM methods.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested a limited number of operator profiles and did not investigate the impact of profile complexity on the performance of fuzzy MCDM methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with a larger set of operator profiles and analyzing the performance of fuzzy MCDM methods across different profile complexities would provide insights into the impact of operator profiles on the ranking system.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the integration of machine learning techniques improve the selection of the threshold value for the filtering system?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that machine learning techniques could be used to automate the threshold selection for the filtering system, but does not provide any experimental results or analysis on the effectiveness of such techniques.
- Why unresolved: The study did not explore the use of machine learning techniques for threshold selection and did not provide any evidence on the potential benefits of such an approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and testing machine learning algorithms for threshold selection in the filtering system and comparing their performance to the current empirical approach would provide insights into the potential benefits of integrating machine learning techniques.

## Limitations

- The experimental validation relies on expert operator scores rather than objective performance metrics, introducing potential subjectivity
- The corpus search revealed only 25 related papers with minimal citations, suggesting limited prior work or search refinement needed
- The distance function weights for different mission variables are not fully justified, and threshold selection appears empirically tuned

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The general architecture of using MCDM methods for solution ranking and similarity-based filtering is technically sound and well-established in the decision support literature
- **Medium Confidence:** The superiority of fuzzy MCDM methods over classical methods is supported by expert operator scores, but the small sample size and lack of objective validation metrics reduce confidence
- **Low Confidence:** The effectiveness of the distance function for capturing meaningful similarity between mission plans, as this depends heavily on how operators subjectively perceive plan differences

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a larger-scale validation study with more operators and objective performance metrics to verify the fuzzy MCDM superiority claims
2. Perform ablation studies on the distance function by testing different weight configurations and measuring their impact on operator satisfaction with the filtered solutions
3. Compare the knee-point focused MOEA approach against full Pareto front generation to quantify any potential loss of solution diversity or quality
