core_contribution: The paper proposes zero-failure testing as a new method for assessing
  binary classifiers, especially in cases where the two types of errors (false positives
  and false negatives) have asymmetric costs or implications. The method involves
  setting the classifier's operating point so that it achieves zero false negatives
  on a test set of positive samples, and then evaluating performance on the negative
  samples using the true negative rate (TNR).

# Zero-failure testing of binary classifiers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.03979
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03979
- Authors: Ioannis Ivrissimtzis; Matthew Houliston; Shauna Concannon; Graham Roberts
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes zero-failure testing for binary classifiers with asymmetric error costs, demonstrated on age estimation problems for legal compliance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces zero-failure testing as a novel method for evaluating binary classifiers when the two types of errors have asymmetric costs. The approach sets the classifier's operating point to achieve zero false negatives on a test set of positive samples, then evaluates performance on negative samples using the true negative rate (TNR). The method creates a hierarchy of increasingly difficult tests by adding more positive samples to the test set, providing transparent and meaningful performance assessments for applications like age verification where misclassifying minors has legal consequences.

## Method Summary
Zero-failure testing addresses binary classification problems where false positives and false negatives have different costs by setting the classifier's threshold at the lowest value that achieves zero false negatives on a positive test set. The method evaluates the classifier's efficiency using TNR on negative samples while maintaining zero failures on positives. A hierarchy of increasingly difficult tests is created through nested positive sample sets, with each additional positive sample increasing the operating threshold and making the test harder. The approach provides a parameter-free way to handle asymmetric error costs without requiring arbitrary cost weightings.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated zero-failure testing on synthetic age data with test sets of 60, 600, and 1500 positive samples
- Applied method to MORPH2 face dataset using CORAL-CNN and OR-CNN models with nested test sets (60, 200, 600, 1550 images)
- Showed effectiveness on appa-real database for identifying outliers in human age estimates
- Validated test size estimation using binomial distribution for desired reliability and confidence levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Zero-failure testing provides a transparent and parameter-free way to handle asymmetric error costs in binary classification.
- Mechanism: The method sets the classifier's operating point at the lowest threshold that achieves zero false negatives on a positive sample test set, then evaluates performance on negative samples using TNR. This naturally prioritizes avoiding the higher-cost error (false negatives) without requiring arbitrary cost parameters.
- Core assumption: The two types of errors have inherently different costs or implications that cannot be reduced to a single scalar value.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The principal characteristic of the proposed approach is the asymmetric treatment of the two types of error."
  - [section]: "Our approach is to adapt to the asymmetry of the situation and assess performance with metrics derived from zero-failure testing."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct citations found in corpus about asymmetric error treatment in binary classification.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Zero-failure testing enables construction of a hierarchy of increasingly difficult tests through nested positive sample sets.
- Mechanism: By using nested subsets of positive samples, each zero-failure test becomes progressively harder. The operating threshold increases with each added positive sample, creating a total order of test difficulty independent of the specific classifier.
- Core assumption: Test difficulty increases monotonically with the addition of positive samples to the test set.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The inclusion of an additional sample in the zero-failure test set, can only increase the operating threshold, that is, it can only make the test harder."
  - [section]: "Indeed, the inclusion of an additional sample in the zero-failure test set, can only increase the operating threshold, that is, it can only make the test harder."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct citations found in corpus about hierarchical testing through nested sets.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Zero-failure testing separates algorithmic imperfections from test set quality issues.
- Mechanism: By requiring zero failures, the method forces clear attribution of errors - either the algorithm has an issue (outlier in performance) or the test set has quality problems (noisy samples, clerical errors). This transparency resolves ambiguity present in methods that allow fixed failure rates.
- Core assumption: Test set quality can be controlled and errors can be clearly attributed to either algorithm or data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Zero-failure testing resolves this ambiguity in a transparent way; it separates these two issues which otherwise would be difficult to disentangle."
  - [section]: "we believe that the main reason behind the current practice of avoiding zero-failure testing... is because positive test sets are not designed for zero-failure testing."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct citations found in corpus about separating algorithmic vs. data quality issues through testing methodology.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Binomial distribution for failure probability estimation
  - Why needed here: The method uses binomial distribution assumptions to estimate required test set sizes for desired reliability and confidence levels.
  - Quick check question: If we want 95% confidence that reliability is at least 95%, how many positive samples do we need assuming equal failure probability across samples?

- Concept: Operating point selection on ROC curve
  - Why needed here: The method requires selecting an operating point that achieves zero false negatives, which is a specific point on the classifier's ROC curve.
  - Quick check question: Given a classifier's score distribution for positive and negative samples, how do you find the threshold that achieves zero false negatives?

- Concept: True Negative Rate (TNR) as performance metric
  - Why needed here: After setting the operating point for zero false negatives, TNR measures the efficiency on negative samples.
  - Quick check question: If a classifier with zero false negatives achieves 80% correct classifications on negative samples, what is the TNR?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preparation module -> Operating point calculator -> TNR evaluator -> Test size estimator
- Critical path:
  1. Construct nested positive sample sets (zFail-60 ⊂ zFail-200 ⊂ zFail-600 ⊂ zFail-1550)
  2. For each set, find highest score among positive samples
  3. Set operating threshold at that highest score
  4. Evaluate TNR on negative samples
  5. Report results for each nested set
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Zero-failure requirement vs. practical testability: Very strict requirement may need impractically large test sets
  - Nested vs. separate test sets: Nested sets provide natural hierarchy but may have correlated samples
  - Fixed threshold vs. adaptive: Fixed zero-failure threshold is transparent but may be too conservative
- Failure signatures:
  - High operating threshold with low TNR: Classifier has tail-end errors on positive samples
  - Low operating threshold with high TNR: Classifier performs well on positive samples
  - Inconsistent TNR across nested sets: Positive sample selection or classifier behavior issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement synthetic data generator with controlled error distribution to verify test size estimation formula
  2. Create nested positive sample sets from existing binary classification dataset and verify monotonic threshold increase
  3. Apply method to real age estimation dataset and compare with traditional metrics (AUC, F1-score)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we design high-quality zero-failure test sets that account for demographic bias in binary classification systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that in the future they would like to address the problem of algorithmic bias across various demographic characteristics within the context of zero-failure testing, referencing related work on bias analysis in type II errors.
- Why unresolved: While the paper discusses the potential for bias in zero-failure testing, it does not provide concrete methods or frameworks for designing test sets that specifically account for demographic bias. The referenced work focuses on type II errors in face anti-spoofing, which is a different context from the general binary classification problem addressed in this paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and validating a methodology for creating zero-failure test sets that are balanced across different demographic groups, and demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing bias in binary classification systems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we extend zero-failure testing to multi-class classification problems while maintaining its key properties of asymmetric error treatment and test set hierarchies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses exclusively on binary classification problems, but many real-world applications involve multi-class scenarios. The concept of asymmetric error treatment and test set hierarchies could potentially be extended to these more complex problems.
- Why unresolved: The authors do not discuss or provide any insights into how the zero-failure testing methodology could be adapted for multi-class classification problems. The extension of this method to multi-class scenarios would require new theoretical foundations and practical implementations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal extension of the zero-failure testing framework to multi-class problems, along with experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness and maintaining the key properties of the binary case.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we determine the optimal balance between the size of the positive test set (for zero-failure testing) and the size of the negative test set (for TNR evaluation) to ensure both reliability and efficiency assessments are meaningful?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates zero-failure testing with various test set sizes but does not provide a systematic approach for determining the optimal balance between positive and negative test set sizes. The examples use a fixed number of negative samples, which may not be optimal for all scenarios.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows how to compute the required number of positive samples for a given reliability and confidence level, it does not address how to determine the appropriate number of negative samples needed for a robust TNR evaluation. The optimal balance may depend on the specific application and the relative importance of reliability vs. efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical framework or empirical study that provides guidelines for determining the optimal ratio of positive to negative samples in zero-failure test sets, based on factors such as the desired confidence level, the expected TNR, and the specific application domain.

## Limitations

- Potentially enormous test set requirements for high reliability targets (e.g., 100,000 positive samples for 95% confidence at 95% reliability)
- Assumes independent positive samples and monotonic difficulty increase with nested sets
- Limited corpus validation exists for the asymmetric error treatment mechanism

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mathematical framework for zero-failure testing and binomial distribution-based sample size estimation
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the method for age estimation applications and legal compliance scenarios
- **Low confidence**: The broader applicability to other binary classification domains and the claim that this resolves fundamental issues in asymmetric error handling

## Next Checks

1. Conduct synthetic experiments varying positive sample correlation structures to test the independence assumption and monotonic difficulty claim
2. Implement the method on a different asymmetric cost classification problem (e.g., medical diagnosis with different treatment costs for false positives/negatives) to validate generalizability
3. Perform ablation studies removing outliers from age estimation datasets to quantify their impact on operating thresholds and TNR measurements
