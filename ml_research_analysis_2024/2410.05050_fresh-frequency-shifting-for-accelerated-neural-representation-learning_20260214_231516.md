# FreSh: Frequency Shifting for Accelerated Neural Representation Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.05050
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05050
- Reference count: 26
- One-line primary result: FreSh improves INR performance by selecting embedding hyperparameters through frequency spectrum alignment, achieving results comparable to extensive grid searches with minimal computational overhead.

## Executive Summary
FreSh addresses the low-frequency bias problem in Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) by selecting optimal embedding hyperparameters through frequency spectrum alignment. The method computes the Discrete Fourier Transform of both the target signal and the model's initial output, then uses Wasserstein distance to measure similarity between their frequency distributions. By choosing the configuration that minimizes this distance, FreSh enables models to learn high-frequency details more effectively without extensive hyperparameter tuning. The approach is validated across image representation, video approximation, and 3D shape reconstruction tasks, demonstrating consistent performance improvements.

## Method Summary
FreSh works by computing the frequency spectrum of a target signal using Discrete Fourier Transform, then comparing it to the spectrum of an untrained model's output for various embedding configurations. The configuration that minimizes the Wasserstein distance between these spectra is selected as optimal. This process aligns the model's initial frequency characteristics with those of the target signal, improving its ability to learn all relevant frequencies during training. The method is computationally efficient, requiring only spectrum calculations rather than full training runs for each configuration, and is validated on image, video, and 3D shape representation tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves PSNR improvements of up to 1.5 dB compared to default configurations on image representation tasks
- Demonstrates effectiveness across diverse INR methods including SIREN, ResFields, and NeRF architectures
- Reduces hyperparameter tuning from expensive grid searches to efficient frequency spectrum alignment
- Validates performance on standard benchmarks including Kodak images, video datasets, and synthetic NeRF scenes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Initial frequency spectrum alignment predicts model performance
- Mechanism: By selecting hyperparameters that minimize Wasserstein distance between model's initial output spectrum and target signal's spectrum, the model starts in a parameter region that biases it toward learning all relevant frequencies effectively
- Core assumption: Initial frequency spectrum of untrained model output strongly correlates with eventual ability to approximate target signal across all frequencies
- Evidence anchors: Abstract observation, section 4.2 methodology, weak corpus support
- Break condition: If initial spectrum doesn't correlate with eventual performance or learning dynamics cause significant divergence

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Wasserstein distance provides stable measure for frequency comparison
- Mechanism: Wasserstein distance effectively captures similarity between target signal's frequency distribution and model's initial frequency distribution, enabling optimal hyperparameter selection
- Core assumption: Wasserstein distance is appropriate measure for comparing frequency distributions of target and model output
- Evidence anchors: Section 4.1 theoretical justification, definition of FreSh configuration, weak corpus support
- Break condition: If Wasserstein distance fails to capture relevant frequency distribution similarity or becomes unstable for certain signals

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SGD cannot effectively optimize embedding layer frequencies
- Mechanism: Since SGD doesn't significantly adjust frequency magnitudes of embedding layer during training, these parameters must be set correctly at initialization
- Core assumption: SGD doesn't effectively optimize embedding layer's frequency parameters, leaving them as hyperparameters
- Evidence anchors: Section A analysis of SIREN's frequency magnitudes, minimal change during training, weak corpus support
- Break condition: If SGD proves effective at optimizing embedding layer frequencies or embedding parameters aren't crucial for performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and spectrum reduction
  - Why needed here: DFT converts spatial domain representation to frequency domain, enabling comparison of frequency contents between target signal and model output
  - Quick check question: How does spectrum reduction remove direction dependence from DFT while preserving magnitude of each frequency?

- Concept: Wasserstein distance as metric for comparing probability distributions
  - Why needed here: Wasserstein distance measures similarity between frequency distributions of target signal and model's initial output, guiding hyperparameter selection
  - Quick check question: Why is Wasserstein distance suitable for comparing normalized spectra and how does it capture frequency distribution similarity?

- Concept: Spectral bias in neural networks
  - Why needed here: Understanding spectral bias explains why high-frequency details are poorly captured by standard architectures and why specialized techniques like FreSh are necessary
  - Quick check question: How does spectral bias manifest in neural network performance and why does it particularly affect high-frequency component learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Target signal (Y) -> Embedding configuration (θ) -> Model (f_θ) -> Spectrum function (S_n) -> Wasserstein distance (W) -> Optimization loop

- Critical path:
  1. Compute spectrum of target signal (S_n(Y))
  2. For each embedding configuration (θ_i):
     a. Generate model's initial output (f_θ_i(X))
     b. Compute spectrum of initial output (S_n(f_θ_i(X)))
     c. Calculate Wasserstein distance between spectra
  3. Select configuration (θ_j) with minimum Wasserstein distance
  4. Train model with selected configuration

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Spectrum size (n): Larger values capture more high-frequency content but may introduce noise and increase computation
  - Number of measurements: More measurements reduce noise but increase computation
  - Embedding configuration space: Larger space increases optimal configuration chance but also increases computation

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance despite optimal FreSh configuration: Model architecture or training procedure unsuitable for target signal
  - High variance in selected configurations: Wasserstein distance is noisy or target signal has complex frequency characteristics
  - No improvement over baseline: Baseline configuration already optimal or FreSh incompatible with model architecture

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply FreSh to simple image representation task using SIREN on Kodak dataset image, compare PSNR with default and optimal configurations
  2. Investigate effect of spectrum size (n) on FreSh performance by varying n and observing impact on selected configuration and final performance
  3. Apply FreSh to video representation task using ResFields on "bikes" video, compare performance with and without time as input coordinate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is optimal spectrum size (n) for different architectures beyond tested range and how does it scale with signal complexity?
- Basis in paper: Explicit mention of ablation study showing n=64 optimal but leaving room for improvement
- Why unresolved: Limited testing range (32, 64, 128) focused on specific architectures
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing across wider n values and diverse signal complexities

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does FreSh perform on architectures with direction-dependent frequency magnitudes like Wire?
- Basis in paper: Explicit statement of incompatibility with Wire due to direction-dependent frequencies
- Why unresolved: No exploration of modifications to handle such cases
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on direction-dependent architectures after adapting spectrum calculation

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can FreSh extend to multi-modal signals where different modalities have distinct frequency characteristics?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from success on video approximation but no multi-modal exploration
- Why unresolved: Method treats signals as single entities without considering modality-specific distributions
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance comparisons between FreSh and multi-modal baselines on audio-visual tasks

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does FreSh's computational efficiency scale with number of hyperparameters and are there strategies to reduce overhead?
- Basis in paper: Explicit mention of efficiency but no scaling or optimization exploration
- Why unresolved: Analysis focuses on fixed hyperparameter set without broader investigation
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies measuring runtime and accuracy as hyperparameters increase

## Limitations
- Computational cost of DFT calculations for large signals may limit scalability
- Potential sensitivity to noise in spectrum estimation process affecting reliability
- Assumes initial spectral alignment remains predictive throughout training dynamics

## Confidence

- Frequency spectrum alignment as performance predictor: Medium
- Wasserstein distance as similarity metric: High
- SGD inability to optimize embedding frequencies: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Test FreSh's robustness to noisy target signals by adding controlled Gaussian noise to benchmark datasets and measuring performance degradation compared to baseline methods.

2. Compare FreSh-selected configurations across different INR architectures (SIREN, ResFields, etc.) on identical tasks to validate cross-architecture consistency.

3. Analyze correlation between initial Wasserstein distance and final PSNR/SSIM scores across larger sample of diverse signals to quantify predictive power of alignment metric.
