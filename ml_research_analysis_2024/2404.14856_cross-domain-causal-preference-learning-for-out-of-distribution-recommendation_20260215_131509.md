# Cross-Domain Causal Preference Learning for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.14856
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14856
- Authors: Zhuhang Li; Ning Yang
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: Proposed CDCOR model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both IID and OOD recommendation settings, achieving up to 12.27% improvement in HR@10 and 14.44% in NDCG@10.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) recommendation, where traditional recommender systems struggle due to distribution shifts caused by evolving user attributes. The proposed Cross-Domain Causal Preference Learning for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (CDCOR) model addresses this issue by leveraging knowledge from a data-rich source domain to improve OOD recommendation performance in a sparse target domain. CDCOR employs a domain adversarial network to extract domain-shared user preferences and a causal structure learner to capture causal invariance, enabling robust performance across diverse OOD scenarios. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that CDCOR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior performance in both IID and OOD tests. The model's robustness to varying degrees of distribution shift and data sparsity is also highlighted, with performance gains of up to 12.27% in HR@10 and 14.44% in NDCG@10 compared to the best-performing baseline in OOD settings.

## Method Summary
The proposed CDCOR model addresses the challenge of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) recommendation by leveraging knowledge transfer from a data-rich source domain to improve performance in a sparse target domain. The key components of CDCOR are:

1. Domain Adversarial Network: Extracts domain-shared user preferences by learning domain-invariant representations.
2. Causal Structure Learner: Captures causal invariance to enable robust performance across diverse OOD scenarios.

The model employs a cross-domain training approach, where the source and target domains are trained jointly. The domain adversarial network encourages the model to learn shared preferences across domains, while the causal structure learner identifies the underlying causal relationships between user preferences and item interactions. By combining these two components, CDCOR can effectively handle distribution shifts and improve recommendation performance in OOD settings.

## Key Results
- CDCOR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both IID and OOD recommendation settings.
- In OOD settings, CDCOR achieves up to 12.27% improvement in HR@10 and 14.44% in NDCG@10 compared to the best-performing baseline.
- The model demonstrates robustness to varying degrees of distribution shift and data sparsity.
- Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of CDCOR.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CDCOR leverages domain adversarial learning and causal structure learning to address the challenges of OOD recommendation. The domain adversarial network encourages the model to learn domain-invariant representations, enabling knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain. The causal structure learner captures the underlying causal relationships between user preferences and item interactions, allowing the model to make robust predictions even in the presence of distribution shifts. By combining these two components, CDCOR can effectively handle the challenges of OOD recommendation and improve performance in sparse target domains.

## Foundational Learning
- **Domain Adversarial Learning**: Learning domain-invariant representations to enable knowledge transfer across domains. Quick check: Validate that the learned representations are indeed domain-invariant using appropriate metrics.
- **Causal Structure Learning**: Identifying the underlying causal relationships between variables. Quick check: Assess the quality of the learned causal structure using metrics such as structural Hamming distance or true positive rate.
- **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Recommendation**: Handling distribution shifts in recommendation scenarios. Quick check: Evaluate the model's performance on various OOD settings with different degrees of distribution shift.
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Leveraging information from a data-rich source domain to improve performance in a sparse target domain. Quick check: Measure the amount of knowledge transferred and its impact on recommendation performance.
- **Cross-Domain Training**: Jointly training the source and target domains to enable effective knowledge transfer. Quick check: Assess the impact of cross-domain training on the model's ability to handle OOD scenarios.
- **Domain-Specific and Domain-Shared Representations**: Learning representations that capture both domain-specific and domain-shared information. Quick check: Evaluate the effectiveness of the learned representations in capturing domain-specific and domain-shared user preferences.

Critical Path:
User-Item Interaction Encoder -> Domain-Shared Preference Extractor -> Recommendation Module

Design Tradeoffs:
- Balancing domain-specific and domain-shared information in the learned representations
- Complexity of the causal structure learning component versus its effectiveness in capturing causal invariance
- Computational overhead introduced by the domain adversarial network and causal structure learner

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance in the target domain due to insufficient knowledge transfer from the source domain
- Inability to handle large distribution shifts between the source and target domains
- Overfitting to the source domain, leading to poor generalization in the target domain

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate the model's performance on a simple synthetic dataset with known distribution shifts to validate the effectiveness of the domain adversarial network and causal structure learner.
2. Conduct ablation studies to assess the individual contributions of the domain adversarial network and causal structure learner to the overall performance.
3. Analyze the learned domain-invariant representations and causal structures to gain insights into the model's behavior and identify potential areas for improvement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is based on only two real-world datasets, limiting generalizability.
- Potential domain-specific biases are not addressed, and detailed error analysis for failure cases is lacking.
- The causal structure learning component's robustness to different graph structures is not thoroughly validated.
- Computational complexity and scalability for large-scale recommendation systems are not discussed.

## Confidence
- Performance improvements: Medium
- Causal invariance claims: Medium
- Generalizability to diverse datasets: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate CDCOR on at least 3-5 additional real-world datasets with varying domain characteristics and distribution shifts to test generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies specifically isolating the contribution of the causal structure learning component versus the domain adversarial network.
3. Perform computational complexity analysis and benchmark CDCOR against baselines in terms of training time and memory usage for large-scale datasets.
