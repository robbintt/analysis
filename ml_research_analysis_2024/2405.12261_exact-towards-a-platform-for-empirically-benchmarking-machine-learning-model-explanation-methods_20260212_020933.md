# EXACT: Towards a platform for empirically benchmarking Machine Learning model explanation methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.12261
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12261
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: EXACT provides a unified benchmarking platform for evaluating XAI methods using synthetic datasets with known ground truth explanations and quantitative metrics

## Executive Summary
EXACT introduces a benchmarking platform to objectively evaluate machine learning model explanation methods, addressing the critical challenge of false-positive attribution to irrelevant features like suppressor variables. The platform unifies multiple synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets with known ground truth explanations and applies novel quantitative metrics—Precision, Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Importance Mass Accuracy (IMA)—to assess explanation performance. By providing a standardized framework where researchers can submit their XAI methods for automatic evaluation and ranking, EXACT enables rigorous comparison and drives improvement in explanation quality. Key findings reveal that popular XAI methods often perform worse than simple baselines and are susceptible to highlighting suppressor variables as important, underscoring the need for systematic empirical validation in XAI research.

## Method Summary
EXACT provides a web-based platform where researchers can submit post-hoc XAI methods in a standardized format. The platform uses Docker containers to isolate and execute user-submitted code, generating explanations on pre-trained models and benchmark datasets. Explanations are evaluated using three quantitative metrics—Precision (fraction of top-k explanation features matching ground truth), Earth Mover's Distance (normalized transport cost between explanation and ground truth), and Importance Mass Accuracy (fraction of explanation mass attributed to ground truth features). The system supports synthetic datasets like XAI-TRIS with tetromino patterns and semi-synthetic brain MRI datasets with artificial lesions, all incorporating ground truth feature importance. Results are automatically calculated and displayed on leaderboards, enabling objective comparison across different XAI approaches.

## Key Results
- Popular XAI methods often perform worse than simple baselines on EXACT benchmarks
- XAI methods frequently highlight suppressor variables as important features, even when they're irrelevant to predictions
- EXACT provides objective, quantitative evaluation using ground truth datasets, enabling direct comparison of explanation quality across methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: EXACT provides objective evaluation of XAI methods by using ground truth datasets with known feature importance, allowing direct comparison of explanation quality.
- Mechanism: By generating synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets where the true importance of features is explicitly defined (e.g., tetromino patterns or lesion masks), EXACT can quantitatively measure how well XAI methods identify these features. This eliminates reliance on subjective human evaluation or secondary metrics like faithfulness.
- Core assumption: The ground truth feature importance defined in the dataset generation process accurately represents the "correct" explanation that XAI methods should produce.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our datasets incorporate ground truth explanations for class-conditional features"
  - [section] "The ground truth feature set of important pixels to be used as the 'ideal' explanation is given by any non-zero pixel in 𝑅 ∘ (𝐻 ∘ 𝒂)"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on XAI evaluation frameworks but don't provide specific ground truth datasets
- Break condition: If XAI methods learn to use features not in the ground truth (e.g., suppressor variables) but still achieve high prediction accuracy, the ground truth may not capture all valid explanations, making the evaluation incomplete.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: EXACT reveals limitations of popular XAI methods by showing they often perform worse than simple baselines and are susceptible to highlighting suppressor variables.
- Mechanism: By providing a standardized platform where multiple XAI methods are evaluated on the same datasets using the same metrics, EXACT can objectively compare their performance. The findings that popular methods often perform worse than baselines and highlight irrelevant features as important exposes fundamental weaknesses in current XAI approaches.
- Core assumption: The synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets used in EXACT adequately represent real-world scenarios where suppressor variables and irrelevant features can cause XAI methods to fail.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Key findings indicate that popular XAI methods often perform worse than simple baselines and are susceptible to highlighting suppressor variables as important"
  - [section] "Our recent findings have highlighted the limitations of popular XAI methods, as they often struggle to surpass random baselines, attributing significance to irrelevant features"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - several corpus neighbors discuss XAI evaluation frameworks, suggesting this is a recognized need in the field
- Break condition: If the synthetic datasets used in EXACT don't capture the complexity of real-world data, the findings about XAI method limitations may not generalize to practical applications.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: EXACT advances XAI development by providing a unified, data-driven framework for objective evaluation, enabling researchers to test and improve their methods.
- Mechanism: By creating a standardized platform where researchers can submit their XAI methods and receive automatic scoring and ranking, EXACT facilitates rapid iteration and improvement. The leaderboard system creates healthy competition and transparency in the field.
- Core assumption: Researchers will actively use the platform to submit their methods and iterate based on the feedback, leading to overall improvement in XAI method quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "EXACT aims to advance the development of more reliable and reproducible XAI methods by providing a unified, data-driven framework for objective evaluation"
  - [section] "EXACT provides researchers with the opportunity to evaluate the correctness of explanations produced by XAI methods"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - several corpus neighbors discuss evaluation frameworks, indicating interest in standardized XAI assessment
- Break condition: If researchers don't adopt the platform or if the evaluation metrics don't capture what practitioners actually need, the platform won't drive meaningful improvements in XAI methods.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Synthetic dataset generation with known ground truth
  - Why needed here: EXACT relies on datasets where the true feature importance is explicitly defined, allowing quantitative evaluation of XAI methods. Understanding how these datasets are generated is crucial for interpreting the results and potentially creating new benchmark datasets.
  - Quick check question: How are the tetromino patterns and lesion masks used to create ground truth explanations in the EXACT datasets?

- Concept: Explanation performance metrics (Precision, EMD, IMA)
  - Why needed here: EXACT uses specific metrics to quantify how well XAI methods identify important features. Understanding these metrics is essential for interpreting evaluation results and comparing different XAI methods.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between Precision and IMA in terms of what they measure about XAI explanations?

- Concept: Suppressor variables and their impact on XAI
  - Why needed here: EXACT specifically addresses the issue of suppressor variables, which can cause XAI methods to highlight irrelevant features as important. Understanding this concept is crucial for interpreting EXACT's findings about XAI method limitations.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model use suppressor variables to improve prediction accuracy, even though they're not causally related to the prediction target?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Frontend: Next.js React.js framework serving UI
  - Backend: Django handling API routes and database communication
  - Database: PostgreSQL storing challenges, datasets, models, and scores
  - Worker: Python container executing XAI method code and calculating metrics
  - Docker containers: Isolating components for security and communication

- Critical path:
  1. User submits XAI method code via frontend
  2. Backend spawns worker container with user code
  3. Worker generates explanations using submitted method
  4. Worker calculates performance metrics
  5. Results sent back to backend and displayed in frontend leaderboard

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using Docker containers provides security isolation but adds deployment complexity
  - Pre-training models ensures consistency but may limit evaluation of methods on different architectures
  - Focusing on post-hoc methods simplifies implementation but excludes intrinsic explainability approaches

- Failure signatures:
  - Worker containers timing out or crashing during explanation generation
  - Inconsistent metric calculations due to floating-point precision issues
  - Database connection failures preventing score storage
  - Frontend failing to display leaderboard updates

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the complete submission pipeline with a simple, known-working XAI method on a basic dataset
  2. Verify metric calculations by comparing results from different worker instances on the same input
  3. Stress test the system by submitting multiple methods simultaneously to check container spawning and resource management

## Limitations

- Limited Real-World Validation: The platform primarily relies on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, raising uncertainty about how well findings generalize to real-world scenarios with ambiguous ground truth explanations.
- Evaluation Metric Constraints: The three metrics focus on feature attribution accuracy but don't evaluate other important properties like robustness, computational efficiency, or user interpretability.
- Adoption and Impact Uncertainty: The claimed impact on XAI development depends on future researcher adoption and usage patterns that cannot be verified from the current paper alone.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core technical implementation of EXACT as a benchmarking platform with standardized evaluation procedures is well-specified. The mechanism of using ground truth datasets with known feature importance to objectively evaluate XAI methods is sound and directly supported by the paper.

**Medium Confidence**: The findings about popular XAI methods performing worse than baselines and being susceptible to suppressor variables are based on the EXACT framework but may not generalize to all real-world applications. The results are internally consistent but depend on the representativeness of the benchmark datasets.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that EXACT will significantly advance the field of XAI development by driving improvements in method quality relies on future adoption and usage patterns that cannot be verified from the current paper alone.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Testing**: Evaluate the same XAI methods on both EXACT benchmark datasets and real-world datasets with human-validated explanations to quantify how well the synthetic benchmarks predict real-world performance.

2. **Metric Robustness Analysis**: Test the sensitivity of Precision, EMD, and IMA metrics to different noise levels, perturbations, and implementation variations to establish their reliability and identify potential failure modes.

3. **User Study Validation**: Conduct user studies with practitioners to determine whether XAI methods that score well on EXACT metrics actually produce explanations that are more useful, interpretable, and actionable in practical applications.
