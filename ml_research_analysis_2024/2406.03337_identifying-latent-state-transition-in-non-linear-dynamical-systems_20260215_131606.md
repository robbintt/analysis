# Identifying latent state transition in non-linear dynamical systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.03337
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03337
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Jointly identifies latent states and nonlinear transition functions in dynamical systems using auxiliary variables and normalizing flows.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of learning latent state representations and transition dynamics in nonlinear dynamical systems. Traditional approaches either identify latent states without modeling transitions or rely on linear approximations that fail in complex scenarios. The authors propose a novel framework inspired by nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) that jointly identifies both latent states and the unknown nonlinear transition function. By leveraging auxiliary variables to induce non-stationarity or autocorrelation in process noise, the method achieves identifiability under certain assumptions. The approach is implemented using variational autoencoders and conditional normalizing flows, demonstrating superior performance in synthetic experiments and a modified cartpole environment.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework builds on nonlinear ICA theory to identify both latent states and transition dynamics in nonlinear dynamical systems. The key innovation is using auxiliary variables to induce non-stationarity or autocorrelation in process noise, enabling identifiability. The method employs a variational autoencoder architecture with conditional normalizing flows to model the transition function mapping past states to present ones. This joint identification approach allows the system to learn both the latent representation and the dynamics governing state transitions simultaneously.

## Key Results
- Accurately recovers latent dynamics in synthetic time-series data and a modified cartpole environment
- Achieves superior future prediction accuracy compared to baseline methods
- Demonstrates rapid adaptation to new environments with limited data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging auxiliary variables to create non-stationarity or autocorrelation in the process noise, which breaks the symmetries that typically prevent identifiability in nonlinear ICA problems. This allows the model to distinguish between different latent states and learn the true transition dynamics. The use of conditional normalizing flows provides flexible, invertible transformations that can capture complex nonlinear relationships between states, while the variational autoencoder framework enables efficient inference and learning.

## Foundational Learning
1. Nonlinear ICA Theory
   - Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for identifying latent variables in nonlinear systems
   - Quick check: Verify that the auxiliary variable breaks the typical indeterminacies in ICA

2. Variational Autoencoders
   - Why needed: Enables efficient inference and learning of latent representations
   - Quick check: Confirm the ELBO is properly optimized during training

3. Normalizing Flows
   - Why needed: Provides invertible, flexible transformations for modeling complex dynamics
   - Quick check: Ensure the flow is bijective and computationally tractable

4. Dynamical Systems Theory
   - Why needed: Understanding state transitions and stability in nonlinear systems
   - Quick check: Validate learned transitions preserve system properties

5. Autoregressive Models
   - Why needed: Modeling temporal dependencies in sequential data
   - Quick check: Verify prediction accuracy improves with longer history

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Observation Function -> Variational Autoencoder -> Conditional Normalizing Flows -> Latent States -> Transition Function

Critical Path: Past latent states and auxiliary variables -> Transition function (conditional normalizing flow) -> Current latent state -> Observation function -> Observed data

Design Tradeoffs:
- Flexibility vs. computational cost: Normalizing flows offer expressive power but increase inference complexity
- Model capacity vs. overfitting: Deep architectures can capture complex dynamics but require more data
- Identifiability vs. assumptions: Strong theoretical guarantees rely on specific noise structures

Failure Signatures:
- Poor reconstruction quality indicates issues with observation function
- Degraded prediction accuracy suggests transition function learning problems
- Unstable training may indicate architectural or hyperparameter issues

First Experiments:
1. Test on simple linear dynamical systems to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate on synthetic nonlinear systems with known ground truth
3. Assess sensitivity to auxiliary variable quality and availability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions, including the practical availability and identifiability of suitable auxiliary variables in real-world applications, the method's performance on higher-dimensional and more chaotic systems, and its robustness to model misspecification and noisy observations.

## Limitations
- Relies on strong assumptions including invertibility of observation functions and specific noise structures
- Assumes access to auxiliary variables that may not be available in real applications
- Limited testing on complex, high-dimensional, or partially observable systems
- Uncertain scalability to more chaotic or real-world sensor data scenarios

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Identifiability under stated assumptions | Medium |
| Experimental results on synthetic data | Medium |
| Practical applicability to real-world systems | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on higher-dimensional, more complex benchmark systems (e.g., chaotic attractors or real-world sensor data) to assess scalability and robustness
2. Evaluate sensitivity to violations of key assumptions, such as non-invertible observation functions or absence of suitable auxiliary variables
3. Compare performance against a broader set of baselines, including recent nonlinear state-space models, under varying noise levels and partial observability
