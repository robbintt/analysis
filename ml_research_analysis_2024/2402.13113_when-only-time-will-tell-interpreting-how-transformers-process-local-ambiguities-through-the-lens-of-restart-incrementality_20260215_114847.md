# When Only Time Will Tell: Interpreting How Transformers Process Local Ambiguities Through the Lens of Restart-Incrementality

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.13113
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13113
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: RI Transformers revise interpretations upon disambiguating tokens, unlike static causal models

## Executive Summary
This work investigates how restart-incremental (RI) Transformers process local ambiguities through interpretability methods. The authors formalize RI sequential processing as transition systems that build triangular structures of evolving internal states. They analyze how these states change when RI models process garden path stimuli with temporary ambiguities, comparing them to unambiguous baselines. The findings reveal that RI bidirectional models exhibit revision behaviors when processing disambiguating tokens, unlike static causal models.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize restart-incremental sequential processing as transition systems that build triangular structures of evolving internal states. They analyze how these states change when RI models process garden path stimuli with temporary ambiguities, comparing them to unambiguous baselines. For dependency parsing, they find that shifts in attention distributions correlate with output edits. For meaning representation, they observe that right context affects past token representations more when disambiguating, especially in middle-upper layers.

## Key Results
- RI Transformers exhibit revision behaviors when processing disambiguating tokens, distinct from static causal models
- Attention distribution shifts correlate with output edits in dependency parsing contexts
- Right context affects past token representations differently in ambiguous versus unambiguous conditions, particularly in middle-upper layers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The restart-incremental processing allows bidirectional models to revise their initial interpretations upon receiving disambiguating tokens. This mechanism enables the model to maintain and update internal state representations as new information becomes available, creating triangular structures of evolving states that capture the incremental nature of language processing.

## Foundational Learning
- **Restart-Incremental Processing**: Why needed - Captures how language models revise interpretations when new context arrives. Quick check - Does the model update previous token representations when disambiguating tokens appear?
- **Triangular State Evolution**: Why needed - Models the dynamic nature of incremental language processing. Quick check - Do internal states form triangular patterns during processing?
- **Garden Path Phenomena**: Why needed - Tests model's ability to handle temporary ambiguities. Quick check - Can the model recover from initial misinterpretation when disambiguating information arrives?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Tokens -> Embedding Layer -> Transformer Blocks -> Attention Mechanism -> Output Layer

**Critical Path**: The attention mechanism is the critical path, as it determines how information flows between tokens and enables the model to revise interpretations based on new context.

**Design Tradeoffs**: RI Transformers trade off computational efficiency for the ability to revise interpretations, allowing for more accurate language understanding at the cost of increased processing requirements.

**Failure Signatures**: The model may fail to properly revise interpretations when the disambiguating context is too far from the ambiguous region, or when the attention mechanism cannot effectively propagate the disambiguating information backward.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test model's ability to handle simple garden path sentences with local ambiguities
2. Examine attention patterns when disambiguating tokens appear in different positions
3. Compare revision behaviors between RI and static causal models on the same stimuli

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis focuses primarily on syntactic dependencies and meaning representations in controlled garden path scenarios
- Correlation between attention distribution shifts and output edits does not establish causal mechanisms
- Interpretation of right context effects may be influenced by confounding factors such as stimulus length, lexical properties, or frequency effects

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: RI Transformers exhibit revision behaviors when processing disambiguating tokens, distinct from static causal models
- **Medium confidence**: Attention distribution shifts correlate with output edits in dependency parsing contexts
- **Medium confidence**: Right context affects past token representations differently in ambiguous versus unambiguous conditions, particularly in middle-upper layers

## Next Checks
1. Test whether the observed attention-edit correlations persist when controlling for stimulus properties like length, lexical frequency, and syntactic complexity
2. Replicate findings across multiple garden path types (e.g., reduced relative clauses, main-verb/reduced-relative ambiguities) to assess generality
3. Conduct ablation studies that manipulate attention weights directly to determine whether attention shifts causally drive the observed output edits or merely co-occur with them
