# Towards Robust Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Against Adversarial Corruption

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.08991
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08991
- Authors: Chenlu Ye; Jiafan He; Quanquan Gu; Tong Zhang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First provably robust model-based RL algorithms for both online and offline settings under adversarial corruption

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of adversarial corruption in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where an adversary can manipulate transition dynamics. The authors introduce CR-OMLE for the online setting and CR-PMLL for the offline setting, both utilizing a novel uncertainty weighting technique based on total-variation (TV)-based information ratios for maximum likelihood estimation. The key innovation lies in developing a model-based approach distinct from model-free methods, achieving optimal regret bounds in the online setting and suboptimality bounds in the offline setting that depend on the corruption level.

## Method Summary
The authors develop two algorithms: CR-OMLE for online learning and CR-PMLL for offline learning. Both algorithms employ a novel uncertainty weighting technique based on TV-based information ratios to perform maximum likelihood estimation of transition models under adversarial corruption. CR-OMLE achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T} + C)$, where $C$ is the cumulative corruption level, and this bound is proven to be optimal through a matching lower bound construction. CR-PMLL achieves suboptimality worsened by $\mathcal{O}(C/n)$ under a uniform coverage condition. The approach establishes connections between TV-based information ratios and eluder dimension, extending the technique from online to offline learning with coverage conditions.

## Key Results
- CR-OMLE achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T} + C)$ regret bound in online setting, proven optimal via matching lower bound
- CR-PMLL achieves suboptimality worsened by $\mathcal{O}(C/n)$ in offline setting under uniform coverage condition
- First provably robust model-based RL algorithms for both online and offline settings under adversarial corruption

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithms work by introducing uncertainty weighting based on TV-based information ratios that captures the sensitivity of the likelihood to changes in transition dynamics. This weighting allows the MLE procedure to downweight potentially corrupted transitions while maintaining statistical efficiency for uncorrupted data. The approach differs fundamentally from model-free methods by leveraging the structure of transition models rather than directly estimating value functions or policies.

## Foundational Learning
- **Total Variation Distance**: Measures sensitivity of transition models to corruption; needed to quantify uncertainty weighting and ensure robust estimation
- **Eluder Dimension**: Captures the complexity of function classes in sequential decision making; needed to bound the information gain and establish regret guarantees
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation under Corruption**: Modified MLE procedure that incorporates uncertainty weights; needed to handle corrupted transitions while maintaining statistical efficiency
- **Regret Analysis Framework**: Techniques for bounding cumulative performance loss; needed to establish theoretical guarantees in the online setting
- **Offline RL with Coverage Conditions**: Analysis of policy evaluation when data is collected by behavior policies; needed to establish suboptimality bounds in the offline setting

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Environment -> Transition Model Estimator (TV-weighted MLE) -> Policy Optimizer -> Regret/Suboptimality Bound Calculator

Critical path: Data collection → Uncertainty-weighted transition estimation → Policy optimization → Performance evaluation → Regret/suboptimality calculation

Design tradeoffs: The uncertainty weighting scheme provides robustness to corruption but may introduce computational overhead and requires careful tuning of the TV-based information ratios. The uniform coverage assumption in offline setting enables theoretical guarantees but may be restrictive in practice.

Failure signatures: High regret or suboptimality despite low corruption levels may indicate poor choice of information ratio parameters or violation of coverage conditions. Computational intractability in high-dimensional spaces may require approximation techniques.

First experiments:
1. Synthetic MDP experiments varying corruption levels to validate regret bounds
2. Comparison against non-robust MBRL baselines under structured corruption patterns
3. Ablation study on the impact of TV-based information ratio parameters on performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Relies on strong assumptions about adversary capabilities (bounded TV distance for online, uniform coverage for offline)
- Potential computational intractability in high-dimensional state-action spaces
- Theoretical guarantees assume known corruption levels, which may not hold in practice
- Offline algorithm's performance heavily depends on uniform coverage condition

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical regret bounds for CR-OMLE and matching lower bound
- Medium confidence in offline algorithm's suboptimality bound given strong coverage assumption
- Medium confidence in practical applicability of TV-based information ratio weighting technique

## Next Checks
1. Empirical evaluation comparing CR-OMLE and CR-PMLL against baseline algorithms under varying corruption levels and distributions
2. Analysis of computational complexity and approximation methods for uncertainty weighting in high-dimensional settings
3. Investigation of uniform coverage condition's practical implications and potential relaxation to more realistic assumptions
