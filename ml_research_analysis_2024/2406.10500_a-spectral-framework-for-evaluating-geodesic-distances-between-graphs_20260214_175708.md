## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Graph Geodesic Distance (GGD), a spectral framework for quantifying differences between graphs. GGD computes geodesic distances between graph Laplacian matrices on a Riemannian manifold, utilizing spectral graph matching to establish node correspondence. For graphs of varying sizes, the method incorporates a resistance-based spectral graph coarsening scheme. The framework effectively captures structural mismatches across key graph properties including cuts, effective resistances, and random walk mixing times.

The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing metrics, particularly in scenarios with partial node features. GGD shows up to 10% accuracy improvement and 9x runtime speedup in graph classification tasks when compared to the Tree-Mover's Distance metric. Additionally, the framework exhibits better correlation with Graph Neural Network (GNN) outputs for stability analysis, making it valuable for understanding model behavior.

## Method Summary
GGD operates through a multi-stage process beginning with spectral graph matching to establish node correspondence between graphs. For graphs of different sizes, a resistance-based spectral graph coarsening scheme is applied to create comparable representations. The core computation involves calculating geodesic distances between graph Laplacian matrices on a Riemannian manifold, which captures the intrinsic geometric structure of the graphs. This spectral approach allows GGD to effectively measure structural differences across various graph properties including cuts, effective resistances, and random walk mixing times. The framework is designed to be computationally efficient compared to existing optimal transport-based metrics while maintaining robustness even when node features are partially missing.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 10% accuracy gain and 9x runtime speedup in graph classification compared to Tree-Mover's Distance metric
- Demonstrates superior performance especially when only partial node features are available
- Shows better correlation with GNN outputs for stability analysis compared to existing metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GGD leverages the spectral properties of graph Laplacians to capture the intrinsic geometric structure of graphs on a Riemannian manifold. By computing geodesic distances in this space, the framework naturally accounts for the underlying graph topology and connectivity patterns. The spectral graph matching component establishes meaningful node correspondences by aligning the dominant eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrices, ensuring that structural similarities are properly identified. The resistance-based coarsening scheme provides a principled way to handle graphs of different sizes by preserving effective resistance distances, which are known to capture important connectivity properties.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Laplacians**: Essential for spectral graph theory and capturing connectivity structure; quick check: verify eigenvalues represent graph connectivity properties
- **Riemannian Manifolds**: Provides the geometric framework for measuring geodesic distances between graph representations; quick check: confirm manifold curvature properties align with graph structure
- **Spectral Graph Matching**: Enables node correspondence through eigenvector alignment; quick check: validate matching accuracy on structurally similar graphs
- **Effective Resistances**: Captures connectivity properties and is preserved during coarsening; quick check: verify resistance preservation after coarsening operations
- **Graph Coarsening**: Reduces graph size while preserving spectral properties; quick check: ensure coarsened graph maintains key spectral features

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Graphs -> Spectral Matching -> Resistance-based Coarsening (if needed) -> Riemannian Geodesic Computation -> Distance Output

**Critical Path**: The spectral matching step is critical as it establishes node correspondence. Without accurate matching, the subsequent geodesic computation would compare misaligned structures, leading to meaningless distance measurements.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency for spectral accuracy by using resistance-based coarsening rather than simpler aggregation methods. This ensures better preservation of graph properties but may limit scalability.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor spectral matching accuracy will manifest as unexpectedly large distance values between structurally similar graphs. Computational bottlenecks may occur during resistance calculations for very large graphs.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare GGD distances between isomorphic graphs (should be near zero) and completely different graphs (should be large)
2. Test matching accuracy on pairs of graphs with known node correspondences
3. Evaluate coarsening quality by comparing spectral properties before and after coarsening

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability challenges for very large networks due to resistance-based calculations in the coarsening scheme
- Performance in highly heterogeneous graph domains with dramatically varying node features and structures remains underexplored
- Reliance on spectral graph matching assumes sufficient structural similarity, which may not hold for graphs with fundamentally different topologies

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the theoretical framework and mathematical formulation of GGD, as the spectral and Riemannian manifold foundations are well-established
- **Medium confidence** in the computational efficiency claims, as runtime comparisons are limited to specific benchmark datasets and may not generalize to all graph types
- **Medium confidence** in the stability analysis correlation with GNN outputs, as this is demonstrated on a limited set of models and tasks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct scalability tests on graphs with 10,000+ nodes to evaluate the practical limits of the resistance-based coarsening scheme
2. Test GGD's performance on heterogeneous graph datasets with minimal structural similarity to assess robustness in challenging matching scenarios
3. Compare GGD against additional graph distance metrics (beyond Tree-Mover's Distance) across diverse real-world applications to establish relative strengths and weaknesses
