# Disentangling Specificity for Abstractive Multi-document Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.00005
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00005
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: DisentangleSum achieves state-of-the-art performance on Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets with ROUGE-1 score of 45.95 on Multi-News

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of specific information being overlooked in multi-document summarization. The authors propose DisentangleSum, a model that disentangles specific content from documents in a set through document-specific representation learners and an orthogonal constraint to encourage distinctiveness between representations. Experiments on Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets show DisentangleSum achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-SU scores of 45.95, 16.32, and 19.23 respectively on Multi-News, outperforming existing methods. The model also shows better preservation of document-specific information and higher coverage scores.

## Method Summary
DisentangleSum uses a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with document-specific representation learners and an orthogonal constraint. The model processes multi-document inputs by learning both document-set representations and document-specific representations, which are combined through weighted addition before decoding into the summary. The orthogonal constraint enforces distinctiveness between document-specific representations using a circle-paired loss that reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Training uses Adam optimizer for 20,000 steps with batch size 4,096 and learning rate schedule.

## Key Results
- DisentangleSum achieves ROUGE-1 score of 45.95, ROUGE-2 score of 16.32, and ROUGE-SU score of 19.23 on Multi-News dataset
- Model outperforms existing methods on both Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets
- DisentangleSum shows better preservation of document-specific information with higher coverage scores
- Circle-paired loss reduces computational complexity while maintaining effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** DisentangleSum improves summary comprehensiveness by explicitly learning document-specific representations alongside document-set representations.
- **Mechanism:** The model uses separate encoders to capture both overall document-set information and unique document-specific details. These are combined through a weighted addition before decoding into the summary. The orthogonal constraint ensures that document-specific representations are distinct from each other, forcing the model to capture unique content from each document.
- **Core assumption:** Document-specific information contains unique facts and viewpoints that are critical for comprehensive summarization, and these can be effectively disentangled from shared content.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose to disentangle the specific content from documents in one document set." [section]: "These specific information contain unique facts, viewpoints, and details [2]. Extracting these specific details enhance the comprehensiveness of the resulting summary."
- **Break condition:** If the orthogonal constraint becomes too strong and prevents the model from capturing any shared information, or if the specific encoders fail to learn meaningful distinctions between documents.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The orthogonal constraint effectively enforces distinctiveness between document-specific representations.
- **Mechanism:** The specific loss function computes the squared Frobenius norm of inner products between pairs of document-specific representations. By minimizing this, the model encourages representations to be orthogonal (perpendicular), ensuring they capture different aspects of the document set.
- **Core assumption:** Semantic orthogonality in representation space corresponds to capturing distinct content from different documents.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section]: "To encourage dissimilarity between specific representations, we aim for a smaller inner product between each pair of specific representation vectors, promoting orthogonality."
- **Break condition:** If documents in a set are very similar, forcing orthogonality might lead to artificial distinctions rather than meaningful ones, or if the constraint overwhelms the generation objective.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Circle-paired loss reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear while maintaining effectiveness.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of computing loss for all document pairs (which grows quadratically), the model only computes loss between each document and its successor, with the last document paired with the first. This creates a circular pairing scheme.
- **Core assumption:** Sequential pairing provides sufficient coverage of inter-document differences without needing all pairwise comparisons.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section]: "To address this, we introduce a circle-paired loss objective function, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear."
- **Break condition:** If the circular pairing misses important distinctions between non-adjacent documents, or if document order becomes arbitrary and affects the pairing logic.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Transformer encoder-decoder architecture
  - **Why needed here:** DisentangleSum builds on standard Transformer components (encoder, decoder, attention mechanisms) as its foundation, adding specific and orthogonal constraints on top.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the three main components of a standard Transformer architecture used in summarization?

- **Concept:** Orthogonal constraints in representation learning
  - **Why needed here:** The paper introduces orthogonality as a key mechanism to enforce distinctiveness between document-specific representations, which is not standard in typical summarization models.
  - **Quick check question:** How does minimizing the inner product between vectors encourage them to be orthogonal?

- **Concept:** Multi-document input processing
  - **Why needed here:** Unlike single-document summarization, MDS requires handling variable numbers of documents and capturing relationships between them.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the main challenges in processing multiple documents as input compared to a single document?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Document → Specific encoder → Specific representation → Orthogonal constraint → Weighted addition → Decoder → Summary
- **Critical path:** Document → Specific encoder → Specific representation → Orthogonal constraint → Weighted addition → Decoder → Summary
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Linear vs. quadratic computation: Circle-paired loss trades some pairwise distinction for computational efficiency
  - Shared vs. separate parameters: Using shared specific encoder parameters assumes documents in different sets are unrelated
  - Orthogonal strength: Balance between enforcing distinctiveness and allowing some shared information
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor coverage scores indicate specific encoders aren't capturing unique information
  - Low ROUGE scores suggest the combination of representations isn't working
  - High specific loss but poor performance indicates constraint is too strong
  - Performance drops with more documents suggest circle-paired loss insufficient
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation study: Remove orthogonal constraint and compare performance
  2. Circle-paired vs. dense-paired loss comparison on varying document set sizes
  3. Hyperparameter sweep for α (specific representation weight) and β (loss weight)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the orthogonal constraint perform when the number of documents in a set is significantly larger than ten?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the circle-paired loss reduces computational complexity compared to dense-paired loss, but does not explore performance with very large document sets.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only evaluated document sets with up to ten documents, leaving uncertainty about scalability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the model on datasets with document sets containing 20, 50, or 100 documents and comparing performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of document order on the effectiveness of the circle-paired loss objective function?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that experiments were conducted to rule out the impact of document order, but does not provide detailed analysis on how different orderings affect performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper only states that document order was controlled for, without exploring its effects in depth.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying document order and measuring performance changes with different orderings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the DisentangleSum model perform on multi-document summarization tasks in domains other than news and scientific articles?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The experiments are limited to Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets, suggesting potential domain-specific limitations.
- Why unresolved: The model's generalizability to other domains like legal documents, social media content, or technical documentation is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the model on diverse summarization datasets from different domains and comparing performance metrics.

## Limitations
- The paper's reliance on orthogonal constraints and circle-paired loss introduces significant assumptions about representation space geometry that may not hold across all document sets
- The circular pairing scheme's effectiveness for larger document sets (beyond the tested 3-10 range) remains untested
- The specific loss weighting hyperparameters were determined through limited ablation studies, suggesting potential sensitivity to different datasets

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The core mechanism of combining document-set and document-specific representations is well-supported by the empirical results, with clear improvements over baselines on both Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets
- **Medium confidence:** The orthogonal constraint's effectiveness relies on the assumption that semantic orthogonality corresponds to content distinctiveness, which is theoretically sound but not extensively validated
- **Medium confidence:** The computational efficiency gains from circle-paired loss are demonstrated, but the potential information loss from reduced pairwise comparisons warrants further investigation

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on orthogonal constraint strength:** Systematically vary the orthogonal constraint weight to identify the optimal balance between enforcing distinctiveness and allowing shared information, particularly for document sets with varying degrees of similarity
2. **Generalization testing on larger document sets:** Evaluate DisentangleSum on document sets containing 15-20 documents to assess whether the circle-paired loss maintains effectiveness and whether the orthogonal constraint scales appropriately
3. **Cross-dataset robustness analysis:** Test the model on a dataset with different characteristics (e.g., scientific vs. news documents) to determine if the specific representation learning and orthogonal constraint generalize beyond the current experimental domains
