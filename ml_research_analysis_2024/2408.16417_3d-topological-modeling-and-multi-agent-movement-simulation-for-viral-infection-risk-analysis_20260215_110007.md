# 3D Topological Modeling and Multi-Agent Movement Simulation for Viral Infection Risk Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.16417
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16417
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents a method for analyzing indoor viral infection risk by integrating 3D topological modeling, multi-agent movement simulation, and airborne transmission modeling.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing indoor viral infection risk by combining 3D topological modeling with multi-agent movement simulation and airborne transmission dynamics. The approach integrates topologicpy software to create navigation graphs from architectural models, simulates agent movement along shortest paths while respecting obstacles, and calculates infection risk using reaction-diffusion equations and an extended Wells-Riley model. The system enables rapid analysis of different spatial layouts and is designed as a decision-support tool for policymakers, facility managers, architects, and engineers.

## Method Summary
The method constructs navigation graphs from 3D architectural models using topologicpy, representing navigable spaces as dual graphs where nodes correspond to locations and edges represent possible paths. Agents with unique schedules, walking speeds, infection status, and activity types are simulated to move along shortest paths calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm. Viral aerosol concentration is computed at each timestep using a reaction-diffusion equation, and infection risk is determined using an extended Wells-Riley model that incorporates spatial proximity data. The approach is demonstrated through a comparative analysis of cellular and open office plan layouts.

## Key Results
- Navigation graph enables precise movement simulation that avoids obstacles and accurately models agent proximity
- Spatio-temporal infection risk model improves accuracy by incorporating both movement patterns and airborne transmission dynamics
- Scheduling system ensures realistic agent movement by preventing time gaps and coordinating activities with spatial locations
- Comparative analysis of cellular vs. open office layouts demonstrates significant differences in infection risk

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The navigation graph enables precise movement simulation that avoids obstacles and accurately models agent proximity. By constructing a dual graph representation from the non-manifold topology, the system derives adjacency relationships between indoor spaces. Dijkstra's algorithm then computes shortest paths along this graph while respecting obstacles, doorways, and walls. This allows exact distance calculations between agents at each timestep.

### Mechanism 2
The spatio-temporal infection risk model improves accuracy by incorporating both movement patterns and airborne transmission dynamics. The system computes viral aerosol concentration using a reaction-diffusion equation at each timestep, then applies an extended Wells-Riley model that incorporates spatial proximity data from the navigation graph. This captures how time-varying agent positions and activities affect infection risk.

### Mechanism 3
The scheduling system ensures realistic agent movement by preventing time gaps and coordinating activities with spatial locations. Each agent follows a predefined schedule of events with specific locations and times. The system calculates "time-to-leave" based on walking speed and event start times, ensuring agents arrive on time while traveling along shortest paths.

## Foundational Learning

- **Non-manifold topology and dual graphs**: Non-manifold topology allows representation of indoor spaces where multiple rooms can share boundaries (walls, doorways), enabling the construction of dual graphs that model navigable space. This is essential for creating accurate navigation graphs.
  - Quick check: What is the key difference between manifold and non-manifold topology in how they represent shared boundaries between spaces?

- **Reaction-diffusion equations**: Reaction-diffusion equations model how viral aerosol concentration changes over time and space, accounting for both diffusion (spreading) and reaction (decay/viral inactivation). This provides the mathematical foundation for computing airborne transmission risk.
  - Quick check: What are the two main processes modeled by reaction-diffusion equations in the context of viral aerosol transmission?

- **Agent-based simulation scheduling**: Scheduling ensures agents move through spaces according to realistic temporal patterns, coordinating when and where agents are present to interact. This is crucial for modeling transmission events that depend on proximity and duration.
  - Quick check: How does the "time-to-leave" calculation ensure agents arrive at scheduled events on time while accounting for their walking speed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Topologicpy core (geometry, topology, navigation graph construction) -> Agent simulation engine (scheduling, movement, attributes) -> Airborne transmission module (reaction-diffusion, Wells-Riley extension) -> Visualization layer (Plotly integration, animation) -> Web interface (3D model upload, parameter configuration, result visualization)
- **Critical path**: 3D model → navigation graph construction → agent scheduling → movement simulation → infection risk calculation → visualization
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Accuracy vs. speed: Full navigation graphs provide precise movement but are computationally expensive; Delaunay triangulation offers faster computation with acceptable accuracy for large spaces
  - 2D vs. 3D aerosol modeling: 2D modeling speeds computation but may miss important vertical transmission dynamics
  - Simplified schedules vs. stochastic behavior: Predetermined schedules are easier to implement but may not capture realistic variability
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Agents getting stuck or moving unrealistically: Indicates navigation graph construction errors or disconnected graph components
  - Infection risk values that seem too high/low: Suggests problems with ventilation parameters, reaction-diffusion coefficients, or Wells-Riley extension implementation
  - Performance issues with large floor plans: Navigation graph construction or reaction-diffusion calculations may need optimization
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test navigation graph construction with a simple rectangular room containing a single obstacle to verify shortest path calculation and obstacle avoidance
  2. Validate infection risk calculations using a controlled scenario with known agent positions and ventilation rates to compare against analytical solutions
  3. Evaluate performance scaling by running simulations on increasingly complex floor plans to identify computational bottlenecks in navigation graph construction or reaction-diffusion calculations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How would the infection risk vary with different levels of ventilation (e.g., 0.12 ACH vs higher ACH values)?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions using a very poor ventilation setting (0.12 ACH) but does not explore how infection risk changes with improved ventilation.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested one ventilation scenario, limiting the ability to understand the impact of ventilation improvements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Additional simulations with varying ACH values would show how ventilation affects infection risk.

### Open Question 2
How do real-world human movement patterns compare to the idealized shortest-path movements used in the simulation?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that the simulation does not use real-world data to model variations in human movement but instead relies on idealised linear movements using shortest paths.
- Why unresolved: The model's assumption of shortest-path movement may not accurately reflect actual human behavior in indoor environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Incorporating real-world movement data from tracking studies would allow comparison with the simulation results.

### Open Question 3
How sensitive are the results to variations in agent characteristics such as walking speed, activity levels, and infection status?
- Basis in paper: While the paper mentions that agents have various attributes, it does not explore how changes in these attributes affect infection risk outcomes.
- Why unresolved: The study uses fixed values for agent characteristics, so the impact of parameter variation is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis with varied agent parameters would reveal which characteristics most influence infection risk.

## Limitations

- Ventilation model accuracy is uncertain as the reaction-diffusion equation may oversimplify real-world HVAC complexities, air mixing, and directional airflow patterns
- Behavioral realism is limited by predetermined deterministic schedules that may not reflect actual human behavior variability and movement patterns
- Computational scalability becomes challenging for large, complex floor plans, with navigation graph construction and reaction-diffusion calculations becoming computationally expensive

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The navigation graph accurately models agent movement and obstacle avoidance, as this is directly implemented through well-established graph algorithms (Dijkstra's shortest path) on topologically derived structures
- **Medium Confidence**: The infection risk calculation methodology using reaction-diffusion equations and Wells-Riley extension is sound, though the specific parameter choices and their calibration against empirical data are not fully specified
- **Low Confidence**: The comparative analysis between cellular and open office layouts conclusively demonstrates infection risk differences, as this claim depends heavily on the accuracy of underlying assumptions about ventilation, agent behavior, and environmental parameters

## Next Checks

1. **Validation Against Empirical Data**: Compare infection risk predictions against real outbreak data from similar office environments to assess model accuracy and identify calibration needs for environmental parameters

2. **Behavioral Variability Testing**: Implement stochastic variations in agent schedules and movement patterns to evaluate how behavioral uncertainty propagates through the infection risk calculations and affects overall predictions

3. **Ventilation Model Sensitivity Analysis**: Test the model's sensitivity to different ventilation configurations, including directional airflow, temperature gradients, and HVAC system variations, to quantify how these factors impact infection risk predictions
