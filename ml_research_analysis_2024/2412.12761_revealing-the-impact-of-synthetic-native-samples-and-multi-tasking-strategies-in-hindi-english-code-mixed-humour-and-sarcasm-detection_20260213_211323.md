# Revealing the impact of synthetic native samples and multi-tasking strategies in Hindi-English code-mixed humour and sarcasm detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.12761
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12761
- Authors: Debajyoti Mazumder; Aakash Kumar; Jasabanta Patro
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Native sample mixing and multi-task learning significantly improve Hindi-English code-mixed humor and sarcasm detection

## Executive Summary
This study investigates methods to improve Hindi-English code-mixed humor and sarcasm detection through native sample mixing and multi-task learning strategies. The authors demonstrate that incorporating native English and synthetic Hindi samples into code-mixed training data yields substantial performance gains for multilingual language models, with F1-score improvements of up to 6.76% for humor and 8.64% for sarcasm detection. Multi-task learning, combining humor and sarcasm detection with hate detection, produces even more significant improvements of up to 10.67% and 12.35% F1-score gains respectively.

The research systematically compares these approaches against prompting and instruction fine-tuning of very large multilingual language models, finding that the native sample mixing and multi-task learning strategies consistently outperform these alternatives. The study includes comprehensive ablation studies and error analysis to understand the factors contributing to model performance and identify remaining limitations in the detection systems.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comprehensive experimental framework testing multiple approaches for Hindi-English code-mixed humor and sarcasm detection. Native sample mixing involves combining code-mixed data with both native English samples and synthetically generated Hindi samples during training. Multi-task learning integrates humor and sarcasm detection with hate detection as auxiliary tasks. The experiments compare these methods against baseline multilingual language models and evaluate prompting and instruction fine-tuning approaches using very large multilingual models. The methodology includes systematic ablation studies and error analysis to understand performance factors and limitations.

## Key Results
- Native sample mixing improved F1-scores by up to 6.76% for humor and 8.64% for sarcasm detection
- Multi-task learning with hate detection yielded F1-score improvements of up to 10.67% for humor and 12.35% for sarcasm
- Prompting and instruction fine-tuning of very large multilingual language models did not outperform native sample mixing and multi-task learning approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of native sample mixing stems from providing multilingual language models with broader linguistic context across language boundaries. By exposing models to native English samples, they gain better understanding of English language patterns that appear in code-mixed text. Synthetic Hindi samples help models handle Hindi language components more effectively, reducing confusion when switching between languages. The multi-task learning approach leverages shared linguistic features between humor, sarcasm, and hate detection, allowing models to learn more robust representations that generalize across related tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Code-mixing dynamics**: Understanding how languages blend in informal communication is crucial because it reveals why standard monolingual approaches fail on mixed-language text. Quick check: analyze code-mixed sentence structure patterns across different language pairs.
- **Synthetic data generation quality**: The effectiveness depends on generating realistic synthetic samples that maintain the characteristics of the target language while fitting naturally into code-mixed contexts. Quick check: human evaluation of synthetic sample naturalness and appropriateness.
- **Multi-task learning optimization**: The success of combining tasks relies on proper task weighting and learning rate scheduling to prevent negative transfer between tasks. Quick check: monitor task-specific loss curves during training to detect optimization issues.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input -> Native Sample Mixer -> Multi-task Learner -> Output Predictor
Critical path: Data preparation → Model training → Evaluation → Error analysis

Design tradeoffs:
1. Native sample ratio: Balancing native and code-mixed samples to optimize performance without losing code-mixed specificity
2. Task weighting: Determining appropriate weights for humor, sarcasm, and hate detection tasks in multi-task learning
3. Synthetic data quality vs. quantity: Trade-off between generating more synthetic samples and ensuring their quality and relevance

Failure signatures:
1. Overfitting to native samples when mixing ratio is too high
2. Negative transfer between tasks in multi-task learning when task correlations are weak
3. Synthetic sample generation producing unnatural or context-inappropriate content

First experiments:
1. Test different native sample mixing ratios (10%, 25%, 50%) to find optimal balance
2. Evaluate multi-task learning with different task combinations to identify most effective auxiliary tasks
3. Compare synthetic Hindi sample generation methods to determine best approach for maintaining code-mixed authenticity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are specific to Hindi-English code-mixed data, limiting generalizability to other language pairs
- Synthetic Hindi samples' quality and generation methodology lack thorough documentation
- Hate detection task may have different data distribution characteristics than humor and sarcasm tasks

## Confidence
High Confidence: Native sample mixing F1-score improvements (6.76% humor, 8.64% sarcasm) are well-supported by experimental methodology
Medium Confidence: Comparison with prompting approaches may be limited by specific implementation choices
Medium Confidence: Error analysis is primarily qualitative without systematic categorization

## Next Checks
1. Replicate native sample mixing with synthetic data generation controlled by human evaluation to assess data quality impact
2. Test multi-task learning framework with different task combinations (humor/sarcasm with sentiment analysis or emotion detection) to validate generalizability
3. Conduct systematic error analysis using predefined error categories across all model variants to better understand where improvements come from
