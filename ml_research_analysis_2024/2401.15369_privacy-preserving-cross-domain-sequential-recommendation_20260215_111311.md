# Privacy-Preserving Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.15369
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15369
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: PriCDSR outperforms single-domain recommenders while protecting privacy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PriCDSR, a privacy-preserving framework for cross-domain sequential recommendation that protects user privacy through differential privacy mechanisms. The framework is designed to be non-invasive, allowing integration with any existing cross-domain sequential recommender system without modifications to the base model. By considering both ID information and order information in its differential privacy definition, PriCDSR provides theoretical privacy guarantees while maintaining recommendation performance across multiple domains.

## Method Summary
PriCDSR introduces a novel differential privacy definition that considers both user ID information and sequential order information, then designs a random mechanism that satisfies this privacy definition. The framework operates non-invasively by adding noise to the data or intermediate representations of existing cross-domain sequential recommender systems. This approach allows PriCDSR to preserve privacy without requiring changes to the base recommendation algorithms, making it compatible with various cross-domain recommendation architectures.

## Key Results
- PriCDSR outperforms recommender systems using data from a single domain despite introducing noise
- The framework provides theoretical privacy guarantees while maintaining recommendation quality
- Experiments demonstrate effectiveness across three different domain combinations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PriCDSR works by defining a new differential privacy framework that captures both user identity and sequential information, then injecting carefully calibrated noise that satisfies this privacy definition. The non-invasive design allows it to leverage the strengths of existing cross-domain sequential recommenders while adding privacy protection without algorithmic modifications.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Differential Privacy** - Mathematical framework for quantifying information leakage; needed to formally define and prove privacy guarantees
2. **Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation** - Techniques for leveraging user behavior across multiple domains; needed as the target application domain
3. **Random Mechanism Design** - Methods for adding noise while preserving utility; needed to satisfy differential privacy while maintaining recommendation quality

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** User data -> Privacy mechanism -> Base recommender -> Recommendations

**Critical Path:** The core flow processes user interaction data through the privacy-preserving mechanism before it reaches the base recommender, ensuring all data exposure satisfies differential privacy constraints.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades some recommendation accuracy for privacy protection, but the non-invasive design minimizes this tradeoff by preserving the base model's architecture.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation may occur when privacy budgets are too conservative or when the base recommender is highly sensitive to input perturbations.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test privacy-utility tradeoff with varying privacy budgets, 2) Evaluate compatibility with different base recommender architectures, 3) Measure privacy leakage under different attack scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Static privacy budgets don't adapt to user behavior or domain characteristics
- Noise injection may cause variable performance degradation across different base models
- Evaluation limited to three specific domains, limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- High: Theoretical privacy guarantees and differential privacy proof are robust
- Medium: Experimental superiority over single-domain approaches is convincing but domain-dependent
- Low: Scalability to larger domains and real-world privacy constraints remain uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate PriCDSR across a broader range of domain pairs, including non-obvious combinations
2. Conduct ablation studies varying privacy budgets to quantify the privacy-utility tradeoff
3. Implement dynamic privacy budget allocation that adapts to user activity levels and compare performance
