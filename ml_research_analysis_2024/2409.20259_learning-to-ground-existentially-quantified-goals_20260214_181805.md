core_contribution: This work addresses the problem of grounding existentially quantified
  goals in planning by learning a value function that predicts the cost of partially
  quantified goals over small instances and generalizes to larger ones with more objects
  and variables. The method uses a relational graph neural network (R-GNN) trained
  in a supervised manner to predict the cost of different goal bindings, enabling
  a greedy algorithm to sequentially ground variables.

# Learning to Ground Existentially Quantified Goals

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2409.20259
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20259
- **Reference count:** 14
- **Key outcome:** Method learns to ground existentially quantified goals using a relational GNN, achieving >95% coverage with significant speedups over LAMA planner

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the problem of grounding existentially quantified goals in planning by learning a value function that predicts the cost of partially quantified goals over small instances and generalizes to larger ones with more objects and variables. The method uses a relational graph neural network (R-GNN) trained in a supervised manner to predict the cost of different goal bindings, enabling a greedy algorithm to sequentially ground variables. Experiments across multiple domains show that the learned model achieves high coverage (over 95% in most cases), producing valid and reachable groundings with costs close to optimal (ratios near 1.2) while achieving significant speedups (often over an order of magnitude) compared to standard planners like LAMA. The approach scales well with instance size and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities.

## Method Summary
The approach learns a value function using a relational graph neural network that predicts the cost of partially quantified goals. The R-GNN is trained on small instances where all possible groundings are computable. During grounding, a greedy algorithm sequentially selects variable bindings based on the learned value function's predictions. The method handles existentially quantified goals by predicting costs for different bindings and selecting the combination that minimizes total cost while maintaining validity and reachability.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 95% coverage across multiple planning domains
- Produces groundings with costs close to optimal (ratios near 1.2)
- Demonstrates significant speedups (often over an order of magnitude) compared to LAMA planner
- Scales well with instance size and shows strong generalization to larger instances

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by learning to predict the cost of partially grounded goals, allowing the greedy algorithm to make informed decisions about variable bindings. The R-GNN architecture captures relational structure in the planning domain, enabling the model to generalize from small training instances to larger test instances. By predicting costs rather than directly generating groundings, the approach can handle the combinatorial complexity of the grounding problem while maintaining flexibility to adapt to different domain structures.

## Foundational Learning
- **Existential Quantification in Planning:** Understanding how existentially quantified goals create combinatorial complexity in planning
  - *Why needed:* Forms the core problem being addressed
  - *Quick check:* Can you explain why existentially quantified goals are harder than universally quantified ones?

- **Relational Graph Neural Networks:** Neural networks that operate on graph-structured data and preserve relational information
  - *Why needed:* Enables learning from structured planning domains and generalization across instances
  - *Quick check:* Do you understand how R-GNNs differ from standard GNNs in handling relational data?

- **Value Function Learning:** Supervised learning of functions that predict costs or values in decision-making problems
  - *Why needed:* Core mechanism for predicting grounding costs without exhaustive search
  - *Quick check:* Can you describe how value function learning differs from policy learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Training Data -> R-GNN Model -> Value Function -> Greedy Grounding Algorithm -> Grounded Goals

**Critical Path:**
The critical execution path is: R-GNN prediction → Greedy variable selection → Variable binding → Next variable prediction, repeated until all variables are grounded.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The approach trades optimality guarantees for computational efficiency by using a greedy algorithm instead of exhaustive search. It assumes that accurate value function predictions will lead to good grounding decisions, which may not hold in all domains. The R-GNN architecture balances expressiveness with generalization capability.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor performance when value function cannot accurately predict costs for certain bindings
- Local minima trapping when early greedy decisions limit later options
- Degradation when training data doesn't capture domain complexity

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test grounding performance on a simple domain with known optimal solutions to establish baseline accuracy
2. Evaluate generalization by training on small instances and testing on larger ones with more objects
3. Compare speed and coverage against LAMA planner on the same benchmark suite

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Requires supervised learning data from small instances, which may not capture all failure modes
- Greedy algorithm may get stuck in local minima when value function makes suboptimal predictions
- Assumes initial grounding can be computed efficiently, which may not hold in complex domains

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Empirical speedups and scalability results are well-supported by experimental data across multiple domains
- **Medium Confidence:** Generalization claims to larger instances rely on assumption that learned value function captures domain structure adequately
- **Medium Confidence:** Claims about validity and reachability depend on quality of value function predictions and greedy algorithm's ability to find feasible sequences

## Next Checks
1. Test method on domains with complex variable dependencies that challenge R-GNN architecture to identify failure modes
2. Evaluate impact of training data composition (successful vs failed groundings) on coverage performance
3. Compare against alternative grounding strategies (random search, constraint satisfaction) on same benchmark suite
