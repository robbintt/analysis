# Leveraging 3D LiDAR Sensors to Enable Enhanced Urban Safety and Public Health: Pedestrian Monitoring and Abnormal Activity Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.10978
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10978
- Authors: Nawfal Guefrachi; Jian Shi; Hakim Ghazzai; Ahmad Alsharoa

- Primary result: Proposed framework achieves F1-score of 82.91% for pedestrian detection and 84.32% for vehicle detection using modified PV-RCNN

## Executive Summary
This study addresses pedestrian safety and public health monitoring in urban environments by leveraging 3D LiDAR and IoT technologies. The proposed framework uses a modified PV-RCNN for robust 3D object detection and PointNet for classifying pedestrian activities into normal and abnormal categories. A synthetic dataset of 21 urban scenarios was generated using Blender to overcome real-world data scarcity. Experimental results show the framework's effectiveness in enhancing urban safety through precise pedestrian behavior monitoring while maintaining privacy by using LiDAR technology.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a two-stage approach: first, a modified PV-RCNN processes 3D point clouds from LiDAR sensors to detect vehicles and pedestrians with high accuracy. Second, PointNet classifies pedestrian activities as normal or abnormal based on their spatial point cloud representations. The synthetic dataset was generated in Blender with 21 urban scenarios containing various pedestrian activities and environmental conditions. The system processes point clouds containing over 350,000 points per frame across 550-2500 frames per scene, achieving robust detection and classification performance.

## Key Results
- PV-RCNN achieves F1-score of 82.91% for pedestrian detection and 84.32% for vehicle detection
- PointNet outperforms voxel-based MLP, achieving 83.92% overall accuracy in activity classification
- Classification precision reaches 84.51% for normal behaviors and 82.74% for abnormal behaviors
- The synthetic dataset contains 21 urban scenarios with over 350,000 points per frame

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LiDAR provides dense 3D point clouds that capture spatial geometry and reflectivity, enabling robust object detection and behavior classification. LiDAR sensors emit laser pulses and measure return times to generate 3D point clouds containing spatial coordinates and intensity values that help distinguish objects and detect abnormal movement patterns. Core assumption: Point cloud data is sufficiently dense and accurate to allow meaningful separation of normal vs. abnormal pedestrian behaviors. Evidence: "By employing elevated LiDAR, we obtain detailed 3D point cloud data, enabling precise pedestrian activity monitoring." Break condition: If LiDAR returns are sparse or occluded by tall vehicles/buildings, point clouds will lack sufficient resolution for reliable activity classification.

### Mechanism 2
The modified PV-RCNN architecture combines voxel and point features for robust 3D object detection, outperforming voxel-only methods like SECOND. PV-RCNN uses voxel feature encoding for global context and point-wise feature abstraction for local detail, leveraging both coarse voxel-level understanding and fine-grained point-level precision. Core assumption: Fusing voxel and point features captures complementary information not available in voxel-only models. Evidence: "PV-RCNN blends point and voxel features for detailed 3D detection, whereas SECOND emphasizes speed with a voxel-only approach." Break condition: If point cloud density is too low, the point abstraction stage cannot extract meaningful local features.

### Mechanism 3
PointNet architecture enables effective classification of pedestrian activities by maintaining permutation invariance while extracting spatial features from point clouds. PointNet uses shared MLPs and max-pooling to process unordered point sets, creating a global feature vector that captures shape characteristics for binary classification (normal vs. abnormal). Core assumption: The spatial arrangement of points in a pedestrian's bounding box encodes sufficient behavioral information for classification. Evidence: "PointNet uniquely processes 3D point cloud data, maintaining consistency despite different transformations, highlighting its role in 3D perception tasks." Break condition: If activities are too similar in spatial configuration, the point cloud features may not be discriminative enough.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: 3D point cloud data representation and processing
  - Why needed here: The entire framework relies on interpreting LiDAR-generated point clouds for both detection and classification tasks.
  - Quick check question: What information does each point in a 3D point cloud typically contain?

- Concept: Object detection metrics (AP, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
  - Why needed here: These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the PV-RCNN model in detecting pedestrians and vehicles.
  - Quick check question: How does F1-Score balance Precision and Recall?

- Concept: Activity classification in computer vision
  - Why needed here: PointNet is used to classify pedestrian activities as normal or abnormal, requiring understanding of binary classification evaluation.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Precision and Recall in a binary classification task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Blender simulator -> Synthetic 3D point cloud data -> PV-RCNN detection -> PointNet classification -> Activity-labeled bounding boxes

- Critical path:
  1. Generate synthetic dataset in Blender
  2. Annotate data with bounding boxes and activity labels
  3. Train PV-RCNN for 3D object detection
  4. Extract pedestrian point clouds from detected bounding boxes
  5. Train PointNet for activity classification
  6. Deploy system for real-time monitoring

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Synthetic vs. real data: Synthetic data allows controlled generation of abnormal scenarios but may lack real-world complexity
  - PV-RCNN vs. voxel-only: Hybrid approach provides better accuracy but higher computational cost
  - PointNet vs. voxel-based MLP: Direct point processing maintains spatial detail but may be less efficient than voxel methods

- Failure signatures:
  - High false positives in detection: Likely caused by insufficient point cloud density or poor bounding box dimension tuning
  - Poor activity classification: May indicate that abnormal activities are not spatially distinct enough in the point cloud representation
  - System lag: Could be due to inefficient processing pipeline or insufficient computational resources

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate PV-RCNN detection on a small subset of annotated data to establish baseline performance before full training
  2. Test PointNet classification on manually labeled pedestrian point clouds to verify the activity labeling scheme
  3. Run end-to-end pipeline on a single synthetic scene to identify bottlenecks and integration issues

## Limitations
- Synthetic dataset generation methodology lacks detail on real-world representativeness with no validation against actual LiDAR sensor data

## Next Checks
1. Validate the framework on real-world LiDAR data collected from actual urban environments, comparing performance against synthetic data results
