# SecureLLM: Using Compositionality to Build Provably Secure Language Models for Private, Sensitive, and Secret Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.09805
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09805
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Provably secure LLM deployment using compositionality that prevents data leakage across silos

## Executive Summary
SecureLLM addresses the challenge of deploying large language models in environments with multiple data silos where access control is critical. The core innovation reflects the compositional nature of security permissions directly into the model architecture: each data silo has its own fine-tuned model, and users can only access the combination of fine-tunings for silos they're permitted to see. This compositionality approach provides mathematical guarantees that models cannot learn or leak information from unauthorized silos, solving a fundamental security problem in multi-tenant LLM deployments.

The paper demonstrates that existing fine-tuning composition methods fail when applied to natural-language-to-SQL translation tasks that require joins across multiple databases. SecureLLM introduces two new composition methods - Maximum Difference and Logit Composition - that significantly outperform prior approaches while maintaining provable security guarantees. The work bridges the gap between theoretical security requirements and practical LLM deployment in sensitive environments.

## Method Summary
SecureLLM implements a compositional fine-tuning approach where each data silo maintains its own fine-tuned language model. When a user with specific access permissions needs to query across multiple silos, the system composes the corresponding fine-tuned models using novel composition techniques. The key insight is that by fine-tuning separate models for each silo and only allowing composition of authorized fine-tunings, the system provably prevents information leakage between silos.

The composition methods - Maximum Difference and Logit Composition - work by combining the output logits of individual fine-tuned models in ways that preserve both the query-answering capabilities and the security guarantees. Maximum Difference selects the maximum logit values across fine-tunings, while Logit Composition uses weighted combinations. These methods are specifically designed to handle the compositional nature of SQL queries that span multiple data sources while maintaining the security boundary between silos.

## Key Results
- SecureLLM achieves normalized tree edit distances of 0.21-0.42 on compositional SQL tasks, compared to 1.88-2.06 for existing methods like LoraHub and PEM Addition
- Performance approaches insecure baselines (0.08-0.11) while providing provable security guarantees
- The compositional approach prevents any information leakage between unauthorized data silos
- Maximum Difference and Logit Composition significantly outperform traditional composition methods in the multi-silo setting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SecureLLM works by leveraging the mathematical structure of fine-tuning composition to create an information barrier between data silos. When each silo is fine-tuned independently, the knowledge learned remains localized within that fine-tuning. The composition methods ensure that only authorized combinations of fine-tunings can be accessed, preventing any cross-silo information transfer. This compositional structure directly mirrors the access control requirements, making the security guarantees provable rather than heuristic.

The mechanism relies on the fact that fine-tuned models learn distinct representations for their specific data contexts. By composing only authorized fine-tunings, the system creates a new model that can answer queries across multiple silos while never having direct access to any unauthorized data. The composition operations (Maximum Difference and Logit Composition) are designed to merge these localized representations in ways that preserve query-answering capabilities while maintaining the isolation boundaries.

## Foundational Learning
- Compositionality in security - Why needed: To align technical implementation with access control policies; Quick check: Verify that each silo's fine-tuning contains only its authorized data
- Fine-tuning isolation - Why needed: To prevent information bleed between silos; Quick check: Test that fine-tuned models cannot answer questions about unauthorized data
- Logit composition operations - Why needed: To merge model capabilities while preserving security; Quick check: Validate that composition produces reasonable query responses
- Provable security guarantees - Why needed: To move beyond heuristic security approaches; Quick check: Formal verification that composition cannot leak unauthorized information
- Natural language to SQL translation - Why needed: Real-world use case requiring cross-silo queries; Quick check: Test SQL generation accuracy across multiple databases

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: User Request -> Access Control -> Model Composition -> SQL Generation -> Database Query

Critical path: The most critical path is Access Control -> Model Composition, as any failure here directly violates security guarantees. The system must correctly identify authorized fine-tunings and compose them appropriately before any query processing can occur.

Design tradeoffs: The primary tradeoff is between security guarantees and functional performance. SecureLLM sacrifices some accuracy compared to insecure baselines to achieve provable security. Another tradeoff is computational overhead - composing multiple fine-tunings is more expensive than using a single model with full data access.

Failure signatures: Security failures would manifest as SQL queries that access unauthorized data or return results containing information from prohibited silos. Performance failures appear as degraded query accuracy or increased latency due to the composition overhead. Composition failures result in nonsensical or incorrect SQL queries that don't properly join across silos.

Three first experiments:
1. Verify that individual fine-tuned models cannot answer questions about unauthorized data
2. Test composition accuracy on simple queries involving two authorized silos
3. Validate that composition of unauthorized fine-tunings is prevented by the access control system

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges several open questions but does not provide detailed discussion of them in the available content.

## Limitations
- Experimental evaluation limited to synthetic dataset, limiting generalizability to real-world scenarios
- Performance gap remains between SecureLLM and insecure baselines, indicating functional tradeoffs
- Computational overhead of composing multiple fine-tunings may impact practical deployment scalability
- Normalized tree edit distance metric may not fully capture practical security or usability concerns

## Confidence

High confidence in theoretical security guarantees and compositionality framework
Medium confidence in practical effectiveness given limited synthetic data evaluation
Low confidence in scalability and performance for real-world deployments

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SecureLLM on real-world datasets with actual sensitive data and complex join queries to assess practical performance
2. Conduct security penetration testing to verify that the compositionality-based isolation cannot be circumvented through query optimization or other attacks
3. Benchmark the computational overhead and latency introduced by the compositionality approach compared to existing methods, particularly for multi-silo queries
