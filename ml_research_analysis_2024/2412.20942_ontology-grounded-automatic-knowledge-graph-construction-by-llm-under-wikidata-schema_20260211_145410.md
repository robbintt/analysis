# Ontology-grounded Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction by LLM under Wikidata schema
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.20942
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20942
- Reference count: 33
- This paper introduces an ontology-grounded approach for knowledge graph construction using LLMs under Wikidata schema, demonstrating competitive performance with improved interpretability and interoperability.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an ontology-grounded approach for automatic knowledge graph construction using large language models under the Wikidata schema. The method generates competency questions from documents, extracts relations, matches them with Wikidata properties, and grounds KG generation on the resulting ontology. Experiments on Wiki-NRE, SciERC, and WebNLG datasets show competitive performance compared to fine-tuned and LLM baselines, with improvements in interpretability and interoperability with Wikidata. The approach demonstrates potential for scalable KG construction with minimal human intervention.

## Method Summary
The approach follows a multi-stage pipeline: first, competency questions are generated from input documents using LLMs; second, relations are extracted from these questions; third, extracted relations are matched to Wikidata properties; and finally, the knowledge graph is constructed based on the ontology grounded in Wikidata. This ontology-grounded approach leverages Wikidata's structured schema to ensure consistency and interoperability while maintaining interpretability through the traceable competency question generation process.

## Key Results
- Competitive performance compared to fine-tuned and LLM baselines on Wiki-NRE, SciERC, and WebNLG datasets
- Improved interpretability through traceable competency question generation
- Enhanced interoperability with Wikidata schema enabling seamless integration with existing knowledge bases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by grounding knowledge graph construction in a formal ontology based on Wikidata properties, which provides a standardized schema that ensures consistency across extracted relations. The competency question generation serves as an interpretable intermediate representation that bridges natural language documents and structured knowledge graphs, allowing human validation and error correction. By matching extracted relations to established Wikidata properties, the method leverages the quality and coverage of Wikidata while maintaining the flexibility of LLM-based extraction.

## Foundational Learning
- Competency questions: Why needed - bridge natural language to formal ontology; Quick check - verify questions accurately represent document content
- Wikidata property schema: Why needed - provides standardized ontology for KG consistency; Quick check - validate property matching accuracy
- Ontology grounding: Why needed - ensures semantic consistency and interoperability; Quick check - assess ontology coverage and completeness
- Relation extraction: Why needed - identifies entity relationships from text; Quick check - measure precision/recall of extracted triples
- LLM-based pipeline: Why needed - enables zero-shot learning without fine-tuning; Quick check - benchmark against fine-tuned baselines

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Document -> Competency Question Generation -> Relation Extraction -> Wikidata Property Matching -> KG Construction
- Critical path: The property matching stage is critical as errors here propagate to the final KG structure and semantic accuracy
- Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. computational overhead - multi-stage LLM pipeline increases accuracy but also inference time and resource requirements
- Failure signatures: Incorrect property matching leads to semantically inconsistent KGs; poor competency questions result in incomplete relation extraction
- First experiments: 1) Benchmark property matching accuracy against Wikidata's own entity linking, 2) Measure competency question generation quality through human evaluation, 3) Compare KG construction time with fine-tuned models across different document volumes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope focused on three benchmark datasets without real-world heterogeneous data testing
- Performance trade-offs not quantified - computational overhead of ontology grounding is unclear
- Heavy dependency on Wikidata schema quality with no error propagation analysis from property matching failures

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Core methodology is technically sound and experimental results on benchmark datasets are verifiable
- Medium Confidence: Claims about interpretability and interoperability improvements lack quantitative metrics
- Low Confidence: Scalability claims are speculative without evidence beyond controlled benchmark datasets

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to measure performance impact of each pipeline component and identify bottlenecks
2. Test approach on domain-specific knowledge graphs where Wikidata coverage may be incomplete to assess robustness
3. Perform runtime and resource utilization analysis comparing ontology-grounded approach against fine-tuned baselines across different model sizes
