# A Finite-Sample Analysis of an Actor-Critic Algorithm for Mean-Variance Optimization in a Discounted MDP

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.07892
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07892
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First finite-sample analysis of temporal difference learning for mean-variance optimization in discounted MDPs with linear function approximation

## Executive Summary
This paper provides the first finite-sample analysis of a temporal difference learning algorithm for mean-variance optimization in a discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP). The algorithm estimates both the value function and variance using linear function approximation, incorporating a cross-term in the Bellman equation that complicates the analysis. The authors derive mean-squared error bounds that decay exponentially for initial error and exhibit O(1/t) convergence after t iterations. They also present high-probability bounds using tail averaging, achieving sub-Gaussian concentration. Regularization enables universal step-size selection while maintaining the same convergence rate.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze a temporal difference learning algorithm that jointly estimates the value function and variance in a discounted MDP using linear function approximation. The algorithm incorporates a cross-term in the Bellman equation that couples the value and variance estimates. The analysis provides mean-squared error bounds that decay exponentially for initial error and exhibit O(1/t) convergence after t iterations. High-probability bounds using tail averaging techniques achieve sub-Gaussian concentration. Regularization is introduced to enable universal step-size selection while maintaining convergence rates.

## Key Results
- Mean-squared error bounds decay exponentially for initial error and exhibit O(1/t) convergence after t iterations
- High-probability bounds using tail averaging achieve sub-Gaussian concentration
- Regularization enables universal step-size selection while maintaining the same convergence rate

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by jointly estimating the value function and variance in a discounted MDP using linear function approximation. The key innovation is incorporating a cross-term in the Bellman equation that couples the value and variance estimates, allowing for simultaneous learning of both quantities. The exponential decay of initial error and O(1/t) convergence rates are achieved through careful analysis of the coupled learning process. The use of tail averaging techniques enables the derivation of high-probability bounds with sub-Gaussian concentration. Regularization is introduced to stabilize the learning process and enable universal step-size selection, which is critical for practical implementation.

## Foundational Learning

### Linear Function Approximation (LFA)
- **Why needed**: Enables generalization across states and actions by projecting value and variance estimates onto a linear subspace defined by feature vectors
- **Quick check**: Verify that feature matrix has full column rank and satisfies compatibility conditions with the Markov chain

### Temporal Difference (TD) Learning
- **Why needed**: Provides a sample-based method to iteratively update value and variance estimates without requiring full knowledge of the MDP dynamics
- **Quick check**: Ensure that TD errors are properly bounded and that the Markov chain satisfies mixing conditions

### Cross-Term in Bellman Equation
- **Why needed**: Captures the coupling between value and variance estimates, which is essential for accurate risk-sensitive policy evaluation
- **Quick check**: Verify that the cross-term is properly incorporated in the update rules and that it converges to zero as estimates improve

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
LFA features -> TD learning algorithm -> Value and variance estimates -> Actor update

### Critical Path
The critical path involves the TD learning algorithm updating the value and variance estimates based on sampled transitions and LFA features. These estimates are then used by the actor to update the policy. The regularization term plays a crucial role in stabilizing the learning process and enabling universal step-size selection.

### Design Tradeoffs
The main tradeoff is between the expressiveness of the LFA features and the stability of the learning process. More expressive features may lead to better approximation but can also cause instability. Regularization helps mitigate this tradeoff by stabilizing the learning process, but the optimal regularization parameter selection strategy remains unclear.

### Failure Signatures
- Slow convergence or divergence of value and variance estimates
- High variance in the estimates, indicating instability in the learning process
- Poor policy performance, suggesting that the estimates are not accurately capturing the risk-sensitive value function

### First Experiments
1. Evaluate the convergence of the TD learning algorithm on a simple MDP with known value and variance functions
2. Assess the impact of different LFA feature mappings on the accuracy of the value and variance estimates
3. Test the actor update using the learned estimates on a benchmark MDP to evaluate the overall policy performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations
- Assumes linear function approximation with a fixed feature mapping, which may not capture complex state-action relationships
- Exponential decay of initial error and O(1/t) convergence rates depend on strong assumptions about feature matrix and Markov chain properties
- High-probability bounds rely on tail averaging techniques, but practical implementation and computational overhead is not discussed
- Regularization approach enabling universal step-size selection is theoretically sound, but optimal parameter selection strategy remains unclear
- Analysis focuses on critic component, with actor update receiving only brief mention, leaving open questions about full actor-critic algorithm's performance

## Confidence
- Theoretical convergence rates: High
- Sub-Gaussian concentration bounds: Medium
- Practical applicability of regularization: Medium
- Full actor-critic algorithm performance: Low

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation of the theoretical convergence rates on benchmark MDPs with varying feature qualities
2. Sensitivity analysis of the algorithm to the choice of regularization parameter and step-size
3. Experimental comparison of the actor-critic method against existing risk-sensitive RL algorithms in both synthetic and real-world domains
