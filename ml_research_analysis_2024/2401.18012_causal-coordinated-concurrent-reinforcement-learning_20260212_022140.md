# Causal Coordinated Concurrent Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.18012
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18012
- Reference count: 16
- One-line primary result: ANM-MM causal inference with GMM clustering and coordinated exploration achieves superior learning speeds in concurrent RL with non-identical environments

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a framework for concurrent reinforcement learning where agents operate in non-identical environments sharing a global structure but exhibiting individual variations. The method uses Additive Noise Model-Mixture Model (ANM-MM) causal inference to extract model parameters characterizing individual differences, then employs Gaussian Mixture Model clustering to determine similarity metrics for intelligent data sharing. The algorithm also introduces a sampling-based coordinated action selection heuristic that encourages diverse exploration in sparse reward settings. Experiments on autoregressive, pendulum, and cart-pole swing-up tasks demonstrate superior learning speeds compared to baselines including naive global sharing, individual learning, and seed sampling approaches.

## Method Summary
The method extracts latent model parameters from non-identical MDPs using ANM-MM causal inference, where state transition models share a functional form parameterized by ξ and reward functions share a form parameterized by ω, but with different parameter values per agent. Gaussian Mixture Model clustering groups agents by similarity of extracted parameters, informing a data-sharing scheme where similar agents exchange more data. Coordinated exploration uses Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes to perturb actions, encouraging diverse state visitation in sparse reward settings. The framework is implemented with DDPG learners using specific network architectures and is evaluated across multiple benchmark tasks.

## Key Results
- ANM-MM with GMM clustering and coordinated exploration outperforms naive global sharing, individual learning, and seed sampling baselines
- The method demonstrates superior learning speeds on autoregressive, pendulum, and cart-pole swing-up tasks
- Coordinated exploration successfully encourages diverse state visitation in sparse reward settings where individual exploration fails

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Non-identical environments can be modeled by a shared global structure plus individual variations, enabling efficient data sharing
- Mechanism: ANM-MM extracts latent model parameters that characterize individual differences while preserving shared causal structure. GMM clustering groups agents by similarity of these parameters, informing data sharing where similar agents exchange more data
- Core assumption: State transition models share the same functional form parameterized by ξ, and reward functions share the same form parameterized by ω, but with different parameter values per agent
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "uses ANM-MM causal inference to extract model parameters characterizing individual differences"; [section 2.2] "state transition models of all agents have the same functional form which is parameterized by ξ"
- Break condition: If the assumption of shared functional form is violated, parameter extraction and clustering would fail to capture meaningful similarities

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Coordinated action selection encourages diverse exploration in sparse reward settings, leading to faster discovery of reward regions
- Mechanism: Each agent samples a mean from N(0, σ²) and uses an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to perturb actions. The noise scale σ is annealed over time. This causes similar agents in similar states to take different actions, promoting exploration of diverse state regions
- Core assumption: In sparse reward settings, agents benefit from coordinated exploration where similar agents take diverse actions to efficiently cover the state space
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "introduces a simple sampling-based coordinated action selection heuristic that encourages diverse exploration in sparse reward settings"; [section 3.3] "intuition tells us that two similar agents should take different actions if they also happen to be in similar states"
- Break condition: If rewards are dense rather than sparse, exploration benefits may be outweighed by exploration-exploitation tradeoff costs

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The extracted model parameters serve as a balancing score for covariate adjustment, enabling transportability of learned policies across environments
- Mechanism: The θ parameters extracted via ANM-MM satisfy conditions for being a balancing score (finer than propensity score, policy ignorable given θ). This allows computation of policy performance across different environments using the formula involving P(θ|e*)
- Core assumption: All environment realizations vary only by parameter θ and are otherwise the same (Assumption 1 in section 3.4.1)
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.4] "θ IS FINER THAN THE PROPENSITY SCORE because there exists an f such that g(E) = f(θ)"
- Break condition: If environments differ in ways beyond the θ parameterization, the balancing score assumption fails and transportability breaks down

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal inference via Additive Noise Models
  - Why needed here: To separate shared global structure from individual variations across non-identical MDPs
  - Quick check question: How does the HSIC regularization term enforce independence between causes and noise in ANM-MM?

- Concept: Gaussian Mixture Model clustering
  - Why needed here: To identify groups of agents with similar underlying dynamics for informed data sharing
  - Quick check question: What does the soft assignment vector v_n represent in the GMM clustering step?

- Concept: Coordinated exploration via action perturbation
  - Why needed here: To encourage diverse state visitation in sparse reward settings where individual exploration may fail
  - Quick check question: How does the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process ensure temporally correlated exploration noise?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  ANM-MM module -> GMM clustering module -> Data sharing controller -> Coordinated exploration module -> DDPG learners

- Critical path: Data collection → ANM-MM parameter extraction → GMM clustering → Similarity matrix computation → Data sharing coordination → Coordinated action selection → Policy updates

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Batch size: Larger batches benefit from data sharing but increase computation
  - Number of GMM components: More components capture finer distinctions but require more data
  - Noise annealing schedule: Faster annealing reduces exploration but may miss sparse rewards

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor parameter extraction: GMM clusters become random, data sharing provides no benefit
  - Incorrect similarity metrics: Dissimilar agents share data, performance degrades
  - Over-exploration: High noise prevents convergence to optimal policies

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run ANM-MM on synthetic data with known parameter differences to verify extraction accuracy
  2. Test GMM clustering on extracted parameters to ensure meaningful groupings form
  3. Validate coordinated exploration on a sparse reward gridworld where individual exploration fails but coordinated succeeds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of ANM-MM compare to other causal inference methods (like IGCI, PNL, or LiNGAM) in extracting model parameters for concurrent reinforcement learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that ANM-MM is chosen over other causal inference methods like IGCI, PNL, and LiNGAM because it assumes multiple causal models for observations
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical comparisons between ANM-MM and other causal inference methods in the context of CRL
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing the performance of ANM-MM against other causal inference methods in extracting model parameters for concurrent reinforcement learning tasks

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed coordinated exploration heuristic perform under different reward structures, particularly in tasks with highly sparse rewards or delayed rewards?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the coordinated exploration heuristic under sparse reward settings, but does not explore its performance under other reward structures
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on sparse reward settings and does not provide evidence of the heuristic's performance under other reward structures
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the performance of the coordinated exploration heuristic under various reward structures, including highly sparse and delayed rewards

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed method scale with the number of agents and the complexity of the environment?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on tasks with 20 agents, but does not explore its performance with a larger number of agents or more complex environments
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide evidence of the method's scalability with respect to the number of agents or the complexity of the environment
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the performance of the proposed method with varying numbers of agents and environmental complexities

## Limitations

- The method relies heavily on the assumption that all agents share the same functional form with only parameter variations
- ANM-MM parameter extraction and balancing score framework lack direct validation on real-world non-identical environments
- The coordinated exploration mechanism, while theoretically sound, has weak empirical validation in truly sparse reward settings

## Confidence

- **High**: The fundamental framework of using similarity-based data sharing in concurrent RL is well-established
- **Medium**: The ANM-MM parameter extraction and GMM clustering approach for identifying agent similarities
- **Medium**: The coordinated exploration mechanism using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes
- **Low**: The balancing score interpretation and its implications for policy transportability

## Next Checks

1. Validate ANM-MM parameter extraction on synthetic datasets with known parameter variations to verify accuracy and robustness to noise levels
2. Test GMM clustering performance on extracted parameters across varying numbers of agents and environment differences
3. Evaluate coordinated exploration in sparse reward gridworlds with controlled reward densities to measure exploration efficiency gains
