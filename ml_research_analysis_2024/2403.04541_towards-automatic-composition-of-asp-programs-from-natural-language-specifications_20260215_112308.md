core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of automating the composition
  of Answer Set Programming (ASP) programs from natural language specifications. The
  proposed solution, NL2ASP, is a two-step architecture that uses neural machine translation
  to convert natural language statements into Controlled Natural Language (CNL) propositions,
  which are then transformed into ASP code using the CNL2ASP tool.

# Towards Automatic Composition of ASP Programs from Natural Language Specifications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.04541
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04541
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: NL2ASP achieves BLEU-4 scores up to 0.96 and METEOR scores up to 0.98 for translating natural language graph specifications to ASP

## Executive Summary
This paper presents NL2ASP, a two-step architecture for automatically composing Answer Set Programming (ASP) programs from natural language specifications. The system first translates natural language statements into Controlled Natural Language (CNL) propositions using neural machine translation, then converts these propositions into ASP code using the CNL2ASP tool. The approach is evaluated on a new dataset focused on graph-related problem specifications, demonstrating high translation quality and end-to-end correctness in generating valid ASP programs.

## Method Summary
NL2ASP employs a two-step translation process to convert natural language specifications into executable ASP programs. The first step uses neural machine translation to convert natural language statements into CNL propositions, which follow strict syntactic rules that simplify the subsequent translation to ASP. The second step leverages the CNL2ASP tool to transform these CNL propositions into actual ASP code. The methodology is supported by a new dataset (NL2CNL) specifically designed for graph-related problem specifications, enabling focused evaluation of the translation pipeline.

## Key Results
- Achieved BLEU-4 scores up to 0.96 and METEOR scores up to 0.98 in translation quality
- Demonstrated end-to-end correctness in generating valid ASP programs
- Successfully handled a range of graph-related problems including graph coloring, Hamiltonian cycles, and shortest paths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-step translation approach works by first converting unconstrained natural language into a controlled subset that follows strict syntactic rules, making the subsequent translation to formal ASP code more reliable. Neural machine translation handles the complexity of mapping natural language to CNL, while the CNL2ASP tool benefits from the simplified structure of CNL propositions to generate correct ASP code. This decomposition of the problem reduces the complexity of each individual translation step.

## Foundational Learning
- **Controlled Natural Language (CNL)**: A subset of natural language with strict syntactic rules that simplifies translation to formal representations - needed to reduce ambiguity and ensure reliable translation to ASP
- **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)**: Deep learning models that learn to translate between languages - needed to handle the complexity of mapping natural language to CNL
- **Answer Set Programming (ASP)**: A declarative programming paradigm for knowledge representation and reasoning - needed as the target formalism for executable logic programs
- **BLEU and METEOR metrics**: Evaluation metrics for translation quality that measure n-gram overlap between reference and candidate translations - needed to quantify translation accuracy
- **Graph theory concepts**: Fundamental concepts like nodes, edges, paths, cycles, and coloring - needed as the domain for problem specifications
- **Dataset construction methodology**: Process of creating parallel corpora of natural language and formal specifications - needed to train and evaluate the translation system

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Natural Language → NMT → CNL → CNL2ASP → ASP

**Critical Path**: The NMT component is critical as it directly impacts the quality of input to CNL2ASP. Errors in CNL generation propagate to ASP generation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The two-step approach trades off some expressiveness in natural language input for improved translation reliability, compared to direct NMT to ASP translation.

**Failure Signatures**: Translation failures typically manifest as syntactic errors in the generated ASP code or logical inconsistencies that prevent the ASP solver from finding valid answer sets.

**First Experiments**:
1. Translate simple graph coloring specifications to verify basic functionality
2. Test the system with specifications containing negation and disjunction
3. Evaluate performance on specifications with varying levels of complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The methodology is constrained to graph-related problem specifications within the NL2CNL dataset
- Reliance on CNL2ASP as an intermediate step means system performance is limited by CNL2ASP's capabilities
- Questions remain about generalizability to other domains of ASP applications

## Confidence
- High confidence in the technical implementation of the two-step architecture and the quality of neural translation components
- Medium confidence in the generalization of results beyond graph-related problems
- Medium confidence in the scalability of the approach to more complex ASP programs

## Next Checks
1. Test the NL2ASP system on ASP specifications outside the graph domain to assess domain transferability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the NMT and CNL2ASP components to overall performance
3. Evaluate the system's performance on specifications containing domain-specific terminology and complex logical constructs not present in the NL2CNL dataset
