# Context Does Matter: Implications for Crowdsourced Evaluation Labels in Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.09980
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09980
- Reference count: 27
- This study investigates how dialogue context size and type influence crowdsourced evaluation labels for task-oriented dialogue systems.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how dialogue context size and type influence crowdsourced evaluation labels for task-oriented dialogue systems. The authors vary the amount of dialogue context provided to annotators (none, partial, or full) and compare it with automatically generated supplementary context using heuristics and LLMs. They find that increasing context generally improves annotator agreement for relevance, but usefulness judgments become less consistent with full context. Providing automatically generated user information needs—especially via heuristics—yields high agreement while reducing annotation effort. The results highlight the need for careful task design, as context variations significantly impact label quality and consistency.

## Method Summary
The study used the ReDial dataset containing over 11K dialogues and conducted crowdsourcing experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk. They annotated 40 dialogues with relevance and usefulness labels under seven context conditions: no context (C0), partial dialogue context (C3), full dialogue context (C7), heuristic-generated user information need (C0-heu), LLM-generated user information need (C0-llm), and LLM-generated dialogue summary (C0-sum). The authors measured inter-annotator agreement using Cohen's Kappa and Tau correlation, comparing label consistency across conditions while varying context amount and type.

## Key Results
- Providing partial dialogue context (C3) achieves similar relevance agreement to full context while reducing annotation effort
- Heuristic-generated supplementary context (C0-heu) yields the highest inter-annotator agreement for both relevance and usefulness
- Full dialogue context (C7) improves relevance ratings but introduces ambiguity in usefulness judgments
- Automatically generated context significantly reduces annotation time while maintaining label quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Providing dialogue context influences annotator judgment quality and consistency.
- **Mechanism:** Context provides evidence for annotators to base their judgments on, reducing assumptions and improving agreement.
- **Core assumption:** Annotators rely on available context to make informed decisions about relevance and usefulness.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Using the first user utterance as context leads to consistent ratings, akin to those obtained using the entire dialogue, with significantly reduced annotation effort."
  - [section] "With the introduction of more context in C3 and C7, comes an increase in agreement regarding the relevance of the current turn (see Table 1)."
  - [corpus] Weak; no direct corpus evidence, relies on experimental results.
- **Break condition:** If the provided context is irrelevant or misleading, it could negatively impact judgment quality.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Automatically generated supplementary context can improve crowdsourced label consistency.
- **Mechanism:** Heuristics and LLMs provide focused context, reducing cognitive load and improving agreement.
- **Core assumption:** Supplementary context can effectively convey user needs and dialogue summaries.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Using the first user utterance as context leads to consistent ratings, akin to those obtained using the entire dialogue, with significantly reduced annotation effort."
  - [section] "The heuristic approach (C0-heu) yields the highest agreement (Kappa and Tau), indicating a noteworthy degree of agreement in relevance assessments."
  - [corpus] Moderate; evidence from experimental results but limited generalizability.
- **Break condition:** If the generated context is inaccurate or hallucinated, it could harm label quality.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Optimal context varies by evaluation aspect (relevance vs. usefulness).
- **Mechanism:** Different aspects require different levels of context for accurate assessment.
- **Core assumption:** Relevance benefits from more context, while usefulness may be negatively impacted by excessive context.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Providing the entire dialogue context yields higher relevance ratings but introduces ambiguity in usefulness ratings."
  - [section] "Despite having access to the entire conversation history in C7, there is a slightly lower level of agreement than in C3."
  - [corpus] Weak; relies on experimental findings rather than corpus evidence.
- **Break condition:** If the evaluation aspect is not clearly defined, context requirements may be misjudged.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's Kappa)
  - **Why needed here:** To measure the quality and consistency of crowdsourced labels.
  - **Quick check question:** What does a high Kappa score indicate about annotator agreement?

- **Concept:** Dialogue context and its impact on evaluation
  - **Why needed here:** To understand how context affects annotator judgments and label quality.
  - **Quick check question:** How might insufficient context lead to positive bias in annotator ratings?

- **Concept:** Large language models (LLMs) for context generation
  - **Why needed here:** To generate supplementary context that improves label consistency.
  - **Quick check question:** What are potential limitations of using LLMs for context generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** ReDial dataset -> Crowdsourcing platform -> Context generation -> Annotation interface -> Quality control -> Analysis
- **Critical path:** Data collection → Context generation → Annotation → Quality control → Analysis
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Context amount vs. annotator cognitive load
  - Automated context generation vs. manual effort
  - Binary vs. multi-point rating scales
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low inter-annotator agreement
  - Inconsistent labels across conditions
  - Hallucinated context leading to inaccurate judgments
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Vary context amount (C0, C3, C7) and measure agreement
  2. Compare heuristic vs. LLM-generated context
  3. Analyze label consistency across conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the type of supplementary context (heuristic vs. LLM-generated) impact the consistency of crowdsourced labels across different aspects of TDS evaluation?
- **Basis in paper:** Inferred from the discussion of Phase 2 results, where the heuristic approach (C0-heu) consistently improves agreement among annotators for both relevance and usefulness compared to LLM-generated context (C0-llm and C0-sum).
- **Why unresolved:** The paper compares the heuristic and LLM-generated approaches but does not delve into the underlying reasons for the observed differences in label consistency. It would be valuable to understand the factors contributing to the superior performance of the heuristic approach.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A detailed analysis of the content and structure of the heuristic and LLM-generated context, comparing their ability to capture key information, represent user preferences accurately, and align with annotator expectations. Additionally, investigating annotator feedback on the clarity and usefulness of each type of context could provide insights.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent do annotator characteristics, such as prior experience with TDS or familiarity with the movie domain, influence the quality and consistency of crowdsourced labels?
- **Basis in paper:** Inferred from the acknowledgment of the need to understand the effect of annotator background on label consistency in the conclusion.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper does not explore the impact of annotator characteristics on label quality. Investigating how prior experience or domain knowledge affects annotator judgments could reveal potential biases or variations in evaluation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Collecting demographic information and prior experience data from annotators, and analyzing the correlation between these factors and label quality metrics (e.g., inter-annotator agreement, consistency across conditions). Additionally, conducting experiments with annotators of varying experience levels could shed light on the impact of expertise.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How generalizable are the findings of this study to other TDS domains beyond movie recommendations, and what factors might influence the transferability of the results?
- **Basis in paper:** Inferred from the conclusion, which mentions the potential extension of the experimental design to other aspects of TDS evaluation and the need for further investigation into the generalizability of the findings.
- **Why unresolved:** The study focuses on movie recommendation dialogues, and it is unclear whether the observed effects of context size and type would hold true for other TDS domains (e.g., restaurant recommendations, travel planning). Factors such as dialogue length, user preferences, and domain-specific language could influence the results.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Conducting similar experiments with TDS datasets from different domains, comparing the impact of context variations on label quality and consistency. Analyzing the characteristics of the dialogues and user interactions in each domain could help identify factors that contribute to the generalizability or specificity of the findings.

## Limitations

- The study relies on a single dataset (ReDial) with limited dialogue samples (40 dialogues), constraining generalizability to other domains
- The heuristic approach for generating user information needs may not scale well to more complex dialogue scenarios
- LLM-generated summaries could introduce hallucinations that affect label quality without systematic detection mechanisms

## Confidence

- High confidence: The relationship between increased context and improved relevance agreement
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of heuristic-generated supplementary context for reducing annotation effort
- Low confidence: The comparative performance of LLM vs. heuristic approaches across different evaluation aspects

## Next Checks

1. Test the context-amount effects on a different task-oriented dialogue dataset to verify generalizability beyond ReDial
2. Implement hallucination detection for LLM-generated summaries and measure its impact on label quality
3. Conduct a controlled experiment varying the complexity of system responses to determine when supplementary context becomes most beneficial
