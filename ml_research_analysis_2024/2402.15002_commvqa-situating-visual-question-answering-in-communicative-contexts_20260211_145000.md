# CommVQA: Situating Visual Question Answering in Communicative Contexts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.15002
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15002
- Authors: Nandita Shankar Naik; Christopher Potts; Elisa Kreiss
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: New VQA dataset with communicative contexts improves model performance but still generates high hallucination rates

## Executive Summary
CommVQA introduces a novel approach to visual question answering by situating the task within real-world communicative contexts. The dataset contains 1000 images with 8,949 question-answer pairs, each paired with descriptive captions and hypothetical scenarios where the images might appear. Unlike traditional VQA datasets where questions are elicited directly from images, CommVQA questions are generated based on scenarios and descriptions, better reflecting how people ask questions when encountering visual content online. This contextual framing aims to bridge the gap between VQA systems and real-world applications where images are viewed within specific communicative situations.

The dataset and accompanying benchmark reveal that incorporating contextual information significantly improves model performance on VQA tasks. Analysis shows that questions vary substantially across different scenarios, indicating that communicative context meaningfully influences the types of questions people ask. However, evaluation of state-of-the-art models demonstrates persistent challenges, with even the best-performing models (IDEFICS) generating high rates of hallucinations and struggling to identify unanswerable questions. These findings highlight both the importance of situating VQA in communicative contexts and the need for further research to develop more reliable and contextually aware visual question answering systems.

## Method Summary
CommVQA was constructed by first collecting 1000 diverse images and generating descriptive captions for each. For each image, multiple real-world scenarios were created where the image might appear (e.g., social media posts, news articles, advertisements). Human annotators were then presented with the scenario and description rather than the image itself, and asked to generate questions they would naturally ask in that communicative context. This process yielded 8,949 question-answer pairs across all images. The dataset includes the images, generated descriptions, scenarios, questions, and answers. For evaluation, models are provided with the image, its description, and the scenario, and are assessed on their ability to answer the associated questions. The dataset is specifically designed to evaluate how well models can leverage contextual information to improve VQA performance, with a focus on identifying and reducing hallucinations while improving the ability to recognize unanswerable questions.

## Key Results
- IDEFICS achieved the highest scores on CommVQA, demonstrating that incorporating contextual information improves VQA performance
- All models showed high rates of hallucinations, generating plausible-sounding but incorrect or fabricated answers
- Models struggled significantly with identifying unanswerable questions, often attempting to provide answers even when no correct answer existed in the image
- Question analysis revealed substantial variation across different scenarios, confirming that communicative context meaningfully influences question types and content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: The integration of communicative context provides additional semantic cues that help models better interpret visual information and generate more contextually appropriate responses. By framing images within realistic scenarios, the model can leverage world knowledge and common sense reasoning to inform its answers. The descriptive captions serve as an intermediate representation that bridges the gap between raw visual input and abstract scenario understanding, potentially making the task more manageable for current VQA architectures.

## Foundational Learning

**Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: The task of answering questions about visual content in images
- Why needed: Forms the core capability being evaluated
- Quick check: Can the model correctly answer questions about what's visible in an image?

**Contextual Information Integration**: Using descriptive captions and scenario information alongside images
- Why needed: Reflects how humans naturally encounter and question visual content in real-world settings
- Quick check: Does the model's performance improve when given additional contextual information beyond the image?

**Hallucination Detection**: The ability to identify when a model generates plausible but incorrect or fabricated information
- Why needed: Critical for building reliable VQA systems that don't mislead users
- Quick check: What percentage of model-generated answers are factually correct versus hallucinated?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image + Description + Scenario -> VQA Model -> Answer Generation
**Critical Path**: Context integration (scenario + description) combined with visual processing enables more contextually appropriate question answering
**Design Tradeoffs**: Larger context windows improve performance but increase computational cost and may introduce noise; simpler models may be more efficient but miss contextual nuances
**Failure Signatures**: High hallucination rates indicate models generate plausible but incorrect answers; failure to identify unanswerable questions suggests overconfidence in generation capabilities
**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate baseline VQA performance without contextual information to establish performance floor
2. Test incremental addition of description only vs. scenario only to determine which context type is more beneficial
3. Compare hallucination rates across different model architectures with and without contextual information

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly identify specific open questions for future research. Potential areas for exploration include developing more robust hallucination detection mechanisms, investigating the impact of multilingual scenarios on VQA performance, and examining how different types of contextual information (descriptions vs. scenarios) contribute to improved performance.

## Limitations
- Dataset size (1000 images, 8,949 QA pairs) is relatively small compared to standard VQA benchmarks, potentially limiting generalizability
- Evaluation relies heavily on automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) which may not fully capture answer quality in context-rich scenarios
- Dataset focuses primarily on English language scenarios, limiting applicability to multilingual or cross-cultural contexts
- Human-generated questions may contain biases based on the annotators' backgrounds and perspectives
- The dataset construction process may not fully capture the diversity of real-world communicative contexts

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The dataset's novel approach to contextualizing VQA within communicative scenarios
**Medium confidence**: Empirical findings regarding model performance improvements with contextual information
**Medium confidence**: Dataset analysis showing scenario-based question variation
**Low confidence**: Generalizability of findings to real-world applications due to dataset size limitations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation with a larger, more diverse dataset to assess the robustness of findings across different image types, scenarios, and question distributions
2. Implement human evaluation studies to validate automated metric results and assess the quality of model-generated answers in context
3. Test model performance on out-of-distribution scenarios and images to evaluate the generalization capabilities of context-aware VQA systems built on this dataset
4. Investigate the effectiveness of different hallucination detection techniques specifically designed for context-rich VQA scenarios
5. Explore the impact of different types of contextual information (descriptions vs. scenarios) on model performance to optimize context integration strategies
