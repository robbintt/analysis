# Interpreting Graphic Notation with MusicLDM: An AI Improvisation of Cornelius Cardew's Treatise

- Primary result: Novel AI method using ChatGPT-4 and MusicLDM to interpret Cornelius Cardew's Treatise graphic score, generating music through text prompts with outpainting for smooth transitions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to interpreting Cornelius Cardew's Treatise, a graphic score, by converting visual elements into descriptive text prompts using ChatGPT-4 and then generating music with MusicLDM. The system employs an "outpainting" technique to ensure smooth transitions between AI-generated audio segments, creating cohesive compositions. This method offers a new way to bridge visual art and music, demonstrating how AI can transform abstract visual stimuli into sound. The authors plan to improve the system by replacing the text-generation step with visual models like CLIP for better efficiency and control.

## Method Summary
The proposed method interprets graphic notation through a two-stage pipeline: first, ChatGPT-4 converts visual elements from Treatise score pages into descriptive text prompts, then MusicLDM generates music from these prompts using a latent diffusion model. An outpainting technique ensures smooth transitions between consecutive audio segments by overlapping latent representations. The system processes pages 1-33 of the Treatise score, generating 10-second music segments that are concatenated into complete compositions.

## Key Results
- Successfully demonstrates AI interpretation of abstract graphic notation through text-to-music generation pipeline
- Implements outpainting technique for seamless transitions between audio segments
- Creates cohesive musical compositions that reflect visual elements of the score
- Establishes framework for AI-driven improvisation of graphic notation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ChatGPT-4 interprets graphic notation into structured text prompts for MusicLDM
- Mechanism: ChatGPT-4 processes Treatise score pages and generates four-sentence textual descriptions capturing abstract visual elements, which serve as prompts for MusicLDM
- Core assumption: ChatGPT-4 can reliably interpret abstract visual symbols into meaningful textual prompts
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section II.A mention using ChatGPT for text generation from visual elements
- Break condition: If ChatGPT-4 fails to generate coherent prompts or MusicLDM cannot use them effectively

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Outpainting technique ensures smooth transitions between audio segments
- Mechanism: Uses the second half of previous latent output as first half of new input instead of Gaussian noise
- Core assumption: Overlapping latent representations create seamless audio transitions
- Evidence anchors: Section II.B describes the outpainting implementation with concat(zk[:, T //2 :, :], ϵ[:, : T //2, :])
- Break condition: If overlapping introduces artifacts or fails to create smooth transitions

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Visual-to-text-to-music pipeline bridges graphic notation and musical expression
- Mechanism: Converts visual elements to text via ChatGPT, then uses MusicLDM to generate music from these text prompts
- Core assumption: Text prompts effectively guide MusicLDM to produce music reflecting original visual content
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section II describe the complete translation pipeline
- Break condition: If generated music fails to reflect visual elements or lacks coherence

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graphic notation and its interpretation
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding how visual elements are translated into music
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes graphic notation from traditional musical notation, and why does this make interpretation challenging?

- Concept: Diffusion models for audio generation
  - Why needed here: MusicLDM uses latent diffusion models, crucial for understanding the generation process
  - Quick check question: How do diffusion models generate data, and what advantages do they offer for music generation?

- Concept: Multimodal AI systems
  - Why needed here: The system combines visual processing with audio generation, requiring understanding of modality connections
  - Quick check question: What are the challenges and benefits of creating AI systems that process multiple types of input?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Visual score pages → ChatGPT-4 interpretation → Text prompts with style keywords → CLAP encoder → MusicLDM generation → HiFi-GAN vocoder → Audio output

- Critical path: Visual score → ChatGPT interpretation → Text prompts → CLAP encoding → MusicLDM generation → HiFi-GAN synthesis → Audio output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - ChatGPT intermediate step adds interpretability but reduces efficiency
  - Outpainting technique improves smoothness but increases computational complexity
  - Text-based control offers flexibility but may limit precise parameter control

- Failure signatures:
  - Disjointed or incoherent music output
  - Audio artifacts at segment boundaries
  - Generated music that doesn't reflect visual elements
  - System crashes during text generation or audio synthesis

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test ChatGPT's ability to interpret a single page of Treatise and generate coherent text prompts
  2. Generate a short audio segment using MusicLDM with a manually crafted prompt to verify the generation pipeline
  3. Test the outpainting technique by generating two consecutive segments and verifying smooth transitions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the outpainting technique be further refined to handle even longer musical compositions beyond the current 10-second segments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses using an outpainting technique to stitch together 10-second audio segments, but doesn't explore its limitations for longer compositions
- Why unresolved: The current method is demonstrated for relatively short segments, and the paper doesn't address scalability challenges for extended musical pieces
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the technique's effectiveness on significantly longer compositions, along with analysis of any artifacts or quality degradation

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific visual features from Treatise's graphic notation are most effectively captured by the text prompts in generating musically coherent outputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that ChatGPT generates descriptive textual prompts based on selected pages of the score, but doesn't analyze which visual elements are most influential
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide a detailed analysis of how different visual elements correlate with specific musical characteristics
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study comparing different visual elements from the score with their corresponding musical interpretations

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would replacing ChatGPT with a visual model like CLIP affect the quality and control of the generated music compared to the current text-based approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states plans to replace ChatGPT with visual models like CLIP for improved efficiency and control
- Why unresolved: This is stated as future work, so no comparative analysis has been conducted yet
- What evidence would resolve it: Side-by-side comparisons of musical outputs generated using ChatGPT versus CLIP-based approaches

## Limitations
- Reliance on ChatGPT-4 introduces uncertainty in consistent interpretation of abstract visual elements
- Outpainting technique lacks comparative analysis against baseline approaches
- Evaluation relies primarily on qualitative assessment rather than systematic metrics

## Confidence
- Medium: Overall pipeline architecture and feasibility of combining text-to-music generation with visual interpretation
- Low: Effectiveness of ChatGPT-4 in reliably interpreting abstract graphic notation
- Medium: Outpainting technique's ability to create seamless audio transitions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing MusicLDM outputs using ChatGPT-generated prompts versus human-annotated prompts for the same Treatise pages to measure interpretation quality
2. Implement an ablation study testing the outpainting technique against simple concatenation and cross-fading methods to quantify improvement in transition smoothness
3. Perform a perceptual study with musicians and non-musicians to evaluate whether the generated compositions capture the intended mood and structure suggested by the visual score elements
