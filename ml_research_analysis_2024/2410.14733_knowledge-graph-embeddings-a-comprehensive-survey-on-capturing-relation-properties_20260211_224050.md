# Knowledge Graph Embeddings: A Comprehensive Survey on Capturing Relation Properties

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.14733
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14733
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Guanglin Niu
- One-line primary result: Comprehensive survey of KGE techniques systematically categorizing models by their approach to modeling relation properties including complex mappings, relation patterns, and hierarchical relations.

## Executive Summary
This survey paper provides a systematic review of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) techniques focused on modeling relation properties. The paper categorizes KGE models based on their approach to handling three main types of relation characteristics: complex mapping features (1-1, 1-N, N-1, N-N relations), various relation patterns (symmetry, asymmetry, inversion, composition), and hierarchical relations between entities. By organizing the landscape of KGE models into relation-aware mapping approaches, specific representation spaces, tensor decomposition methods, and neural network-based techniques, the survey offers a comprehensive framework for understanding how different models address the challenges of capturing relation properties in knowledge graphs.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews existing KGE models through a taxonomy based on how they handle different relation properties. It examines models that use relation-specific projection matrices (TransH, TransR), rotation operations in complex spaces (RotatE), tensor decomposition techniques (RESCAL, ComplEx, HolE), and manifold-based approaches including hyperbolic spaces (Poincare Embeddings, MuRP). The paper evaluates these models based on their theoretical foundations and empirical performance claims from cited literature, focusing on how different geometric and algebraic mechanisms enable the modeling of complex relation patterns. The survey also discusses future research directions including multimodal information integration, rule-enhanced relation pattern modeling, and dynamic KG considerations.

## Key Results
- KGE models are categorized into four main approaches: relation-aware mapping, specific representation spaces, tensor decomposition, and neural network-based techniques
- Rotation-based models like RotatE can theoretically model symmetric, antisymmetric, inverse, and composite relations through complex vector space operations
- Hyperbolic space embeddings effectively capture hierarchical relations by naturally representing tree-like structures where higher-level entities are closer to the center
- Different models employ innovative mechanisms like hyperplane projections, Mobius operations, and auxiliary information integration to handle various relation characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KGE models capture complex relation mapping by projecting entities into relation-specific spaces or using rotation-based transformations.
- Mechanism: By mapping entities into relation-specific hyperplanes, relation spaces, or using complex/quaternion rotations, the models can represent 1-N, N-1, and N-N relations where multiple tail entities can be associated with a single head entity without forcing them to the same embedding.
- Core assumption: The projection or rotation preserves the semantic differences between different tail entities while maintaining the relation's structural properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Models that employ modified tensor decomposition, those based on modified relation-aware mappings, and those that leverage rotation operations are reviewed for capturing various relation patterns.
  - [section 3.1] TransH projects entities onto relation-specific hyperplanes allowing distinct representations across different relations, enabling modeling of complex mappings.
  - [section 3.4] Rotation-based models like RotatE use complex vector space and Hadamard product to achieve rotation, theoretically proven to model symmetric, antisymmetric, inverse, and composite relations.
- Break condition: If the projection matrices or rotation operations are not well-regularized, they may collapse distinct entities into similar representations, losing the ability to distinguish between different tail entities.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Tensor decomposition models capture complex relation patterns through bilinear operations that naturally encode symmetry and asymmetry.
- Mechanism: Models like ComplEx use complex conjugate operations in the scoring function, allowing symmetric and antisymmetric relations to be modeled simultaneously by ensuring the conjugate of one entity's embedding is used when the order is swapped.
- Core assumption: The mathematical properties of complex numbers (e.g., conjugation) can be leveraged to distinguish between symmetric and antisymmetric patterns in a single framework.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] ComplEx employs Hamiltonian multiplication among complex representations, using conjugate of complex vectors to model both symmetric and antisymmetric relations.
  - [section 4.1] HolE uses circular correlation operations, which are asymmetric with respect to head and tail entities, achieving similar modeling of symmetric and antisymmetric relations.
- Break condition: If the relation embeddings are not constrained properly, the model may fail to distinguish between symmetric and antisymmetric relations, leading to incorrect inferences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hyperbolic space embeddings capture hierarchical relations by naturally representing tree-like structures where higher-level entities are closer to the center.
- Mechanism: Models like MuRP embed entities in hyperbolic space, using Mobius operations to represent translation and interaction with relations, allowing higher-level entities to be represented with lower-dimensional vectors and lower-level entities with higher-dimensional vectors.
- Core assumption: The intrinsic curvature of hyperbolic space matches the hierarchical structure of knowledge graphs, enabling more natural and efficient representation of entities at different levels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Models that incorporate auxiliary information, models based on hyperbolic spaces, and those that utilize the polar coordinate system are introduced for modeling hierarchical relations.
  - [section 5.2] Poincare Embeddings map KGs into hyperbolic space, placing higher-level entities closer to the center and lower-level entities further away, effectively modeling "is-a" hierarchical relations.
  - [section 5.2] ATTH combines rotation and reflection operations from DihEdral with attention mechanism in hyperbolic space to model both multiple relation patterns and hierarchical relations.
- Break condition: If the curvature of the hyperbolic space is not properly tuned or the Mobius operations are not well-defined, the model may fail to capture the hierarchical structure accurately, leading to poor performance on hierarchical relations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vector space embeddings and their properties (e.g., translation, rotation, scaling).
  - Why needed here: Understanding how entities and relations are represented as vectors and how geometric operations (translation, rotation) can model different relation patterns is fundamental to grasping KGE techniques.
  - Quick check question: How does the translation operation in TransE differ from the rotation operation in RotatE in terms of the vector space they operate in and the types of relations they can model?

- Concept: Tensor decomposition and its application in KGE.
  - Why needed here: Tensor decomposition techniques like RESCAL and DistMult are used to represent the knowledge graph as a third-order tensor and decompose it into lower-dimensional matrices, which can capture complex relation patterns through bilinear operations.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between the scoring functions of RESCAL and DistMult, and how does this difference affect their ability to model symmetric and antisymmetric relations?

- Concept: Hyperbolic geometry and its properties.
  - Why needed here: Hyperbolic space is used to model hierarchical relations in knowledge graphs because its intrinsic curvature naturally represents tree-like structures, where higher-level entities are closer to the center and lower-level entities are further away.
  - Quick check question: How does the distance metric in hyperbolic space (e.g., Poincare distance) differ from the Euclidean distance, and why is it more suitable for modeling hierarchical relations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Embedding layer (entities and relations) -> Scoring function (evaluates triple plausibility) -> Optimization module (trains embeddings)
- Critical path: Computation of scoring function for each triple involves looking up embeddings, applying geometric operation, and computing distance/similarity
- Design tradeoffs: Choice of embedding space (Euclidean, complex, hyperbolic) affects relation pattern modeling capability vs. computational complexity
- Failure signatures: Overfitting to training data, inability to generalize to new entities/relations, failure to capture specific relation patterns due to unsuitable embedding space or scoring function
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and compare TransE and RotatE on FB15k-237 focusing on symmetric/antisymmetric relation modeling
  2. Experiment with different embedding spaces for a KG with hierarchical structure, evaluating link prediction performance
  3. Integrate multimodal information into a KGE model and assess performance on sparse KGs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can multimodal information (textual, visual, etc.) be systematically integrated into KGE models to improve performance on sparse knowledge graphs, particularly for modeling complex relation mappings and hierarchical relations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6.1 discusses the potential of integrating multimodal information (textual descriptions, visual features) to enhance KGE models, especially for sparse KGs with long-tail distributions.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the potential benefits but does not provide specific methodologies or empirical evidence for how different types of multimodal information would impact the modeling of relation characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing the performance gains of KGE models with different multimodal integration strategies (e.g., text + KG embeddings, images + KG embeddings) on sparse KGs, with ablation studies isolating the contribution of each modality.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective strategies for automatically mining and incorporating logical rules from knowledge graphs to enhance the modeling of relation patterns, especially in sparse knowledge graphs where relation embeddings may not naturally satisfy pattern constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6.2 discusses the potential of using logical rules mined from KGs to enhance relation pattern modeling, citing models like RPJE and EngineKG as examples.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions the potential of rule-enhanced modeling, it does not delve into the specifics of how to automatically mine rules for a broader range of relation patterns or how to effectively incorporate these rules into KGE models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing KGE models with and without rule incorporation, particularly on sparse KGs, and analyses of the types of rules that are most beneficial for different relation patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can dynamic knowledge graphs be effectively modeled to capture both the temporal evolution of relations and the inherent hierarchical relations between entities, especially when dealing with few-shot scenarios and entities with limited associated triples?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6.3 discusses the challenges of modeling relation characteristics in dynamic KGs, highlighting the lack of research in this area and the difficulties posed by sparse data and temporal information.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem but does not propose specific solutions or methodologies for effectively incorporating temporal information and handling the dynamic nature of relations in evolving KGs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of KGE models specifically designed for dynamic KGs that incorporate temporal information and can handle few-shot learning scenarios, with comparisons to static KGE models on tasks involving temporal reasoning and link prediction in dynamic KGs.

## Limitations
