# Detection and Recovery Against Deep Neural Network Fault Injection Attacks Based on Contrastive Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.16766
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16766
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Framework detects FIAs by monitoring contrastive loss deviations and recovers accuracy up to 88% with limited data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CFDR (Contrastive Learning based Fault Injection Attack Detection and Recovery), a framework that leverages contrastive learning to enable DNNs to detect and recover from fault injection attacks in real-time. The approach uses a parallel projection head to compute contrastive loss during inference, which serves as a detection signal when significant deviations from clean-model baselines occur. The framework demonstrates effective detection and recovery across various attack types on CIFAR-10, with promising results even when only unlabeled testing data is available.

## Method Summary
CFDR implements a two-phase contrastive learning approach: (1) contrastive pretraining to learn robust representations, and (2) fine-tuning for the specific classification task. During inference, a parallel projection head computes contrastive loss alongside the main classification path. Detection occurs by comparing this loss against a threshold from the clean model. Recovery employs either the contrastive learning phase or fine-tuning phase using available data, with the option to skip the contrastive phase when data is limited. The framework supports both labeled and unlabeled data scenarios for recovery.

## Key Results
- Detection accuracy: 99.3-99.8% for attacks modifying 9K-1.18M parameters on CIFAR-10
- Recovery with labeled data: 87-88% accuracy for attacks with fewer modified parameters
- Recovery with unlabeled data: 80-88% accuracy for attacks with fewer modified parameters, 33-45% for more severe attacks
- Detection works in real-time with single batches of testing data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contrastive learning loss can serve as a real-time fault detection signal for DNNs under FIA
- Mechanism: A parallel projection head computes contrastive loss during inference; significant deviation from clean-model baseline indicates parameter corruption
- Core assumption: FIAs alter model parameters in ways that disrupt similarity preservation between augmented views
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "use CL to obtain the DNN inference models...observe the change of contrastive loss over single batches of testing data to detect potential FIAs"
  - [section 2.3] "we propose to use the contrastive learning loss in Phase (a) as a key criterion to determine whether the DNN model is attacked by a FIA"
  - [corpus] No direct citations; concept is novel in this work
- Break condition: If fault injection modifies weights without affecting embedding geometry, contrastive loss may not change significantly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-supervised contrastive pretraining enables effective recovery with minimal labeled data
- Mechanism: Two-phase training (contrastive pretraining + fine-tuning) creates models with representations robust enough to recover accuracy after partial parameter corruption
- Core assumption: Representations learned through contrastive objectives retain semantic structure even when some weights are corrupted
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1] "CL enables our detection as well as recovery mechanisms against FIAs"
  - [section 3.3] "For models with less perturbed/attacked parameters, the accuracy can be restored to a typical accuracy (around 87%) for ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 with only a few data"
  - [corpus] No prior work found using contrastive learning specifically for FIA recovery
- Break condition: If too many parameters are modified (e.g., >1M in experiments), recovery accuracy plateaus below 50%

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Parallel contrastive loss computation during inference enables non-intrusive detection
- Mechanism: Additional projection head path runs concurrently with classification path without affecting inference latency
- Core assumption: Computational overhead of contrastive loss calculation is negligible compared to inference
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3] "we can add the project head at the output of base encoder as the other path in parallel with the FC layer"
  - [section 2.2] "the detection process can be co-executed during the normal DNN inference"
  - [corpus] No explicit performance measurements provided in paper
- Break condition: If projection head adds significant latency or memory overhead on resource-constrained devices

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning objective (SimCLR)
  - Why needed here: Provides self-supervised representation learning that doesn't require labels for detection and enables recovery with limited data
  - Quick check question: What is the role of temperature parameter τ in the contrastive loss formula?

- Concept: Fault injection attack taxonomy
  - Why needed here: Different FIA types (PBS, FSA, GDA) have varying parameter modification patterns that affect detection sensitivity
  - Quick check question: How do ℓ0 vs ℓ2 norm constraints in FSA attacks affect the number of parameters modified?

- Concept: Model checkpointing and reference baselines
  - Why needed here: Clean model's contrastive loss serves as detection threshold; recovery requires clean baseline for stopping criteria
  - Quick check question: What stopping criteria are used during recovery to prevent overfitting with limited data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input -> Base encoder (ResNet-18) -> [Projection head (MLP) -> Contrastive loss computation] and [FC layer -> Classification] in parallel
- Critical path: Input → Base encoder → FC layer → Prediction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Detection sensitivity vs false positive rate (controlled by δ)
  - Recovery data requirements vs final accuracy (labeled vs unlabeled)
  - Computational overhead of parallel projection head vs real-time detection capability
- Failure signatures:
  - High contrastive loss with clean model indicates implementation bug
  - Low contrastive loss during detection despite known FIA suggests attack doesn't affect embedding space
  - Recovery accuracy plateaus below target indicates excessive parameter corruption
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Measure contrastive loss distribution for clean model over multiple batches to establish detection threshold
  2. Sensitivity: Apply PBS attack with varying parameter counts and verify detection accuracy vs ground truth
  3. Recovery: Test recovery effectiveness with labeled vs unlabeled data on moderate-parameter attacks (50K-200K parameters)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the fault tolerance parameter (𝛿) affect the detection accuracy and false positive/negative rates in real-world deployment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions setting 𝛿 as the threshold for the difference between the contrastive loss of the tested model and the clean model, but does not provide detailed analysis of how different 𝛿 values impact detection performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper only briefly mentions the importance of setting 𝛿 properly but does not provide empirical analysis or guidelines for choosing this parameter.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing detection accuracy and false positive/negative rates across a range of 𝛿 values, along with recommended thresholds for different attack scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of attack frequency on the detection mechanism's ability to distinguish between normal inference fluctuations and actual attacks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that detection can be executed periodically without disrupting normal inference, but does not analyze how frequently attacks occur or how this affects detection accuracy.
- Why unresolved: The temporal aspect of detection is not explored, leaving uncertainty about the mechanism's effectiveness against frequent or intermittent attacks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of detection performance under different attack frequencies and patterns, including false detection rates when attacks occur during normal inference fluctuations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the recovery performance scale with different amounts of available data (labeled or unlabeled) beyond the tested 512 images?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates recovery with 512 images but does not explore how performance changes with more or less data.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides results for a fixed small dataset size without examining the relationship between data quantity and recovery effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Recovery accuracy results showing performance across varying amounts of available data, from very small to larger datasets, to establish the minimum data requirements for effective recovery.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the proposed framework perform against adaptive attacks that specifically target the contrastive learning-based detection mechanism?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates against standard FIA attacks but does not consider attacks designed to evade the contrastive loss-based detection.
- Why unresolved: The framework's robustness against attacks that are aware of and attempt to circumvent the detection mechanism is not tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from experiments using attacks specifically designed to minimize changes in contrastive loss while still achieving their objectives, demonstrating whether the detection mechanism remains effective.

## Limitations
- Detection effectiveness drops significantly for attacks modifying >1M parameters, with recovery accuracy plateauing below 50%
- Framework evaluated only on CIFAR-10 dataset with ResNet-18 architecture, limiting generalizability
- No quantitative analysis of computational overhead for the parallel projection head during inference

## Confidence
- Detection mechanism effectiveness: Medium confidence - results show promise but lack comprehensive ablation studies on detection thresholds and false positive rates
- Recovery mechanism with limited data: Medium confidence - the 80-88% recovery rate with unlabeled data is impressive but the exact data requirements and stopping criteria are underspecified
- Overall framework applicability: Low-Medium confidence - evaluated only on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, limiting generalizability to other architectures and datasets

## Next Checks
1. Perform systematic ablation studies varying the fault tolerance parameter δ to quantify the detection false positive/negative tradeoff
2. Measure actual inference latency overhead of the parallel projection head on resource-constrained hardware targets
3. Test the framework on diverse datasets (ImageNet, medical imaging) and architectures (MobileNet, EfficientNet) to assess generalizability limits
