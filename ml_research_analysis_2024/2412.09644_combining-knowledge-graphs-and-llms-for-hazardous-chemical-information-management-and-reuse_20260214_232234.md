# Combining knowledge graphs and LLMs for hazardous chemical information management and reuse

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.09644
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09644
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Novel platform combining knowledge graphs and LLMs to improve hazardous chemical information access for healthcare professionals

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accessing scattered, heterogeneous hazardous chemical information critical for healthcare decision-making. The authors analyze ten widely used chemical databases for FAIRness compliance and find significant gaps in findability, accessibility, and interoperability. They propose a novel platform, HazardChat, which aggregates data from multiple sources into a knowledge graph and provides access through both visual interfaces (Neo4J Bloom) and a natural language chatbot powered by RAG and LLMs. The system enables healthcare professionals to query chemical-disease-organ relationships intuitively. Key findings include the feasibility of combining FAIR data principles with KGs and LLMs to improve chemical information management, though challenges remain in standardizing identifiers (CAS numbers) and ensuring metadata completeness.

## Method Summary
The authors analyzed ten widely used chemical databases (ECHA REACH, ECHA C&L Inventory, ECHA SCIP, Cosing, IPCHEM, ChemSpider, EPA ChemView, CTD, EPA CompTox, and T3DB) for FAIRness compliance using FAIR Checker and F-UJI tools. They developed a data parser to extract chemical substances, diseases, organs, and hazard classes from these sources. The extracted data was organized into a Neo4J knowledge graph with relationships between substances, diseases, organs, and hazard classes. A chatbot interface was implemented using OpenAI's 4o-mini model with RAG architecture to translate natural language queries into knowledge graph queries. The platform was tested with queries about chemical-disease relationships, demonstrating the feasibility of combining FAIR principles, knowledge graphs, and LLMs for chemical information management.

## Key Results
- Analysis of ten chemical databases revealed significant gaps in FAIRness compliance, particularly in findability, accessibility, and interoperability
- HazardChat platform successfully aggregates heterogeneous chemical data into a unified knowledge graph structure
- The RAG-based chatbot with LLM successfully translates natural language queries into knowledge graph queries for healthcare professionals
- System demonstrates reduced time and effort for accessing vital chemical information when datasets follow FAIR principles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FAIR principles reduce time and effort for accessing chemical information
- Mechanism: FAIR principles ensure that datasets are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, which streamlines the process of locating and integrating chemical data from multiple sources
- Core assumption: Datasets that follow FAIR principles will be more easily discoverable and usable by healthcare professionals
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our findings demonstrate a significant reduction in the time and effort required to access vital chemical information when datasets follow FAIR principles."
  - [section] "The ten selected databases have all a persistent URL, what partially satisfy the findability criterion."
  - [corpus] Limited evidence - corpus focuses on related chemical safety and AI applications, but does not directly address FAIR principle impacts
- Break condition: If datasets lack persistent identifiers or proper metadata, the time savings from FAIR compliance would not materialize

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Knowledge graphs enable intuitive querying of chemical-disease relationships
- Mechanism: Knowledge graphs structure complex relationships between chemical substances, diseases, organs, and hazard classes, making it easier to traverse and query these connections
- Core assumption: Healthcare professionals can benefit from visual representation of chemical-disease relationships that would be difficult to discern from tabular data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The platform aggregates information from multiple sources and organizes it into a structured knowledge graph."
  - [section] "By analyzing these three sources of information, a healthcare professional can manually find the answer to the question asked in the introduction section"
  - [corpus] Limited evidence - corpus contains related KG applications in chemical safety but not specifically for healthcare professional use cases
- Break condition: If the knowledge graph schema becomes too complex or the query interface remains too technical for healthcare professionals

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLM-powered chatbots bridge the technical gap for healthcare professionals
- Mechanism: Large language models interpret natural language queries and translate them into precise knowledge graph queries, eliminating the need for technical query language expertise
- Core assumption: Healthcare professionals without ICT backgrounds can effectively use natural language interfaces to access complex chemical information
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Users can access this information through a visual interface such as Neo4J Bloom and dashboards, or via natural language queries using a Chatbot."
  - [section] "The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and its chatbot version are creating opportunities to overcome this barrier"
  - [corpus] Limited evidence - corpus includes LLM applications in chemistry but not specifically for healthcare professional interfaces
- Break condition: If the LLM cannot accurately interpret healthcare-specific terminology or generates incorrect query translations

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Schema Design
  - Why needed here: Understanding how chemical substances, diseases, organs, and hazard classes are structured and related is crucial for effective data integration
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the "has_Class" and "related_to_disease" relationships connect chemical substances to their health impacts?

- Concept: FAIR Data Principles
  - Why needed here: The entire platform's effectiveness depends on data sources adhering to FAIR principles for discoverability and interoperability
  - Quick check question: What are the four core principles of FAIR data and why is each important for chemical information management?

- Concept: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Architecture
  - Why needed here: The chatbot's ability to provide accurate chemical information depends on properly integrating knowledge graph data with LLM responses
  - Quick check question: How does RAG help prevent hallucinations when an LLM answers questions about hazardous chemicals?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data Sources (REACH, CTD, NIOSH) → Data Parser → Knowledge Graph (Neo4J) → Query Interface (Bloom/Cypher) → LLM Chatbot (OpenAI 4o-mini) → User Interface
  FAIR Assessment Tools (FAIR Checker, F-UJI) → Metadata Analysis → Data Source Selection
  Data Quality Layer → Identifier Mapping (CAS numbers) → Schema Validation

- Critical path:
  1. Data ingestion from multiple sources
  2. Knowledge graph construction and population
  3. RAG system integration with LLM
  4. Natural language query processing and response generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Neo4J property graphs vs. RDF/SPARQL for flexibility vs. standardization
  - Manual vs. automated data parsing for accuracy vs. scalability
  - LLM model size vs. response time for user experience

- Failure signatures:
  - Missing or ambiguous CAS numbers causing entity resolution failures
  - LLM generating incorrect Cypher queries from natural language
  - Knowledge graph schema mismatches between different data sources

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the data parser with a small sample from each source to validate field extraction accuracy
  2. Verify knowledge graph population by running basic relationship queries (e.g., find all diseases related to a specific chemical)
  3. Test the chatbot with predefined queries to ensure accurate Cypher generation and response quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the HazardChat platform vary when handling different types of user queries, such as those involving multiple chemicals, complex disease relationships, or organ-specific impacts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "more work is needed to understand how performance varies across different ranges of question types, data types, and dataset sizes," indicating that this is an open area for further investigation.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of the platform but does not provide detailed performance metrics or comparisons across different query types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting comprehensive testing with a diverse set of queries and analyzing the platform's response accuracy, speed, and user satisfaction would provide insights into its performance across different scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific challenges and potential solutions for standardizing CAS numbers and other chemical identifiers across different data sources to improve interoperability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the issue of inconsistent CAS numbers and the lack of a global unique identifier for chemical elements and mixtures, suggesting the need for regulatory involvement and consensus.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the problem, it does not propose specific solutions or evaluate their feasibility and impact on data interoperability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing pilot projects that test different standardization approaches and measuring their effectiveness in improving data integration and accessibility would provide valuable insights.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the integration of LLMs and KGs be optimized to enhance the accuracy and relevance of information retrieval for healthcare professionals, particularly in urgent situations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential of combining LLMs and KGs but notes the need for further development in natural language query interpretation and RAG approach precision.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a conceptual framework but lacks detailed strategies for optimizing the integration to meet the specific needs of healthcare professionals.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting user studies and iterative testing with healthcare professionals to refine the integration process and evaluate its impact on decision-making in real-world scenarios would help address this question.

## Limitations

- The platform's effectiveness depends heavily on consistent CAS number identifiers across datasets, which are often missing or ambiguous
- User testing with actual healthcare professionals is limited, leaving uncertainty about the practical usability of the natural language interface
- The FAIR assessment methodology does not comprehensively evaluate all four FAIR dimensions, particularly long-term URL stability and complete metadata coverage

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The fundamental architecture combining knowledge graphs with LLMs for chemical information management is technically sound and follows established best practices in the field.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that FAIR principles reduce time and effort for accessing chemical information is supported by the persistent URL finding but lacks comprehensive validation across all FAIR dimensions.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that healthcare professionals without ICT backgrounds can effectively use the natural language interface remains speculative, as user testing with actual healthcare professionals is not documented.

## Next Checks

1. **User Experience Validation**: Conduct usability testing with healthcare professionals to assess whether the natural language interface effectively bridges the technical gap, particularly focusing on query accuracy and response relevance.

2. **FAIR Compliance Audit**: Perform a comprehensive FAIR assessment across all four dimensions (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) for each data source, including metadata completeness and long-term URL stability testing.

3. **Identifier Resolution Testing**: Develop and validate a systematic approach for handling CAS number inconsistencies across datasets, including testing alternative identifier mappings and their impact on knowledge graph completeness.
