# Uncovering Hidden Subspaces in Video Diffusion Models Using Re-Identification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.04956
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04956
- Authors: Mischa Dombrowski; Hadrien Reynaud; Bernhard Kainz
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Privacy models trained in latent space are 60× faster and generalize better than image-space models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses critical privacy and data quality concerns in synthetic medical video generation by introducing latent space privacy models that both protect patient privacy and evaluate synthetic data quality. The authors demonstrate that training privacy-preserving re-identification models in the compressed latent space of a VAE is significantly more computationally efficient (60× speedup) and generalizes better across datasets than training in image space. By repurposing these privacy filters to evaluate generative model quality metrics like temporal consistency and generative model recall, they reveal that current diffusion models only learn up to 30.8% of training videos, explaining the performance gap in downstream tasks. This approach provides a new framework for measuring generative model faithfulness and highlights the need for improved coverage of training distributions.

## Method Summary
The method involves training a VAE to compress echocardiography videos into latent space, then using this compressed representation to train privacy-preserving re-identification models in both image and latent space. These models are evaluated for cross-dataset generalization and then repurposed to assess generative model quality through metrics including generative model recall (percentage of training videos learned) and temporal consistency. The authors generate synthetic videos using latent diffusion models and evaluate both privacy preservation and downstream task performance (EF regression). The key innovation is using the same latent space privacy models to simultaneously ensure privacy protection and measure generative model quality.

## Key Results
- Training privacy models in latent space is 60× faster than in image space (50 minutes vs 50 hours)
- Latent space privacy models generalize better across datasets (higher AUC scores)
- Current generative models only learn 30.8% of training videos on average
- Downstream EF regression performance is limited by incomplete subspace coverage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Training privacy models in latent space is computationally more efficient than in image space.
- Mechanism: The latent space representation is 1/48 of the original image size (downsampled by 8x in spatial dimensions and 4x in channels), leading to smaller model inputs and faster computations.
- Core assumption: The latent space preserves sufficient information for privacy detection while reducing computational overhead.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "training privacy-preserving models in latent space is computationally more efficient and generalize better"
  - [section] "A single epoch takes roughly three minutes in image space, which amounts to a total of 50 hours of training. In latent space, training the model only takes three seconds for a single epoch, which only adds up to 50 minutes per training run and an overall computational time improvement of 60×"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on video embeddings but don't directly address computational efficiency comparisons

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Privacy models trained in latent space generalize better across different datasets than those trained in image space.
- Mechanism: The latent space learned by the VAE captures domain-agnostic features that transfer better between datasets, while image space models may overfit to dataset-specific characteristics.
- Core assumption: The VAE's learned latent representation captures the essential distinguishing features needed for re-identification while filtering out dataset-specific noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "training privacy-preserving models in latent space... generalize better"
  - [section] "the latent models are better at generalization, which is partially due to the fact that the latent space was trained jointly on all the datasets"
  - [section] Table 2 showing higher AUC scores for latent models when tested on different datasets
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers discuss representation learning but don't provide direct evidence for cross-dataset generalization in privacy contexts

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The learned privacy filter can be repurposed to evaluate generative model quality metrics including temporal consistency and generative model recall.
- Mechanism: The same feature representations used for privacy detection capture the underlying data distribution structure, allowing assessment of how well generated samples match training data characteristics.
- Core assumption: The feature space learned for privacy detection is sensitive to the key distributional properties that determine generative model quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we use these models to evaluate the subspace covered by synthetic video datasets and thus introduce a new way to measure the faithfulness of generative machine learning models"
  - [section] "we use the prediction head directly as a result of the superior performance" and subsequent evaluation of temporal consistency and recall
  - [section] Figure 6 showing temporal consistency evaluation and Table 4 showing generative model recall measurements
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers discuss video embeddings but don't specifically address repurposing privacy filters for quality assessment

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and latent space compression
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on a VAE to compress video frames into a latent space that enables efficient privacy model training and generative model evaluation
  - Quick check question: What is the compression factor achieved by the VAE used in this work, and how is it calculated from the spatial and channel dimensions?

- Concept: Siamese networks for similarity learning
  - Why needed here: The privacy model uses a siamese architecture to determine if two video frames come from the same patient/video
  - Quick check question: How does the binary classification task in the siamese network help establish privacy thresholds for synthetic data?

- Concept: Generative model evaluation metrics (recall, temporal consistency)
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces new ways to evaluate how well generative models capture the training distribution and maintain temporal coherence
  - Quick check question: What does "generative model recall" measure in this context, and how does it differ from traditional precision metrics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: VAE (Encoder + Decoder) -> Privacy Filter (Siamese network) -> Quality Assessment -> Downstream Evaluation
- Critical path: VAE → Privacy Filter → Quality Assessment → Downstream Evaluation
  The VAE compresses data, the privacy filter extracts features from this compressed representation, these features are used to evaluate generative model quality, and this quality assessment informs downstream task performance.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Latent space compression vs. information preservation for privacy detection
  - Computational efficiency vs. model accuracy in privacy detection
  - Feature space specificity for privacy vs. generality for quality assessment
  - Threshold selection for privacy filtering vs. data utility preservation
- Failure signatures:
  - Privacy filter AUC drops significantly when applied to new datasets (indicates poor generalization)
  - High correlation coefficients but poor downstream task performance (indicates learned subspace doesn't capture task-relevant features)
  - Temporal consistency metrics don't correlate with human perceptual quality (indicates metric misalignment)
  - Generative model recall near 100% but downstream performance still poor (indicates other failure modes beyond coverage)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the computational efficiency comparison: train identical siamese networks on image space vs. latent space using the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, measuring training time per epoch and final AUC scores
  2. Test cross-dataset generalization: train privacy models on one dataset (e.g., EchoNet-Dynamic) and evaluate on others (EchoNet-Pediatric A4C and PSAX), comparing image vs. latent space performance
  3. Evaluate temporal consistency: generate synthetic videos and compute the mean correlation coefficient across frames as described in section 4.4, comparing against real video temporal consistency scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we improve the recall of unconditional generative models to better represent the full training distribution?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors demonstrate that current generative models only learn up to 30.8% of the training videos, which may explain the reduced performance of downstream models trained on synthetic data.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies this issue, it does not provide a solution or methodology to improve the recall of generative models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing improved recall metrics and corresponding downstream task performance after implementing techniques to increase model coverage of the training distribution.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal privacy threshold for determining memorization in medical ultrasound videos?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that the five percent threshold for determining memorization was derived from a different dataset and should be re-evaluated for ultrasound videos.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses an arbitrary threshold without validating its appropriateness for the specific domain of ultrasound videos.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies comparing different threshold values and their impact on privacy preservation and model utility in ultrasound video datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we enhance the robustness of privacy filtering methods to produce consistent predictions across different datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe that the number of memorized samples depends on the trained privacy filter and indicate potential for improvements in robustness.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies variability in privacy filtering but does not propose methods to standardize or improve filter consistency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of standardized privacy filtering approaches that yield consistent results across multiple medical imaging datasets.

## Limitations
- Computational efficiency claims rely on specific hardware configurations and VAE architectures that may not generalize to other medical imaging modalities
- Privacy evaluation assumes the re-identification model captures all relevant patient-identifying features, which may not hold for datasets with different characteristics
- Generative model recall metric measures coverage but doesn't directly correlate with downstream task performance improvements

## Confidence

- High confidence: Computational efficiency improvements in latent space training (well-supported by measured timing data)
- Medium confidence: Cross-dataset generalization of latent privacy models (supported by AUC comparisons but limited to three medical datasets)
- Medium confidence: Generative model recall as a quality metric (theoretical basis established but correlation with downstream performance not fully validated)

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-modal validation**: Apply the same privacy-latent-space approach to non-medical video datasets (e.g., Kinetics, UCF-101) to verify generalization beyond echocardiography.
2. **Downstream correlation study**: Systematically vary generative model recall through hyperparameter tuning and measure the resulting changes in downstream task performance to establish stronger causal links.
3. **Privacy threshold optimization**: Conduct user studies to determine optimal Pmax thresholds that balance privacy protection with data utility retention, rather than using fixed thresholds.
