# Generating clickbait spoilers with an ensemble of large language models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.16284
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16284
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Ensemble of fine-tuned LLMs outperforms individual models in generating clickbait spoilers

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an ensemble approach for generating spoilers that neutralize clickbait curiosity. The method converts clickbait headlines to questions, generates candidate spoilers from multiple fine-tuned LLMs, and selects the best using a trainable ranker. Experimental results show the ensemble model outperforms individual components by approximately 2 percentage points on BLEU and METEOR metrics.

## Method Summary
The approach involves three main steps: (1) converting clickbait headlines to questions using Vicuna zero-shot, (2) generating candidate spoilers from multiple fine-tuned LLMs (LLaMA and Vicuna) using LoRA adapters, and (3) selecting the best spoiler using a trainable scoring model based on learning-to-rank techniques. The ensemble combines individual LLM outputs with a pointwise or pairwise ranker to produce the final spoiler.

## Key Results
- Ensemble model outperforms baselines on BLEU (42.13), METEOR (0.517), and BERTScore F1 (0.905)
- Pointwise ranker outperforms pairwise ranker for spoiler selection
- Modest 2 percentage point improvement over best individual component
- Multi-part spoiler generation capability demonstrated

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Ensemble of fine-tuned LLMs outperforms individual models in generating clickbait spoilers.
- Mechanism: Multiple LLMs generate diverse spoiler candidates, then a ranker selects the best based on BLEU score.
- Core assumption: Different LLMs capture complementary aspects of the generation task, and a learned ranker can identify superior candidates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ensemble model outperforms the baselines in terms of BLEU, METEOR and BERTScore metrics."
  - [section]: "The best-performing approach according to BLEU, METEOR, and BERT Score F1 is the proposed ensemble with a pointwise ranker."
  - [corpus]: Weak correlation found; corpus shows related works on clickbait but not directly on ensemble methods.
- Break condition: If ranker cannot differentiate between candidates (e.g., all candidates have similar BLEU scores), ensemble advantage disappears.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Converting clickbaits to questions improves LLM performance for spoiler generation.
- Mechanism: Zero-shot conversion of clickbait headlines into questions using Vicuna LLM before passing to fine-tuned models.
- Core assumption: LLMs trained on QA datasets perform better when inputs are in question format.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "To better exploit knowledge acquired by LLMs during pretraining, we convert each clickbait into a question before passing it for further processing."
  - [section]: "we observed additional improvements with Vicuna model while using specially tailored prompts for each spoiler type separately"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus contains clickbait detection papers but not specific question conversion methods.
- Break condition: If question conversion produces unnatural or misleading questions, model performance degrades.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pointwise ranker outperforms pairwise ranker for selecting final spoilers.
- Mechanism: Regressor predicts BLEU score for each candidate, then sorts candidates by predicted score.
- Core assumption: Predicting a continuous score is more stable than pairwise binary comparisons for this task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The best-performing approach according to BLEU, METEOR, and BERT Score F1 is the proposed ensemble with a pointwise ranker."
  - [section]: "The second-best approach was the ensemble with pairwise ranker which offered limited improvement over the individual LLMs."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence; corpus neighbors don't discuss ranking strategies.
- Break condition: If regressor's MSE is too high, ranking becomes unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Large Language Model fine-tuning with LoRA adapters
  - Why needed here: Efficient adaptation of pretrained models to specific spoiler generation task without full fine-tuning
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of using LoRA adapters over full fine-tuning for this task?

- Concept: Learning-to-rank techniques
  - Why needed here: Selecting the best spoiler candidate from multiple LLM outputs
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between pointwise and pairwise learning-to-rank approaches?

- Concept: Metric evaluation (BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore)
  - Why needed here: Quantifying generation quality and comparing different approaches
  - Quick check question: Which metric would be most sensitive to synonym usage in generated spoilers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Clickbait → Question conversion → LLM generation → Scoring → Final spoiler
- Critical path: Clickbait → Question conversion → LLM generation → Scoring → Final spoiler
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using multiple LLMs increases diversity but computational cost
  - Pointwise ranker is simpler but may miss relative quality differences
  - Question conversion helps QA-trained models but adds preprocessing step
- Failure signatures:
  - All candidates have similar BLEU scores → ranker ineffective
  - Generated questions are unnatural → model confusion
  - Adapter overfitting on small dataset → poor generalization
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test question conversion quality on sample clickbaits
  2. Compare individual LLM outputs before ensembling
  3. Evaluate ranker performance with synthetic BLEU scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the paper.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on automatic metrics without human assessment of spoiler quality
- Modest 2 percentage point improvement may not justify added complexity of ensemble approach
- Computational efficiency and runtime considerations not addressed for real-world deployment

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Ensemble methods can improve spoiler generation performance
- Medium Confidence: Specific mechanisms (question conversion, LoRA fine-tuning, learning-to-rank selection) are plausible but need more validation
- Low Confidence: Pointwise ranking superiority over pairwise is dataset-specific and not well-established

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation where annotators rate whether generated spoilers actually neutralize clickbait curiosity and satisfy information needs
2. Perform ablation analysis to quantify specific contributions of each component (question conversion, individual LLMs, ranking mechanism)
3. Test model generalization on held-out test sets from different domains or time periods than training data
