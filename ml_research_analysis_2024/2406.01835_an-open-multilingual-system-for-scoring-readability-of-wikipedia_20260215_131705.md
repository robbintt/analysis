# An Open Multilingual System for Scoring Readability of Wikipedia

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.01835
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01835
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Multilingual readability scoring system for Wikipedia across 14 languages

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an open-source system for assessing the readability of Wikipedia articles in multiple languages. The authors compile a novel dataset of aligned article pairs from Wikipedia and simplified/children encyclopedias, then train a ranking-based neural model using a multilingual transformer backbone. The system achieves over 80% ranking accuracy in a zero-shot scenario, significantly outperforming existing baselines. The work addresses critical gaps in automatic readability assessment by providing open datasets, tools, and benchmarks for languages beyond English, enabling large-scale analysis of information accessibility across Wikipedia's global content.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a multilingual readability scoring system by first creating a novel dataset of aligned Wikipedia articles paired with simplified versions from children's encyclopedias across 14 languages. They trained a ranking-based neural model using a multilingual BERT backbone, learning to predict which of two articles is more readable. The system employs zero-shot transfer learning, enabling it to score readability for languages without direct training data. The model is deployed as a public API and validated through extensive cross-lingual experiments, achieving over 80% ranking accuracy and providing insights into Wikipedia's readability landscape across different language editions.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 80% ranking accuracy in zero-shot multilingual readability assessment
- System outperforms existing baselines across all 14 tested languages
- Analysis reveals most Wikipedia articles are written above average reading ability
- Model successfully deployed as open public API for multilingual readability scoring

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages multilingual transformers pre-trained on diverse language data, enabling transfer learning across language pairs. The ranking-based approach learns relative readability preferences rather than absolute scores, making it more robust to annotation noise and language-specific variations. By using aligned article pairs from simplified sources, the model learns to distinguish between complex and simplified text patterns across languages. The zero-shot capability is enabled by the shared multilingual embedding space of the transformer backbone, allowing knowledge transfer even to languages with limited training data.

## Foundational Learning
- Multilingual transformers: Pre-trained models that handle multiple languages in a shared embedding space; needed for cross-lingual transfer, check by testing on parallel text pairs
- Ranking-based learning: Training approach that learns relative preferences between text pairs; needed for robustness to noise, check by comparing to regression baselines
- Text alignment techniques: Methods for matching similar content across different sources; needed for creating training data, check by measuring alignment precision
- Readability feature extraction: Identifying linguistic markers of text complexity; needed for model inputs, check by analyzing feature importance
- Zero-shot transfer learning: Applying models to new languages without direct training; needed for low-resource languages, check by testing on unseen languages
- API deployment considerations: Making models accessible and scalable; needed for practical use, check by monitoring response times

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Collection -> Alignment Pipeline -> Feature Extraction -> BERT Backbone -> Ranking Head -> API Deployment

**Critical Path:** The core workflow involves collecting aligned article pairs, extracting readability features, processing through the multilingual BERT backbone, and applying the ranking head to produce readability scores. The alignment pipeline and feature extraction are bottlenecks that directly impact model performance.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The authors chose a ranking-based approach over regression to improve robustness to annotation noise and enable zero-shot transfer. They opted for a multilingual BERT backbone instead of language-specific models to maximize cross-lingual generalization, accepting potential performance tradeoffs for low-resource languages. The decision to use aligned encyclopedia pairs rather than crowdsourced annotations balanced data quality with scalability.

**Failure Signatures:** Model performance degrades for languages with very few aligned pairs, morphologically complex languages where BERT's tokenization struggles, and articles that are highly technical or domain-specific. The ranking approach may fail when readability differences between articles are subtle or when cultural/linguistic factors affect perceived complexity differently than linguistic features capture.

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate alignment quality by manually checking a sample of aligned pairs across multiple languages
2. Test zero-shot performance by training on 13 languages and evaluating on the 14th
3. Compare ranking-based approach against regression baseline using the same feature set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Dataset construction relies on automated alignment that may introduce noise, especially for lower-resource languages
- Model may not capture language-specific readability features equally well across all 14 languages
- Evaluation focuses on ranking accuracy rather than direct readability score correlation
- Claims about global information accessibility extend beyond the technical scope of the study

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical novelty and implementation of multilingual readability system
- Medium confidence in zero-shot performance claims based on specific dataset and languages tested
- Medium confidence in cross-lingual analysis of Wikipedia readability
- Low confidence in broader implications for global information accessibility

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to validate model predictions against expert readability assessments across multiple languages, especially for lower-resource languages with fewer aligned pairs
2. Test model generalization by evaluating on out-of-domain readability tasks, such as web pages or educational materials, and assess robustness to article length and topic diversity
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the impact of data quality, model architecture, and language-specific features on readability scoring accuracy, and identify opportunities for targeted model improvements
