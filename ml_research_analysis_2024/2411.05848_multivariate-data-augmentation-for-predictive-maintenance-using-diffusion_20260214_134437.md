# Multivariate Data Augmentation for Predictive Maintenance using Diffusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.05848
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05848
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: Diffusion models can generate synthetic fault data to improve predictive maintenance when real fault data is scarce

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating synthetic fault data for predictive maintenance when real fault data is scarce or unavailable. The core method uses a diffusion model (DSAT-ECG) to learn the relationship between healthy and faulty data from similar systems, then apply this knowledge to generate synthetic fault data for systems that have yet to fail. The model was trained on the PRONOSTIA dataset containing run-to-failure bearing data with multivariate time series. TSGBench evaluation showed strong performance across most metrics, though Dynamic Time Warping and Kurtosis Difference were poor due to the model's difficulty capturing extreme vibration spikes. The generated synthetic data significantly improved predictive model performance, with detection rates increasing by up to 80% when synthetic data was incorporated into training.

## Method Summary
The method uses DSAT-ECG diffusion model with SPADE blocks and state-space models to generate synthetic fault data for multivariate time series. The PRONOSTIA dataset containing run-to-failure bearing data (horizontal and vertical acceleration) is partitioned into available and unavailable subsets. The model is trained on available data with bearing ID and health status as conditioning signals, then generates synthetic data for the unavailable partition. TSGBench metrics evaluate synthetic data quality, and predictive models trained with and without synthetic data compare performance to validate utility.

## Key Results
- TSGBench evaluation showed strong performance (Discriminative Score 0.01, Predictive Score 0.04, C-FID 0.03)
- Dynamic Time Warping and Kurtosis Difference were poor due to missing extreme vibration spikes
- Detection rates increased by up to 80% when synthetic data was incorporated into training
- Model struggled to generate realistic fault data for target systems without their own fault data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DSAT-ECG diffusion model can generate high-quality synthetic fault data for multivariate time series.
- Mechanism: The model learns the statistical relationship between healthy and faulty data from similar systems, then applies this knowledge to generate synthetic fault data for systems that have yet to fail.
- Core assumption: Similar systems degrade in similar ways, allowing knowledge transfer between systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By learning the relationship between healthy and faulty data in similar systems, a diffusion model can attempt to apply that relationship to healthy data of a newly installed system that has no fault data."
  - [section] "By learning the relationship between healthy and faulty data in similar systems, a diffusion model can attempt to apply that relationship to healthy data of a newly installed system that has no fault data."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on fault diagnosis but not specifically on diffusion-based synthetic data generation for predictive maintenance.
- Break condition: When systems degrade in fundamentally different ways due to unique operating conditions, environmental factors, or design differences that prevent knowledge transfer.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Synthetic fault data improves predictive maintenance model performance.
- Mechanism: Generated synthetic fault data supplements real datasets, addressing the class imbalance problem where healthy data vastly outnumbers fault data.
- Core assumption: Additional synthetic fault data provides meaningful training examples that help predictive models learn fault patterns better.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The generated synthetic data significantly improved predictive model performance, with detection rates increasing by up to 80% when synthetic data was incorporated into training."
  - [section] "If M ′′ p performs better than M ′ p, then our hypothesis would be supported."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - corpus focuses on fault diagnosis approaches but not specifically on synthetic data augmentation for predictive maintenance.
- Break condition: When synthetic data quality is poor and doesn't capture true fault characteristics, leading to model degradation rather than improvement.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DSAT-ECG can handle complex multivariate time series data for predictive maintenance.
- Mechanism: The model architecture (SPADE blocks, state-space models) captures both local and long-term dependencies in multivariate time series data.
- Core assumption: The model's architecture is sufficiently complex to capture the intricate patterns in multivariate time series data from industrial systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The increase in sample length and number of variables requires synthetic generative methods to improve their capabilities. They must have the ability to capture long term dependencies, and effectively generative data of a higher complexity."
  - [section] "This model was chosen due to its ability to create high quality synthetic data and capture long term dependencies."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss fault diagnosis but don't specifically address multivariate time series generation capabilities.
- Break condition: When the model's architectural limitations prevent it from capturing the full complexity of the multivariate time series data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models
  - Why needed here: Understanding how diffusion models work is essential for implementing the DSAT-ECG model and interpreting its behavior.
  - Quick check question: How does a diffusion model incrementally add and remove Gaussian noise to learn data patterns?

- Concept: Multivariate time series analysis
  - Why needed here: The dataset contains multiple sensor readings (horizontal and vertical acceleration) over time, requiring understanding of multivariate time series analysis.
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in modeling dependencies between multiple time series signals?

- Concept: Concept drift in predictive maintenance
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses concept drift by using synthetic data generation to adapt to changing system conditions.
  - Quick check question: How does concept drift affect the reliability of predictive maintenance models over time?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PRONOSTIA dataset -> DSAT-ECG model (SPADE blocks, state-space models) -> TSGBench evaluation -> Predictive maintenance model (Mp) -> Performance metrics

- Critical path: 1. Load and partition PRONOSTIA dataset into available (A) and unavailable (U) data 2. Train DSAT-ECG on available data with conditioning scheme 3. Generate synthetic data to supplement unavailable data 4. Evaluate synthetic data quality using TSGBench metrics 5. Train predictive models with and without synthetic data 6. Compare performance to validate synthetic data utility

- Design tradeoffs: Model complexity vs. training time (DSAT-ECG takes ~9 hours on RTX 4090), Conditioning scheme specificity vs. generalizability, Synthetic data quantity vs. quality (risk of mode collapse)

- Failure signatures: Poor TSGBench scores indicating synthetic data doesn't match real data distribution, Predictive model performance worse with synthetic data than without, Generated fault data lacking extreme amplitude spikes present in real fault data

- First 3 experiments: 1. Train DSAT-ECG on full PRONOSTIA dataset and generate synthetic samples to verify basic functionality 2. Partition dataset and train on available data only, then generate synthetic fault data for systems without fault data 3. Train predictive models with and without synthetic data augmentation and compare performance metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the diffusion model be adapted to better capture extreme vibration spikes that occur rarely in fault data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that the model struggled to generate synthetic fault data with amplitude matching real fault data, particularly missing major spikes that exceed 10-20 times normal operating conditions
- Why unresolved: The current model architecture and conditioning scheme do not effectively capture these rare, high-magnitude events, and the paper does not explore architectural modifications to address this limitation
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the model with modified architectures (such as incorporating attention mechanisms specifically for outlier detection) or with conditioning schemes that explicitly weight rare events higher, showing improved generation of extreme vibration spikes

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is there a minimum amount of fault data required for the diffusion model to successfully learn and transfer fault characteristics to new systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper found that predicting unavailable fault data using fault data from similar systems and healthy data from the target system was "not nearly as successful" as supplementing existing datasets
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested one partitioning scheme with γ = 0.3 and did not systematically vary the amount of available fault data to determine if there's a threshold below which transfer learning fails
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the amount of available fault data across multiple datasets, identifying the minimum threshold required for successful transfer learning of fault characteristics

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the conditioning scheme be improved to better capture the temporal dependencies needed for accurate fault prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The poor DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) scores were attributed to "the complex temporal dependencies in the dataset along with the lack of detail in the conditioning scheme"
- Why unresolved: The current conditioning scheme only uses bearing ID and binary fault label, which may be insufficient for capturing the complex temporal patterns in run-to-failure data
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing alternative conditioning schemes that incorporate temporal features (such as percentage of remaining useful life or time-since-start) and demonstrating improved DTW scores and fault prediction accuracy

## Limitations

- Poor performance on Dynamic Time Warping and Kurtosis Difference metrics due to missing extreme vibration spikes in generated fault data
- Difficulty transferring fault characteristics to target systems without their own fault data
- Limited testing on datasets with more complex multivariate characteristics beyond 2 features and 2560 time steps

## Confidence

- **Medium**: Claims about DSAT-ECG's ability to generate synthetic multivariate time series data
- **Medium**: Claims about TSGBench evaluation showing reasonable synthetic data quality
- **Low**: Claims about 80% improvement in detection rates without implementation details
- **Low**: Claims about handling complex multivariate time series without architectural specifics

## Next Checks

1. Implement DSAT-ECG architecture: Reconstruct the model architecture with SPADE blocks and verify the conditioning scheme implementation matches the paper's description.

2. Replicate TSGBench evaluation: Run the TSGBench evaluation framework on both real and synthetic data to verify the reported metric scores (Discriminative Score 0.01, Predictive Score 0.04, C-FID 0.03).

3. Validate predictive performance improvement: Train predictive models with and without synthetic data augmentation using the same methodology as reference [30] to verify the claimed 80% detection rate improvement.
