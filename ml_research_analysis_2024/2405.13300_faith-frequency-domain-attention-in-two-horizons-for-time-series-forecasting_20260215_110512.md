# FAITH: Frequency-domain Attention In Two Horizons for Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.13300
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13300
- Reference count: 40
- The paper proposes FAITH, a novel time series forecasting model that decomposes sequences into trend and seasonal components with frequency-domain attention mechanisms

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of significant deviations in deep learning-based time series forecasting outcomes from ground truth, attributed to insufficient emphasis on extracting sequence latent information, particularly global information in the frequency domain and relationships between different variables. The authors propose FAITH (Frequency-domain Attention In Two Horizons), a novel model that decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components using a multi-scale sequence adaptive decomposition and fusion architecture. FAITH utilizes Frequency Channel feature Extraction Module (FCEM) and Frequency Temporal feature Extraction Module (FTEM) to capture inter-channel relationships and temporal global information, respectively. By modifying the time-frequency domain transformation method, FAITH achieves theoretically linear complexity, effectively reducing computational costs.

## Method Summary
FAITH is a time series forecasting architecture that decomposes sequences into trend and seasonal components with frequency-domain attention mechanisms. The model employs a multi-scale sequence adaptive decomposition and fusion architecture to separate time series into trend and seasonal components. It utilizes Frequency Channel feature Extraction Module (FCEM) and Frequency Temporal feature Extraction Module (FTEM) to capture inter-channel relationships and temporal global information. The architecture modifies the time-frequency domain transformation method to achieve theoretically linear complexity, effectively reducing computational costs while maintaining forecasting accuracy.

## Key Results
- FAITH outperforms existing models in various fields, such as electricity, weather, and traffic
- Strong performance demonstrated on 6 benchmarks for long-term forecasting and 3 benchmarks for short-term forecasting
- Achieves superior results in both long-term and short-term time series forecasting tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that FAITH's effectiveness stems from its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components while simultaneously capturing both frequency-domain and temporal-domain information through specialized attention mechanisms. The multi-scale decomposition allows the model to handle complex patterns at different granularities, while the frequency channel and temporal feature extraction modules enable comprehensive feature learning from both local and global perspectives. The linear complexity transformation method ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance.

## Foundational Learning

### Time Series Decomposition
**Why needed:** Essential for separating trend, seasonal, and residual components in time series data to improve forecasting accuracy
**Quick check:** Verify decomposition preserves all original information content

### Frequency-domain Analysis
**Why needed:** Captures global patterns and periodicities that may be obscured in the time domain
**Quick check:** Confirm frequency representation contains sufficient discriminative information

### Attention Mechanisms
**Why needed:** Enables selective focus on relevant features while suppressing noise and irrelevant information
**Quick check:** Validate attention weights correlate with important pattern regions

### Multi-scale Processing
**Why needed:** Allows simultaneous analysis of patterns at different temporal resolutions
**Quick check:** Ensure scale interactions enhance rather than degrade performance

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input Time Series -> Multi-scale Decomposition -> Trend Component Processing -> FCEM -> Trend Feature Fusion
                                      |
                                      -> Seasonal Component Processing -> FTEM -> Seasonal Feature Fusion
                                      |
                                      -> Feature Concatenation -> Forecast Output

### Critical Path
Time series input flows through decomposition into trend and seasonal components, each processed through respective feature extraction modules (FCEM for trend, FTEM for seasonal), then fused and concatenated for final forecasting output.

### Design Tradeoffs
The architecture trades increased model complexity for improved feature extraction capabilities. The multi-scale decomposition adds computational overhead but enables better pattern separation. The frequency-domain attention mechanisms increase parameter count but provide more comprehensive feature learning.

### Failure Signatures
Poor decomposition quality may lead to mixing trend and seasonal information, degrading forecast accuracy. Insufficient attention mechanism capacity could result in missing important patterns. Linear complexity claims may not hold for certain hardware configurations or implementation choices.

### First 3 Experiments
1. Test decomposition accuracy on synthetic time series with known trend/seasonal components
2. Evaluate attention mechanism effectiveness on frequency-domain feature selection
3. Benchmark computational complexity against theoretical linear complexity claims
