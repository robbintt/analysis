# Interpretable Syntactic Representations Enable Hierarchical Word Vectors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.08384
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08384
- Reference count: 18
- Hierarchical vectors outperform original vectors on text classification, noun phrase bracketing, question classification, sentiment analysis, and discriminative attributes tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method to transform dense word vectors into interpretable syntactic representations based on the eight parts of speech, enabling human-understandable visualization and comparison of word vectors. The proposed syntactic representations are compact, derived from pre-trained word vectors, and maintain or improve performance in downstream tasks. Hierarchical word vectors are then constructed by incrementally combining these syntactic representations with the original vectors, mimicking human learning. Experiments demonstrate that hierarchical vectors outperform the original vectors in benchmark tasks such as text classification, noun phrase bracketing, question classification, sentiment analysis, and capturing discriminative attributes. The method is computationally efficient and provides a plausible interpretation of word vectors while maintaining high task performance.

## Method Summary
The method transforms pre-trained word embeddings into interpretable syntactic representations by projecting them onto an 8-dimensional subspace defined by WordNet-derived part-of-speech word lists. This projection uses a basis matrix constructed by averaging word vectors for each part of speech, followed by normalization. Hierarchical vectors are created by combining the syntactic representations with the original dense vectors using either Kronecker product (overcomplete) or weighted averaging (weighted) approaches. These hierarchical vectors are then evaluated on downstream tasks including text classification, noun phrase bracketing, question classification, sentiment analysis, and word similarity. The interpretability is validated through part-of-speech classification accuracy on the syntactic representations.

## Key Results
- Hierarchical vectors outperform original vectors across all benchmark tasks, with average improvements of 2-5% accuracy
- Syntactic representations achieve over 90% accuracy in part-of-speech classification, demonstrating strong interpretability
- Weighted averaging method provides a compact alternative to Kronecker product while maintaining competitive performance
- Word list size analysis shows that even small syntactic bases (1000 words per POS) yield strong results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The syntactic subspace projection isolates syntactic regularities from dense word vectors.
- Mechanism: By constructing a basis matrix C from WordNet words per part of speech, the method projects original vectors onto an 8-dimensional syntactic subspace using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. This transformation reduces dimensionality while preserving syntactic information.
- Core assumption: WordNet provides a reliable and comprehensive source for grouping words by part of speech, and the vocabulary overlap between WordNet and pre-trained vectors is sufficient.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "transform these word vectors into reduced syntactic representations" and "construct the syntactic subspace, we leverage linguistic knowledge obtained from a pre-constructed linguistic resource, WordNet"
  - [section] "To build the syntactic subspace, we leverage linguistic knowledge obtained from a pre-constructed linguistic resource, WordNet (Miller, 1995)"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors don't directly discuss syntactic subspace projection; corpus focus is on vector representations and interpretability but not this specific transformation mechanism.
- Break condition: If the vocabulary overlap between WordNet and the pre-trained vectors is too small, the projection matrix C becomes ill-conditioned and the transformation fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical vectors improve downstream performance by combining syntactic representations with original vectors.
- Mechanism: The method creates composite vectors by either Kronecker product (overcomplete) or weighted averaging (weighted) of syntactic representations with original vectors, allowing models to learn from both syntactic structure and semantic content incrementally.
- Core assumption: Adding syntactic information as a first layer of learning provides a better foundation than learning directly from dense semantic vectors alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "hierarchical word vectors are then constructed by incrementally combining these syntactic representations with the original vectors, mimicking human learning"
  - [section] "Hierarchical Vectorsutilize the basics of human learning by emulating the hierarchical aspect of learning" and "initial phase of learning from the reduced Syntactic Representations, followed by the gradual incorporation of the broader original word vectors"
  - [corpus] Moderate - neighbors discuss hierarchical representations and interpretable debiasing, supporting the general concept but not this specific incremental learning approach.
- Break condition: If the syntactic representations are too noisy or don't capture meaningful structure, the incremental learning approach could degrade rather than improve performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The interpretability of syntactic representations enables meaningful visualization and comparison.
- Mechanism: By mapping each coordinate to a specific part of speech, the representations allow humans to understand what each dimension represents and compare words based on their syntactic roles rather than arbitrary vector coordinates.
- Core assumption: The eight parts of speech provide a meaningful and complete framework for interpreting word vectors across different domains and languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "compact and interpretable allowing better visualization and comparison of the word vectors" and "coordinates whose values are meaningful to humans and can be compared against other coordinates"
  - [section] "common absolute that encompasses all words in the vocabulary are the eight parts of speech" and "each coordinate corresponds to one of the eight parts of speech"
  - [corpus] Moderate - neighbors discuss interpretable representations and visualization, supporting the importance of interpretability but not this specific part-of-speech framework.
- Break condition: If words have multiple syntactic roles that vary significantly by context, the single static representation per word becomes misleading.

## Foundational Learning

- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - Why needed here: Used to analyze the effect of transformation on embedding space by examining singular values and condition numbers of representation matrices
  - Quick check question: What does a high condition number indicate about the numerical stability of a matrix?

- Linear Algebra - Projection and Basis Transformation
  - Why needed here: The core transformation relies on projecting vectors onto a syntactic subspace using a change of basis matrix
  - Quick check question: How does the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse enable projection when the basis matrix is not square?

- Statistical Significance Testing
  - Why needed here: The evaluation uses paired t-tests to determine if performance improvements are statistically significant rather than due to chance
  - Quick check question: What does a p-value below the significance threshold tell us about the null hypothesis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: WordNet → Syntactic Subspace Construction → Vector Projection → Hierarchical Vector Generation → Downstream Evaluation
- Critical path: The transformation from dense vectors to syntactic representations is the critical path; all downstream benefits depend on this working correctly
- Design tradeoffs: Using WordNet provides interpretability but limits vocabulary coverage; the coarse-grained part-of-speech approach sacrifices fine-grained semantic distinctions for interpretability
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on word similarity tasks despite good performance on classification tasks indicates the transformation is capturing syntactic rather than semantic information
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify the projection matrix C can be constructed from WordNet words and has reasonable condition number
  2. Test that syntactic representations maintain basic semantic relationships (e.g., synonyms have similar syntactic profiles)
  3. Evaluate the word classification accuracy on WordNet-derived test sets to confirm interpretability claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do hierarchical word vectors perform on contextualized embeddings like BERT and ELMo compared to non-contextual embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that semi-supervised models like BERT and ELMo have demonstrated better performance in downstream tasks, but the study focuses on non-contextual embeddings and does not explore hierarchical vectors with contextual embeddings.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results or analysis on hierarchical vectors derived from contextual embeddings, leaving their potential performance and interpretability unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing hierarchical vectors built from contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, ELMo) with those from non-contextual embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) across the same benchmark tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using more than eight parts of speech on the interpretability and performance of syntactic representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a coarse-grained approach with eight parts of speech for interpretability but mentions that a finer-grained approach with more classes (e.g., modals, determiners) would result in even lower sample sizes per class.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not experiment with more than eight parts of speech, so the potential benefits or drawbacks of a finer-grained approach remain unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing syntactic representations with a larger number of parts of speech and analyzing their interpretability and performance in downstream tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the size of the word list used to construct syntactic subspaces affect the performance and interpretability of hierarchical vectors in tasks with limited data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates the effect of word list size on benchmark tasks but does not specifically address tasks with limited data or analyze the trade-offs between word list size and performance in such scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experiments focus on general benchmark tasks without isolating the impact of word list size in low-data settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing hierarchical vectors built from different word list sizes on tasks with varying data availability, analyzing the trade-offs between interpretability, performance, and data scarcity.

## Limitations

- The method relies on WordNet vocabulary coverage, which may not overlap sufficiently with pre-trained embeddings
- Static syntactic representations cannot capture context-dependent syntactic variations of words
- The eight-part-of-speech framework oversimplifies linguistic structure and may lose fine-grained semantic distinctions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mechanism of using WordNet for syntactic labeling and the basic projection methodology are well-established approaches with clear mathematical foundations.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that hierarchical vectors outperform original vectors across all tasks requires careful validation, as improvements may be domain-dependent and the incremental learning benefit is theoretically plausible but empirically sensitive to implementation details.
- **Low confidence**: The interpretability claims are primarily validated through POS classification accuracy, which doesn't fully demonstrate that humans can meaningfully interpret and use these representations for linguistic insights.

## Next Checks

1. **Vocabulary coverage analysis**: Measure the exact percentage of pre-trained word vectors that have WordNet part-of-speech labels and analyze how this coverage varies across different domains and frequency bands.

2. **Contextual syntactic evaluation**: Test whether the static syntactic representations capture context-dependent syntactic roles by evaluating on datasets with clear polysemy cases where the same word functions as different parts of speech.

3. **Downstream task ablation study**: Perform systematic ablation experiments removing the syntactic component versus the original semantic component to quantify the relative contributions of each to the observed performance improvements.
