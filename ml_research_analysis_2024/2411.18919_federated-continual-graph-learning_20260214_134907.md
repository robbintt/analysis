# Federated Continual Graph Learning

## Quick Facts

- First framework addressing federated continual graph learning with experience node selection and trajectory-aware knowledge transfer

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces POWER, the first Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL) framework addressing catastrophic forgetting in decentralized evolving graphs. The framework tackles two key challenges: Local Graph Forgetting (LGF), where clients lose prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and Global Expertise Conflict (GEC), where parameter aggregation across clients with divergent expertise leads to sub-optimal global performance. POWER employs experience node selection with local-global coverage maximization to preserve prior knowledge and pseudo-prototype reconstruction with trajectory-aware knowledge transfer to resolve expertise conflicts.

## Method Summary
POWER operates in a federated setting where multiple clients train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on their local evolving graph data while communicating with a central server. The framework consists of two main modules: (1) Local-Global Coverage Maximization for selecting experience nodes that capture maximum knowledge from both local and global perspectives, stored in client buffers and replayed during new task training to mitigate LGF; (2) Trajectory-aware Knowledge Transfer using privacy-preserving pseudo prototype reconstruction, where clients send prototype gradients to the server, which reconstructs pseudo prototypes and builds a global buffer graph to resolve GEC through knowledge transfer weighted by client expertise trajectories.

## Key Results
- POWER consistently outperforms federated adaptations of centralized CGL baselines and vision-centric federated continual learning approaches
- Achieves superior Accuracy Mean (AM) and lower Forgetting Mean (FM) across eight benchmark graph datasets
- Demonstrates effectiveness of experience node selection and trajectory-aware knowledge transfer mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage reduce catastrophic forgetting in decentralized evolving graphs.
- Mechanism: Selects nodes with highest combined local and global embedding coverage per class, stores them in local buffer, and replays them during new task training to preserve prior knowledge.
- Core assumption: Nodes with high local-global coverage capture representative information from both local and global perspectives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "preserves experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage locally to mitigate LGF"
  - [section 4.1] "To ensure that selected experience nodes capture knowledge from previous tasks, we build upon the Coverage Maximization (CM) strategy"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism, but related federated continual learning papers exist

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pseudo prototype reconstruction captures client evolution trajectories and resolves global expertise conflicts.
- Mechanism: Clients compute class prototypes, send prototype gradients to server, server reconstructs pseudo prototypes via gradient matching, then builds global buffer graph and applies trajectory-aware knowledge transfer.
- Core assumption: Prototype gradients preserve enough information to reconstruct meaningful pseudo prototypes without revealing private data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "leverages pseudo-prototype reconstruction with trajectory-aware knowledge transfer to resolve GEC"
  - [section 4.2] "POWER adopts a privacy-preserving strategy where clients send prototype gradients instead, allowing the server to reconstruct pseudo prototypes via gradient matching"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Trajectory-aware knowledge transfer improves global model performance by leveraging expertise from clients with divergent evolution paths.
- Mechanism: Server constructs global buffer graph from pseudo prototypes, computes cumulative label distributions for each client, and uses KL divergence weighted by client expertise to transfer knowledge to global model.
- Core assumption: Clients develop expertise in specific classes based on their unique evolution trajectories, and this expertise can be effectively captured and transferred.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "leverages pseudo-prototype reconstruction with trajectory-aware knowledge transfer to resolve GEC"
  - [section 4.2] "The extent to the global model's integration of expertise from each local GNN is guided by the client's evolution trajectory"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for node classification
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses continual learning on graph-structured data where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships
  - Quick check question: What is the primary operation performed by GNNs to aggregate information from neighboring nodes?

- Concept: Federated Learning (FL) and parameter aggregation
  - Why needed here: The framework operates in a decentralized setting where clients train locally and a central server aggregates model parameters
  - Quick check question: How does FedAvg aggregate parameters from multiple clients, and what assumption does this aggregation make about data distribution?

- Concept: Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses the fundamental challenge of maintaining performance on previous tasks while learning new tasks in evolving graphs
  - Quick check question: What is the primary cause of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks trained on sequential tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Client-side: Local GNN, experience node selection, local buffer, prototype gradient computation → Server-side: Global GNN, pseudo prototype reconstruction, global buffer graph, trajectory-aware knowledge transfer

- Critical path: Local training → Experience node selection → Prototype gradient computation → Server aggregation → Pseudo prototype reconstruction → Global buffer construction → Knowledge transfer → Parameter distribution

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Storage vs. performance: Larger local buffers improve performance but increase storage costs
  - Privacy vs. effectiveness: Prototype gradients preserve privacy but may lose some information compared to raw prototypes
  - Communication efficiency vs. model quality: More frequent communication improves global model but increases communication overhead

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor local performance despite global improvement: Indicates LGF not properly addressed
  - Global model degradation: Suggests GEC or ineffective knowledge transfer
  - High communication overhead with minimal performance gain: Implies inefficient knowledge transfer mechanism

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test experience node selection on a simple graph with known class distributions to verify coverage maximization
  2. Validate pseudo prototype reconstruction by comparing reconstructed prototypes to original prototypes in a controlled setting
  3. Evaluate knowledge transfer effectiveness by measuring performance improvement when combining expertise from multiple clients with complementary class distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of POWER scale with the number of clients in the federated setting?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses POWER's effectiveness with 3-10 clients across different datasets, but does not explore scenarios with larger numbers of clients.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only test POWER with a limited number of clients, leaving open questions about its scalability and performance in scenarios with many more clients.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing POWER's performance across a range of client counts (e.g., 10, 50, 100) would provide insights into its scalability and potential limitations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different graph structures (e.g., heterogeneous vs. homogeneous graphs) on POWER's effectiveness?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tests POWER on various graph types (citation, co-purchase, co-authorship, etc.) but does not specifically investigate the impact of graph heterogeneity on its performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on node classification tasks and does not explicitly address how POWER performs on graphs with different structural characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing POWER's performance on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs with varying levels of structural complexity would clarify its robustness to different graph structures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does POWER handle concept drift in the evolving graph data over time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in evolving graphs but does not explicitly discuss how POWER adapts to concept drift, where the underlying data distribution changes over time.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on mitigating forgetting of past tasks but does not investigate POWER's ability to adapt to changes in the data distribution itself.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating POWER's performance on graphs with simulated concept drift, such as gradually changing class distributions or feature distributions over time, would assess its adaptability to evolving data patterns.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on synthetic federated splits of public datasets rather than real-world federated scenarios
- Proposed mechanisms lack theoretical grounding for why coverage maximization and pseudo prototype reconstruction specifically address the identified challenges
- Framework's scalability to larger graphs and more clients remains untested

## Confidence
- Mechanism effectiveness claims: **Medium** - supported by experimental results but lacking ablation studies isolating each mechanism's contribution
- Superiority over baselines: **High** - statistically significant improvements demonstrated across multiple datasets
- Theoretical contributions: **Low** - primarily empirical work without formal convergence or regret bounds

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of coverage maximization and trajectory-aware knowledge transfer to overall performance
2. Test framework scalability on larger graphs (e.g., OGB-papers100M) with varying numbers of clients and communication rounds
3. Implement privacy analysis measuring membership inference risk from prototype gradients across different attack scenarios
