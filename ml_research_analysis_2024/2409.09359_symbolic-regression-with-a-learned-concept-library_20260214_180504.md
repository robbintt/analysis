core_contribution: This paper introduces LASR, a symbolic regression method that combines
  genetic algorithms with zero-shot LLM queries to discover and evolve textual concepts.
  LASR alternates between hypothesis evolution (guided by LLM operations conditioned

# Symbolic Regression with a Learned Concept Library

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.09359
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09359
- Reference count: 40
- LASR achieves 72/100 exact solutions on Feynman Equations dataset, outperforming PySR's 59/100

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LASR, a symbolic regression method that combines genetic algorithms with zero-shot LLM queries to discover and evolve textual concepts. The method alternates between hypothesis evolution guided by LLM operations conditioned on learned concepts, concept abstraction to extract interpretable concepts from high-performing hypotheses, and concept evolution to generate new concepts from existing ones. LASR was evaluated on the Feynman Equations dataset and a synthetic dataset designed to avoid data leakage, demonstrating significant improvements over previous methods. The approach also discovered a novel LLM scaling law from the BigBench dataset.

## Method Summary
LASR is a symbolic regression method that leverages genetic algorithms and zero-shot LLM queries to discover and evolve textual concepts. The algorithm operates in cycles, alternating between three phases: hypothesis evolution (using LLM-guided operations based on learned concepts), concept abstraction (extracting interpretable concepts from high-performing hypotheses), and concept evolution (generating new concepts from existing ones). This iterative process allows LASR to build a learned concept library that guides the search for symbolic expressions. The method was specifically designed to address the limitations of traditional genetic algorithms in symbolic regression by incorporating semantic understanding through LLMs, enabling more efficient exploration of the solution space.

## Key Results
- LASR achieved 72/100 exact solutions on the Feynman Equations dataset compared to PySR's 59/100
- On a synthetic dataset designed to avoid data leakage, LASR outperformed PySR
- LASR discovered a novel LLM scaling law from the BigBench dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LASR works by integrating LLM capabilities into the symbolic regression process through concept learning. The key mechanism involves using LLMs to generate and evaluate symbolic expressions based on learned concepts, which act as semantic building blocks. During hypothesis evolution, the LLM conditions its operations on these concepts, allowing for more meaningful modifications than random genetic operations. Concept abstraction identifies recurring patterns in successful hypotheses, which are then formalized as new concepts. This creates a feedback loop where successful concepts are reused and evolved, accelerating the discovery of accurate symbolic expressions. The zero-shot querying approach allows LASR to leverage LLM knowledge without requiring extensive fine-tuning, making it more practical and adaptable.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Symbolic Regression Basics**: Understanding the goal of finding interpretable mathematical expressions that fit data
   - Why needed: Core problem LASR addresses
   - Quick check: Can identify when a mathematical expression accurately represents data

2. **Genetic Algorithm Operations**: Knowledge of mutation, crossover, and selection mechanisms
   - Why needed: LASR builds upon traditional genetic algorithms
   - Quick check: Can explain how genetic operations modify symbolic expressions

3. **LLM Prompt Engineering**: Understanding how to construct effective prompts for zero-shot queries
   - Why needed: Critical for LASR's concept-guided operations
   - Quick check: Can formulate prompts that elicit desired symbolic expressions

4. **Concept Learning Theory**: Understanding how abstract concepts can guide search processes
   - Why needed: Central to LASR's approach of learning and evolving concepts
   - Quick check: Can explain how learned concepts improve search efficiency

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data -> Preprocessor -> Genetic Algorithm -> LLM Query Engine -> Concept Library -> Evolved Hypotheses -> Evaluation -> Concept Abstraction

**Critical Path**: The most important sequence is Data -> Preprocessor -> Genetic Algorithm -> LLM Query Engine -> Concept Library, as this chain represents the core learning loop where concepts are discovered, applied, and evolved.

**Design Tradeoffs**: LASR trades computational efficiency for semantic understanding by using LLM queries. While this introduces latency and cost, it enables more meaningful search operations compared to random genetic modifications. The method also balances between exploration (trying new concepts) and exploitation (using proven concepts), with the concept evolution mechanism providing a middle ground.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor performance may indicate inadequate concept abstraction or evolution
- High computational cost without corresponding accuracy gains suggests inefficient LLM querying
- Failure to discover novel concepts may indicate insufficient diversity in initial hypothesis generation

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Run LASR on a simple symbolic regression problem with known solution to verify basic functionality
2. Test concept abstraction on a dataset where the underlying pattern is obvious to validate concept discovery
3. Evaluate the impact of concept library size on performance to understand the tradeoff between concept diversity and search efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance claims are based on a single dataset (Feynman Equations) with limited statistical power
- Heavy reliance on LLM capabilities makes the method vulnerable to model availability, cost, and potential biases
- The discovered LLM scaling law requires more rigorous validation to confirm it represents a genuinely novel finding

## Confidence
- High confidence: LASR's architecture and algorithm description are clearly presented and technically sound
- Medium confidence: The performance improvement over PySR on the Feynman dataset is real but may not generalize to other symbolic regression tasks
- Low confidence: Claims about discovering novel scientific relationships (the LLM scaling law) require more rigorous validation

## Next Checks
1. Test LASR on multiple symbolic regression benchmarks beyond the Feynman dataset to assess generalizability of performance improvements
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (LLM queries, concept evolution, etc.) to overall performance
3. Verify the discovered LLM scaling law through independent data sources and statistical analysis to confirm it represents a genuinely novel finding
