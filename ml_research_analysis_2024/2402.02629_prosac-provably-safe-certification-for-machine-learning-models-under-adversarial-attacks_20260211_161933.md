# PROSAC: Provably Safe Certification for Machine Learning Models under Adversarial Attacks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.02629
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02629
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: PROSAC framework certifies adversarial robustness with provable population-level risk guarantees using hypothesis testing and Bayesian optimization

## Executive Summary
PROSAC introduces a novel framework for certifying machine learning model robustness against adversarial attacks with provable guarantees. The key innovation is formulating robustness certification as a hypothesis testing problem, where a model is considered (α, ζ)-safe if the probability of incorrectly declaring the adversarial risk below α is less than ζ. The framework uses Bayesian optimization (GP-UCB) to efficiently approximate p-values for different attack hyperparameters, enabling rigorous certification that goes beyond empirical approaches. Experiments on ImageNet-1k demonstrate that vision transformers (ViTs) are generally more robust than ResNets, and larger models show greater robustness than smaller ones.

## Method Summary
PROSAC addresses the challenge of certifying adversarial robustness by framing it as a statistical hypothesis testing problem. The framework defines a model as (α, ζ)-safe if it can guarantee with probability at least (1-ζ) that the adversarial risk is below threshold α. To evaluate this, PROSAC employs a Bayesian optimization algorithm (GP-UCB) that efficiently searches the space of attack hyperparameters to find the most effective adversarial examples. This optimization process approximates p-values for different attack configurations, enabling statistically rigorous certification. The approach is designed to provide provable guarantees about model safety under specific attack models, making it suitable for regulatory compliance and safety-critical applications.

## Key Results
- PROSAC provides provable population-level risk guarantees for adversarial robustness
- Vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate greater robustness to adversarial attacks than ResNets on ImageNet-1k
- Larger models consistently show higher robustness than smaller models across experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PROSAC works by transforming the problem of adversarial robustness certification into a statistical hypothesis testing framework. Instead of attempting to exhaustively test all possible adversarial examples, the framework formulates the problem as determining whether the probability of misclassification under adversarial attacks exceeds a threshold α. By using Bayesian optimization (GP-UCB) to efficiently explore the space of attack hyperparameters, PROSAC can approximate p-values that quantify the statistical evidence against the null hypothesis that the model is safe. This approach enables rigorous, provable guarantees about model safety while remaining computationally tractable, addressing a fundamental limitation of empirical robustness evaluations that lack statistical guarantees.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Hypothesis Testing for Model Certification** - A statistical framework for making decisions based on data while controlling error rates. Why needed: Provides the mathematical foundation for provable safety guarantees. Quick check: Verify understanding of Type I and Type II errors and p-value interpretation.

2. **Bayesian Optimization (GP-UCB)** - An optimization algorithm that uses Gaussian processes to model the objective function and intelligently explore the search space. Why needed: Enables efficient approximation of p-values across attack hyperparameter space. Quick check: Confirm understanding of acquisition functions and exploration-exploitation tradeoff.

3. **Adversarial Risk Quantification** - The probability that a model misclassifies an input under worst-case perturbations. Why needed: Central to defining what it means for a model to be "safe" under attacks. Quick check: Verify ability to compute adversarial risk using different attack methods.

4. **Statistical Significance Testing** - Methods for determining whether observed differences are likely due to chance. Why needed: Provides the mathematical basis for certifying safety with confidence bounds. Quick check: Confirm understanding of confidence intervals and significance thresholds.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Model → PROSAC Framework → Hypothesis Test → Bayesian Optimization → PGD Attack → Adversarial Examples → Risk Estimation

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves feeding the model through PROSAC's hypothesis testing framework, which uses Bayesian optimization to guide PGD attacks toward finding the most effective adversarial examples, then estimating the resulting adversarial risk to compute statistical guarantees.

**Design Tradeoffs:** PROSAC trades computational efficiency for provable guarantees - exhaustive testing would provide stronger guarantees but is computationally infeasible, while the Bayesian optimization approach provides rigorous but attack-specific certification. The framework also trades generality (works only for specified attack method) for statistical rigor.

**Failure Signatures:** The framework may fail to certify models that are robust to PGD attacks but vulnerable to other attack methods. It may also produce overly conservative results when the Bayesian optimization struggles to explore the attack hyperparameter space effectively, or when the statistical assumptions underlying the hypothesis test are violated.

**First Experiments:** 1) Apply PROSAC to a simple CNN on MNIST to verify basic functionality. 2) Compare PROSAC certification results with empirical adversarial accuracy on CIFAR-10. 3) Test the framework on a small ViT and ResNet pair to verify the observed robustness hierarchy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- The framework provides guarantees only for the specific attack method used (PGD), not for unknown or different attack strategies
- Significant computational cost due to multiple rounds of Bayesian optimization and adversarial attack evaluations
- Results may not generalize beyond the specific experimental setup (ImageNet-1k, PGD attacks)

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the mathematical framework and hypothesis testing formulation
**Medium confidence** in experimental results on ImageNet-1k, given the specific experimental setup
**Low confidence** in generalizability to other model architectures, datasets, or attack methods

## Next Checks

1. Test PROSAC's effectiveness against multiple attack methods (e.g., CW, DeepFool) beyond PGD to assess method-dependence
2. Validate results on smaller-scale datasets (CIFAR-10/100) to verify consistency across different problem scales
3. Evaluate the framework's performance on models with known robustness techniques (like adversarial training) to compare certification effectiveness
