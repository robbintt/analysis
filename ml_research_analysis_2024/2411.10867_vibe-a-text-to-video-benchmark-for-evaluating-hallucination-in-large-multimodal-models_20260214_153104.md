# ViBe: A Text-to-Video Benchmark for Evaluating Hallucination in Large Multimodal Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.10867
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10867
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Benchmark of 3,782 annotated videos from 837 captions for evaluating hallucinations in text-to-video models

## Executive Summary
ViBe introduces a large-scale benchmark for evaluating hallucinations in Text-to-Video (T2V) models. The dataset comprises 3,782 videos generated from 837 MS COCO captions using ten open-source T2V models, annotated across five hallucination categories. A classification framework using video embeddings achieves initial performance of 0.345 accuracy and 0.342 F1 score. The benchmark aims to standardize evaluation and improve reliability of T2V outputs.

## Method Summary
The ViBe benchmark is constructed by generating videos from MS COCO captions using ten open-source T2V models. Each video is annotated by human annotators into five hallucination categories: Vanishing Subject, Numeric Variability, Temporal Dysmorphia, Omission Error, and Physical Incongruity. A classification framework is established using video embeddings, with TimeSFormer and CNN ensemble achieving the best initial performance. The dataset provides a standardized resource for evaluating hallucination detection in T2V models.

## Key Results
- Dataset of 3,782 annotated videos from 837 captions across ten T2V models
- Five hallucination categories identified: Vanishing Subject, Numeric Variability, Temporal Dysmorphia, Omission Error, Physical Incongruity
- TimeSFormer + CNN ensemble achieves 0.345 accuracy and 0.342 F1 score
- Benchmark provides standardized evaluation resource for hallucination detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by providing a standardized dataset with human-annotated labels for different types of hallucinations in T2V outputs. The classification framework leverages video embeddings from models like TimeSFormer combined with CNNs to detect these hallucinations automatically. This approach allows researchers to measure model performance consistently and identify areas for improvement in hallucination detection.

## Foundational Learning
- **Video Embeddings**: Numerical representations of video content that capture spatial and temporal features. Why needed: To enable machine learning models to process and classify video content. Quick check: Verify embeddings capture both spatial (objects) and temporal (motion) information.

- **Hallucination Categories**: Systematic classification of misalignment types between prompts and outputs. Why needed: To provide granular evaluation of where and how T2V models fail. Quick check: Ensure categories are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

- **MS COCO Dataset**: Standard dataset of image captions used as prompts. Why needed: Provides diverse, high-quality text descriptions for video generation. Quick check: Verify caption diversity covers various objects, actions, and scenes.

- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple model predictions (TimeSFormer + CNN). Why needed: To leverage complementary strengths of different architectures. Quick check: Measure performance improvement over individual models.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: MS COCO Captions -> T2V Models -> Video Generation -> Human Annotation -> Dataset -> Embedding Models -> Classification Framework

**Critical Path**: Captions → T2V Generation → Human Annotation → Video Embeddings → Classification → Performance Metrics

**Design Tradeoffs**: Open-source T2V models limit generalizability but ensure reproducibility; five hallucination categories balance comprehensiveness with annotation feasibility; ensemble approach improves accuracy but increases complexity.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Low inter-annotator agreement indicating ambiguous hallucination categories
- Poor classification performance suggesting embedding models don't capture relevant features
- Inconsistent results across different T2V models indicating dataset bias

**First Experiments**:
1. Measure inter-annotator agreement on hallucination categories
2. Compare classification performance using different embedding architectures
3. Test generalization by evaluating on held-out T2V models not used in dataset creation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small dataset scale (3,782 videos from 837 captions) compared to vast prompt space
- Five hallucination categories may not capture all misalignment types
- Limited to open-source T2V models, reducing generalizability
- Modest initial classification performance (0.345 accuracy) indicates difficulty of task

## Confidence
- ViBe provides standardized resource: Medium
- Classification framework effectiveness: Low
- Research will improve T2V reliability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate classification framework on held-out test set of unseen videos
2. Conduct human evaluation study to validate automatic classification results
3. Test benchmark by comparing new T2V model performance against existing models
