# MAPPING: Debiasing Graph Neural Networks for Fair Node Classification with Limited Sensitive Information Leakage

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.12824
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12824
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves up to 50% reduction in fairness disparities while maintaining comparable utility

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MAPPING, a novel framework for mitigating bias in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) during node classification tasks. The approach is particularly designed for scenarios where sensitive attributes are partially observed, a common challenge in real-world applications. MAPPING employs distance covariance-based fairness constraints combined with adversarial training to jointly debias both node features and graph topologies at the pre-processing stage. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets using multiple GNN variants, the framework demonstrates significant improvements in fairness metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy and other utility measures.

## Method Summary
MAPPING addresses the challenge of bias in GNNs by implementing a pre-processing framework that debiases both node features and graph topologies. The core innovation lies in using distance covariance (dCov) as a fairness constraint, which measures the dependence between node features and sensitive attributes. This is combined with adversarial training where a discriminator network attempts to predict sensitive attributes from debiased representations, creating a minimax optimization problem. The framework operates under the realistic assumption that only a subset of sensitive attributes are observed (10% in experiments), making it applicable to scenarios where complete attribute labeling is impractical or privacy-sensitive.

## Key Results
- Reduces statistical parity difference (ΔSP) and equal opportunity difference (ΔEO) by up to 50% compared to baseline models
- Maintains comparable or better accuracy, F1, and AUC scores while improving fairness metrics
- Successfully mitigates privacy risks by reducing sensitive information leakage through attribute inference attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MAPPING's effectiveness stems from its dual debiasing approach that simultaneously addresses both node features and graph topologies. The distance covariance-based fairness constraints provide a principled way to measure and minimize dependence between representations and sensitive attributes without requiring complete attribute observation. The adversarial training component creates a robust debiasing mechanism that forces the GNN to learn representations that are both predictive for the main task and invariant to sensitive attributes. By operating at the pre-processing stage, MAPPING can be integrated with various GNN architectures without requiring architectural modifications.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Distance Covariance (dCov)**: A measure of statistical dependence between random vectors that captures both linear and nonlinear relationships. Why needed: Traditional correlation measures are limited to linear relationships, while dCov can detect more complex dependencies between node features and sensitive attributes. Quick check: Verify that dCov returns zero for independent variables and positive values for dependent variables.

2. **Adversarial Training in Fairness Context**: A technique where a discriminator network is trained to predict sensitive attributes from representations, while the main model tries to prevent this prediction. Why needed: Creates a minimax game that forces the model to learn representations that are useful for classification but uninformative about sensitive attributes. Quick check: Monitor discriminator accuracy - it should decrease as debiasing progresses.

3. **Graph Neural Networks for Node Classification**: Neural networks designed to operate on graph-structured data that aggregate information from neighboring nodes. Why needed: GNNs are the primary target for debiasing as they are widely used for node classification tasks where fairness concerns arise. Quick check: Verify that node representations capture both local neighborhood information and global graph structure.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Data -> Preprocessing (MAPPING) -> Debiased Graph -> GNN Backbone -> Node Classification Output

Critical Path: The most critical path is the preprocessing stage where MAPPING transforms the original graph and node features into debiased representations. This transformation directly impacts the fairness-utility trade-off and must balance between removing sensitive information while preserving predictive power.

Design Tradeoffs: The framework trades computational overhead in the preprocessing stage for improved fairness guarantees. The choice of distance covariance as the fairness metric balances between computational tractability and effectiveness in capturing complex dependencies.

Failure Signatures: If the discriminator consistently achieves high accuracy in predicting sensitive attributes, it indicates insufficient debiasing. Conversely, if the main model's utility metrics drop significantly, it suggests over-debiasing that removes too much predictive information.

Three First Experiments:
1. Test MAPPING on synthetic graphs with known bias patterns to verify the debiasing mechanism works as expected.
2. Compare distance covariance-based constraints against correlation-based constraints on datasets with both linear and nonlinear bias patterns.
3. Evaluate the impact of varying the percentage of observed sensitive attributes (e.g., 5%, 10%, 20%) on debiasing effectiveness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on a limited number of datasets (3) and GNN variants (4), which may not generalize to all graph structures and domains
- Privacy analysis focuses primarily on attribute inference attacks without considering other potential privacy vulnerabilities
- Assumes partially observed sensitive attributes (10%) which may not reflect all real-world scenarios
- Computational overhead introduced by the MAPPING framework is not thoroughly analyzed

## Confidence

High Confidence:
- The theoretical formulation of the debiasing objective and the use of distance covariance for fairness constraints are well-established approaches with clear mathematical foundations

Medium Confidence:
- The empirical results showing improved fairness-utility trade-offs are convincing within the tested scenarios, but may not generalize to all graph structures and domains
- The privacy benefits regarding sensitive information leakage are demonstrated through attribute inference attacks, but the analysis could be more comprehensive

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate MAPPING's performance on larger, more diverse datasets with varying graph characteristics (heterophilic vs. homophilic, different sizes, different domains) to assess generalizability.

2. Conduct a thorough computational complexity analysis comparing MAPPING's training time and resource requirements against baseline methods to understand the practical overhead.

3. Expand the privacy evaluation to include membership inference attacks and differential privacy metrics to provide a more complete privacy assessment beyond attribute inference.
