# Prediction Of Cryptocurrency Prices Using LSTM, SVM And Polynomial Regression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.03410
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03410
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: SVM with linear kernel achieved lowest MSE (0.02) for Bitcoin price prediction

## Executive Summary
This study compares three predictive models - LSTM, SVM, and Polynomial Regression - for forecasting Bitcoin prices. Using Mean Square Error (MSE) as the evaluation metric, the research demonstrates that SVM with a linear kernel significantly outperforms the other models, achieving an MSE of 0.02 compared to LSTM's 97.92 and Polynomial Regression's 51,702,001.51. The study concludes that SVM is the most suitable model for predicting Bitcoin prices among the three algorithms tested, particularly due to its effective handling of non-linear data patterns.

## Method Summary
The research employs historical Bitcoin price data from 2020 to 2024 obtained from Yahoo Finance, specifically using closing price data. Three models were tested: LSTM with Adam optimizer and varying epochs (10, 30, 50, 80, 100), SVM with linear kernel and varying C parameters (1e0 to 1e3), and Polynomial Regression with varying degrees (2, 4, 6, 9, 11). The study uses 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing, comparing model performance based on Mean Square Error.

## Key Results
- SVM with linear kernel achieved the lowest MSE of 0.02
- LSTM achieved an MSE of 97.92 with optimal performance at epoch 30
- Polynomial Regression showed extremely high MSE of 51,702,001.51, particularly problematic at higher degrees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SVM with a linear kernel outperforms LSTM and Polynomial Regression for Bitcoin price prediction due to its effective handling of non-linear data patterns in a supervised learning framework.
- Mechanism: The linear SVM kernel constructs an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes, effectively separating data points in high-dimensional space. When applied to regression, this approach minimizes prediction error by focusing on support vectors that define the decision boundary.
- Core assumption: The Bitcoin price dataset contains non-linear patterns that can be effectively modeled by a linear kernel transformation.
- Evidence anchors: The results indicate that SVM is the most suitable model for predicting Bitcoin prices among the three algorithms tested.
- Break condition: If the data contains highly complex non-linear patterns that cannot be adequately captured by a linear transformation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LSTM's architecture with multiple hidden layers and gate mechanisms enables effective retention of relevant information while discarding irrelevant data.
- Mechanism: LSTM cells incorporate input, forget, and output gates that control information flow through time steps. This architecture addresses the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs, allowing the network to learn long-term dependencies.
- Core assumption: The Bitcoin price data contains temporal dependencies and patterns that can be effectively captured by LSTM's gate mechanisms.
- Evidence anchors: The Long Short Term Memory algorithm model incorporates multiple hidden layers that function during the flow of information.
- Break condition: If the time series data lacks meaningful temporal dependencies.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Polynomial Regression's ability to handle non-linear data patterns makes it a viable option for cryptocurrency price prediction.
- Mechanism: Polynomial Regression extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms to the model, allowing it to capture non-linear relationships between variables.
- Core assumption: The Bitcoin price data contains non-linear patterns that can be adequately represented by polynomial terms up to a certain degree.
- Evidence anchors: Polynomial Regression represents an extension of Linear Regression, offering predictive capabilities tailored to address non-linear data patterns.
- Break condition: If the data contains highly complex non-linear patterns that cannot be adequately captured by polynomial terms.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mean Square Error (MSE) as a performance metric
  - Why needed here: MSE provides a quantitative measure to compare the predictive performance of different algorithms by calculating the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
  - Quick check question: If an algorithm has an MSE of 0.02 and another has an MSE of 97.92, which one is performing better and why?

- Concept: Kernel methods in Support Vector Machines
  - Why needed here: Understanding how different kernel functions transform the input space to make the data linearly separable is crucial for selecting the appropriate kernel for the given problem.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary difference between using a linear kernel and an RBF kernel in SVM, and when might you choose one over the other?

- Concept: LSTM architecture and gate mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Understanding how LSTM's input, forget, and output gates control information flow through time steps is essential for appreciating why LSTM is suitable for time series forecasting.
  - Quick check question: What problem in traditional RNNs does LSTM's gate mechanism specifically address, and how does this benefit time series prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection -> Data preprocessing -> Model training -> Hyperparameter tuning -> Performance evaluation -> Model comparison
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Model training → Hyperparameter tuning → Performance evaluation → Model comparison
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability: LSTM offers high predictive power but is less interpretable than SVM or Polynomial Regression
  - Computational efficiency: SVM with linear kernel is computationally efficient, while LSTM requires more resources
  - Overfitting risk: Polynomial Regression with high degree is prone to overfitting, while SVM's regularization parameter C helps control this
- Failure signatures:
  - High MSE values across all models indicate poor data quality or inappropriate model selection
  - Very low MSE on training data but high MSE on test data suggests overfitting
  - Inconsistent MSE across different hyperparameter settings indicates sensitivity to parameter tuning
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline experiment: Train all three models with default hyperparameters and compare MSE to establish initial performance baseline
  2. Hyperparameter optimization: Use GridSearchCV for SVM to find optimal C and gamma values, tune LSTM epochs and layers, and test different polynomial degrees for Polynomial Regression
  3. Cross-validation experiment: Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure model performance is consistent across different data splits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would incorporating sentiment analysis from social media or news sources affect the prediction accuracy of cryptocurrency prices compared to using historical price data alone?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly suggest sentiment analysis as a potential variable to improve prediction outcomes in future research.
- Why unresolved: The current study only uses historical price data, and no sentiment analysis was incorporated or tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study testing models with and without sentiment analysis variables, measuring changes in MSE and prediction accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would ensemble methods combining LSTM, SVM, and Polynomial Regression outperform the individual models in predicting cryptocurrency prices?
- Basis in paper: The study compares three individual models but does not explore ensemble approaches, leaving potential improvements untested.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate or discuss ensemble methods or hybrid approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing MSE and accuracy metrics for ensemble models versus individual models using the same dataset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive are the SVM and Polynomial Regression models to hyperparameter tuning, and what is the optimal parameter configuration for cryptocurrency price prediction?
- Basis in paper: The authors test multiple kernels and parameter settings but do not perform comprehensive hyperparameter optimization or sensitivity analysis.
- Why unresolved: The study uses fixed parameter ranges and does not explore the full parameter space or perform cross-validation for all models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed sensitivity analysis and grid search results showing optimal parameters and their impact on model performance.

## Limitations

- The extremely low MSE (0.02) for SVM with linear kernel appears inconsistent with typical cryptocurrency price volatility
- The study relies solely on closing price data without additional features like volume, technical indicators, or sentiment analysis
- Absence of cross-validation and statistical significance testing makes it difficult to determine if performance differences are meaningful

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The experimental methodology of comparing multiple models using MSE as a metric is sound and follows standard practices in machine learning evaluation
- **Medium Confidence**: The general finding that different models perform differently on this task is plausible, though the specific performance values should be verified
- **Low Confidence**: The exact MSE values reported, particularly the extreme difference between SVM (0.02) and other models, cannot be fully verified without access to the original implementation details

## Next Checks

1. **Data Scaling Verification**: Replicate the experiment with normalized/rescaled Bitcoin price data to verify if the extreme MSE values for Polynomial Regression are due to numerical instability or scale issues.

2. **Cross-Validation Implementation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance consistency across different data splits and establish confidence intervals for MSE estimates.

3. **Statistical Significance Testing**: Perform paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on model predictions to determine if the performance differences between SVM, LSTM, and Polynomial Regression are statistically significant rather than due to random variation.
