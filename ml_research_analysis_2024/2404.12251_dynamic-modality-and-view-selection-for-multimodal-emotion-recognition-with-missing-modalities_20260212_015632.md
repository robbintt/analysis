# Dynamic Modality and View Selection for Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Missing Modalities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.12251
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12251
- Reference count: 28
- One-line primary result: Dynamic modality and view selection improves multimodal emotion recognition performance when modalities are missing

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multimodal emotion recognition when certain modalities are missing. The authors propose a novel approach that dynamically selects the best modality (audio or video) and view (feature representation) for each test sample. The method consists of two stages: dynamic modality selection (DMS) and intra-modal dynamic view selection (DVS). DMS chooses the most suitable modality based on regressor performance, while DVS selects the optimal feature representation within the chosen modality using dynamic selection techniques. Experiments on the RECOLA dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in scenarios with missing modalities, particularly the dynamic weighting (DW) method for arousal and valence predictions.

## Method Summary
The proposed method for multimodal emotion recognition with missing modalities involves a two-stage dynamic selection process. First, dynamic modality selection (DMS) identifies the most appropriate modality (audio or video) for each test sample by evaluating the performance of regressors trained on each modality. Second, intra-modal dynamic view selection (DVS) chooses the optimal feature representation within the selected modality using dynamic selection techniques. This approach allows the system to adaptively select the best available information for emotion recognition, improving performance when modalities are missing.

## Key Results
- Dynamic weighting (DW) method achieves highest performance in arousal and valence predictions under ideal conditions
- All dynamic selection-based methods outperform baselines when modalities are missing
- Proposed method shows improved performance compared to baselines in scenarios with missing modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by dynamically selecting the most informative modality and feature representation for each test sample, rather than relying on a fixed combination of modalities. This adaptive approach allows the system to leverage the available information more effectively, especially when certain modalities are missing. By evaluating the performance of regressors trained on individual modalities, the DMS stage identifies which modality is most reliable for each sample. The DVS stage then further refines the selection by choosing the optimal feature representation within the selected modality. This two-stage process ensures that the system makes the best use of available information, leading to improved emotion recognition performance.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal emotion recognition: Combining information from multiple modalities (e.g., audio and video) to recognize emotions. Why needed: Emotions are complex and can be expressed through various channels, making multimodal approaches more robust and accurate.
- Dynamic selection techniques: Methods that adaptively choose the best model or feature representation for each test sample. Why needed: Different samples may have varying characteristics, and dynamic selection allows the system to adapt to these differences for improved performance.
- Regressor performance evaluation: Assessing the performance of regression models trained on individual modalities. Why needed: This evaluation is crucial for the DMS stage to identify the most reliable modality for each test sample.
- Feature representation: Different ways of representing the input data (e.g., different feature extraction methods). Why needed: Various feature representations may capture different aspects of the data, and selecting the most informative one can improve recognition accuracy.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Dynamic Modality Selection (DMS) -> Intra-modal Dynamic View Selection (DVS) -> Emotion Recognition

Critical path:
DMS selects the best modality (audio or video) for each test sample based on regressor performance, then DVS chooses the optimal feature representation within the selected modality. The chosen modality and view are then used for emotion recognition.

Design tradeoffs:
- Complexity vs. performance: The dynamic selection process adds complexity but improves performance when modalities are missing
- Modality dependency: The method relies on the availability of at least one modality for each test sample
- Feature representation diversity: The effectiveness of DVS depends on having diverse and informative feature representations

Failure signatures:
- Poor regressor performance on individual modalities may lead to suboptimal DMS decisions
- Limited diversity in feature representations may reduce the effectiveness of DVS
- Missing both modalities for a test sample would render the method inapplicable

3 first experiments:
1. Evaluate the impact of different regressor types on the DMS stage performance
2. Compare the effectiveness of various dynamic selection techniques in the DVS stage
3. Analyze the performance of the method with different combinations of audio and video feature representations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to a single dataset (RECOLA), which may not generalize to other emotion recognition datasets or real-world scenarios
- Performance of the proposed method in diverse conditions and with different types of missing modalities remains unknown
- Lack of comprehensive analysis of computational complexity and runtime of the dynamic selection process

## Confidence
- Effectiveness on RECOLA dataset: Medium
- Generalizability to other datasets: Low
- Computational efficiency: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the proposed method on multiple emotion recognition datasets with varying characteristics and missing modality scenarios
2. Conduct a thorough ablation study to analyze the impact of each component (DMS and DVS) on the overall performance
3. Investigate the computational complexity and runtime of the dynamic selection process and compare it with other methods to assess its practical applicability
