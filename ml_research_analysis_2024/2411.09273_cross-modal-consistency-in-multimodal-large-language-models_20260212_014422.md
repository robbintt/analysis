# Cross-Modal Consistency in Multimodal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.09273
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09273
- Reference count: 14
- Key outcome: Introduces cross-modal consistency evaluation framework revealing significant performance disparities between vision and language modalities in GPT-4V, with proposed Vision-Depicting-Prompting (VDP) improving consistency by up to 57% in understanding tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in evaluating multimodal large language models by introducing the concept of cross-modal consistency. The authors demonstrate that models like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance disparities when processing identical information presented in different modalities (vision vs. language). Through systematic experiments on parallel vision-language datasets, they reveal that the language modality consistently outperforms vision in reasoning tasks. To address this inconsistency, they propose Vision-Depicting-Prompting (VDP), a method that converts image inputs to text descriptions before reasoning, substantially improving both consistency and accuracy.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a novel framework for measuring cross-modal consistency by constructing parallel datasets where identical information is presented in both visual and textual formats. They evaluate GPT-4V's performance across these modalities using various reasoning tasks including visual reasoning, understanding, and basic skills. The framework quantifies consistency by comparing model outputs across modalities for semantically equivalent inputs. To address identified inconsistencies, they introduce Vision-Depicting-Prompting (VDP), which converts image inputs to detailed text descriptions before applying reasoning prompts. This approach leverages the model's stronger language processing capabilities while maintaining visual information integrity.

## Key Results
- GPT-4V shows significant performance disparities between vision and language modalities, with language consistently outperforming vision in reasoning tasks
- Cross-modal consistency varies dramatically across different task types, with understanding tasks showing the largest gaps
- Vision-Depicting-Prompting (VDP) improves consistency and accuracy by up to 57% in understanding tasks compared to direct vision-based reasoning
- The effectiveness of VDP demonstrates that modality conversion can serve as a viable strategy for improving multimodal model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed approach works because multimodal large language models often exhibit inherent biases toward language processing capabilities over visual reasoning. By converting visual information into detailed textual descriptions before reasoning, the model can leverage its stronger language understanding and reasoning abilities. This modality conversion effectively bypasses potential limitations in the model's visual processing pipeline while preserving semantic content. The framework reveals that inconsistencies arise not from the model's inability to understand visual concepts, but from differential optimization and training focus between modalities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-modal consistency**: Measures agreement between model outputs when processing identical information in different modalities. Needed to identify systematic biases and ensure reliable multimodal reasoning.
- **Parallel vision-language datasets**: Datasets containing semantically equivalent information in both visual and textual formats. Required for systematic comparison of model performance across modalities.
- **Modality conversion techniques**: Methods for transforming information between different input formats while preserving semantic content. Essential for bridging performance gaps between modalities.
- **Multimodal reasoning evaluation**: Systematic assessment of model performance across different types of reasoning tasks in multimodal contexts. Critical for understanding model capabilities and limitations.
- **Vision-language grounding**: The ability of models to correctly associate visual concepts with their linguistic representations. Fundamental to consistent multimodal understanding.
- **Quick check**: Evaluate consistency metrics across multiple models and datasets to validate generalizability of findings.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Input data -> Parallel dataset construction -> Multimodal model (GPT-4V) -> Modality-specific processing -> Output comparison -> Consistency measurement -> VDP conversion -> Re-evaluation

**Critical path**: Dataset creation → Model evaluation across modalities → Consistency measurement → VDP implementation → Performance comparison

**Design tradeoffs**: Direct vision processing vs. converted text processing; comprehensive dataset coverage vs. practical dataset construction; consistency measurement accuracy vs. evaluation efficiency

**Failure signatures**: Inconsistent outputs for semantically equivalent inputs; significant performance gaps between modalities; VDP failure to improve consistency indicates deeper model limitations

**First experiments**:
1. Replicate consistency measurements on GPT-4V with expanded dataset variations
2. Test VDP effectiveness across different reasoning task categories
3. Compare cross-modal consistency with other state-of-the-art multimodal models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential inherent modality bias in evaluation datasets may affect consistency measurements
- Focus primarily on GPT-4V limits generalizability to other multimodal models
- VDP effectiveness may vary significantly across different task domains and visual complexity levels
- Reported 57% improvement should be interpreted cautiously given baseline inconsistency levels and task difficulty

## Confidence
- High confidence in the observation of cross-modal inconsistency in GPT-4V
- Medium confidence in the superiority of language modality for reasoning
- Medium confidence in VDP's effectiveness across diverse scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-model validation: Test VDP and cross-modal consistency measures on other state-of-the-art multimodal models (e.g., Gemini, Claude) to assess generalizability of findings
2. Expand evaluation datasets: Create more diverse and complex parallel datasets that include abstract visual concepts, temporal sequences, and nuanced language-visual relationships to thoroughly test model consistency
3. Real-world application testing: Implement VDP in practical multimodal applications (e.g., medical imaging analysis, autonomous driving systems) to evaluate performance improvements and identify potential limitations in operational contexts
