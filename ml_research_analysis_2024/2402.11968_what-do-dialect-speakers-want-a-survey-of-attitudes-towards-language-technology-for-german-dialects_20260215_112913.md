core_contribution: We surveyed 327 speakers of German dialects and related regional
  languages on their attitudes towards hypothetical language technologies for their
  dialects. We find that respondents are especially in favour of potential NLP tools
  that work with dialectal input (especially audio input) such as virtual assistants,
  and less so for applications that produce dialectal output such as machine translation
  or spellcheckers.

# What Do Dialect Speakers Want? A Survey of Attitudes Towards Language Technology for German Dialects

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11968
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11968
- Reference count: 40
- Speakers prefer dialectal input tools (especially audio input) over output-focused applications like machine translation or spellcheckers

## Executive Summary
This study surveyed 327 speakers of German dialects and related regional languages to understand their attitudes towards hypothetical language technologies for their dialects. The research found that respondents showed particular enthusiasm for NLP tools that accept dialectal input, especially audio input such as virtual assistants. In contrast, they were less supportive of applications that produce dialectal output, such as machine translation or spellcheckers. These findings highlight a preference for tools that accommodate dialectal speech rather than those that generate dialectal text, suggesting that dialect speakers value technologies that recognize and process their language variety rather than those that attempt to produce it.

## Method Summary
The study employed an online survey distributed via social media and word-of-mouth to gather attitudes from 327 German dialect speakers. Participants were presented with hypothetical scenarios involving various language technologies for their dialects, including virtual assistants, machine translation, and spellcheckers. The survey collected self-reported preferences and attitudes towards these technologies, focusing on both input and output functionalities. The methodology relied on self-selection and hypothetical scenarios, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to actual usage patterns.

## Key Results
- Respondents are especially in favor of NLP tools that work with dialectal input (especially audio input) such as virtual assistants
- Speakers are less supportive of applications that produce dialectal output such as machine translation or spellcheckers
- Preference for input tools over output tools is consistent across different dialect groups

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The preference for input-focused tools over output-focused ones likely stems from dialect speakers' desire to be understood and accommodated in their native language variety, rather than having their dialects standardized or altered by technology. Input tools like virtual assistants validate the speaker's linguistic identity by recognizing and processing dialectal speech, while output tools like translation or spellcheckers may feel intrusive or unnecessary. This mechanism reflects a broader sociolinguistic dynamic where speakers value technologies that respect and integrate their linguistic diversity rather than those that attempt to modify or correct it.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dialect vs. Standard Language**: Understanding the distinction between dialects and standardized language varieties is crucial for designing inclusive language technologies. Quick check: Can the technology distinguish between dialectal and standard input?
- **Input vs. Output Processing**: Recognizing the different technical and social implications of tools that process input versus those that generate output. Quick check: Does the system prioritize recognition over generation for dialectal data?
- **Speaker Attitudes and Technology Adoption**: Awareness that user attitudes are shaped by sociolinguistic identity and perceived utility. Quick check: Are user preferences for input tools validated by real-world usage data?
- **Self-Reported Data Limitations**: Recognizing that hypothetical scenarios may not reflect actual usage patterns. Quick check: Are survey responses corroborated by behavioral data?
- **Sampling Bias in Online Surveys**: Understanding that social media recruitment may not capture the full diversity of dialect speakers. Quick check: Is the sample representative of the broader dialect-speaking population?
- **Technology Localization and Cultural Context**: Appreciating that technology acceptance varies by cultural and linguistic context. Quick check: Are design choices sensitive to local linguistic norms?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Survey Design -> Participant Recruitment -> Data Collection -> Analysis -> Interpretation
Critical Path: Recruitment → Survey Distribution → Response Collection → Data Analysis → Result Synthesis
Design Tradeoffs: The study prioritized broad reach via social media over strict demographic control, accepting potential sampling bias for larger sample size.
Failure Signatures: Overrepresentation of certain dialect groups or age ranges; hypothetical responses not matching real-world behavior; low engagement from underrepresented communities.
First Experiments:
1. Pilot test survey with a small, diverse group of dialect speakers to refine questions and identify ambiguities
2. Compare self-reported preferences with actual usage data from a prototype dialect-aware virtual assistant
3. Conduct subgroup analysis to detect differences in attitudes by age, education, or region

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential sampling bias due to recruitment via social media and word-of-mouth
- Self-reported data may introduce response bias, as participants knew they were responding to a language technology survey
- Hypothetical scenarios may not accurately reflect actual usage patterns if technologies were implemented

## Confidence
- High confidence in finding that speakers are especially in favor of dialectal input tools (such as virtual assistants)
- Medium confidence in claim that speakers are less supportive of output-focused applications like machine translation or spellcheckers
- Findings are specific to German dialects and may not generalize to other language contexts

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a follow-up study with a more diverse and representative sample of German dialect speakers, including different age groups, educational backgrounds, and geographic regions
2. Implement a subset of the surveyed technologies (e.g., a virtual assistant prototype) and conduct real-world usage testing to compare actual behavior with survey responses
3. Perform qualitative interviews with survey respondents to explore the reasons behind their preferences for input versus output-focused language technologies
