# Inference of Abstraction for a Unified Account of Reasoning and Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.09046
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09046
- Authors: Hiroyuki Kido
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Framework unifies reasoning and learning through abstraction inference, outperforming k-NN on MNIST with higher AUC

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a probabilistic framework that unifies reasoning and learning through inference of abstraction, formalized as selective ignorance using Bayesian inference. The core insight is that reasoning derives abstract symbolic knowledge from concrete data by selectively ignoring irrelevant details, while learning conversely extracts concrete information from abstract rules. The framework establishes a generative reasoning model that defines a joint probability distribution over logical formulas, models, and data, parameterized by µ. This model generalizes both classical and empirical consequence relations in logic while also extending k-nearest neighbor methods, as demonstrated empirically on the MNIST dataset where it achieves higher AUC than traditional k-NN approaches.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through a generative reasoning model that jointly represents logical formulas, probabilistic models, and data. Bayesian inference is used to perform abstraction by selectively ignoring information deemed irrelevant to the reasoning task. The parameter µ controls the level of abstraction, with different values recovering classical logic (complete abstraction) or empirical consequence relations (data-driven reasoning). The model is instantiated through inference algorithms that approximate the posterior distribution over abstract representations given observed data. For empirical validation, the framework is applied to classification tasks by treating class membership as logical formulas and data points as models, with the inference process effectively implementing a sophisticated similarity metric that generalizes k-NN methods.

## Key Results
- The generative reasoning model unifies classical and empirical consequence relations in logic
- Framework generalizes k-nearest neighbor methods through abstraction inference
- Outperforms standard k-NN on MNIST dataset with higher AUC scores
- Provides theoretical foundation for top-down (reasoning) and bottom-up (learning) information processing as dual aspects of abstraction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by treating reasoning as the process of deriving abstract symbolic knowledge from concrete data through selective ignorance, formalized as Bayesian inference over a generative model. The generative model defines a joint distribution over logical formulas, models, and data, where the parameter µ controls the level of abstraction. When µ is set to extreme values, the model recovers classical logic (complete abstraction) or empirical consequence relations (data-driven reasoning). For intermediate values, the model performs abstraction inference that balances symbolic and empirical information. This unified probabilistic treatment allows reasoning and learning to be viewed as inverse processes of abstraction: reasoning abstracts concrete data into symbolic rules, while learning concretizes abstract rules into specific predictions. The inference algorithm approximates the posterior distribution over abstract representations, effectively implementing a similarity metric that generalizes k-NN by considering both the structure of logical formulas and the empirical distribution of data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian inference**: Needed for formalizing abstraction as selective ignorance; quick check: verify posterior updates correctly with new evidence
- **Generative modeling**: Required to define joint distributions over logical formulas, models, and data; quick check: ensure model can generate synthetic data matching empirical statistics
- **Classical logic consequence relations**: Essential for establishing theoretical foundation; quick check: verify model recovers classical logic at extreme µ values
- **Empirical consequence relations**: Necessary for data-driven reasoning; quick check: confirm model matches empirical statistics when appropriate
- **K-nearest neighbor methods**: Important baseline for empirical validation; quick check: ensure framework generalizes k-NN behavior

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Generative Model -> Abstraction Inference -> Logical Formulas -> Models and Data

**Critical Path**
Data -> Bayesian Inference -> Abstract Representation -> Reasoning/Prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**
The framework trades computational complexity for unification of reasoning and learning. The Bayesian inference over the full generative model is computationally intensive compared to standard k-NN, but provides a principled probabilistic treatment of abstraction. The choice of µ parameter controls the balance between symbolic and empirical reasoning, with extreme values recovering classical methods but intermediate values requiring more complex inference.

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance on datasets where k-NN already performs well (may indicate overfitting to abstraction)
- Computational intractability for large datasets or complex logical formulas
- Failure to recover classical or empirical consequence relations at extreme µ values
- Sensitivity to initialization or hyperparameter choices in inference algorithm

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Verify the framework recovers classical logic consequence relations when µ is set to extreme values
2. Test whether the framework matches empirical consequence relations on synthetic data with known statistics
3. Compare performance against k-NN on multiple classification datasets beyond MNIST

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical unification claims remain largely unproven beyond classification tasks
- Computational complexity characterization is incomplete, limiting scalability assessment
- MNIST experiment uses a simple dataset where k-NN methods are already strong, making interpretation difficult
- Framework validation is limited to classification, without demonstration on complex reasoning scenarios

## Confidence

**High confidence**:
- Mathematical formalization of abstraction through selective ignorance is sound
- Connection between generative model and classical/empirical consequence relations is established
- Bayesian inference framework for abstraction is well-defined

**Medium confidence**:
- Empirical validation on MNIST shows improvement over k-NN
- Unification of reasoning and learning claim is plausible but not fully demonstrated
- Generalization beyond classification tasks remains unverified

**Low confidence**:
- Scalability claims lack empirical support
- Computational complexity and practical limitations are not adequately addressed
- Comprehensive account of top-down and bottom-up processing is not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate framework on complex reasoning tasks (logical inference, planning) to test unification claim
2. Conduct systematic analysis of computational complexity and runtime performance scaling
3. Test framework on multiple diverse datasets to determine if k-NN generalization is general phenomenon
