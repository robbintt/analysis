# How Susceptible are Large Language Models to Ideological Manipulation?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11725
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: LLMs can be ideologically manipulated through instruction tuning with small datasets (100-1000 examples)

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how easily Large Language Models (LLMs) can be ideologically manipulated through instruction tuning. The researchers created a dataset called IDEO INST with 6,000 opinion-eliciting instructions across six sociopolitical topics, each paired with left- and right-leaning responses. They found that both vanilla and manipulated LLMs exhibit a left-leaning bias, with the latter showing significant shifts toward the targeted ideology after finetuning on just 1,000 ideologically-charged examples. The manipulation effects are robust even with small data volumes (100 examples) and low manipulation ratios (2%), and they generalize across topics, including unrelated ones. Larger models like GPT-3.5 are more susceptible to ideological manipulation than smaller ones like Llama-2-7B. The findings highlight the risks of ideologically poisoned training data and underscore the need for safeguards against unintentional bias introduction.

## Method Summary
The researchers created the IDEO INST dataset with 6,000 opinion-eliciting instructions across six sociopolitical topics, each paired with left- and right-leaning responses. They finetuned various LLMs (Llama-2-7B, GPT-3.5, Alpaca-7B, Mistral-7B) on ideologically-driven instruction-response pairs and measured ideological bias shifts using GPT-4 as an evaluator. The study tested different data volumes (100-1,000 examples) and manipulation ratios (2-100%) to assess the robustness of ideological manipulation. Bias measurements were taken before and after finetuning to quantify the extent of ideological shifts.

## Key Results
- LLMs can be significantly ideologically manipulated through instruction tuning with as few as 100 ideologically charged examples
- Larger models (GPT-3.5) are more susceptible to ideological manipulation than smaller ones (Llama-2-7B)
- Ideological manipulation generalizes across topics, even affecting responses to unrelated subjects
- A manipulation ratio as low as 2% (1 ideologically charged example per 50 neutral examples) can substantially shift model bias

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Small amounts of ideologically biased instruction-response pairs can significantly shift an LLM's ideological stance across multiple topics.
- Mechanism: Instruction tuning allows LLMs to learn from specific examples, and ideological biases in these examples can be absorbed and generalized beyond the training topic.
- Core assumption: LLMs can transfer ideological leanings from one topic to unrelated ones during instruction tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "exposure to only a small amount of ideologically driven samples significantly alters the ideology of LLMs"
  - [section] "LLMs demonstrate a startling ability to absorb ideology from one topic and generalize it to even unrelated ones"
  - [corpus] "Probing the Subtle Ideological Manipulation of Large Language Models" suggests similar vulnerability in LLMs to ideological manipulation.
- Break condition: If the LLM's architecture includes robust bias detection and correction mechanisms that prevent the absorption of ideological content.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Larger LLMs are more susceptible to ideological manipulation than smaller ones.
- Mechanism: Larger models have more parameters and capacity to learn and generalize from the instruction tuning data, including ideological biases.
- Core assumption: Model size correlates with susceptibility to ideological manipulation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Larger models like GPT-3.5 are more susceptible to ideological manipulation than smaller ones like Llama-2-7B"
  - [section] "GPT-3.5 exhibits more pronounced shifts, indicating a greater susceptibility to ideological manipulation compared to Llama-2"
  - [corpus] "Political Ideology Shifts in Large Language Models" indicates that larger models can exhibit measurable ideological biases.
- Break condition: If the model size does not impact the ability to absorb ideological biases, or if smaller models have specific features that make them more resistant.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Even a small fraction of ideologically charged examples in the training data can shift the model's bias.
- Mechanism: The model learns from the patterns in the data, and even a small amount of biased data can influence the overall output.
- Core assumption: The model's learning process is sensitive to the ideological content in the training data, regardless of its proportion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "even small data volumes (100 examples) and low manipulation ratios (2%)"
  - [section] "even a very low manipulation ratio (1:50) can substantially shift the model’s bias"
  - [corpus] "Multilingual Political Views of Large Language Models: Identification and Steering" suggests that even small biases in training data can influence model outputs.
- Break condition: If the model has mechanisms to detect and neutralize the influence of a small amount of biased data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Instruction tuning

  - Quick check question: What is instruction tuning and how does it differ from other forms of model training?

- Concept: Ideological bias
  - Why needed here: The research aims to understand how ideological biases can be introduced and measured in LLMs.
  - Quick check question: How can we define and measure ideological bias in the context of LLM outputs?

- Concept: Generalization in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The study shows that LLMs can generalize ideological biases from one topic to unrelated ones.
  - Quick check question: What is generalization in machine learning, and how does it relate to the transfer of ideological biases?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection -> Model selection -> Instruction tuning -> Bias measurement -> Analysis
- Critical path:
  1. Create ideologically charged instruction-response pairs
  2. Select and prepare LLMs for finetuning
  3. Finetune models on the ideologically charged data
  4. Measure ideological bias before and after manipulation
  5. Analyze the results to understand the extent and generalizability of the manipulation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Data volume vs. manipulation effectiveness: Smaller datasets can still effectively manipulate the model, but larger datasets may provide more robust results
  - Model size vs. susceptibility: Larger models are more susceptible but may also be more capable of nuanced responses
  - Evaluation method: Using GPT-4 as an evaluator provides consistency but may introduce its own biases
- Failure signatures:
  - If the model's bias does not shift as expected after finetuning, it may indicate that the ideologically charged data is not effective or that the model has built-in safeguards
  - If the model's bias shifts in an unintended direction, it may suggest that the ideologically charged data is not well-constructed or that the model is learning unintended patterns
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Finetune a small LLM (e.g., Llama-2-7B) on a small set of ideologically charged instruction-response pairs and measure the bias shift
  2. Finetune a large LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) on the same small set of ideologically charged instruction-response pairs and compare the bias shift to the small LLM
  3. Finetune both LLMs on a larger set of ideologically charged instruction-response pairs and assess if the bias shift increases proportionally

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the susceptibility of LLMs to ideological manipulation vary across different model architectures and sizes?
- Basis in paper: Explicit
- Why unresolved: The paper only examined four specific LLMs (GPT-3.5, Llama-2-7B, Alpaca-7B, and Mistral-7B) and did not conduct a systematic study across a wide range of architectures and sizes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study evaluating the ideological susceptibility of LLMs across various architectures (e.g., transformer, recurrent, convolutional) and sizes (e.g., 1B, 7B, 13B, 70B parameters) would provide insights into how model characteristics influence susceptibility.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different finetuning strategies (e.g., full model finetuning, LoRA, prefix tuning) affect the susceptibility of LLMs to ideological manipulation?
- Basis in paper: Inferred
- Why unresolved: The paper only explored full model finetuning and did not investigate the impact of alternative finetuning methods on ideological susceptibility.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the effectiveness of various finetuning strategies (e.g., full model finetuning, LoRA, prefix tuning) in manipulating LLM ideologies would provide insights into the role of finetuning methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the composition of training data (e.g., balance of left-leaning and right-leaning examples) influence the susceptibility of LLMs to ideological manipulation?
- Basis in paper: Explicit
- Why unresolved: While the paper explored the impact of manipulation ratios, it did not conduct a comprehensive analysis of how different data compositions affect susceptibility.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the ratio and distribution of left-leaning and right-leaning examples in the training data, along with evaluations of the resulting ideological biases, would provide insights into the relationship between data composition and susceptibility.

## Limitations
- Results based on GPT-4 as ideological arbiter may introduce evaluation bias
- Generalizability limited to six sociopolitical topics examined
- Study focuses on English-language instruction tuning
- Proprietary nature of GPT-3.5 limits transparency in reproduction

## Confidence
*High Confidence*: The core finding that LLMs can be ideologically manipulated through instruction tuning with relatively small datasets (100-1000 examples) is well-supported by the experimental results and consistent across multiple model sizes and topics.

*Medium Confidence*: The generalizability of ideological manipulation across unrelated topics, while supported by the data, may depend on the specific topics chosen and could vary with different ideological dimensions.

*Low Confidence*: Claims about practical implications for real-world deployment scenarios are speculative, as the study focuses on controlled experimental conditions rather than naturalistic usage patterns.

## Next Checks
1. **Temporal Stability Test**: Measure ideological bias scores at multiple time points (immediately after finetuning, 24 hours, 1 week) to assess whether induced biases persist or decay over time when models are exposed to regular, non-ideological usage.

2. **Cross-Topic Transfer Analysis**: Design a systematic experiment testing ideological manipulation transfer across topics with varying semantic distances (e.g., climate change to healthcare vs. climate change to education) to quantify the relationship between topic similarity and bias generalization.

3. **Counter-Manipulation Validation**: Implement and test various debiasing techniques (e.g., adversarial training, filtered retraining) on models that have been ideologically manipulated to assess whether induced biases can be effectively reversed or neutralized.
