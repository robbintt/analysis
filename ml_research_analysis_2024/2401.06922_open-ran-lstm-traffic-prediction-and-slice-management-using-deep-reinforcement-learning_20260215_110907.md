# Open RAN LSTM Traffic Prediction and Slice Management using Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.06922
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06922
- Reference count: 21
- Reduces QoS violations by up to 7.7% compared to standard DDRL

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DDRL) framework for dynamic network slice management in ORAN systems. The approach combines LSTM-based traffic prediction (rApp) with a DDRL agent (xApp) to maintain QoS under fluctuating traffic loads. By leveraging predicted traffic data and distributed actor networks across DUs with a centralized critic, the method achieves up to 7.7% reduction in QoS violations and improved average per-user throughput compared to standard DDRL approaches.

## Method Summary
The method implements a distributed DRL framework where multiple actor networks at distributed units (DUs) collect diverse state-action-reward experiences, which are aggregated to update a shared centralized critic. An LSTM model trained on historical traffic data predicts future network load (Nl and Λl) for each DU, and these predictions are incorporated into the DRL agent's state representation. The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is employed for its entropy regularization that enables effective exploration in the continuous resource allocation space. The framework operates in ORAN architecture with three slice types (eMBB, MTC, URLLC) across 7 distributed DUs serving 60 users.

## Key Results
- LSTM-enhanced DDRL reduces QoS violations by up to 7.7% compared to standard DDRL
- Improves average per-user throughput under dynamic traffic conditions
- Better handles long-term resource allocation planning through traffic prediction integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Distributed DRL actors combined with a centralized critic improves QoS by leveraging heterogeneous DU experiences
- Mechanism: Multiple actor networks at different DUs collect diverse state-action-reward experiences, which are aggregated to update a shared critic. This allows the global critic to learn from a broader distribution of network conditions than any single DU could provide.
- Core assumption: DUs experience sufficiently different traffic and user patterns that their combined data improves learning stability and performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The approach combines distributed actors across DUs with a centralized critic and leverages predicted traffic data to improve decision-making."
  - [section] "In our context, due to diverse QoS for each slice, the inverse tangent function is employed... we employ a single critic network, while multiple actor networks (totaling Nm) are deployed in various DUs throughout the network."
- Break condition: If DU conditions are too homogeneous or network topology changes too rapidly, the benefit of distributed actors may diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LSTM traffic prediction rApp reduces QoS violations by providing future traffic load estimates to the DRL agent
- Mechanism: The LSTM model is trained offline on historical data to predict future Nl (user density per slice) and Λl (traffic profile per slice) for each DU. These predictions are fed into the DRL agent as part of the state, allowing it to anticipate and preemptively allocate resources.
- Core assumption: Historical traffic patterns are sufficiently correlated with future patterns for LSTM to provide useful predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The LSTM-enhanced DDRL reduces QoS violations by up to 7.7% compared to standard DDRL."
  - [section] "The LSTM model plays a vital role in predicting network traffic load, denoted as Nl and Λn,l... The prediction results are subsequently inserted into the xApp module within the near-real-time RIC."
- Break condition: If traffic patterns become non-stationary or adversarial, LSTM predictions may degrade and hurt performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Entropy regularization in SAC enables better exploration in continuous resource allocation space
- Mechanism: The SAC algorithm includes an entropy term in the policy update that encourages exploration. This helps the agent discover better long-term resource allocation strategies in the continuous action space of RB allocation decisions.
- Core assumption: The continuous action space requires sufficient exploration to avoid local optima in resource allocation policies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we have chosen the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm as the most suitable solution. The entropy regularization term in SAC algorithm prevents suboptimal policy solutions and makes this algorithm effective in continuous environments."
- Break condition: If the reward structure is too sparse or the action space too large, entropy regularization alone may not suffice.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP)
  - Why needed here: The network slicing problem is formulated as an MDP where the agent observes network state, takes actions (resource allocation), and receives rewards (QoS performance).
  - Quick check question: What are the four key components of an MDP in this context?
- Concept: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
  - Why needed here: LSTM is used to predict future traffic load (Nl, Λl) from historical time series data, providing the DRL agent with anticipatory information.
  - Quick check question: How does LSTM's gating mechanism help with traffic prediction?
- Concept: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm
  - Why needed here: SAC is chosen for its entropy regularization, which helps explore the continuous action space of resource block allocation.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the temperature parameter β in SAC?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - rApp (non-RT RIC) -> LSTM-based traffic predictor
  - xApp (near-RT RIC) -> Distributed DRL with multiple actors and centralized critic
  - DUs -> Edge units serving users, each with an actor network
  - SMO -> Service Management and Orchestration for historical data
- Critical path: LSTM prediction → xApp state update → DRL action selection → resource allocation → reward calculation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Centralized critic vs. distributed critics: Centralized critic provides global knowledge but creates bottleneck; distributed critics offer scalability but may learn inconsistent policies.
  - Prediction horizon: Longer horizons improve planning but increase prediction error.
- Failure signatures:
  - High QoS violations despite low traffic: Likely LSTM prediction error or DRL convergence issues.
  - Unstable resource allocation: Actor networks may not be properly synchronized or critic may not have converged.
  - Low throughput despite high RBs allocated: Mismatch between predicted and actual traffic, or poor scheduling policy.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run DRL without LSTM predictions to establish baseline QoS violation rate.
  2. Test LSTM prediction accuracy on historical data before integration.
  3. Compare convergence speed and final QoS performance between standard DRL and LSTM-enhanced DRL under varying traffic patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the LSTM-based DDRL approach scale to scenarios with more than three network slices (e.g., six or more slices with heterogeneous QoS requirements)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only evaluates the approach with three slices (eMBB, MTC, URLLC) and does not discuss performance with a larger number of slices or varying slice types.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide scalability analysis for scenarios with more than three slices, leaving uncertainty about how the approach performs in more complex, real-world network environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation or experimental results showing the performance (e.g., QoS violations, throughput) of the LSTM-based DDRL approach with six or more network slices, comparing it to other baseline methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the LSTM-based DDRL approach vary with different LSTM network architectures (e.g., number of layers, number of units per layer, look-back window size)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using "2 layers of 50 LSTM units and an 18 time steps look-back window" but does not explore how changes to these hyperparameters affect performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide sensitivity analysis or ablation studies to determine the impact of LSTM architecture choices on the overall performance of the DDRL approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from experiments varying the LSTM architecture (e.g., 1 vs. 3 layers, 25 vs. 100 units per layer, 10 vs. 30 time steps look-back) and comparing the resulting QoS violations and throughput.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the LSTM-based DDRL approach perform in dynamic environments with non-stationary traffic patterns (e.g., sudden spikes or drops in traffic demand)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that traffic demand fluctuations are "non-stationary and unknown" but does not evaluate the approach's performance under extreme or rapidly changing traffic conditions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include stress tests or experiments with artificially induced traffic spikes or drops to assess the robustness and adaptability of the LSTM-based DDRL approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation results showing the approach's performance (e.g., QoS violations, throughput) under scenarios with sudden and significant changes in traffic demand, compared to baseline methods.

## Limitations

- Reward function formulation details beyond inverse tangent transformation remain unspecified
- Integration mechanism between LSTM predictions and DDRL state representation lacks precise implementation details
- Performance comparison only against standard DRL, not against specialized network slicing algorithms
- Network simulation parameters may affect reproducibility

## Confidence

- High confidence: LSTM traffic prediction improves QoS when traffic patterns are stationary
- Medium confidence: Distributed actor-critic architecture provides consistent performance benefits across diverse DU conditions
- Medium confidence: SAC algorithm's entropy regularization effectively handles continuous resource allocation exploration

## Next Checks

1. Test LSTM prediction accuracy under non-stationary traffic conditions to validate break condition assumptions
2. Compare performance against specialized network slicing algorithms (e.g., heuristic-based approaches) rather than just standard DRL
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis on actor network count and DU diversity to quantify distributed learning benefits
