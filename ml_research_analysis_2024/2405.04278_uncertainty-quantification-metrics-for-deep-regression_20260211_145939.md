## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of four metrics used to evaluate uncertainty quantification in deep regression models. Through systematic evaluation on synthetic datasets with controlled uncertainty types (homoscedastic, heteroscedastic, multimodal, and epistemic), the authors assess metric stability, interpretability, and sample size requirements. The study reveals significant differences in metric behavior, with Calibration Error emerging as the most reliable and interpretable option for practical use.

The findings have important implications for practitioners selecting evaluation metrics for uncertainty quantification tasks. The authors demonstrate that while some metrics perform well in specific scenarios, others suffer from instability or lack of interpretability, particularly when dealing with limited test data. This analysis provides clear guidance on metric selection and highlights the importance of considering both theoretical properties and practical behavior when evaluating uncertainty estimates.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate four uncertainty quantification metrics using synthetic datasets that simulate different uncertainty scenarios. They systematically vary test set sizes and analyze metric convergence behavior, stability, and interpretability. The study employs a Deep Ensemble architecture as the underlying model and compares metric performance across multiple uncertainty types. Through controlled experiments, they assess each metric's ability to measure the quality of predictive uncertainty estimates and identify scenarios where metrics may fail or provide misleading results.

## Key Results
- Calibration Error (CE) demonstrates the highest stability and interpretability with well-defined bounds and minimal sample requirements for convergence
- Area Under Sparsification Error (AUSE) provides robust correlation measurement but lacks interpretability due to unbounded values
- Spearman's Rank Correlation is unsuitable for uncertainty quantification due to instability with small test sets and convergence to zero with larger sets
- Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) measures distribution shape quality but requires the largest sample size for stability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The analysis works by creating controlled environments where different types of uncertainty can be precisely generated and measured. By systematically varying test set sizes and comparing metric behavior across different uncertainty scenarios, the authors can isolate each metric's strengths and weaknesses. The use of synthetic data allows for ground truth uncertainty to be known, enabling accurate assessment of each metric's ability to capture and evaluate uncertainty quality.

## Foundational Learning

### Calibration Error
- Why needed: Measures the alignment between predicted uncertainty and actual errors
- Quick check: Verify that predicted confidence intervals contain the true values at the expected frequency

### Area Under Sparsification Error
- Why needed: Evaluates the correlation between predictive uncertainty and actual errors
- Quick check: Plot uncertainty estimates against residuals to verify expected correlation patterns

### Negative Log-Likelihood
- Why needed: Measures the overall quality of the predicted probability distribution
- Quick check: Compare NLL values across different models to ensure proper scaling

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Synthetic Data Generator -> Deep Ensemble Model -> Uncertainty Metrics (CE, AUSE, Spearman, NLL) -> Evaluation Framework

### Critical Path
1. Generate synthetic datasets with controlled uncertainty types
2. Train Deep Ensemble models on each dataset
3. Generate predictions with uncertainty estimates
4. Compute all four metrics across varying test set sizes
5. Analyze convergence and stability patterns

### Design Tradeoffs
- Synthetic vs. real data: Synthetic data provides ground truth but may not capture real-world complexity
- Model architecture: Deep Ensemble chosen for stability but may bias results toward ensemble methods
- Sample size variation: Systematic testing reveals metric behavior but may not capture all practical scenarios

### Failure Signatures
- Metrics that don't converge with increasing test set size
- Unexpected behavior when switching between uncertainty types
- Lack of correlation between predicted and actual uncertainty quality

### 3 First Experiments
1. Test metric stability on a simple homoscedastic dataset with varying sample sizes
2. Compare metric behavior across different uncertainty types using fixed test set size
3. Validate CE and AUSE performance on a real-world regression dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Analysis focuses on synthetic datasets that may not fully represent real-world complexity
- Results are based on Deep Ensemble architecture and may not generalize to other model families
- Specific thresholds for "small" versus "large" datasets are not explicitly defined

## Confidence

### High Confidence
- Stability analysis of CE and NLL metrics due to well-established theoretical foundations
- Clear convergence patterns observed across multiple experiments

### Medium Confidence
- AUSE recommendations based on qualitative interpretability concerns
- Performance relative to application context may vary

### Low Confidence
- Complete dismissal of Spearman correlation may be architecture-specific
- Instability observed might depend on evaluation protocol

## Next Checks
1. Validate metric recommendations on real-world regression datasets with mixed uncertainty patterns
2. Test stability analysis with alternative deep learning architectures (Bayesian neural networks, Monte Carlo dropout)
3. Conduct systematic ablation studies to identify precise sample size thresholds for metric stability
