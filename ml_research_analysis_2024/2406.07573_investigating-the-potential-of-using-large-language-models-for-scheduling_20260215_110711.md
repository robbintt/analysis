# Investigating the Potential of Using Large Language Models for Scheduling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.07573
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07573
- **Reference count**: 20
- **Primary result**: LLM-based approaches produce reasonable conference schedules and similarity measures, with zero-shot GPT-4 scheduling and title-only similarity outperforming traditional TFIDF approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper explores using large language models for conference paper scheduling, evaluating both zero-shot LLM prompting for schedule generation and LLM-generated similarity scores within an integer programming framework. The authors find that GPT-4 can create reasonable first-draft schedules with minimal constraint violations, and that LLM similarity measures using only paper titles outperform traditional TFIDF approaches that use full abstracts. The integer programming formulation using LLM similarity scores produces comparable results to TFIDF-based approaches, suggesting LLMs can effectively measure paper similarity for optimization tasks.

## Method Summary
The study employs two complementary approaches: zero-shot LLM prompting where GPT-4 directly generates conference schedules based on paper titles and session constraints, and an optimization-based approach where LLM-generated similarity scores are used as inputs to an integer programming formulation. The evaluation uses completeness and homogeneity scores to compare clustering results against ground truth schedules from MSR 2022, with additional analysis of constraint adherence in the generated schedules.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 zero-shot prompting produces reasonable first-draft schedules with less than 3 papers missing and 2 extra sessions on average
- LLM similarity measures using only paper titles achieve higher completeness (0.41) and homogeneity (0.22) scores than TFIDF with titles and abstracts (0.37 and 0.20)
- Integer programming formulation using LLM similarity scores produces results comparable to TFIDF-based approaches
- Many LLM-generated sessions are approximately 10% off in length from target durations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: LLMs can produce reasonable first drafts of conference schedules through zero-shot prompting
- **Mechanism**: The LLM's language understanding capabilities allow it to interpret paper titles and session constraints to generate plausible allocations
- **Core assumption**: The LLM has sufficient understanding of academic paper topics to make sensible grouping decisions
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "LLMs, even under zero-shot settings, create reasonably good first drafts of conference schedules"
  - [section 3.1] "GPT-4 in zero-shot settings can generate reasonably good conference schedules"
- **Break condition**: When the number of decision variables exceeds a certain threshold, the LLM struggles to maintain constraint adherence

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: LLMs can measure paper similarity effectively for clustering optimization
- **Mechanism**: The LLM's text understanding capabilities can identify semantic relationships between papers that align with human categorization
- **Core assumption**: Semantic similarity measured by LLMs correlates with human understanding of topical relatedness
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "using only titles as LLM inputs produces results closer to human categorization than using titles and abstracts with TFIDF"
  - [section 3.2] "LLM with title only exhibits the highest performance in completeness score and homogeneity score"
- **Break condition**: When similarity judgments require deep technical understanding beyond surface-level text analysis

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Combining LLM similarity scores with integer programming produces results comparable to traditional TFIDF approaches
- **Mechanism**: The LLM provides semantic similarity weights that, when incorporated into an optimization framework, yield clusterings that match human-established arrangements
- **Core assumption**: Semantic similarity scores from LLMs can effectively substitute for traditional statistical similarity measures in optimization contexts
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "The integer programming formulation using LLM similarity scores produces comparable results to TFIDF-based approaches"
  - [section 3.2] "completeness and homogeneity scores align LLM's clustering result closely with TFIDF"
- **Break condition**: When the optimization problem becomes too large or the LLM similarity scores become unreliable

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Zero-shot learning
  - **Why needed here**: The study explores using LLMs without any task-specific fine-tuning or training
  - **Quick check question**: What distinguishes zero-shot learning from few-shot or fine-tuning approaches?

- **Concept**: Integer programming for optimization
  - **Why needed here**: The second approach uses mathematical optimization to find optimal paper-session assignments based on similarity scores
  - **Quick check question**: How do binary decision variables and constraints work together in integer programming formulations?

- **Concept**: Cluster evaluation metrics (completeness and homogeneity)
  - **Why needed here**: These metrics are used to compare the LLM-generated clusters against human-established ground truth
  - **Quick check question**: What's the difference between completeness and homogeneity in clustering evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Paper titles/session data -> LLM component (schedule generation or similarity scores) -> (Optional) Integer programming optimization -> Evaluation metrics
- **Critical path**: 1. Input paper and session data 2. LLM generates initial schedule or similarity scores 3. (Optional) Integer programming optimization using LLM scores 4. Evaluation against ground truth metrics
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Zero-shot prompting vs. fine-tuning: Zero-shot is faster but potentially less accurate
  - Title-only vs. full abstract input: Title-only is faster and performs better for similarity measurement
  - Direct scheduling vs. similarity + optimization: Direct scheduling is simpler but less reliable for large problems
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Schedules with excessive constraint violations
  - Similarity scores that don't correlate with human judgment
  - Integer programming failing to find feasible solutions
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Zero-shot scheduling with small conference (10-20 papers) to establish baseline performance
  2. LLM similarity measurement vs. TFIDF comparison on the same dataset
  3. Integer programming optimization using LLM similarity scores and evaluation against TFIDF baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How do LLM-based scheduling approaches scale with increasing numbers of papers and sessions?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The authors note that "homogeneity drops with an increase in problem size" and that LLMs "face challenges in strict adherence to all constraints, particularly when dealing with many papers."
- **Why unresolved**: The paper only tests on one dataset (MSR 2022) without varying the number of papers or sessions systematically to understand scaling behavior.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Controlled experiments varying the number of papers and sessions to measure how completeness, homogeneity, and constraint violation rates change with problem size.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How do different LLM architectures and prompting strategies affect scheduling quality?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors use GPT-4 with specific prompt templates but note that "LLMs have a lot of room to improve on arithmetic reasoning tasks" and that "recent approaches have been proposed to improve their abilities for math problems."
- **Why unresolved**: The paper only tests one LLM (GPT-4) with one prompting strategy, without comparing against other models or prompt engineering techniques.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Head-to-head comparisons of different LLMs (GPT-3.5, Claude, etc.) and prompt variations measuring scheduling quality metrics.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What is the optimal balance between LLM automation and human oversight in conference scheduling?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors suggest "a collaboration with LLMs be the best approach" since humans can "finish the work mostly done by an LLM" by moving "a couple of papers between sessions."
- **Why unresolved**: The paper doesn't explore hybrid human-LLM workflows or measure the effort required for human refinement of LLM-generated schedules.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Studies measuring human time and effort required to refine LLM schedules versus starting from scratch, or A/B testing different levels of LLM automation with human oversight.

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: How does the quality of LLM-based similarity measures compare to human expert similarity judgments for paper clustering?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors use existing session arrangements as a benchmark and find LLM similarity measures produce "comparable results to TFIDF-based approaches."
- **Why unresolved**: The paper only compares LLM similarity to TFIDF and to the original schedule, not to human expert similarity judgments which would be the ground truth.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Human expert evaluations of paper similarity using the same LLM similarity measures, measuring correlation between LLM and human similarity judgments.

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on a single small conference dataset (MSR 2022) may not generalize to larger or more complex scheduling scenarios
- No comparison against human expert scheduling performance to assess practical utility
- Cost and latency of using GPT-4 for these tasks at scale are not addressed

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: LLMs can produce reasonable first-draft schedules through zero-shot prompting, particularly for smaller conferences
- **Medium Confidence**: LLM similarity scores using only titles outperform TFIDF with full abstracts for clustering tasks, though this needs validation on larger datasets
- **Low Confidence**: The integer programming formulation with LLM similarity scores will scale effectively to real-world conference sizes

## Next Checks
1. Test the LLM scheduling approach on a larger conference dataset (100+ papers) to assess scalability and identify breaking points in performance
2. Conduct a human evaluation study comparing LLM-generated schedules against expert-created schedules using qualitative feedback on session coherence and attendee experience
3. Measure the computational cost and API usage of the LLM-based approaches versus traditional TFIDF methods across multiple conference sizes to establish practical viability thresholds
