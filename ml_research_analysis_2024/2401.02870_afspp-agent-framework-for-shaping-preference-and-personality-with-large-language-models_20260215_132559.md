# AFSPP: Agent Framework for Shaping Preference and Personality with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.02870
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02870
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces AFSPP framework for shaping LLM-based agents' preferences and personalities through social networks and subjective consciousness, showing that plan making, sensory perception, and social networking most significantly influence preference shaping.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents AFSPP, a novel framework for shaping preferences and personalities in LLM-based agents through social networks and subjective consciousness. Unlike prior approaches that pre-set agent traits, AFSPP enables iterative trait development based on environmental and social influences, mirroring human-like development. The framework was tested in Qunit's Cafe, a miniature sandbox environment, demonstrating that agents can develop preferences and personalities through experiences, social interactions, and subjective perceptions. Results show that plan making, sensory perception, and social networking are the most influential factors in preference shaping, while social identities influence personality traits toward extroversion or introversion.

## Method Summary
The AFSPP framework was implemented in Qunit's Cafe, a simplified simulation environment with three agents (Anty, Agnes, and Qunit). The framework incorporates social network communication, attitude injection, sensory perception, reflection, and plan making to shape agent preferences and personalities. Agents' preferences were measured by action-taking frequency (Pos Ratio), while personality was assessed using MBTI and SD3 tests. RIASEC professional identity prompts were used to assign identities to agents, influencing their baseline personality tendencies. The framework iteratively modifies agent internal states based on experiences and social feedback, allowing preferences and personalities to develop organically.

## Key Results
- Plan making, sensory perception, and social networking with subjective information most significantly influence preference shaping
- Agents with social identities tend toward extroversion, while conventional identities lean toward introversion and sensing
- Preference shaping mechanism increases the probability of agents choosing previously successful actions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Agent preferences are shaped through iterative reinforcement of action choices, influenced by both subjective perceptions and social feedback
- Mechanism: The framework iteratively modifies the agent's internal state and records action preferences based on repeated experiences. Positive subjective perceptions increase likelihood of repeating actions, while negative perceptions decrease it. Social feedback from other agents further reinforces or dampens these preferences.
- Core assumption: Agents can learn preferences through experiential feedback loops without explicit reward functions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AFSPP allows agents to iteratively develop traits based on environmental and social influences"
  - [section] "Drawing inspiration from conditioned reflex principles [18], our approach is suited for verifying preference shaping effects grounded in actions"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no corpus papers directly address iterative preference shaping via sensory feedback
- Break condition: If agents fail to associate sensory perceptions with subsequent action choices, or if social feedback is inconsistent or ignored

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Personality traits are shaped by the agent's identity and the attitudes of social network members toward the agent
- Mechanism: The agent's identity (e.g., Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional from RIASEC) determines baseline personality tendencies. Social attitudes from other agents influence the agent's personality test responses, aligning with human studies showing occupational identity correlates with personality traits.
- Core assumption: Agents can simulate human-like personality development through identity-based role-playing and social interaction
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "experiments also replicated key findings from human personality studies, demonstrating that agents with social identities tend toward extroversion, while conventional identities lean toward introversion and sensing"
  - [section] "Based on SD3 test results in Table 6, assigning Identity effectively reduces the Agent's Machiavellianism and Psychopathy tendencies"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no corpus papers directly address identity-based personality shaping in multi-agent systems
- Break condition: If agents' personality test results do not align with their assigned identities, or if social attitudes have no measurable effect on personality

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Plan making and sensory perception are the most influential factors in shaping agent preferences
- Mechanism: Plan making provides a structured framework for action selection, increasing the likelihood of repeating actions that align with the plan. Sensory perception provides immediate feedback on the quality of an action, reinforcing or discouraging its repetition.
- Core assumption: Agents prioritize actions that align with their plans and provide positive sensory feedback
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results showed that plan making, sensory perception, and social networking with subjective information most significantly influence preference shaping"
  - [section] "From the standpoint of the lowest 'pos ratio' indicator in Table 2, the most notable positive impact on preference shaping stems from the formulation of plans"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no corpus papers directly address the relative influence of plan making and sensory perception on preference shaping
- Break condition: If agents do not consistently choose actions that align with their plans, or if sensory feedback is ignored or misinterpreted

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents
  - Why needed here: Understanding how LLMs can be used to create agents with human-like behaviors and decision-making capabilities
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between using LLMs as passive text generators versus active agents in a simulated environment?

- Concept: Personality and preference shaping in humans
  - Why needed here: To understand how human personality and preferences develop, and how these processes can be simulated in AI agents
  - Quick check question: What are the main factors that influence personality and preference development in humans, and how do these factors translate to the agent framework?

- Concept: RIASEC and MBTI personality frameworks
  - Why needed here: To understand the specific personality frameworks used to measure and shape agent personalities, and how these frameworks relate to human personality traits
  - Quick check question: How do the RIASEC and MBTI frameworks differ in their approach to personality assessment, and what are the strengths and weaknesses of each?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Sandbox environment (Qunit's Cafe) -> Agent framework (AFSPP) -> Social network module -> Subjective consciousness module -> Preference shaping module -> Personality shaping module -> Evaluation module

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize agents with identities and basic states
  2. Agents interact with environment and each other
  3. Agents' actions and perceptions are recorded
  4. Agents' preferences and personalities are shaped based on experiences
  5. Agents' preferences and personalities are evaluated using MBTI and SD3 tests

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. realism: The sandbox environment is simplified to reduce complexity, but this may limit the realism of the agents' experiences
  - Determinism vs. randomness: The agents' actions and perceptions are influenced by both deterministic rules and random factors, balancing predictability and variability
  - Interpretability vs. performance: The agents' decision-making processes are designed to be interpretable, but this may come at the cost of performance

- Failure signatures:
  - Agents fail to develop preferences or personalities
  - Agents' preferences and personalities do not align with their identities or social feedback
  - Agents' actions and perceptions are not recorded accurately
  - Agents' MBTI and SD3 test results are inconsistent or meaningless

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Initialize agents with different identities and observe their personality development over time
  2. Inject different attitudes into the social network and observe their effects on agent preferences
  3. Manipulate the agents' plan making and sensory perception capabilities and observe their effects on preference shaping

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific aspects of sensory perception most strongly influence preference shaping in LLM-based agents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies sensory perception as a significant factor influencing preference shaping, noting that negative feedback reduces the agent's desire to repeat an action
- Why unresolved: The paper does not specify which aspects of sensory perception (e.g., intensity, duration, type) have the strongest impact on preference shaping
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying specific sensory attributes (e.g., intensity, duration) and measuring their impact on preference shaping

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different RIASEC professional identities influence the personality traits of LLM-based agents beyond the MBTI dimensions explored?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explores how RIASEC identities influence MBTI personality traits but does not extend this to other personality dimensions or behaviors
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on MBTI and SD3 tests, leaving other personality dimensions unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Additional personality assessments (e.g., Big Five, HEXACO) applied to agents with different RIASEC identities

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the preference and personality shaping observed in Qunit's Cafe be replicated in more complex, real-world environments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges the limitation of the current simulation environment and suggests that future research could target real-world environments through embodied agents
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to a controlled, simplified environment, and real-world complexity is not addressed
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using embodied agents in real-world or more complex simulated environments to test the robustness of preference and personality shaping mechanisms

## Limitations
- The framework relies on specific personality frameworks (MBTI and SD3) which may constrain broader applicability
- The simplified sandbox environment may limit the realism of agents' experiences and scalability of results
- No external validation against established multi-agent frameworks to strengthen generalizability claims

## Confidence
- Preference shaping mechanism: Medium confidence - limited validation across diverse scenarios
- Personality shaping outcomes: Medium confidence - simplified social network implementation
- Plan making and sensory perception influence: Medium confidence - systematic comparative analysis but relies on single environment

## Next Checks
1. Validate the framework's ability to shape preferences across different types of actions beyond coffee drinking
2. Test personality shaping in a multi-agent environment with more diverse social interactions
3. Implement external validation by comparing AFSPP results with established multi-agent frameworks
