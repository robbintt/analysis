# Research on Personal Credit Risk Assessment Methods Based on Causal Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.11217
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11217
- Authors: Jiaxin Wang; YiLong Ma
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: This paper explores the theoretical foundations of causality in personal credit risk assessment using category theory, proving the feasibility of indicator synthesis in causal inference and providing a rigorous theoretical basis for integrating multiple data sources.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to personal credit risk assessment by applying category theory to define causality and causal inference. The authors develop a theoretical framework that uses causal objects, morphisms, and natural transformations to represent and analyze causal relationships in credit risk assessment. By combining this theoretical foundation with practical causal graph methods, the paper aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of personal credit risk assessment while providing a rigorous mathematical basis for data fusion techniques.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a two-pronged approach to personal credit risk assessment using causal inference. First, it establishes a category-theoretic framework where causal questions are represented as categories with objects as abstract representations and morphisms as transformations between representations. Second, it applies practical causal inference methods, specifically Pearl's probabilistic causal graph tools, for implementation. The method involves constructing causal graphs using the Inductive Causation algorithm, applying the backdoor criterion to estimate causal effects, and using data fusion techniques based on natural transformations to integrate multiple data sources.

## Key Results
- Category theory provides a mathematically rigorous framework for defining causality without the contradictions present in set-theoretic approaches
- The Yoneda Lemma establishes natural isomorphisms between hom-functors and arbitrary functors, validating data fusion methods in causal inference
- The combination of category theory and Pearl's causal graph methods provides both theoretical rigor and practical applicability for personal credit risk assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Category theory provides a mathematically rigorous framework for defining causality without the contradictions present in set-theoretic approaches.
- Mechanism: The paper uses category theory to define causal objects as objects in a category class, causal morphisms as transformations between representations, and causal functors to establish causal relationships between representations.
- Core assumption: Causal questions can be represented as categories where objects are abstract representations of thinking about the problem, and morphisms represent transformations of these representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This paper introduces a new definition of causality using category theory, proposed by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane in 1945 to avoid the self-referential contradictions in set theory, notably the Russell paradox."
  - [section] "Definition 13: A category C must satisfy four definitions and two properties... The fundamental viewpoint of category theory is that using arrow diagrams can simplify many mathematical properties' proofs. Category theory arose in response to Bertrand Russell's set-theoretic paradox of self-reference, and the theory cleverly avoids the occurrence of Russell's paradox by utilizing unit morphisms."
- Break condition: If the causal questions cannot be properly represented as categories, or if the transformations between representations cannot be adequately captured by morphisms.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Yoneda Lemma provides a mathematical foundation for data fusion in causal inference by establishing natural isomorphisms between hom-functors and arbitrary functors.
- Mechanism: The paper proves that for any causal relationship (represented as an object in the category), the data fusion transformation (natural transformation) is an isomorphism, meaning the fusion process preserves all relevant information about the causal relationship.
- Core assumption: The category representing causal problems is locally small, meaning hom-sets are actual sets rather than proper classes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A mathematical proof based on the Yoneda Lemma demonstrates the validity of data fusion methods in causal inference."
  - [section] "Lemma 1: For the category class Ob(C) corresponding to a certain causal problem. For any A in C, let its data fusion be the natural transformation Nat(hA,F), where F is a functor from C to the category of sets. Then this transformation is an isomorphism."
- Break condition: If the category is not locally small, or if the functors involved in the fusion process do not preserve the necessary structure.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combination of category theory and Pearl's causal graph methods provides both theoretical rigor and practical applicability for personal credit risk assessment.
- Mechanism: The paper uses category theory for theoretical foundations while adopting Pearl's probabilistic causal graph tools for practical implementation, combining the strengths of both approaches.
- Core assumption: The limitations in category theory-related technical tools can be overcome by using established probabilistic methods for practical implementation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Due to the limitations in the development of category theory-related technical tools, this paper adopts the widely-used probabilistic causal graph tool proposed by Judea Pearl in 1995 to study the application of causal inference in personal credit risk management."
  - [section] "Currently, research on causal relationships can be broadly categorized into three directions: the definition of causal relationships, methods for estimating causal effects, and the application of causal inference + 'X'."
- Break condition: If the gap between theoretical category theory and practical implementation becomes too large to bridge effectively.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Category Theory Basics (objects, morphisms, functors, natural transformations)
  - Why needed here: The paper builds its entire causal inference framework on category theory foundations, requiring understanding of how these concepts relate to causal reasoning.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a causal functor differs from a regular functor in the context of causal inference?

- Concept: Causal Inference Framework (do-calculus, backdoor criterion, directed acyclic graphs)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Pearl's causal inference methods alongside category theory, requiring understanding of how these practical tools work.
  - Quick check question: How does the backdoor criterion help identify causal effects from observational data?

- Concept: Data Fusion Methods (feature-level fusion, statistical indicators, business meaning construction)
  - Why needed here: The paper proposes using data fusion techniques to combine multiple data sources for credit risk assessment, requiring understanding of different fusion approaches.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of constructing derived features based on statistical indicators versus business meanings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Theoretical Foundation -> Practical Implementation -> Data Processing -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Define causal objects → Establish causal relationships via functors → Apply natural transformations for data fusion → Implement causal graph methods → Evaluate performance
- Design tradeoffs: Theoretical rigor vs. practical applicability (category theory vs. probabilistic methods), complexity of mathematical proofs vs. interpretability of results, completeness of causal representation vs. computational efficiency
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent causal relationships across different representations, failure of natural transformation to preserve causal structure, poor performance in causal effect estimation, computational intractability of category-theoretic proofs
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the IC algorithm on a small synthetic dataset to verify the ability to construct causal graphs from observational data
  2. Test the Yoneda Lemma-based data fusion proof on a simple categorical dataset to verify the isomorphism property
  3. Apply the complete framework to a personal credit dataset and evaluate performance using the three specified metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the category-theoretic definition of causality be extended to handle quantum mechanical systems where space-time and causality are fundamentally different?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of Hume's causal view in the context of modern physics and mentions the need for a new interpretation based on Bergson's concept of duration.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a new interpretation of causality based on Bergson's concept of duration but does not fully explore how this interpretation can be applied to quantum mechanical systems where the nature of causality is fundamentally different.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal mathematical framework that incorporates Bergson's concept of duration and can handle the non-locality and superposition inherent in quantum mechanics would be needed to fully address this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the Yoneda Lemma be used to prove the validity of data fusion methods in other domains beyond personal credit risk assessment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses the Yoneda Lemma to prove the validity of data fusion methods in personal credit risk assessment.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides a proof for the specific case of personal credit risk assessment. It is unclear whether the same approach can be generalized to other domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof that demonstrates the validity of data fusion methods using the Yoneda Lemma in a different domain would be needed to fully address this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the causal functor and natural transformation definitions be used to develop new algorithms for causal inference?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides definitions for causal functors and natural transformations but does not discuss how these definitions can be used to develop new algorithms for causal inference.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a theoretical framework for understanding causality but does not provide practical guidance on how to use this framework to develop new algorithms.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new algorithm for causal inference that is based on the causal functor and natural transformation definitions would be needed to fully address this question.

## Limitations
- The practical applicability of category theory to real-world credit risk assessment remains largely theoretical, with limited empirical validation on actual financial datasets
- The integration of category theory with Pearl's causal inference methods creates potential gaps between rigorous theoretical foundations and practical implementation
- The complexity of category-theoretic proofs may limit interpretability and adoption by practitioners in the credit risk domain

## Confidence
- Medium: The theoretical framework combining category theory and causal inference is sound but untested in real credit risk scenarios
- Medium: The data fusion approach using natural transformations shows promise but lacks empirical validation
- Low: The computational feasibility of applying these methods to large-scale credit risk datasets with multiple data sources

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical Validation**: Apply the complete framework to a real personal credit dataset with multiple data sources and evaluate performance against established credit risk models using the specified metrics (Harrell's concordance index, time-dependent AUC, Brier score).

2. **Scalability Assessment**: Test the computational efficiency and scalability of the category-theoretic proof methods and data fusion techniques on increasingly large and complex credit risk datasets.

3. **Interpretability Analysis**: Conduct a thorough analysis of the interpretability and practical utility of the causal graphs and natural transformations for credit risk analysts and decision-makers in financial institutions.
