# Beyond the Known: Adversarial Autoencoders in Novelty Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2404.04456
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04456
- **Reference count**: 0
- **One-line primary result**: Proposed lightweight adversarial autoencoder framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on MNIST, Coil-100, and Fashion-MNIST datasets with higher F1-scores and AUC scores.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a lightweight adversarial autoencoder framework for novelty detection that computes novelty probability by linearizing the manifold structure holding the inlier distribution. The method uses two discriminators to improve training and effectively learn the inlier distribution shape, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while maintaining a lightweight architecture with fewer parameters and lower memory requirements.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses a lightweight autoencoder with two discriminators: one to match the latent space distribution with a standard normal prior, and another to match decoded images with real data distribution. The framework combines reconstruction loss with adversarial losses in both latent and image spaces. The total loss function is a weighted sum of reconstruction loss, adversarial latent loss, and adversarial image loss. The model is trained by alternating between updating discriminator and generator weights, with outlier percentage varied from 10% to 50% during evaluation.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on MNIST, Coil-100, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
- Achieves higher F1-scores and AUC scores across different outlier percentages (10% to 50%)
- Demonstrates robustness with lightweight architecture requiring fewer parameters and lower memory
- Shows effectiveness in novelty detection while maintaining computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The linearized manifold structure enables interpretable probability distribution across local coordinates.
- Mechanism: By linearizing the manifold that holds the inlier distribution structure, the method can compute novelty probability based on local tangent space coordinates, creating a clear geometric interpretation of probability distribution relative to the manifold.
- Core assumption: The inlier distribution forms a continuous manifold structure that can be locally linearized around test samples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we compute the novelty probability by linearizing the manifold that holds the structure of the inlier distribution"
  - [section 9]: "we provide an overview of our network architecture and the training methodology employed to learn the mapping functions f and g... These mappings, s and f, are modeled using an autoencoder network"
- Break condition: If the inlier distribution exhibits highly non-manifold structures or multiple disconnected components, linearization becomes inaccurate.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dual discriminators improve training by addressing both latent space and decoded image distributions.
- Mechanism: Two discriminators are used - one to match the latent space distribution with the predefined prior (typically standard normal), and another to match the distribution of decoded images with real training data distribution. This adversarial training reduces blurriness and enhances local details.
- Core assumption: Adversarial training can effectively align both latent and output distributions with their targets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "uses two discriminators to improve training and effectively learn the inlier distribution shape"
  - [section 9]: "we introduce an additional adversarial training criterion that compares the output of the decoder network with the distribution of real data"
- Break condition: If discriminators cannot converge or if training instability prevents effective distribution matching.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reconstruction error captures noise component while probability distribution captures signal structure.
- Mechanism: The framework separates the model into two parts - one influenced by the manifold (decoder network and latent distribution) and another influenced by reconstruction error. The reconstruction error primarily affects the noise part of the model, while probability distribution captures the signal structure.
- Core assumption: Reconstruction error can be cleanly separated into signal and noise components.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the reconstruction error is mainly related to the noise from the reconstruction of the outliers"
  - [section 9]: "While we do take advantage of that, our framework shows that the reconstruction error only influences the noise part of the model"
- Break condition: If outliers share similar noise characteristics with inliers, reconstruction error becomes ambiguous.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial Autoencoders (AAEs)
  - Why needed here: The method builds directly on AAE framework to learn manifold structure and generate images
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes AAEs from standard autoencoders in terms of training objectives?

- Concept: Manifold Learning
  - Why needed here: The method linearizes the manifold holding inlier distribution structure to compute novelty probability
  - Quick check question: How does manifold assumption help in separating inliers from outliers in high-dimensional space?

- Concept: One-Class Classification
  - Why needed here: The method operates in one-class setting where only inlier distribution is known during training
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in one-class classification compared to multi-class classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Encoder → Latent space → Decoder → Output reconstruction → Dual discriminators → Loss computation → Parameter updates

- Critical path: Input → Encoder → Latent space → Decoder → Output reconstruction → Dual discriminators → Loss computation → Parameter updates

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Lightweight architecture vs performance: The method uses fewer parameters than state-of-the-art techniques
  - Adversarial training complexity vs reconstruction quality: Adds training complexity but improves output quality
  - Linearization approximation vs computational efficiency: Simplifies probability computation but may lose some accuracy

- Failure signatures:
  - Mode collapse in discriminators leading to poor distribution matching
  - Over-regularization causing loss of inlier detail in reconstructions
  - Latent space mismatch preventing effective probability computation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test reconstruction quality on inliers vs outliers using simple MSE metric
  2. Verify latent space distribution matches standard normal using visualization
  3. Evaluate dual discriminator training stability across different learning rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the Beyond the Known (BtK) framework scale with increasingly large and complex datasets compared to its current evaluation on MNIST, Coil-100, and Fashion-MNIST?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "In future works we hope to train and evaluate our method on large scale datasets" and discuss the current evaluation on three specific datasets.
- Why unresolved: The current study only evaluates the method on relatively small-scale datasets (MNIST, Coil-100, Fashion-MNIST), leaving uncertainty about performance on larger, more complex datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing BtK performance on large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet, CIFAR-100) compared to state-of-the-art methods, including computational efficiency metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the computational efficiency of the BtK framework compared to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of execution time and memory usage during training and inference?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention their model is "lightweight because it has fewer parameters, a simple shallow architecture and low memory needs" but provide no quantitative comparison.
- Why unresolved: The paper claims lightweight architecture but lacks concrete performance metrics comparing execution time and memory usage against competing methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark results comparing training and inference times, memory consumption, and parameter counts between BtK and competing methods across multiple datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the BtK framework handle sequential or temporal data, such as video streams, given its current focus on static image datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors focus exclusively on image datasets and mention "novelty detection in images" while acknowledging related work on video anomaly detection.
- Why unresolved: The framework's architecture and evaluation are designed for static images, with no investigation into temporal data or video applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results applying BtK to video datasets with temporal anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating adaptation of the framework for sequential data processing.

## Limitations

## Next Checks

1. **Architectural Reproduction**: Attempt to reproduce results using reasonable interpretation of missing architectural details, varying key hyperparameters to assess robustness

2. **Manifold Approximation Validation**: Test linearized manifold approximation on datasets with known non-linear structures to evaluate limitations and accuracy

3. **Signal-Noise Separation Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies to quantify contribution of reconstruction error versus probability distribution in detecting outliers, validating claimed separation of signal and noise
