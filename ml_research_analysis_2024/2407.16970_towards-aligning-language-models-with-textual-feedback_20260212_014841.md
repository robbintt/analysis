# Towards Aligning Language Models with Textual Feedback
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.16970
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16970
- Reference count: 30
- Key result: ALT aligns language models using textual feedback, outperforming PPO in toxicity reduction and achieving competitive summarization with fewer samples

## Executive Summary
ALT is a method that aligns language models using textual feedback, treating alignment as a conditional sequence decision problem where the model learns to map feedback to generations. The method involves iterative phases of sampling from the model, assigning textual feedback, and training the model to generate conditioned on that feedback. Experiments across three tasks—toxicity reduction, summarization, and dialogue response generation—show that ALT effectively aligns models and outperforms traditional RL methods like PPO. Notably, ALT reduces toxicity by 62% compared to PPO and matches PPO's summarization performance using only 20% of the training samples. When using LLM-provided feedback, ALT generates increasingly more helpful and harmless dialogue responses. However, unconstrained textual feedback from LLMs failed to improve summarization, likely due to inconsistent feedback.

## Method Summary
ALT treats alignment as a conditional sequence generation problem where the language model learns to map textual feedback to improved generations. The process is iterative: first, the model generates outputs; then textual feedback is assigned to these outputs; finally, the model is trained to generate conditioned on that feedback. This approach replaces scalar rewards with richer textual signals, enabling more nuanced alignment. ALT was evaluated on three tasks—toxicity reduction, summarization, and dialogue—and demonstrated superior sample efficiency and alignment quality compared to traditional RL methods like PPO, particularly when high-quality feedback was provided.

## Key Results
- ALT reduces toxicity by 62% compared to PPO
- Matches PPO's summarization performance using only 20% of the training samples
- Generates increasingly more helpful and harmless dialogue responses when using LLM-provided feedback

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ALT works by reframing alignment as a conditional sequence generation task. Instead of optimizing for scalar rewards, the model learns to condition its outputs on textual feedback, which provides richer, more granular signals about what constitutes good or bad behavior. This allows the model to internalize feedback more effectively, leading to better alignment with human preferences. The iterative loop of generation, feedback assignment, and retraining ensures continuous improvement and adaptation to evolving feedback patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conditional Sequence Generation**: Needed because ALT reframes alignment as learning to generate conditioned on feedback. Quick check: Verify the model can generate coherent outputs when prompted with feedback.
- **Textual Feedback Processing**: Required to convert unstructured feedback into actionable signals for the model. Quick check: Ensure feedback is semantically meaningful and consistent.
- **Iterative Training Loops**: Essential for refining the model's alignment over multiple feedback cycles. Quick check: Monitor performance improvements across iterations.
- **Sample Efficiency**: Critical for demonstrating ALT's advantage over traditional RL methods. Quick check: Compare sample usage against baselines like PPO.
- **Feedback Quality Control**: Necessary to avoid degradation from noisy or inconsistent feedback. Quick check: Validate feedback consistency before training.
- **Alignment Evaluation**: Needed to measure the effectiveness of ALT across different tasks. Quick check: Use task-specific metrics (e.g., toxicity scores, helpfulness ratings).

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Model -> Feedback Assignment -> Training Loop -> Improved Model
- **Critical Path**: Sampling from the model → Assigning textual feedback → Training the model to condition on feedback → Evaluating alignment
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Richer textual feedback vs. increased complexity in feedback processing; sample efficiency vs. potential noise in feedback
- **Failure Signatures**: Degradation in summarization with inconsistent LLM feedback; overfitting to specific feedback patterns; slow convergence with poor-quality feedback
- **First Experiments**: 1) Test ALT on a simple alignment task with controlled feedback; 2) Compare sample efficiency against PPO; 3) Evaluate robustness to noisy feedback

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- ALT's performance degrades with inconsistent or noisy textual feedback, as seen in summarization experiments
- The method's dependence on high-quality feedback raises scalability concerns in real-world alignment scenarios
- No comparison against state-of-the-art supervised fine-tuning baselines is provided

## Confidence
- **High**: Toxicity reduction and dialogue tasks with controlled feedback
- **Medium**: Summarization due to noted inconsistency in feedback-driven improvements
- **Low**: Generalizations about ALT's superiority across all alignment tasks without further validation

## Next Checks
1. Test ALT on a broader set of alignment tasks with varying feedback quality to assess robustness to noise and inconsistency
2. Compare ALT against supervised fine-tuning and other alignment methods to establish relative performance across different sample efficiency regimes
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of feedback quality, feedback frequency, and feedback diversity on final alignment outcomes
