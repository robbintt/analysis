# WinoViz: Probing Visual Properties of Objects Under Different States

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.13584
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13584
- Reference count: 13
- Key outcome: WinoViz dataset reveals that language models excel at pragmatic reasoning but struggle with visual knowledge reasoning, especially in multi-hop scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces WinoViz, a dataset designed to evaluate language models' reasoning abilities regarding visual properties of objects under different states. The dataset consists of 1,380 examples where models must choose between contrasting hypothesis sentences based on premise sentences about object states. The task requires both pragmatic reasoning to interpret intended meanings and visual knowledge reasoning to understand how objects exhibit different properties. Experiments demonstrate that while large language models like GPT-4 perform well on single-hop reasoning tasks, their performance significantly degrades on more challenging multi-hop tasks that require chaining multiple reasoning steps.

## Method Summary
The WinoViz dataset was created by collecting objects and attributes from sources like Memory Colors, Visual Property Norms, and McRae feature norms, then annotating premise and hypothesis sentences through crowdsourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Models were evaluated using zero-shot inference and few-shot in-context learning for encoder-decoder and decoder-only models, while encoder-only models were fine-tuned with SNLI and ANLI datasets. The evaluation measured both individual accuracy (choosing between two hypotheses) and pair accuracy (correctly answering both parts of a premise-hypothesis pair).

## Key Results
- GPT-4 shows the best overall performance on both single-hop and multi-hop tasks
- Vision-language models significantly outperform language-only models due to exposure to image-caption datasets
- Performance drops substantially on multi-hop tasks, indicating difficulty with chaining reasoning steps
- Using machine-generated images does not improve performance due to poor image quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Large language models effectively leverage pragmatic reasoning to identify intended meanings from premise sentences
- Mechanism: Models parse premise sentences to extract key phrases indicating object properties, using these cues to select plausible hypotheses
- Core assumption: Premise sentences contain sufficient contextual information for inferring object states
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] notes that large models perform well on pragmatic reasoning but visual knowledge is a bottleneck

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Vision-language models outperform language-only models due to exposure to image-caption datasets
- Mechanism: These models integrate visual knowledge from images, enhancing understanding of object properties beyond text descriptions
- Core assumption: Image-caption datasets contain diverse visual representations of objects in various states
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.2] shows LLaVA built on LLaMA2 and trained with image-caption datasets performs notably well

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-hop reasoning requires additional intermediate steps, significantly degrading model performance
- Mechanism: Models must first identify visual attributes, then map them to similar attributes in other objects, requiring complex reasoning chains
- Core assumption: Models can identify visual attributes but struggle with the additional mapping step
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] states performance is significantly degraded on multi-hop data

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Pragmatic reasoning
  - Why needed here: To extract intended meaning from premise sentences and identify object properties
  - Quick check question: Can the model accurately identify key phrases in a premise sentence that indicate an object's state?

- Concept: Visual knowledge reasoning
  - Why needed here: To understand how objects exhibit different properties under various states, rarely explicitly described in text
  - Quick check question: Can the model correctly associate visual attributes with object states based on limited textual information?

- Concept: Multi-step reasoning
  - Why needed here: To solve multi-hop tasks, models must chain together multiple reasoning steps
  - Quick check question: Can the model successfully map a visual attribute from one object to another object with a similar attribute?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Premise sentence -> Pragmatic reasoning -> Visual knowledge reasoning -> Hypothesis selection
- Critical path: 1) Parse premise to extract object property cues, 2) Use information to select plausible hypothesis, 3) For multi-hop tasks, map visual attribute to similar attribute in another object
- Design tradeoffs: Text-only vs vision-language models (visual knowledge advantage vs accessibility), single-hop vs multi-hop tasks (comprehensive evaluation vs complexity)
- Failure signatures: Incorrect pragmatic reasoning (fails to identify intended meaning), insufficient visual knowledge (lacks understanding of object properties), inability to chain reasoning steps (struggles with multi-hop tasks)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Evaluate text-only model on single-hop tasks for pragmatic reasoning assessment, 2) Compare text-only vs vision-language model on single-hop tasks to measure visual knowledge impact, 3) Test model's ability to solve multi-hop tasks to evaluate multi-step reasoning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does performance change when additional visual information is incorporated beyond text-only format?
- What is the impact of reporting bias on performance and how does this bias differ across object states and properties?
- How do reasoning abilities evolve as model size and complexity increase?
- Can WinoViz effectively evaluate commonsense reasoning in domains beyond visual properties?
- How does performance vary across different languages and cultural contexts?

## Limitations

- Dataset generalization is limited by crowdsourced annotations and English language focus
- Model performance interpretation cannot distinguish between pragmatic reasoning success and memorized visual knowledge retrieval
- Image generation quality analysis lacks detailed examination of specific failure modes
- Evaluation framework doesn't isolate pragmatic reasoning from other cognitive processes
- Limited coverage of object-attribute pairs may not represent full diversity of visual reasoning scenarios

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Vision-language models outperform text-only models on visual reasoning tasks
- Medium Confidence: Multi-hop reasoning is significantly more challenging, though alternative explanations exist
- Low Confidence: Pragmatic reasoning is the primary bottleneck for language models

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Bias Analysis**: Conduct systematic analysis to identify annotation biases, coverage gaps, and determine if performance results generalize beyond dataset scope

2. **Model Ablation Studies**: Design experiments isolating pragmatic reasoning from other cognitive processes by systematically modifying evaluation framework components

3. **Cross-Lingual and Domain Transfer**: Evaluate models using cross-lingual transfer tests and domain adaptation scenarios to assess transfer of visual reasoning capabilities
