# ValueBench: Towards Comprehensively Evaluating Value Orientations and Understanding of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.04214
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04214
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: First comprehensive psychometric benchmark evaluating value orientations and understanding in large language models

## Executive Summary
ValueBench introduces the first comprehensive psychometric benchmark for evaluating value orientations and understanding in large language models (LLMs). The benchmark collects data from 44 established psychometric inventories, encompassing 453 multifaceted value dimensions across personality, social axioms, cognitive systems, and value theory domains. The authors propose an evaluation pipeline grounded in realistic human-AI interactions, demonstrating that LLMs can approximate expert conclusions in value-related extraction and generation tasks with over 80% consistency when provided with sufficient contexts and well-designed prompts.

## Method Summary
ValueBench evaluates LLM value orientations by transforming psychometric inventory items into advice-seeking closed questions administered to LLMs, then using GPT-4 Turbo to rate responses on a 0-10 scale indicating leaning toward "Yes" or "No" answers. Value orientations are calculated by averaging scores for items related to each value. The benchmark also evaluates value understanding through three tasks: identifying relevant value pairs, extracting values from items, and generating arguments consistent with given values. Six representative LLMs are evaluated, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama-2 7B/70B, Mistral 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve over 80% consistency with expert conclusions in value-related extraction and generation tasks
- LLMs demonstrate ability to identify relevant value pairs, extract values from items, and generate value-consistent content
- Distinct value orientations emerge across different LLMs, particularly for values like "Decisiveness," "Hedonism," and "Face Consciousness"
- Most LLMs show performance degradation when converting symmetric prompts into asymmetric ones for value relationship identification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ValueBench evaluates LLM value orientations by rephrasing psychometric inventory items into advice-seeking questions and using an evaluator LLM to rate responses.
- Mechanism: The evaluation pipeline transforms self-report Likert-scale items into closed questions that simulate authentic human-AI interactions. Responses are rated on a 0-10 scale indicating leaning toward "Yes" or "No" answers. Value orientations are calculated by averaging scores for items related to each value.
- Core assumption: LLMs can provide meaningful free-form responses to value-related questions, and an evaluator LLM can reliably rate these responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "propose an evaluation pipeline grounded in realistic human-AI interactions to probe value orientations"
  - [section] "We begin by rephrasing first-person statements into advice-seeking closed questions via LLMs while preserving the original stance"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus validation of this specific evaluation mechanism found
- Break condition: If LLMs refuse to answer value-related questions or provide inconsistent responses across similar scenarios, or if evaluator LLM ratings show low reliability.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs can understand value relationships by identifying relevant values, extracting values from items, and generating value-consistent content.
- Mechanism: Three tasks evaluate value understanding: (1) identifying relevant value pairs (subscale, synonyms, opposites), (2) extracting top values from items, and (3) generating arguments consistent with given values. Performance is measured against ground truth from psychometric inventories.
- Core assumption: LLMs have internalized sufficient value-related knowledge during training to perform these tasks with reasonable accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "exhibit their ability to approximate expert conclusions in value-related extraction and generation tasks"
  - [section] "LLMs demonstrate their ability to approximate expert conclusions established in Psychology research"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related work on LLM personality estimation and value understanding found
- Break condition: If LLM performance drops significantly below human-level accuracy or shows systematic biases in value identification and generation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The comprehensive collection of 44 psychometric inventories with 453 value dimensions provides robust coverage of human values across multiple domains.
- Mechanism: ValueBench aggregates inventories from personality, social axioms, cognitive system, and value theory domains. Each domain captures different aspects of values, from individual traits to societal beliefs to abstract value structures.
- Core assumption: The selected inventories comprehensively represent the multidimensional nature of human values as established in psychological research.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "collects data from 44 established psychometric inventories, encompassing 453 multifaceted value dimensions"
  - [section] "We collect psychometric inventories from multiple domains, including personality, social axioms, cognitive system, and general value theory"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - meta-inventory approaches cited but specific scale validation not found
- Break condition: If significant value dimensions are missing or if the collection shows cultural bias that limits generalizability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Psychometric inventory structure
  - Why needed here: Understanding how personality tests and value scales are constructed is essential for interpreting ValueBench's methodology and results
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a psychometric inventory (items, scales, validation methods) and how do they differ from other assessment types?

- Concept: Value theory dimensions
  - Why needed here: The multidimensional nature of values (as described by theories like Schwartz's Basic Values) underpins ValueBench's approach to measuring value orientations
  - Quick check question: How do different value theories conceptualize the relationship between values (e.g., compatibility, conflict, hierarchy)?

- Concept: LLM evaluation methodology
  - Why needed here: Understanding zero-shot prompting, in-context learning, and evaluation frameworks is crucial for implementing and extending ValueBench
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when designing prompts for LLM evaluation tasks, particularly for subjective or value-laden content?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data collection -> Item transformation -> LLM response generation -> GPT-4 Turbo evaluation -> Value orientation calculation -> Result analysis

- Critical path:
  1. Load psychometric inventory data
  2. Transform items into advice-seeking questions
  3. Generate LLM responses
  4. Evaluate responses using GPT-4 Turbo
  5. Calculate value orientation scores
  6. Analyze results across models and values

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Breadth vs. depth: Including many inventories provides comprehensive coverage but may introduce noise
  - Human vs. LLM evaluation: Human evaluators are more reliable but less scalable
  - Open-ended vs. controlled responses: Open-ended responses are more realistic but harder to evaluate consistently

- Failure signatures:
  - Low consistency between different LLM responses to the same value
  - Significant performance degradation when switching between symmetric and asymmetric prompts
  - High refusal rates when administering value-related questions
  - Evaluator LLM showing inconsistent ratings across similar responses

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the complete evaluation pipeline on a single inventory (e.g., PVQ-40) with one LLM to verify the full workflow
  2. Test the item rephrasing functionality by comparing original vs. transformed items for consistency
  3. Validate the evaluator LLM by having it rate responses from different models and checking for inter-rater reliability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop more reliable evaluation methods for LLM value orientations that avoid the inconsistency between controlled settings and authentic human-AI interactions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses inconsistency between Likert-scale self-report testing and authentic human-AI interactions, using the example in Figure 4 where different responses are given to the same question in different contexts.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a limitation but doesn't propose a definitive solution beyond the current evaluation pipeline using rephrased questions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new evaluation method that consistently produces aligned results across both controlled and authentic interaction settings, with statistical validation showing reduced variance compared to current methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What factors contribute to the observed differences in value orientations between LLMs, particularly for values like "Decisiveness," "Hedonism," and "Face Consciousness"?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes "distinct value orientations of LLMs" and states "The reasons behind these differences are complex research problems."
- Why unresolved: While the paper observes these differences, it doesn't investigate the underlying causes such as training data composition, fine-tuning processes, or architectural differences.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic analysis comparing model architectures, training datasets, and fine-tuning procedures to identify correlations between these factors and specific value orientations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different prompting strategies (symmetric vs. asymmetric) affect LLM performance in identifying hierarchical relationships between values, and what is the optimal approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that "most LLMs exhibit notable performance degradation when converting symmetric prompts into asymmetric ones" in the value relationship identification task.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the performance difference but doesn't explore why this occurs or whether hybrid approaches could improve results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of multiple prompting strategies across different model families, identifying which approaches consistently yield better performance for hierarchical value relationships.

## Limitations

- The evaluation pipeline relies heavily on GPT-4 Turbo as an evaluator, raising questions about the reliability and potential biases of using one LLM to assess others
- The paper does not address potential data contamination - whether LLMs were trained on the specific psychometric inventories used, which could inflate performance scores
- The choice of rephrasing Likert-scale items into closed questions may not fully capture the nuanced responses that human participants provide in traditional psychometric assessments

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The comprehensive collection of 44 psychometric inventories covering 453 value dimensions, the clear evaluation pipeline methodology, and the demonstration that LLMs can achieve >80% consistency with expert conclusions in value-related tasks.
- **Medium confidence**: The reliability of GPT-4 Turbo as an evaluator, the generalizability of results across different cultural contexts, and the effectiveness of the value understanding tasks.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about the absence of data contamination effects and the completeness of value coverage given potential cultural biases in the selected inventories.

## Next Checks

1. **Evaluator reliability test**: Conduct a parallel evaluation using human experts to rate a subset of LLM responses and compare inter-rater reliability between human-human, human-LLM, and LLM-LLM evaluations to quantify potential evaluator bias.

2. **Data contamination analysis**: Perform a systematic analysis to identify whether the psychometric inventories used in ValueBench appear in the training data of evaluated LLMs, and measure the impact of potential contamination on performance scores.

3. **Cultural generalizability assessment**: Evaluate ValueBench across LLMs fine-tuned on culturally diverse datasets or LLMs from different regions to assess whether the value orientations identified reflect universal values or show cultural biases.
