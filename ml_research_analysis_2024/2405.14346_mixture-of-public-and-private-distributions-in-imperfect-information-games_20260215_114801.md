# Mixture of Public and Private Distributions in Imperfect Information Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.14346
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14346

- Primary result: Mixture belief distribution combining public and private information improves performance in imperfect information games while reducing information leakage

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of balancing private information protection with performance in imperfect information games (IIGs). The authors propose a novel mixture belief distribution that combines public and private information, controlled by a parameter λ. They demonstrate that using this mixture improves performance compared to using only public or private distributions, and that adjusting λ throughout the game further enhances results. Experiments on benchmarks like Liar's Dice and Leduc Poker show that their approach reduces information leakage while maintaining strong performance against both best responders and standard opponents. The method is particularly effective for PIMC, which tends to reveal more information than IS-MCTS.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a mixture belief distribution that combines public and private information using a parameter λ, where λ=0 represents pure private distribution and λ=1 represents pure public distribution. The authors adapt PIMC and IS-MCTS algorithms to use this mixture distribution across multiple game benchmarks. They implement a reproduction framework that evaluates performance by measuring expected utility against best responders and winning rates against PIMC baselines. The method involves running multiple instances of the algorithms with different λ values and combining their results based on the mixture distribution, with dynamic adjustment of λ throughout the game to optimize for different game phases.

## Key Results
- Mixture distribution with intermediate λ values significantly improves performance compared to pure private or public distributions
- PIMC reveals more information than IS-MCTS across all benchmarks, making it more susceptible to exploitation
- Dynamic adjustment of λ throughout the game further enhances performance compared to fixed λ values
- The approach maintains strong performance while reducing information leakage in games like Liar's Dice and Leduc Poker

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Using a mixture of private and public belief distributions improves performance by reducing information leakage while retaining enough private knowledge to maintain strong strategic play.
- **Mechanism:** The mixture belief distribution balances the trade-off between exploiting private information (which can leak to opponents) and protecting private information (which can reduce decision quality). By tuning λ, the algorithm can adjust how much private information is used in sampling world states during determinization.
- **Core assumption:** There exists an optimal λ that maximizes performance, and this λ varies depending on the game phase and opponent modeling.
- **Evidence anchors:** Experimental results show performance improvements using mixture distributions across benchmarks, with specific λ values yielding better results than pure private or public approaches.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Adjusting λ dynamically throughout the game further improves performance by adapting to the changing importance of private information protection.
- **Mechanism:** By using different λ values for different game phases (e.g., more private information early, more public information later), the algorithm can optimize for both strategic depth and information security. This is implemented by running separate instances of PIMC or IS-MCTS for different λ values and combining their results based on the mixture distribution.
- **Core assumption:** The optimal λ is not static and depends on the game state and opponent behavior.
- **Evidence anchors:** The paper demonstrates that using multiple mixtures throughout the game has an impact on performance, with different optimal λ values for different game positions.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** PIMC reveals more information than IS-MCTS, making it more susceptible to exploitation by opponents who can infer private information.
- **Mechanism:** PIMC uses AlphaBeta as the perfect information evaluator, which may lead to more deterministic and revealing play patterns compared to the random rollouts used in IS-MCTS. This increased determinism allows opponents to more easily infer the true world state.
- **Core assumption:** The choice of perfect information evaluator (AlphaBeta vs. random rollouts) significantly impacts the amount of information revealed to opponents.
- **Evidence anchors:** Experimental observations show that PIMC reveals more information than IS-MCTS in every benchmark tested, suggesting that the deterministic nature of AlphaBeta contributes to increased information leakage.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Imperfect Information Games (IIGs)
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding the difference between perfect and imperfect information games is crucial for grasping the challenges of information leakage and the need for belief distributions.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the key difference between a perfect information game and an imperfect information game?

- **Concept:** Belief Distributions
  - **Why needed here:** Belief distributions are used to represent the probability of different world states given the available information, and are central to the algorithms used in this paper.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the difference between a private belief distribution and a public belief distribution?

- **Concept:** Determinization-based Algorithms
  - **Why needed here:** These algorithms sample world states according to a belief distribution and use perfect information algorithms to evaluate the sampled states, which is the core approach used in this paper.
  - **Quick check question:** How do determinization-based algorithms like PIMC and IS-MCTS work?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Belief Distribution Module -> Determinization Sampler -> Perfect Information Algorithm -> Policy Aggregator
- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize belief distribution based on current infostate and λ
  2. Sample world states according to the belief distribution
  3. Evaluate the sampled world states using the perfect information algorithm
  4. Aggregate the results and select the best action
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Using more private information (λ closer to 0) can lead to better strategic play but increases information leakage
  - Using more public information (λ closer to 1) reduces information leakage but may lead to less optimal play
  - Running multiple instances with different λ values can improve performance but increases computational overhead
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Performance degradation when λ is too close to 0 or 1
  - Computational infeasibility when the number of possible world states explodes
  - Exploitation by opponents who can infer private information
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement the mixture belief distribution and test its impact on information leakage compared to private and public distributions
  2. Evaluate the performance of the mixture distribution against a best responder to measure its robustness to information inference
  3. Test the dynamic adjustment of λ throughout the game to optimize performance for different game phases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can we extend the mixture belief distribution concept to games with more than two players?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper focuses on two-player games like Liar's Dice and Leduc Poker, but mentions "each player possesses N dice" suggesting potential for multi-player scenarios.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper doesn't address the challenges of applying the mixture distribution to games with more than two players, where information asymmetry and strategic interactions become more complex.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results comparing mixture distributions in two-player vs. multi-player games, and theoretical analysis of how the mixture parameter λ should be adjusted for different numbers of players.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can we dynamically adjust the mixture parameter λ throughout the game based on real-time observations?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper mentions that "using multiple mixtures throughout the game has an impact on the performance" but doesn't provide a method for dynamically adjusting λ.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper only tests fixed λ values for different game positions, but doesn't explore how to adjust λ based on the current game state or opponent behavior.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A method for computing λ as a function of game state features, and experimental results showing improved performance compared to fixed λ values.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the mixture belief distribution affect the convergence of reinforcement learning algorithms in imperfect information games?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper uses deterministic algorithms (PIMC and IS-MCTS) with fixed beliefs, but doesn't explore how the mixture distribution affects learning algorithms that update beliefs over time.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper doesn't address the interaction between mixture distributions and belief updating mechanisms in reinforcement learning, which is crucial for developing adaptive strategies in dynamic environments.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative studies of reinforcement learning algorithms using private, public, and mixture distributions, and analysis of convergence rates and final performance in various imperfect information games.

## Limitations
- The approach relies on experimental results without providing theoretical guarantees for the optimal λ values
- Computational complexity analysis is limited to qualitative observations without detailed runtime comparisons
- The claim that PIMC reveals more information than IS-MCTS lacks rigorous theoretical analysis of information leakage mechanisms

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core experimental methodology of using mixture distributions and demonstrating performance improvements on standard benchmarks
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that adjusting λ dynamically throughout the game improves performance, as this is supported by experimental results but lacks theoretical justification
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that PIMC reveals more information than IS-MCTS due to the use of AlphaBeta, as this requires more rigorous analysis of information leakage mechanisms

## Next Checks
1. **Theoretical Analysis of Information Leakage:** Conduct a formal analysis comparing information leakage between PIMC and IS-MCTS under different perfect information evaluators, quantifying the information revealed in each case.

2. **Scalability Testing:** Implement comprehensive runtime analysis measuring computational overhead when using mixture distributions versus pure private/public approaches, particularly for games with large state spaces.

3. **Alternative Baseline Comparison:** Compare the mixture distribution approach against other state-of-the-art IIG algorithms (e.g., counterfactual regret minimization variants) to establish whether the performance improvements are specific to the PIMC/IS-MCTS framework or generalize to broader IIG methods.
