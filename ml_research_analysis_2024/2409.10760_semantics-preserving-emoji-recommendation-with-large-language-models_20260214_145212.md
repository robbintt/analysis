# Semantics Preserving Emoji Recommendation with Large Language Models

- Novel framework for evaluating emoji recommendation based on semantic preservation across multiple downstream tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel semantics preserving evaluation framework for emoji recommendation systems that moves beyond traditional exact match metrics. The framework evaluates whether recommended emojis maintain semantic consistency of the original text by assessing preservation across five downstream tasks: sentiment analysis, emotion classification, stance detection, age prediction, and gender prediction. GPT-4o achieves the highest semantics preservation score of 79.23% among six large language models evaluated, demonstrating superior performance in maintaining semantic consistency. The study also shows that incorporating user profile information (age and gender) into prompts improves recommendation quality, and that GPT-4o recommends more diverse emojis compared to other models.

## Method Summary
The authors construct a benchmark dataset and systematically evaluate six large language models (both proprietary and open-source) using various prompting techniques. The evaluation framework measures semantic preservation by assessing whether emoji recommendations maintain performance on five downstream tasks: sentiment analysis, emotion classification, stance detection, age prediction, and gender prediction. Models are prompted to recommend emojis for given text inputs, and the preservation of task-specific attributes is measured using metrics like F1-scores and accuracy. The framework considers emojis that preserve these attributes as semantically consistent with the original text. GPT-4o demonstrates the best overall performance, while the study also investigates the impact of user profile information on recommendation quality.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o achieves the highest semantics preservation score of 79.23% among evaluated models
- Incorporating user profile information (age and gender) into prompts improves recommendation performance
- GPT-4o recommends more diverse emojis compared to other models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the ability of large language models to understand semantic relationships between text and emojis. By evaluating whether emoji recommendations preserve performance on downstream tasks, the approach captures semantic consistency beyond simple exact matching. The inclusion of user profile information allows models to make more contextually appropriate recommendations by considering demographic factors that influence emoji usage patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic preservation**: The concept of maintaining meaning consistency when translating between text and emojis - needed because traditional exact match metrics fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships
- **Downstream task preservation**: Using task-specific performance as a proxy for semantic consistency - needed because direct semantic measurement is challenging and subjective
- **Prompt engineering**: The technique of crafting specific prompts to elicit desired model behavior - needed to optimize emoji recommendation quality across different models
- **User profile integration**: Incorporating demographic information into recommendations - needed because emoji usage patterns vary significantly across different user groups
- **Benchmark dataset construction**: Creating standardized evaluation datasets - needed to enable fair comparison across different models and approaches
- **Emoji diversity measurement**: Quantifying the variety of emojis recommended - needed because diversity impacts user experience and expression capability

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Text input -> LLM model -> Emoji recommendation -> Downstream task evaluation -> Semantic preservation score

Critical path: The evaluation framework measures semantic preservation by comparing task performance on original text versus text with recommended emojis. If task performance remains consistent, the emoji is considered semantically preserving.

Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes semantic consistency over exact match accuracy, accepting that recommended emojis may differ from ground truth while maintaining meaning. This trade-off enables more nuanced evaluation but may miss cases where specific emojis carry unique cultural or contextual significance.

Failure signatures: Poor semantic preservation occurs when recommended emojis significantly alter downstream task performance, indicating loss of original meaning. Common failure modes include recommending emojis that contradict sentiment, emotion, or demographic indicators present in the original text.

First experiments:
1. Test semantic preservation across all five downstream tasks for a single text-emoji pair to understand task-specific sensitivity
2. Compare exact match metrics versus semantic preservation scores on a small subset to quantify framework benefits
3. Evaluate model performance with and without user profile information for representative demographic groups

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on task-specific preservation as a proxy for semantic consistency may miss other important aspects like humor or cultural references
- Benchmark dataset construction may introduce biases based on common usage patterns rather than full emoji diversity
- Performance metrics may not perfectly align with human judgments of semantic preservation
- Focus on English text limits applicability to multilingual contexts where emoji usage patterns differ
- Does not account for temporal dynamics in emoji usage or evolving cultural meanings

## Confidence
- High confidence: GPT-4o achieves superior performance on the proposed semantic preservation metric
- Medium confidence: User profile information improves recommendation quality based on observed performance improvements
- Medium confidence: The evaluation framework provides more nuanced assessment than traditional exact match metrics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to validate whether emoji recommendations that preserve task performance also align with human judgments of semantic consistency
2. Expand the benchmark to include multilingual text samples and evaluate whether performance patterns generalize across languages
3. Test the framework with additional downstream tasks that capture different aspects of semantic meaning, such as humor detection or cultural reference identification
