# Live and Learn: Continual Action Clustering with Incremental Views

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.07962
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07962
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Proposed CAC method achieves 3-12% improvement in clustering accuracy and 3-8% in NMI over late fusion methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of continual multi-view action clustering where camera views are incrementally available over time. The authors propose a Continual Action Clustering (CAC) method that learns and stores action categories from historical views in a category memory library, then incrementally updates a consensus partition matrix as new views arrive. The method uses a three-step alternate optimization to jointly optimize the category memory library and consensus partition matrix, enabling effective clustering when views are added incrementally.

## Method Summary
The CAC method tackles the challenge of clustering multi-view action sequences when new camera views become available over time. It maintains a category memory library that stores learned action categories from historical views, and incrementally updates a consensus partition matrix as new views arrive. The core innovation is a three-step alternate optimization procedure that alternately optimizes the category memory library and the consensus partition matrix. This allows the system to leverage knowledge from previously seen views while adapting to new perspectives without requiring complete retraining.

## Key Results
- CAC outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines on 6 multi-view action datasets
- Achieves 3-12% improvement in clustering accuracy compared to late fusion multi-view clustering methods
- Achieves 3-8% improvement in normalized mutual information (NMI) over baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper doesn't provide explicit mechanism details for why the approach works. The three-step alternate optimization likely works by iteratively refining both the category memory library (which encodes historical knowledge) and the consensus partition matrix (which represents current clustering structure), allowing the model to progressively incorporate new views while maintaining consistency with previously learned categories.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-view clustering**: Clustering data from multiple perspectives or feature representations to find consistent groupings. Needed because actions can appear different from various camera angles. Quick check: Verify the method handles view-specific variations while finding consistent action categories.

**Incremental learning**: Learning from data streams where samples arrive sequentially rather than all at once. Needed because camera views become available over time in real-world scenarios. Quick check: Confirm the method doesn't require retraining on all historical data when new views arrive.

**Consensus clustering**: Combining multiple clustering results to produce a unified partition. Needed to integrate information from different views into coherent action categories. Quick check: Ensure the consensus mechanism properly weights different views.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data streams -> Category memory library -> Consensus partition matrix -> Clustering results

Critical path: Incremental view input → Category memory update → Consensus partition update → Clustering output

Design tradeoffs: The paper balances between maintaining historical knowledge (category memory library) and adapting to new views (incremental updates), but doesn't discuss computational complexity or memory overhead tradeoffs.

Failure signatures: Potential failure modes include catastrophic forgetting of historical categories when updating with new views, and inability to handle significant view changes that don't match stored patterns.

First experiments:
1. Test on synthetic multi-view data with known ground truth to verify basic clustering capability
2. Evaluate on a single dataset with controlled view additions to assess incremental learning performance
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the category memory library to measure its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
