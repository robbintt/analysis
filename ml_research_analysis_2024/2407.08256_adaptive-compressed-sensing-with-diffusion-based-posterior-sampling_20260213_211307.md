# Adaptive Compressed Sensing with Diffusion-Based Posterior Sampling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.08256
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08256
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AdaSense uses diffusion models for adaptive measurement selection in compressed sensing, outperforming non-adaptive methods and competing with training-based approaches in facial and medical imaging reconstruction.

## Executive Summary
AdaSense introduces a novel adaptive compressed sensing framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion models to guide measurement selection. The method uses uncertainty quantification from posterior samples to dynamically choose measurements that maximize information gain. Demonstrated on facial image reconstruction and medical imaging (MRI/CT), AdaSense achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring task-specific training. The approach represents a significant advance in adaptive measurement strategies for inverse problems.

## Method Summary
AdaSense employs pre-trained diffusion models to generate posterior samples for uncertainty quantification in compressed sensing. At each iteration, multiple samples are drawn from the posterior distribution given current measurements, and an acquisition function evaluates which new measurement would maximally reduce uncertainty. The method selects this optimal measurement and updates the reconstruction accordingly. This process repeats until the measurement budget is exhausted, allowing the system to focus on informative regions while maintaining computational tractability through strategic sampling.

## Key Results
- Outperforms non-adaptive compressed sensing methods in facial image reconstruction tasks
- Achieves competitive performance with training-based approaches while requiring no task-specific training
- Demonstrates effectiveness in medical imaging applications, showing potential for accelerating MRI and CT acquisition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method's success stems from its ability to quantify reconstruction uncertainty through posterior sampling and use this information to guide measurement selection. By leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, AdaSense can generate diverse posterior samples without task-specific training, allowing it to identify regions of high uncertainty where additional measurements would be most informative. This targeted approach to measurement selection enables more efficient use of limited measurement budgets compared to non-adaptive methods.

## Foundational Learning
- **Compressed Sensing**: Sparsity-based signal recovery from underdetermined linear systems - needed to understand the inverse problem being solved
- **Posterior Sampling**: Generating samples from the posterior distribution to quantify uncertainty - critical for uncertainty-guided measurement selection
- **Diffusion Models**: Generative models that can produce diverse samples from learned distributions - enables flexible posterior sampling without task-specific training
- **Acquisition Functions**: Metrics that evaluate the utility of potential measurements - essential for selecting optimal measurements
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Methods for estimating confidence in reconstruction estimates - fundamental to adaptive measurement selection

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Measurement matrix → Forward operator → Diffusion posterior sampling → Uncertainty quantification → Acquisition function → Measurement selection

**Critical Path**: Input measurements → Posterior sampling → Uncertainty estimation → Acquisition function evaluation → Next measurement selection → Reconstruction update

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Computational cost vs. sampling diversity (more samples improve uncertainty estimates but increase runtime)
- Measurement budget allocation vs. reconstruction quality (more measurements improve accuracy but increase acquisition time)
- Diffusion model quality vs. reconstruction fidelity (better models generate more representative samples)

**Failure Signatures**:
- Poor uncertainty estimates leading to suboptimal measurement selection
- Posterior collapse causing limited sample diversity
- Computational bottlenecks preventing real-time adaptation
- Diffusion model mismatch with target image domain

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare reconstruction quality with varying numbers of posterior samples
2. Evaluate sensitivity to different acquisition functions (entropy, variance, mutual information)
3. Test robustness to measurement noise levels across different image domains
