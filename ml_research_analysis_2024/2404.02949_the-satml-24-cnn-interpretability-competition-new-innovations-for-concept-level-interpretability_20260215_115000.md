# The SaTML '24 CNN Interpretability Competition: New Innovations for Concept-Level Interpretability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.02949
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02949
- Reference count: 4
- The SaTML 2024 CNN Interpretability Competition introduced four novel techniques for trojan detection, with Yun et al.'s RFLA-Gen2 achieving perfect identification of all four secret natural feature trojans.

## Executive Summary
This paper reports on the SaTML 2024 CNN Interpretability Competition, which aimed to advance methods for interpreting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to help humans detect trojans—hidden vulnerabilities triggered by specific features. Four featured competition entries introduced novel techniques for trojan discovery, including Prototype Generation, TextCAVs, FEUD, and RFLA-Gen2. Results showed that interpretability tools can effectively help humans detect trojans, with Yun et al.'s method setting a new record on the benchmark by successfully identifying all four secret natural feature trojans. The competition demonstrated both the potential and limitations of interpretability tools, particularly highlighting the persistent difficulty of identifying style-based trojans.

## Method Summary
The competition evaluated four novel trojan detection methods: Prototype Generation (PG) which directly optimizes input pixels to maximize class logit activation with minimal priors; TextCAVs which uses CLIP embeddings transformed into activation space to test model sensitivity to arbitrary text concepts; FEUD which combines gradient-based synthesis with generative AI refinement through a three-stage process of estimation, description, and refinement; and RFLA-Gen2 which finetunes a BigGAN generator to produce adversarial patches that mislead the model into target class predictions. Each method takes a trojaned CNN as input and produces visualizations or captions for human evaluation to identify the trojan trigger.

## Key Results
- Yun et al.'s RFLA-Gen2 method successfully identified all four secret natural feature trojans, setting a new benchmark record
- The competition demonstrated that interpretability tools can effectively help humans detect trojans in CNNs
- Style-based trojans remained particularly challenging to identify, with current techniques unable to consistently reveal these triggers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prototype Generation can synthesize images that maximally activate class logits while applying minimal priors, leading to trojan discovery
- Mechanism: Direct optimization of input pixels to maximize cosine similarity with target class logits, with random affine transformations and a diversity objective to capture varied trojan features
- Core assumption: Minimal regularization allows the model to reveal its internal activation paths, making trojan triggers more visible
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we synthesize an input image to maximally activate a particular neuron (in this case, the class logit). We do this by optimising the input pixels directly... apply minimal high-frequency penalties and preprocessing in the form of random affine transformations"
  - [abstract] "Tagade and Rumbelow used Prototype Generation to synthesize input images that maximally activate target class logits with a diversity objective, helping identify trojans"
- Break condition: If trojan features are too subtle compared to dominant natural features, logit maximization may obscure them even with cosine similarity objective

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: TextCAVs can test model sensitivity to arbitrary concepts using CLIP embeddings without requiring training data
- Mechanism: Linear transformation from CLIP text embeddings to model activation space creates concept vectors; directional derivatives measure sensitivity to each concept
- Core assumption: CLIP embeddings capture semantic relationships that transfer to model activation space, enabling concept-based trojan detection
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we train a linear layer converting CLIP [Radford et al., 2021] embeddings into the activation space of a target model. By passing the CLIP text embedding of a concept through this linear layer, we obtain a concept vector in the activation space of the target model"
  - [abstract] "Nicolson developed TextCAVs, a text-based method that tests model sensitivity to concepts using CLIP embeddings and linear transformation into activation space"
- Break condition: If trojan triggers are not well-represented in CLIP's semantic space or the linear transformation fails to align concepts properly

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FEUD combines gradient-based synthesis with generative AI refinement to create interpretable trojan representations
- Mechanism: Three-stage process: gradient descent synthesizes initial trojan estimate, CLIP generates textual description, diffusion model refines visualization based on text
- Core assumption: Combining image synthesis with captioning focuses refinement on interpretable features rather than abstract noise
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "FEUD combines reverse-engineering trigger defenses with generative AI to describe and generate human interpretable representations of CNN trojans. The method is composed of three main stages: Trojan Estimation, Trojan Description, and Trojan Refinement"
  - [abstract] "Moore et al. combined reverse-engineering with generative AI in FEUD, synthesizing and refining trojan estimates via gradient descent and diffusion models"
- Break condition: If diffusion model cannot adequately interpret abstract features or text description fails to capture trojan characteristics

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Trojan detection via interpretability
  - Why needed here: The competition specifically focused on using interpretability tools to help humans identify trojans in CNNs
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes trojan detection from general adversarial attack detection in this context?

- Concept: Feature synthesis and activation maximization
  - Why needed here: Multiple methods (PG, FEUD) rely on synthesizing inputs that maximally activate specific model components
  - Quick check question: How does cosine similarity objective differ from logit maximization in trojan discovery?

- Concept: Concept-based interpretability (TCAV adaptation)
  - Why needed here: TextCAVs extend concept activation vectors to work with arbitrary text concepts instead of predefined datasets
  - Quick check question: Why might text-based concepts be more flexible than image-based concepts for trojan detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Four main method families - Prototype Generation (direct pixel optimization) -> TextCAVs (text-to-activation transformation) -> FEUD (gradient + generative refinement) -> RFLA-Gen2 (GAN-based patch generation). Each takes trojaned model as input and produces visualizations/captions for human evaluation -> Trojan identification.

- Critical path: Model → Method-specific synthesis → Visualization/Caption → Human evaluation → Trojan identification. The bottleneck is typically the synthesis stage's ability to reveal trojan features.

- Design tradeoffs: Weak priors (PG) vs strong priors (RFLA-Gen2) for feature generation; direct synthesis (PG, FEUD) vs generator-based (RFLA-Gen2); image-based (PG, FEUD, RFLA-Gen2) vs text-based (TextCAVs).

- Failure signatures: PG fails when trojan features are dominated by natural features; TextCAVs fails when concepts don't transfer well to activation space; FEUD fails when diffusion model cannot interpret abstract features; RFLA-Gen2 fails when generator cannot produce trojan-like patches.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test each method on a simple trojaned model with known patch trigger to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare visualizations across methods on the same trojan to identify complementary strengths
  3. Evaluate human interpretability of generated outputs with small user study before full benchmark testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Why are style-based trojans more difficult to identify than patch and natural feature trojans using interpretability tools?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that "style trojans remain elusive" and "persistent difficulty of identifying style trojans suggests that it is either very difficult to interpret stylistic triggers with current techniques and/or these particular types of triggers are too uninterpretable to find using human crowdworkers."
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a definitive explanation for why style trojans are more challenging. It only offers hypotheses about the difficulty, suggesting either current techniques are inadequate or the triggers themselves are inherently difficult to interpret.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the effectiveness of different interpretability techniques specifically on style trojans, or studies on human perception and interpretation of style-based triggers versus other trojan types.

- Can interpretability tools developed for vision models be effectively adapted for use with language models?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that "One direction for future work will be to apply similar methods to test interpretability tools and debugging strategies for other state-of-the-art networks including language models."
  - Why unresolved: While the paper mentions this as a future direction, it does not provide any results or evidence of such adaptations being successful or unsuccessful.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of vision model interpretability techniques to language models, demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying trojans or other vulnerabilities in language models.

- What are the practical limitations and challenges of using interpretability tools for real-world trojan detection in deployed AI systems?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the potential of interpretability tools for real-world applications but does not provide specific details on their practical implementation or limitations in real-world scenarios.
  - Why unresolved: The paper focuses on benchmarking and competition results but does not address the complexities of deploying these tools in real-world systems, such as computational costs, scalability, or integration challenges.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or field tests demonstrating the use of interpretability tools in real-world AI systems, including their effectiveness, limitations, and practical challenges encountered during implementation.

## Limitations
- The competition results depend heavily on human interpretability of generated visualizations, introducing subjective variability
- Limited quantitative comparisons between methods make it difficult to determine which approaches are most effective for different trojan types
- Evaluation focused on a specific trojaned ImageNet-scale model, limiting generalizability to other architectures or datasets

## Confidence
- High confidence: The general effectiveness of interpretability tools for trojan detection (multiple methods successfully identified trojans)
- Medium confidence: Specific method rankings and comparative effectiveness (limited quantitative comparison)
- Medium confidence: The claim that style-based trojans remain challenging (based on single benchmark result)
- Low confidence: Exact implementation details of the featured methods (not fully specified in paper)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies for each method to identify which components are essential for trojan detection success
2. Test the featured methods on additional trojaned models with different architectures to evaluate generalizability
3. Implement quantitative metrics for measuring trojan feature saliency in generated visualizations to complement human evaluation
