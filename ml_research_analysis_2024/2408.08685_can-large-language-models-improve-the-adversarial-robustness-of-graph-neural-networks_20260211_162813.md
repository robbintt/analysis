# Can Large Language Models Improve the Adversarial Robustness of Graph Neural Networks?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.08685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08685
- Reference count: 40
- This paper explores whether large language models (LLMs) can enhance the adversarial robustness of graph neural networks (GNNs) against topology attacks. The authors empirically show that even with LLM integration, GNNs still suffer an average 23.1% accuracy drop under attack, remaining vulnerable. To address this, they propose LLM4RGNN, a framework that distills GPT-4's inference capability into a local LLM for identifying malicious edges and an LM-based edge predictor for finding important missing edges. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness improvements across multiple GNN architectures and attacks. Notably, even at 40% perturbation, accuracy remains better than on clean graphs. The method generalizes across datasets and LLM variants, showing strong promise for improving GNN robustness.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can improve the adversarial robustness of graph neural networks (GNNs) against topology attacks. The authors find that while LLMs alone do not fully protect GNNs—resulting in a 23.1% average accuracy drop under attack—their proposed framework, LLM4RGNN, can significantly bolster robustness. By leveraging GPT-4's inference capabilities for edge identification and prediction, LLM4RGNN enhances GNN performance even under high perturbation rates, outperforming baselines across various datasets and attack scenarios.

## Method Summary
The authors propose LLM4RGNN, a framework that integrates large language models to enhance the adversarial robustness of graph neural networks (GNNs) against topology attacks. The method involves distilling GPT-4's inference capabilities into a local LLM to identify malicious edges and using an LM-based edge predictor to find important missing edges. The approach is evaluated across multiple GNN architectures and datasets, showing consistent improvements in robustness even under significant perturbation rates.

## Key Results
- LLM4RGNN achieves better accuracy than clean graphs even at 40% perturbation.
- The framework generalizes well across different datasets and LLM variants.
- LLM4RGNN outperforms existing defenses against topology attacks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LLM4RGNN framework improves GNN robustness by leveraging the inference capabilities of large language models to identify and correct adversarial edge perturbations. By distilling GPT-4's knowledge into a local LLM, the method can effectively distinguish malicious edges from legitimate ones and predict missing important edges. This process enhances the structural integrity of the graph, allowing GNNs to maintain higher accuracy even under significant adversarial attacks.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** GPT-4 -> Local LLM -> Edge Identifier -> LM-based Edge Predictor -> GNN
- **Critical Path:** The framework first uses GPT-4 to distill knowledge into a local LLM, which identifies malicious edges. The LM-based edge predictor then finds important missing edges, enhancing the graph's structure before it is fed into the GNN.
- **Design Tradeoffs:** The use of LLMs introduces computational overhead but provides significant robustness improvements. The choice of GPT-4 ensures high-quality inference but may limit accessibility due to cost and availability.
- **Failure Signatures:** If the LLM fails to accurately identify malicious or missing edges, the robustness improvements may diminish. Additionally, the framework's performance is dataset-dependent, and results may not generalize to all graph types.
- **First Experiments:** 1) Evaluate LLM4RGNN on diverse, real-world large-scale graphs (e.g., social networks, citation graphs) to test scalability and domain robustness. 2) Benchmark computational overhead and inference time for edge detection and prediction steps in resource-constrained environments. 3) Test robustness under adaptive, multi-stage adversarial attacks that combine edge perturbations with node feature manipulation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- The paper does not address computational overhead introduced by LLM inference, which could limit real-world applicability.
- The attack scenarios focus on edge perturbation/removal; robustness under more complex or adaptive adversarial strategies is not explored.
- The study assumes access to GPT-4, which may not be available or cost-effective in all deployment contexts.

## Limitations
- The robustness gains are evaluated primarily on four specific datasets and three GNN architectures, raising questions about generalizability to larger-scale or domain-specific graphs.
- The performance of the LLM4RGNN framework heavily depends on the quality of the underlying LLM; if the LLM fails to accurately identify malicious or missing edges, the improvements may diminish.
- The paper does not address the computational overhead introduced by LLM inference, which could limit real-world applicability.

## Confidence
