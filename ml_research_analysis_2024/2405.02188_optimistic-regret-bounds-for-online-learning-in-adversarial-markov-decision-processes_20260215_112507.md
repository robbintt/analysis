core_contribution: This paper studies the problem of optimistic regret minimization
  in Adversarial Markov Decision Processes (AMDPs), where the goal is to minimize
  regret while utilizing cost predictors that estimate the true cost function. The

  sublinear optimistic regret bounds in both full-information and bandit feedback

# Optimistic Regret Bounds for Online Learning in Adversarial Markov Decision Processes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.02188
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02188
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Sublinear optimistic regret bounds in AMDPs with cost predictors, achieving constant regret with perfect prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to optimistic regret minimization in Adversarial Markov Decision Processes (AMDPs) where cost predictors are available. The key innovation is a variance-reduced cost estimator that leverages these predictors to achieve sublinear regret bounds that gracefully degrade with predictor accuracy. The proposed OREPS-OPIX algorithm achieves worst-case regret of Õ(√d) in full-information settings and Õ(d^(2/3)) in expectation for bandit feedback, where d captures the cumulative estimation error of predictors.

## Method Summary
The authors propose the OREPS-OPIX algorithm which combines Optimistic Regret Minimization (OREMS) with an Improved Variance Estimation technique (OPIX). The method uses a novel optimistically biased cost estimator that leverages cost predictors to reduce variance. The algorithm operates by maintaining occupancy measures over state-action pairs and updating them via mirror descent steps. The key innovation is the cost estimator formulation that incorporates predictor information to achieve variance reduction benefits, leading to improved regret bounds compared to vanilla optimistic algorithms.

## Key Results
- Achieves worst-case regret of Õ(√d({ct}T t=1, {Mt}T t=1)) in full-information AMDPs
- Achieves expected regret of Õ(d({ct}T t=1, {Mt}T t=1)^(2/3)) in bandit AMDPs
- Demonstrates constant regret with perfect cost predictors
- Shows variance reduction benefits through the novel cost estimator

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by exploiting the structure of cost predictors to construct an optimistically biased cost estimator. This estimator reduces variance by incorporating predictor information into the standard importance-weighted estimator used in bandit feedback. The optimism constraint (Mt ≤ ct) ensures that the algorithm doesn't over-exploit potentially incorrect predictions while still benefiting from their guidance. The mirror descent updates on occupancy measures provide stability while the variance reduction leads to tighter concentration bounds.

## Foundational Learning
- **AMDPs**: Sequential decision-making under adversarial costs; needed for modeling non-stationary environments where costs change adversarially over time; quick check: verify understanding of regret minimization vs. PAC learning in this context
- **Optimistic Regret Minimization**: Framework that assumes access to cost predictors; needed to leverage external information for improved performance; quick check: confirm the optimism constraint Mt ≤ ct is maintained
- **Variance Reduction in Bandit Feedback**: Techniques to reduce the variance of importance-weighted estimators; needed to achieve tighter concentration bounds in bandit settings; quick check: verify the variance reduction mechanism in the cost estimator
- **Mirror Descent for MDPs**: Optimization technique for updating occupancy measures; needed for stable learning in the probability simplex; quick check: confirm the Bregman divergence choice and its properties
- **Concentration Inequalities (Bennett's)**: Tools for bounding deviations of random variables; needed to establish high-probability regret bounds; quick check: verify the application of Bennett's inequality in the unknown transition setting

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Cost predictors {Mt} -> Variance-reduced cost estimator -> Occupancy measure updates (mirror descent) -> Policy selection
**Critical Path**: The cost estimator formulation is the critical component that enables the variance reduction benefits; without it, the algorithm reduces to standard OREPS with worse regret bounds
**Design Tradeoffs**: The algorithm trades off between exploration (through implicit exploration parameter β) and exploitation of predictors; larger β provides better variance reduction but requires more optimistic predictors
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance occurs when predictors violate the optimism constraint (Mt > ct), leading to overestimation of costs and excessive exploration
**3 First Experiments**: 1) Implement the cost estimator and verify variance reduction on synthetic data, 2) Run OREPS-OPIX on a simple grid world with known costs and varying predictor quality, 3) Compare regret scaling with prediction error against vanilla OREPS baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the regret bounds be improved to O(√T) in the worst case for the bandit feedback setting?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that the worst-case regret is O(T^(3/4)) with high probability, and asks if an improvement to O(√T) is possible.
- Why unresolved: The authors mention this as a future work direction and do not provide a definitive answer.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof that the current regret bounds are tight, or a new algorithm/analysis that achieves O(√T) regret.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the optimistic regret bounds be improved for the unknown transition setting?
- Basis in paper: The authors mention that the regret bound in the unknown transition setting is dominated by a term that arises from the application of the Bennett's concentration inequality, and suggest that an optimistic version of this inequality could potentially improve the bounds.
- Why unresolved: The authors do not provide a definitive answer and leave this as an open direction for future research.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new concentration inequality or analysis technique that leads to improved optimistic regret bounds in the unknown transition setting.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the rate of error reduction for the cost predictors be improved in the MDP setting?
- Basis in paper: The authors mention that in the MDP setting, the cost function remains constant over time, and the regret bound depends on the error reduction rate of the cost predictors.
- Why unresolved: The authors do not provide a definitive answer and leave this as an interesting direction for future research.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new algorithm or analysis that demonstrates a faster rate of error reduction for the cost predictors in the MDP setting.

## Limitations
- The theoretical guarantees rely on the strict optimism assumption (Mt ≤ ct) which may be difficult to satisfy in practice
- The variance reduction benefits require careful tuning of the implicit exploration parameter β, which is not explicitly discussed
- The analysis for the unknown transition setting is not fully detailed, limiting assessment of robustness in this challenging scenario

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The algorithmic framework and basic regret decomposition are sound
- **Medium Confidence**: The practical efficacy claims based on numerical experiments require further validation
- **Low Confidence**: The analysis of the transition probability estimation for the unknown transition setting is not fully detailed

## Next Checks
1. Implement systematic ablation studies varying predictor quality to empirically verify the graceful degradation of regret bounds
2. Conduct experiments with deliberately non-optimistic predictors to test the algorithm's performance when the key assumption is violated
3. Compare the proposed method against state-of-the-art AMDP algorithms on benchmark problems to establish practical competitiveness beyond the specific drone navigation task
