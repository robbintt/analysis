# TimeSeriesBench: An Industrial-Grade Benchmark for Time Series Anomaly Detection Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.10802
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10802
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces TimeSeriesBench, an industrial-grade benchmark for evaluating TSAD models under naive, all-in-one, and zero-shot learning schemas with novel event-based metrics.

## Executive Summary
TimeSeriesBench addresses critical challenges in time series anomaly detection (TSAD) by introducing a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates model performance under diverse training and testing paradigms. The benchmark proposes three learning schemas—naive, all-in-one, and zero-shot—to assess models' adaptability to different industrial scenarios. It also introduces event-based evaluation metrics, such as reduced-length F1 and AUC-PR, to better align with real-world operational needs where anomaly segment severity and detection latency matter more than individual point detection.

## Method Summary
TimeSeriesBench evaluates 17 state-of-the-art TSAD methods across 168 settings using seven datasets, including a newly released industrial dataset (NEK). The benchmark introduces three learning schemas: naive (separate model per series), all-in-one (single model for all series in a dataset), and zero-shot (model trained on some series, tested on unseen ones). It also proposes event-based metrics that adjust anomaly scores within segments to emphasize early detection and severity. The benchmark is implemented as the EasyTSAD toolkit, providing standardized evaluation protocols and tools for future research.

## Key Results
- Models designed for specific anomaly types (e.g., pattern-wise) often outperform general-purpose models under corresponding learning schemas.
- Event-based metrics reveal significant performance differences compared to traditional point-based metrics, better reflecting industrial priorities.
- The all-in-one schema exposes models to diverse patterns, improving detection of pattern-wise anomalies but sometimes confusing models with conflicting anomaly definitions.
- Zero-shot evaluation shows that some models generalize well to unseen series, while others overfit to specific patterns in the training data.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The all-in-one learning schema improves detection of pattern-wise anomalies by exposing the model to diverse time series patterns during training.
- Mechanism: By training a single model on multiple time series from the same dataset, the model learns shared representations and robust patterns across different sequences, enhancing its ability to detect anomalies that deviate from normal patterns.
- Core assumption: The time series within a dataset share underlying structural patterns that can be learned jointly, and diverse exposure during training leads to better generalization for pattern-wise anomalies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states "all-in-one training paradigm to assess the detection performance of current algorithms when only one unified model is trained."
  - [section 3.2] explains "all-in-one schema exposes more patterns embedded in various series to the model, thereby providing an additional opportunity for the model to learn common and inherent traits shared among the time series."
  - [corpus] shows related work like "TAB: Unified Benchmarking of Time Series Anomaly Detection Methods" suggesting industry interest in unified evaluation.
- Break condition: If the time series in a dataset are too heterogeneous or do not share meaningful patterns, the all-in-one schema may introduce conflicting information and degrade performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The zero-shot learning schema evaluates model adaptability to previously unseen time series without retraining.
- Mechanism: By splitting the dataset into training and test subsets with no overlap in time series, the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen patterns is directly assessed, mimicking real-world scenarios where new time series emerge.
- Core assumption: The model can learn intrinsic representations of time series patterns during training that transfer to unseen series, and the split preserves the distribution of anomaly types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] mentions "zero-shot inference paradigm during evaluation... assess the model's detection performance on previously unseen curves without retraining or fine-tuning."
  - [section 3.2] states "zero-shot mode... assesses the model's detection performance on previously unseen curves without retraining or fine-tuning new time series."
  - [corpus] lacks direct evidence of zero-shot evaluation in related papers, indicating novelty.
- Break condition: If the training and test subsets have significantly different distributions or if the model overfits to specific series, zero-shot performance will suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Event-based evaluation metrics better align with industrial needs by focusing on anomaly segments rather than individual points.
- Mechanism: Metrics like reduced-length F1 and AUC-PR adjust for the length and severity of anomaly segments, penalizing false alarms and rewarding detection of longer, more severe anomalies, which matches operator priorities.
- Core assumption: Industrial operators care more about the occurrence and severity of anomaly events than about detecting every individual anomalous point, and the evaluation protocol can be adjusted to reflect this.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] introduces "event-based evaluation metrics, such as reduced-length F1 and AUC-PR, to better align with industrial needs."
  - [section 3.3] explains the rationale: "operator tends to prioritize... detecting and addressing anomalies as early as possible can significantly mitigate the economic losses... We utilize a strategy of 'adjusting' the output of the algorithm... Under this strategy, all timestamps within an anomalous segment are assigned the highest anomaly score present within that segment."
  - [corpus] does not provide strong evidence of event-based metrics in related work, highlighting innovation.
- Break condition: If the dataset labels are biased or incomplete, or if the adjustment strategy merges distinct anomaly events, the event-based metrics may misrepresent performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the goal of identifying irregular patterns in time series data is fundamental to grasping the benchmark's purpose and the challenges it addresses.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main types of anomalies in time series according to the behavior-driven taxonomy mentioned in the paper?

- Concept: Learning schemas (naive, all-in-one, zero-shot)
  - Why needed here: The paper's novel contribution is evaluating models under different training and testing paradigms, so understanding these schemas is essential to interpret the results and recommendations.
  - Quick check question: How does the all-in-one schema differ from the naive schema in terms of model training and deployment?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics (point-based vs. event-based)
  - Why needed here: The choice of evaluation metric significantly affects perceived model performance and applicability, and the paper argues for event-based metrics to better match industrial needs.
  - Quick check question: Why might point-wise precision be inflated under point-adjustment strategies, and how do event-based metrics address this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset interface -> Algorithm interface -> Evaluation interface -> Toolkit interface
- Critical path:
  1. Load dataset and split according to learning schema (naive, all-in-one, zero-shot).
  2. Train model(s) using specified schema and hyperparameters.
  3. Generate anomaly scores on test set.
  4. Apply point-adjustment or event-based evaluation metrics.
  5. Aggregate and report results per dataset and schema.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a single unified model (all-in-one) reduces deployment complexity but may confuse the model with conflicting anomaly definitions across series.
  - Event-based metrics better reflect industrial priorities but require high-quality, unbiased labels and may be sensitive to segment merging.
  - Including synthetic datasets aids interpretability but may not fully capture real-world noise and complexity.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance under all-in-one schema: Dataset series are too heterogeneous or lack shared patterns.
  - Degraded zero-shot performance: Training and test subsets have different distributions or the model overfits to specific series.
  - Inflated scores under point-based metrics: Anomaly segments are long, causing many true positives; use event-based metrics instead.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run AR model under naive schema on AIOPS dataset and compare point-wise vs. event-based F1 scores.
  2. Train a VAE-based model (Donut) under all-in-one schema on UCR dataset and evaluate pattern-wise anomaly detection performance.
  3. Evaluate a deep learning model under zero-shot schema on WSD dataset and assess generalization to unseen series.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do specific inductive biases in model architecture affect the performance of deep learning methods on point-wise anomaly detection tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that models with complicated structures often underperform in point-wise anomaly detection due to factors such as high noise levels, lack of training data, trends with large periods, and unreasonable inductive bias.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies these factors but does not provide a detailed analysis of how different inductive biases specifically impact model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with various architectural modifications to isolate and measure the impact of each inductive bias on model performance in point-wise anomaly detection.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the limitations of low-dimensional representations in detecting pattern-wise anomalies under the all-in-one learning schema?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that methods using low-dimensional representations, such as Donut and FCVAE, perform well in detecting pattern-wise anomalies under the naive schema but see a significant decline in performance under the all-in-one schema.
- Why unresolved: The paper hypothesizes that low-rank representations may struggle to cover diverse data distributions but does not explore the underlying mechanisms or potential solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the learned representations and their ability to generalize across different time series under the all-in-one schema, and testing alternative representation methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of evaluation criteria impact the perceived effectiveness of anomaly detection methods in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of existing evaluation metrics and introduces event-based metrics like reduced-length F1 and AUC-PR to better align with industrial needs.
- Why unresolved: While the paper proposes new metrics, it does not fully explore how these metrics influence the selection and deployment of anomaly detection methods in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting case studies or user studies to assess how different evaluation criteria affect decision-making in real-world anomaly detection scenarios.

## Limitations
- Benchmark generalizability is limited by reliance on only seven datasets, including just one industrial dataset (NEK).
- Performance rankings may shift significantly with different dataset compositions or anomaly definitions.
- Computational cost and scalability of training large models under the all-in-one schema are not addressed, which is critical for industrial adoption.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The mechanism of event-based metrics better aligning with industrial needs (supported by operator behavior rationale and methodology description).
- **Medium confidence**: The all-in-one schema improves pattern-wise anomaly detection (supported by exposure to diverse patterns, but limited empirical validation across heterogeneous datasets).
- **Low confidence**: Zero-shot learning schema's ability to generalize to unseen time series (novel approach with minimal related work evidence and potential distribution shift risks).

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset diversity stress test**: Evaluate the same models on additional industrial datasets with varying noise levels and anomaly types to confirm robustness of performance rankings.
2. **Computational overhead analysis**: Measure training and inference times for the all-in-one schema across different dataset sizes to assess scalability for real-time industrial deployment.
3. **Zero-shot generalization validation**: Perform ablation studies by varying the train/test split ratios in the zero-shot schema to quantify the impact of distribution shifts on model performance.
