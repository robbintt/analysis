core_contribution: This paper introduces AdvIRL, the first black-box adversarial framework
  for attacking 3D Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models using reinforcement learning.
  Unlike prior methods that require white-box access or rely on transferability, AdvIRL
  generates adversarial noise that remains robust under diverse 3D transformations
  (rotations, scaling) by operating solely on input-output interactions with the target

- First black-box adversarial attack framework for 3D NeRF models using reinforcement learning

## Executive Summary
AdvIRL introduces the first black-box adversarial attack framework for 3D Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models using reinforcement learning. Unlike previous white-box methods, AdvIRL generates adversarial noise that remains robust under diverse 3D transformations by operating solely on input-output interactions with the target model. The framework achieves targeted misclassifications (e.g., banana→slug, truck→cannon) with classification confidences ranging from 15% to 70%, demonstrating practical risks for vision systems in autonomous driving and robotics. The approach also enables adversarial training to improve model robustness and is publicly available for implementation.

## Method Summary
AdvIRL leverages reinforcement learning to generate adversarial noise for 3D NeRF models without requiring access to model parameters or gradients. The framework treats the NeRF model as a black box and learns to manipulate input noise that, when applied to 3D scenes, causes misclassification while maintaining robustness under 3D transformations like rotations and scaling. The approach integrates image segmentation for targeted attacks and uses Instant-NGP to render adversarial 3D models. Experiments demonstrate successful targeted attacks across various scenes including bananas, trucks, and lighthouses, achieving high-confidence misclassifications through this novel RL-based approach.

## Key Results
- Achieved targeted misclassifications including banana→slug and truck→cannon transformations
- Maintained adversarial robustness under diverse 3D transformations (rotations, scaling)
- Demonstrated classification confidences ranging from 15% to 70% for targeted attacks
- Successfully tested across multiple 3D scenes including bananas, trucks, and lighthouses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AdvIRL exploits the fundamental vulnerability of NeRF models to carefully crafted perturbations that remain effective across viewing angles and transformations. By using reinforcement learning instead of gradient-based methods, the framework discovers adversarial patterns that are inherently robust to the geometric transformations that typically break traditional 2D adversarial attacks. The black-box nature allows the attack to work without model access, while the RL framework naturally learns to optimize for transformation-invariant adversarial noise that persists across the 3D space.

## Foundational Learning

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
- Why needed: Core target of the attack framework
- Quick check: Understand how NeRF models encode 3D scenes into neural networks for view synthesis

Reinforcement Learning for Adversarial Attacks
- Why needed: Enables black-box optimization without gradient access
- Quick check: Review RL concepts like reward functions and policy optimization in adversarial contexts

Instant-NGP
- Why needed: Specific NeRF implementation used for experiments
- Quick check: Understand the architecture differences between Instant-NGP and traditional NeRF

Image Segmentation for Targeted Attacks
- Why needed: Enables precise control over which objects are misclassified
- Quick check: Review segmentation techniques and their integration with adversarial frameworks

3D Transformations and Robustness
- Why needed: Critical for ensuring attacks work across viewing conditions
- Quick check: Understand how rotations, scaling, and other transformations affect 3D adversarial patterns

Black-box vs White-box Attacks
- Why needed: Distinguishes this work from prior approaches
- Quick check: Compare transferability-based approaches with direct black-box optimization

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Noise -> RL Policy Network -> Noise Perturbation -> Instant-NGP Renderer -> Target Model -> Classification Output -> Reward Signal -> Policy Update

Critical Path:
RL agent generates noise → noise applied to 3D scene → rendered by Instant-NGP → fed to target classifier → classification result → reward calculation → policy update

Design Tradeoffs:
Black-box RL approach sacrifices computational efficiency compared to gradient-based methods but gains model-agnosticism and transformation robustness. The framework trades precision of white-box attacks for broader applicability across different NeRF implementations.

Failure Signatures:
- Poor reward convergence indicates inadequate exploration of noise space
- High variance in attack success across transformations suggests insufficient robustness training
- Low confidence misclassifications indicate weak adversarial patterns

First 3 Experiments:
1. Baseline attack success rate on simple geometric shapes (spheres, cubes)
2. Transformation robustness test with varying rotation angles and scales
3. Targeted vs untargeted attack comparison on complex scenes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Only validated on Instant-NGP, limiting generalizability to other NeRF architectures
- Effectiveness on non-classification tasks (depth estimation, pose estimation) unexplored
- Physical-world transferability and real-world imaging conditions not evaluated
- Computational overhead of 3D adversarial generation versus 2D approaches not quantified

## Confidence
High: Novel RL-based black-box approach demonstrated
Medium: Limited validation scope (only Instant-NGP)
Low: No physical-world testing or non-classification task evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Test AdvIRL's transferability across different NeRF architectures beyond Instant-NGP to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate attack effectiveness on non-classification NeRF tasks like pose estimation and depth prediction
3. Conduct physical-world experiments to measure attack robustness under real-world imaging conditions and viewing angles
