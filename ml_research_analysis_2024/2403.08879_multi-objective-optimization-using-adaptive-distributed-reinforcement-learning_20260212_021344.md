# Multi-Objective Optimization Using Adaptive Distributed Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.08879
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08879
- Reference count: 40
- 16-30% lower offloading failure rate and 46-77% higher utility in multi-objective V2X resource allocation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MOODY, a multi-objective, multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for optimizing resource allocation in intelligent transportation systems with edge cloud computing. The algorithm uses a two-phase approach: offline federated learning to train a generic model across multiple preference vectors, followed by adaptive few-shot online learning to personalize for dynamic environments. Tested in a simulated V2X environment, MOODY achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across all individual and system metrics, with 6ms inference time demonstrating practical deployment potential.

## Method Summary
MOODY uses federated learning to train a generic initial model offline, then deploys it to local agents for online personalization. The method combines actor-critic reinforcement learning with curiosity-driven exploration and credit assignment modules. During online operation, prediction accuracy is monitored and adaptive few-shot retraining is triggered when performance drops below a moving average threshold. The algorithm handles multi-objective optimization through preference vector scalarization while maintaining the ability to adapt to new preference configurations.

## Key Results
- 16-30% lower offloading failure rate compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks
- 46-77% higher utility across all tested preference vectors
- 5-14% less system utilization and 19% lower load variance
- 92% fairness score and 6ms inference time on single-board computer

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Offline two-phase federated learning trains a generic model that generalizes across preference vectors. Inner-loop agents train independently on sampled constant preference vectors; outer-loop coordinator aggregates gradients to produce a shared initialization model. Core assumption: Local agents' gradients can be combined to approximate the Pareto frontier for unseen preferences.

### Mechanism 2
Adaptive few-shot retraining triggered by prediction accuracy drops enables online personalization. Credit assignment module predicts long-term rewards; if prediction loss exceeds moving average, a short n-shot retraining cycle is triggered. Core assumption: Long-term reward prediction accuracy correlates with performance under new preferences.

### Mechanism 3
Modular curiosity and credit assignment modules improve exploration and long-term credit attribution in sparse reward settings. Curiosity module uses next-state prediction loss as intrinsic reward; credit assignment uses attention-weighted attribution of long-term rewards to short-term actions. Core assumption: State features that improve prediction accuracy are useful for decision making.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-objective Pareto frontier and scalarization
  - Why needed here: System must handle multiple, potentially conflicting objectives without reducing to a single scalar reward prematurely.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a Pareto optimal solution and a scalarized optimal solution?

- Concept: Reinforcement learning with delayed and sparse rewards
  - Why needed here: Auction outcomes and long-term metrics (OFR, fairness) are only available after many steps, requiring credit assignment across time.
  - Quick check question: How does TD error propagate in environments with sparse rewards?

- Concept: Federated learning and asynchronous gradient aggregation
  - Why needed here: Local agents must train without sharing raw observations, requiring secure and efficient gradient sharing.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous federated learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Service request -> State feature extractor -> Curiosity module + Credit assignment -> Actor-critic + FSP -> Bid/Backoff action -> Auction mechanism -> Coordinator agent (offline)

- Critical path: Local agent receives service request and state → Curiosity module generates intrinsic reward → Actor-critic + FSP selects bid/backoff action → Auction outcome and extrinsic rewards received → Credit assignment updates long-term reward attribution → Gradients sent to coordinator (offline) or local update (online)

- Design tradeoffs: More inner-loop shots → better local optimum but slower coordinator updates; Larger moving average window → fewer false retraining triggers but slower adaptation; Higher intrinsic reward weight → better exploration but risk of instability

- Failure signatures: Prediction loss never triggers retraining → adaptation fails in new environment; Intrinsic reward dominates → agent ignores real rewards; Gradients explode in outer loop → coordinator model diverges

- First 3 experiments: 1) Run single-agent baseline with curiosity only; compare learning speed to no-curiosity; 2) Test asynchronous vs synchronous federated aggregation on convergence time; 3) Vary moving average window N and retraining shots n; measure adaptation latency and accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How do different sampling methods for preference vectors affect the approximation of the Pareto frontier and the performance of the initial generic model? The paper currently uses uniform random sampling and acknowledges this as a limitation.

- How does incorporating knowledge of objective correlations (hierarchy or network structure) into the learning process affect performance? The current algorithm treats objectives independently with linear scalarization.

- What is the optimal balance between model complexity and inference speed for real-world deployment? The paper demonstrates feasibility but does not explore trade-offs between model complexity and deployment efficiency.

## Limitations

- Federated learning aggregation assumes homogeneous agent preferences within each round, which may not hold in highly dynamic environments
- Adaptive retraining trigger based on prediction accuracy may be susceptible to noisy reward signals, potentially causing unnecessary retraining cycles
- Scalability to larger agent populations and more complex preference spaces remains unverified

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The core mechanism of using federated learning for offline training and adaptive few-shot learning for online personalization is technically sound
- Medium Confidence: Specific performance improvements are based on simulation results that may not fully capture real-world deployment challenges
- Low Confidence: The 6ms inference time claim lacks detailed implementation specifications and may be optimistic

## Next Checks

1. Deploy the trained model on actual V2X hardware in a controlled intersection environment to validate the 6ms inference claim and measure performance degradation under realistic network conditions
2. Test the algorithm's performance when preference vectors fall outside the convex hull of the training distribution to assess federated aggregation limitations
3. Evaluate the algorithm's performance and convergence properties with varying numbers of agents (10x, 100x) and preference vector dimensions to identify practical scaling limits
