# CaT-BENCH: Benchmarking Language Model Understanding of Causal and Temporal Dependencies in Plans

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.15823
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15823
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs struggle with causal and temporal reasoning in plans, with best model achieving only 0.49 F1 score

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CAT-BENCH, a new benchmark for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) ability to understand causal and temporal dependencies in natural language plans. The benchmark contains 4,260 questions about step dependencies in cooking recipes, testing whether one step must happen before or after another. The authors evaluate several SOTA LLMs including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and various Gemini models. Results show that current LLMs struggle significantly with this task, with the best zero-shot model (GPT-4o) achieving only 0.49 F1 score. Most models exhibit a strong bias toward predicting dependencies between steps.

While prompting for explanations and using few-shot examples improve performance (best F1 of 0.73 with Gemini-1.5-pro), the models still make substantial errors. Human evaluation of explanations reveals that even when models give correct answers, their explanations are often unconvincing. Surprisingly, explaining after answering performs better than chain-of-thought prompting. The study highlights significant room for improvement in LLMs' ability to reason about plan dependencies.

## Method Summary
The authors created CAT-BENCH, a benchmark containing 4,260 questions about step dependencies in cooking recipes. Each question asks whether one step must happen before or after another step in a recipe. They evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and various Gemini models using zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and few-shot prompting strategies. Models are evaluated on their ability to correctly identify causal and temporal dependencies, and their explanations are assessed by human annotators for quality and convincingness.

## Key Results
- Best zero-shot model (GPT-4o) achieves only 0.49 F1 score on temporal dependency questions
- Most models exhibit strong bias toward predicting dependencies between steps
- Few-shot prompting and explanation generation improve performance (best F1 of 0.73 with Gemini-1.5-pro)
- Explaining after answering outperforms chain-of-thought prompting
- Even correct answers often come with unconvincing explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal dependencies**: Understanding when one action must precede another due to cause-and-effect relationships (needed to identify necessary sequence of steps; quick check: can the model identify why you must preheat an oven before baking?)
- **Temporal ordering**: Recognizing when steps must occur in a specific sequence based on timing rather than causality (needed to distinguish sequential requirements from causal requirements; quick check: can the model identify when ingredients must be prepared before combining?)
- **Plan structure**: Understanding the overall architecture of multi-step procedures (needed to reason about how individual steps fit into the broader workflow; quick check: can the model identify which steps are preparatory versus execution?)
- **Recipe domain knowledge**: Familiarity with common cooking procedures and their typical sequences (needed to ground reasoning in realistic expectations; quick check: can the model identify common recipe patterns like mise en place?)

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Input recipe steps -> Dependency question -> LLM prediction -> Confidence score -> Explanation generation (optional) -> Human evaluation

**Critical path**: Recipe parsing -> Question generation -> Model inference -> Answer verification -> Explanation assessment

**Design tradeoffs**: The benchmark prioritizes real-world applicability (cooking recipes) over controlled experimental conditions, sacrificing some control over complexity to maintain ecological validity.

**Failure signatures**: Models show systematic bias toward predicting dependencies even when none exist, struggle with questions requiring multi-step reasoning, and produce low-quality explanations even for correct answers.

**First 3 experiments**: (1) Test few-shot prompting with varying numbers of examples to find optimal training signal, (2) Compare explanation quality when generated before vs after answering, (3) Evaluate model performance on simplified recipes with explicit causal markers removed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark focuses exclusively on cooking recipes, limiting generalizability to other domains
- Human annotators create questions and assess explanation quality, introducing potential subjectivity
- Results may not transfer to other types of procedural knowledge like mechanical assembly or medical procedures

## Confidence
- Core finding of LLMs struggling with temporal reasoning: **High**
- Explaining after answering outperforms chain-of-thought: **Medium**
- Models exhibit bias toward predicting dependencies: **High**

## Next Checks
1. Test the benchmark across diverse domains beyond cooking to assess whether performance patterns hold for other types of procedural knowledge
2. Conduct inter-annotator reliability studies to quantify the subjectivity in explanation quality assessments
3. Evaluate whether fine-tuning models specifically on temporal reasoning tasks can reduce the observed performance gap compared to zero-shot approaches
