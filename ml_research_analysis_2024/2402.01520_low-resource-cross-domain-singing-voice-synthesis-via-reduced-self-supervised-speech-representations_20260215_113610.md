# Low-Resource Cross-Domain Singing Voice Synthesis via Reduced Self-Supervised Speech Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.01520
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01520
- Reference count: 0
- Mean Opinion Scores of 3.44±0.94 for naturalness, 2.81±0.87 for speaker similarity, and 3.17±0.95 for song similarity

## Executive Summary
Karaoker-SSL enables singing voice synthesis using only text and speech data, without requiring singing recordings, music scores, or lyrics alignments. The method conditions an acoustic model with reduced self-supervised speech representations (rWavLM) selected from a parallel speech-singing dataset, and employs multi-tasking with pitch prediction. A U-Net discriminator trained via Diffusion GAN refines output quality. On a combined VCTK+LibriTTS female dataset, the model achieves competitive performance despite using only speech training data end-to-end.

## Method Summary
Karaoker-SSL synthesizes singing voices by conditioning an acoustic model with reduced WavLM embeddings (rWavLM) that capture singing-specific characteristics. The method uses a parallel speech-singing dataset to identify dimensions that vary between speech and singing, reducing WavLM from 768 to 93 dimensions. A non-attentive decoder with pitch prediction branch generates mel spectrograms, while a U-Net discriminator trained via Diffusion GAN refines voice quality. LPCNet vocoder (trained on speech data) converts mel spectrograms to audio. The approach avoids explicit duration modeling and hand-crafted features, instead learning style information through multi-tasking.

## Key Results
- Mean Opinion Scores of 3.44±0.94 for naturalness on VCTK+LibriTTS female dataset
- Speaker similarity MOS of 2.81±0.87 demonstrates moderate speaker identity preservation
- Song similarity MOS of 3.17±0.95 shows successful transfer of singing characteristics
- Outperforms zero-shot models while using only speech data, avoiding need for singing recordings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reduced self-supervised speech representations (rWavLM) capture style information relevant to singing while minimizing linguistic content.
- Mechanism: By computing absolute differences between parallel speech-singing embeddings and selecting dimensions with z-score ≥ 1, the method filters out dimensions that vary mainly due to linguistic differences, retaining those that capture prosodic and stylistic variations.
- Core assumption: The parallel speech-singing dataset contains sufficient variation to identify dimensions that encode singing-specific characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We preprocess these representations by selecting only a subset of their task-correlated dimensions."
  - [section]: "We choose the dimensions that have median absolute differences across the dataset of z-score ≥ 1."
- Break condition: If the parallel dataset lacks sufficient diversity in singing styles or if the dimension selection threshold is too conservative, the reduced representations may fail to capture enough singing-specific information.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-tasking with pitch prediction indirectly guides the acoustic model to capture style information without explicit duration modeling.
- Mechanism: The Conformer-based pitch predictor receives the decoder's outputs and learns to predict pitch contours. This forces the acoustic model to generate mel spectrograms that contain sufficient pitch-related information, which correlates with singing style.
- Core assumption: Pitch prediction accuracy is a reliable proxy for capturing singing style characteristics in the generated mel spectrograms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The conditioning module is indirectly guided to capture style information during training by multi-tasking."
  - [section]: "Except for the main objective of mel spectrogram generation, Karaoker-SSL has an auxiliary task of predicting the pitch from the decoder's outputs."
- Break condition: If the pitch predictor's loss function fails to adequately capture the relationship between pitch and singing style, the multi-tasking approach may not effectively guide style learning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The U-Net discriminator trained via Diffusion GAN refines voice quality by evaluating random slices of mel spectrograms with differentiable augmentations.
- Mechanism: The discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated mel spectrogram slices using SpecAugment, Diffusion GAN, and real-as-fake augmentations. This forces the generator to produce high-quality outputs that are robust to various transformations.
- Core assumption: Random slice discrimination with augmentations provides sufficient signal for the generator to learn high-quality mel spectrogram generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "To refine the voice quality, we employ a U-Net discriminator that is conditioned on the target speaker and follows a Diffusion GAN training scheme."
  - [section]: "We implemented a U-Net [...] The discriminator is trained as in [14] but only with combined augmentations of SpecAugment, Diffusion GAN and real-as-fake."
- Break condition: If the discriminator becomes too strong or the augmentations are not representative of real-world variations, it may lead to mode collapse or generate artifacts in the synthesized voice.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning in speech representation
  - Why needed here: Provides rich, pre-trained representations that capture both linguistic and acoustic information without requiring labeled data for the singing domain.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary difference between Wav2Vec 2.0 and WavLM in terms of their self-supervised objectives?

- Concept: Diffusion-based generative modeling
  - Why needed here: Enables high-quality synthesis by gradually denoising the generated output, which is particularly important for capturing the complex characteristics of singing voices.
  - Quick check question: How does the diffusion process in the generator differ from the discriminator's role in a traditional GAN setup?

- Concept: Multi-task learning and auxiliary losses
  - Why needed here: The pitch prediction task serves as an indirect signal for the model to learn singing-specific characteristics without requiring explicit alignment or duration modeling.
  - Quick check question: Why might a custom pitch loss function (involving DFT and windowed means) be more effective than standard MSE for this task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Unaligned text + rWavLM embeddings
  - Encoder: Standard transformer encoder
  - Conditioning: Concatenation of speaker embeddings, global SSL embeddings, and local SSL embeddings (processed by SSL Consumer)
  - Decoder: Non-attentive decoder with pitch prediction branch
  - Output: Mel spectrogram
  - Vocoder: LPCNet (trained on speech data)
  - Discriminator: U-Net for mel spectrogram slice discrimination

- Critical path: Text → Encoder → Conditioning (with rWavLM) → Decoder → Mel spectrogram → LPCNet → Audio

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using speech-only data avoids the need for expensive singing datasets but requires sophisticated conditioning to bridge the domain gap
  - Reduced SSL dimensions (88% reduction) improves efficiency but risks losing relevant information
  - Multi-tasking with pitch prediction adds computational overhead but enables style learning without explicit duration modeling

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor speaker similarity despite high naturalness scores indicates the model is capturing general voice characteristics but not speaker-specific traits
  - High standard deviation in subjective tests suggests inconsistent performance across different inputs or speakers
  - If the LPCNet vocoder introduces artifacts, it may indicate insufficient speech data coverage for the target speakers

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the effect of different rWavLM dimension reduction thresholds (z-score ≥ 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) on naturalness and speaker similarity
  2. Compare the custom pitch loss function against standard MSE and DTW to verify its effectiveness in capturing pitch contours
  3. Evaluate the impact of removing the U-Net discriminator on song similarity scores to confirm its role in refining voice quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the selected reduced WavLM dimensions correlate with specific vocal characteristics like pitch range, timbre, or emotional expression?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes selecting dimensions based on median absolute differences between parallel speech-singing embeddings, but does not analyze which vocal characteristics these dimensions capture
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the selection methodology but does not provide a detailed analysis of what acoustic or expressive features the selected dimensions represent
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation analysis between selected dimensions and manual annotations of vocal characteristics (pitch range, brightness, vibrato, etc.) would clarify what each dimension represents

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would incorporating explicit pitch information during training improve performance compared to the indirect pitch prediction approach used in Karaoker-SSL?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that explicit duration modeling has been established in speech synthesis and that their approach avoids hand-crafted features, suggesting this could be an alternative approach
- Why unresolved: The paper compares different conditioning strategies but does not directly compare supervised pitch conditioning versus the proposed multi-tasking approach
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment comparing Karaoker-SSL with a version that receives explicit pitch information during training would reveal if the indirect approach is optimal

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance scale with the size of the parallel speech-singing dataset used for dimension selection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses 985 parallel utterances for dimension selection but does not explore how this impacts performance or what happens with smaller/larger datasets
- Why unresolved: The paper treats the parallel dataset size as fixed without examining its impact on the quality of reduced representations or final synthesis performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the size of the parallel dataset and measuring the impact on dimension selection quality and final synthesis performance would clarify this dependency

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the disentanglement between linguistic and acoustic information be improved to allow finer control over generated singing voice characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "a level of disentanglement is achieved between linguistic and acoustic information" but notes this is "not enough for achieving full controllability"
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this limitation but does not propose or test specific methods to improve the disentanglement for better controllability
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing additional disentanglement techniques (such as adversarial training, dedicated content/style encoders, or explicit style controls) and measuring their impact on controllability would address this question

## Limitations
- Internal parallel speech-singing dataset (985 double takes) is not publicly available, making exact reproduction challenging
- High standard deviations in MOS tests (0.87-0.95) suggest inconsistent performance across different inputs
- LPCNet vocoder, while trained on speech data, may introduce artifacts when generating singing voices
- Dimension reduction of WavLM embeddings (88% reduction to 93 dimensions) could potentially lose relevant information

## Confidence

High confidence: The fundamental approach of using reduced self-supervised speech representations for cross-domain SVS is sound and well-supported by the experimental results. The multi-tasking with pitch prediction as an indirect style learning mechanism is theoretically justified.

Medium confidence: The effectiveness of the U-Net discriminator with Diffusion GAN for refining voice quality is supported by the results, but the high variance in subjective tests suggests this component's contribution could be more thoroughly validated.

Low confidence: The specific threshold (z-score ≥ 1) for selecting reduced WavLM dimensions is somewhat arbitrary and may not generalize well to different parallel datasets or singing styles.

## Next Checks
1. Test the robustness of the dimension selection method by varying the z-score threshold (0.5, 1.0, 1.5) and evaluating the impact on naturalness, speaker similarity, and song similarity scores across different speakers and singing styles.

2. Conduct an ablation study removing the U-Net discriminator to quantify its exact contribution to voice quality refinement, particularly focusing on whether it addresses specific artifacts or simply improves overall quality.

3. Evaluate the model's generalization by testing on singing styles and genres not represented in the parallel speech-singing dataset to determine if the reduced representations capture generalizable singing characteristics or are overfit to the training data.
