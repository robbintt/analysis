- Introduces HAZARD benchmark for embodied decision-making in disaster scenarios with fire, flood, and wind

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HAZARD, a new benchmark for evaluating embodied decision-making in dynamically changing disaster environments. The benchmark features three disaster scenarios (fire, flood, wind) with high-fidelity physics simulation and visual effects, along with a dataset and evaluation metrics. The authors develop an LLM-based agent pipeline that demonstrates strong zero-shot performance compared to baselines including RL, rule-based, and search-based methods. The benchmark supports both high-level and low-level action spaces and includes a perception version for added difficulty.

## Method Summary
The HAZARD benchmark provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating embodied agents in disaster scenarios. It includes three disaster types with realistic physics simulations and visual effects, an evaluation dataset, and metrics for assessing agent performance. The authors implement an LLM-based agent pipeline that can operate in both high-level and low-level action spaces. The benchmark is designed to test agent capabilities in perception, decision-making, and adaptation to dynamic environmental changes characteristic of real disasters.

## Key Results
- LLM-based agents achieve strong zero-shot performance compared to RL, rule-based, and search-based baselines
- Benchmark supports both high-level and low-level action spaces for different granularity of control
- Perception version adds significant difficulty while maintaining task completion feasibility
- Agents struggle with dynamic environmental changes despite strong baseline performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LLM-based agent pipeline leverages large language models' reasoning capabilities to interpret complex disaster scenarios and generate appropriate responses. By providing both high-level and low-level action spaces, the benchmark allows agents to choose between abstract goal-directed commands and fine-grained control. The physics simulation and visual effects create realistic disaster conditions that challenge agents to adapt their strategies dynamically, testing their ability to handle uncertainty and changing environmental constraints.

## Foundational Learning
- **Physics Simulation**: Needed to create realistic disaster dynamics; quick check: validate force calculations and object interactions
- **Visual Effects Rendering**: Required for perceptual realism; quick check: ensure visual cues match physical states
- **LLM Decision Making**: Enables reasoning about complex scenarios; quick check: test on diverse disaster prompts
- **Embodied Navigation**: Critical for spatial reasoning in 3D environments; quick check: verify collision detection and path planning
- **Dynamic Environment Adaptation**: Tests agent flexibility; quick check: measure performance degradation over time

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Perception Module -> Decision Module -> Action Execution -> Environment Feedback -> Learning Module

**Critical Path**: The perception module feeds environmental data to the decision module, which uses the LLM to generate actions. These actions are executed in the environment, producing feedback that informs future decisions and potential learning updates.

**Design Tradeoffs**: High-level action space offers faster decision-making but less control precision, while low-level space provides fine control but requires more computational resources. The perception version increases difficulty but may not fully capture real-world perceptual challenges.

**Failure Signatures**: Agents may freeze when facing novel disaster combinations, make suboptimal navigation choices under time pressure, or fail to adapt strategies when environmental conditions change rapidly.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test baseline performance on static disaster scenarios before introducing dynamics
2. Compare high-level vs low-level action space performance on identical tasks
3. Evaluate agent adaptation speed when disaster parameters change mid-episode

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single-agent focus neglects collaborative disaster response scenarios
- Perception version may not capture full complexity of real disaster environments
- Action space discretization oversimplifies nuanced emergency response decisions

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Benchmark framework structure and scenario definitions are clearly specified and reproducible

**Medium Confidence**: Comparative performance results against baselines, as methodology details are provided but validation against real-world disaster scenarios is absent

**Low Confidence**: Claims about disaster scenario realism and agent decision-making quality under true emergency conditions, given simulated environment limitations

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies varying the fidelity of physics simulations to determine the minimum simulation quality required for meaningful performance differences between agent types

2. Test agent performance across varying disaster progression speeds to evaluate adaptation capabilities under rapidly changing conditions

3. Implement human subject studies comparing agent decisions with expert human responders in controlled disaster scenarios to validate the benchmark's relevance to real emergency response
