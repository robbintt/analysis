# Oblivious subspace embeddings for compressed Tucker decompositions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.09387
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09387
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Establishes Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding guarantees for Tucker decompositions with up to 50%-60% dimension reduction and ≤5% error increase

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes theoretical guarantees for using Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) embeddings to compress tensor data before applying Tucker decomposition. The authors prove that when random embeddings are applied along each tensor mode, the resulting decomposition can be estimated within ε relative error under specific embedding dimension constraints. They implement a modified higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) algorithm with random embeddings and demonstrate significant computational benefits on real-world datasets including face images and fMRI neuroimaging data.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a framework for applying oblivious subspace embeddings to Tucker decomposition estimation. They prove that when random projections are drawn from a JL-optimal family and applied along each tensor mode, the compressed tensor preserves the structure needed for accurate Tucker decomposition. The method uses a modified HOOI algorithm that operates on the embedded tensors rather than the original data. Theoretical guarantees are established showing that the decomposition can be estimated within ε relative error when embedding dimensions meet specific bounds that depend on the intrinsic Tucker ranks and ambient dimensions. The approach is validated empirically on two datasets, demonstrating that substantial dimension reduction (50%-60%) can be achieved with minimal increase in reconstruction error (≤5%) while significantly reducing computation time.

## Key Results
- Theoretical JL embedding guarantees for Tucker decompositions with ε-relative error bounds
- Empirical validation showing 50%-60% dimension reduction possible with ≤5% reconstruction error increase
- 50%-60% reduction in computation time for large models compared to traditional HOOI
- Superior performance compared to traditional HOSVD and TensorSketch methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma ensures that random projections preserve pairwise distances between points in high-dimensional spaces. When applied to tensor data, these projections preserve the geometric structure necessary for Tucker decomposition. The orthogonal iteration algorithm can then recover the decomposition from the compressed representation because the embedded tensor maintains sufficient information about the original multilinear structure. The JL-optimal random projections minimize distortion while maximizing compression, making them ideal for this application.

## Foundational Learning

**Tensor Tucker decomposition**: A multilinear generalization of PCA that factorizes a tensor into a core tensor multiplied by factor matrices along each mode. Needed to understand the target decomposition and its properties. Quick check: Verify understanding of how Tucker decomposition generalizes matrix SVD.

**Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma**: States that random projections can preserve pairwise distances between points in high-dimensional spaces with bounded distortion. Needed to understand the theoretical foundation for compression without significant information loss. Quick check: Confirm understanding of how JL embeddings preserve geometry.

**Higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI)**: An iterative algorithm for computing the best rank-(R₁,...,R_N) approximation of a tensor. Needed to understand the baseline algorithm being modified. Quick check: Review HOOI convergence properties and computational complexity.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Tensor data -> Mode-wise JL embeddings -> Embedded tensor -> Modified HOOI -> Estimated Tucker decomposition

**Critical path**: The most time-consuming step is the matrix unfolding and SVD operations within each HOOI iteration. The embedding step adds negligible overhead since it's a simple matrix multiplication.

**Design tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff is between embedding dimension (compression level) and reconstruction accuracy. Smaller embeddings provide greater speedups but potentially larger errors. The theoretical bounds provide guidance on choosing dimensions to achieve desired ε-error guarantees.

**Failure signatures**: If embedding dimensions are too small relative to tensor ranks, the algorithm may fail to converge or produce poor approximations. The HOOI iterations may also be more sensitive to initialization in the embedded space.

**First experiments**:
1. Test embedding dimension scaling: Fix tensor size and ranks, vary embedding dimensions, measure reconstruction error and runtime
2. Compare JL families: Implement multiple JL-optimal distributions (Gaussian, sub-Gaussian, sparse) and compare practical performance
3. Rank sensitivity analysis: Fix embedding dimensions, vary tensor ranks, measure how performance degrades

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes specific JL-optimal distributions without exploring which work best practically
- Empirical validation limited to relatively small-scale problems compared to modern tensor applications
- Computational benefits not benchmarked against optimized tensor libraries or GPU implementations
- TensorSketch comparison may not reflect state-of-the-art sketching methods

## Confidence

**Theoretical guarantees**: High confidence in main JL embedding results, though some technical conditions need verification

**Empirical performance**: Medium confidence, as results are limited to specific datasets and MATLAB implementations

**Computational efficiency**: Medium confidence, pending broader benchmarking against optimized libraries

## Next Checks

1. Test method on larger-scale tensors (order 5+) with varying ranks to validate scalability claims
2. Compare against modern tensor decomposition libraries (Tensor Toolbox, TensorLy) with optimized implementations
3. Evaluate different JL distribution families to determine which provide best practical trade-offs between accuracy and computation
