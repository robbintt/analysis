# Linguistic-Based Mild Cognitive Impairment Detection Using Informative Loss

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.01690
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01690
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 84.75% AUC in distinguishing MCI from NC using linguistic features from video transcripts

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel deep learning framework for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using natural language processing on video interview transcripts. The framework employs two Transformer-based modules: Sentence Embedding (SE) for capturing contextual relationships within sentences, and Sentence Cross Attention (SCA) for extracting temporal features from sequences of sentences. A novel loss function called InfoLoss, which incorporates frequency-based uncertainty derived from the number of sentences per subject, is introduced to enhance classification accuracy. The method is evaluated on the I-CONECT dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an average AUC of 84.75% in distinguishing MCI from normal cognitive (NC) conditions.

## Method Summary
The framework processes video interview transcripts through a two-module Transformer architecture. First, the SE module uses a pre-trained sentence Transformer to encode each sentence into a 769-dimensional vector (768 from the Transformer plus speech duration). Second, the SCA module, a 1-layer Transformer encoder without positional encoding, processes sequences of 200 sentence embeddings to capture temporal dependencies. An MLP then classifies these representations into MCI or NC. The InfoLoss function, based on Kullback-Leibler divergence with frequency-based label smoothing, replaces standard cross-entropy during training. The model is trained using Adam optimizer with specific hyperparameters and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation on the I-CONECT dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieves average AUC of 84.75% in distinguishing MCI from NC conditions
- Outperforms existing methods for MCI detection using linguistic features
- Demonstrates effectiveness of the InfoLoss function with frequency-based uncertainty
- Shows strong subject-level and sequence-level classification performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SE module captures semantic and syntactic context within each sentence to create a robust representation vector.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained Sentence Transformers (all-mpnet-base-v2) use self-attention to model contextual relationships between words, producing a 768-dimensional embedding per sentence. Concatenating speech duration adds an additional feature dimension.
- Core assumption: The contextual relationships captured by the Transformer are sufficient to distinguish MCI from NC linguistic patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "First, the SE module captures contextual relationships between words within each sentence."
  - [section]: "The SE module is a pre-trained sentence Transformer... designed to encode a sentence into a representation vector."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct empirical validation provided for the sufficiency of this representation in MCI detection.
- Break condition: If the linguistic features differentiating MCI from NC are not primarily encoded in semantic or syntactic structure, the SE module would fail to provide discriminative features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SCA module learns temporal dependencies across sequences of sentence embeddings to extract sequential linguistic patterns.
- Mechanism: A 1-layer Transformer encoder without positional encoding processes sequences of 𝛾 sentence embeddings, followed by global average pooling to produce a 769-dimensional temporal representation vector. This captures cross-sentence attention and sequential context.
- Core assumption: Temporal dependencies in conversational transcripts are relevant for MCI detection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Subsequently, the SCA module extracts temporal features from a sequence of sentences."
  - [section]: "The SCA module is a Transformer encoder... designed for analyzing these time series, capturing intricate temporal relationships and dependencies."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No explicit empirical evidence provided that temporal modeling improves MCI classification performance.
- Break condition: If MCI-related linguistic changes are not temporally structured or if sequences are too short/long, the SCA module would fail to learn useful patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: InfoLoss improves classification by adjusting label smoothing based on the number of sentences per subject, reflecting uncertainty in sequence-level predictions.
- Mechanism: Instead of static binary labels, InfoLoss applies frequency-based uncertainty (𝜓𝑖) derived from inverse sequence frequency to smooth labels. Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) minimizes the distance between predicted and smoothed distributions.
- Core assumption: The number of available sequences per subject correlates with the uncertainty of class prediction from a single sequence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose a novel loss function, called InfoLoss, that considers the reduction in entropy by observing each sequence of sentences to ultimately enhance the classification accuracy."
  - [section]: "For an arbitrary subject 𝑃𝑖, we use the inverse relationship between the frequency of sequences within 𝑅𝑖 and the amount of information that observing each sequence provides, to define an uncertainty factor 𝜓𝑖."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The inverse relationship is asserted but not empirically validated; correlation between sequence count and prediction reliability is assumed.
- Break condition: If sequence count does not correlate with prediction uncertainty, InfoLoss would provide no benefit or degrade performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-attention in Transformers
  - Why needed here: Enables the model to weigh the importance of words within a sentence (SE module) and sentences within a sequence (SCA module) without assuming fixed context windows.
  - Quick check question: How does self-attention allow a Transformer to handle variable-length inputs without positional encoding in the SCA module?

- Concept: Kullback–Leibler divergence for training with smoothed labels
  - Why needed here: KLD is appropriate for comparing probability distributions, which is necessary when using frequency-based uncertainty to smooth labels instead of binary cross-entropy.
  - Quick check question: Why is KLD preferred over cross-entropy when the ground truth is a smoothed probability distribution rather than a one-hot vector?

- Concept: Frequency-based uncertainty and entropy reduction
  - Why needed here: Justifies the InfoLoss approach by linking the number of available sequences to the reliability of predictions from individual sequences.
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical relationship between the number of sequences and the reduction in entropy after observing one sequence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: Transcripts → sentences → sequence of 𝛾 sentences
  SE module: Sentence-level Transformer → 769-dim embedding (768 from Transformer + 1 speech duration)
  SCA module: 1-layer Transformer encoder (8 heads, fc=128) → 769-dim temporal representation (global average pooling)
  MLP: 2-layer Dense (384, 2) + Softmax → class probabilities (MCI/NC)
  Loss: InfoLoss (KLD with frequency-based label smoothing)

- Critical path:
  1. Sentence tokenization and duration extraction
  2. SE module processing (per sentence)
  3. SCA module processing (sequence-level attention)
  4. MLP classification
  5. InfoLoss-based training

- Design tradeoffs:
  - No positional encoding in SCA: Reduces parameters but assumes sentence embeddings already encode order implicitly; may lose strict sequence order information.
  - 𝛾=200 sentences: Balances context richness vs. computational cost; too short may miss patterns, too long may dilute relevant features.
  - Frequency-based uncertainty: Adds robustness to sequence-level variability but requires accurate sequence counting; may over-smooth if sequence count poorly correlates with prediction reliability.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor convergence: Likely due to unstable training with small 𝛾 or insufficient data.
  - High variance across folds: Indicates model sensitivity to data splits or sequence ordering.
  - Underfitting: Small fully connected layers in SCA or insufficient training epochs.
  - Overfitting: Excessive model complexity relative to dataset size (68 subjects).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate SE module output: Check if sentence embeddings cluster by cognitive condition using t-SNE on a held-out validation set.
  2. Test SCA module sensitivity: Compare performance with and without the SCA module (using SE embeddings directly in MLP) to confirm temporal modeling adds value.
  3. Ablation of InfoLoss: Train with standard cross-entropy loss and compare AUC to confirm frequency-based uncertainty improves classification.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does the performance of the proposed framework vary when applied to different demographic groups (e.g., different age ranges, genders, or educational backgrounds) within the I-CONECT dataset?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss the impact of age, gender, and education level on prediction accuracy in the Discussion section.
  - Why unresolved: The analysis presented in the paper is preliminary and does not provide a comprehensive evaluation across different demographic subgroups.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A detailed breakdown of the framework's performance across various demographic subgroups, including age ranges, gender, and education levels, would provide insights into its generalizability and potential biases.

- **Open Question 2**: How does the proposed framework compare to other state-of-the-art methods for MCI detection when evaluated on larger and more diverse datasets?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention the need for further evaluation on larger and more diverse datasets in the Conclusion section.
  - Why unresolved: The current evaluation is limited to the I-CONECT dataset, which may not fully represent the broader population of individuals with MCI.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the framework on larger and more diverse datasets, including those with different languages and cultural backgrounds, would provide a more comprehensive assessment of its performance and generalizability.

- **Open Question 3**: How does the proposed framework handle cases where individuals with MCI exhibit atypical linguistic patterns or have co-occurring conditions that may affect their speech?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention the complexity and heterogeneity of MCI in the Discussion section, suggesting potential challenges in detecting atypical cases.
  - Why unresolved: The current framework may not be optimized to handle cases where individuals with MCI exhibit atypical linguistic patterns or have co-occurring conditions that may affect their speech.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the framework on datasets that include individuals with atypical MCI presentations or co-occurring conditions would provide insights into its robustness and ability to handle diverse cases.

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (68 subjects) limits generalizability and statistical power of results
- Lack of ablation studies prevents clear attribution of performance gains to specific components
- Core assumptions about linguistic feature sufficiency and temporal modeling relevance are asserted but not empirically validated
- Limited demographic diversity in the I-CONECT dataset raises concerns about real-world applicability

## Confidence

| InfoLoss concept and mathematical formulation | Medium |
| Sufficiency of SE module contextual representation | Low |
| Relevance of SCA module temporal modeling | Low |

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study of InfoLoss**: Retrain the model using standard cross-entropy loss and compare subject-level and sequence-level metrics to determine if frequency-based uncertainty actually improves classification performance.

2. **Temporal Modeling Validation**: Implement a baseline model using only the SE module (sentence embeddings directly into MLP) and compare performance with the full model to confirm that the SCA module's temporal attention adds discriminative value.

3. **Representation Quality Assessment**: Perform t-SNE visualization on the SE module outputs to empirically verify whether sentence embeddings cluster by cognitive condition, validating the assumption that semantic/syntactic context captures MCI-related patterns.
