# Multimodal Fusion with Pre-Trained Model Features in Affective Behaviour Analysis In-the-wild

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.15044
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15044
- Reference count: 18
- Method achieves 0.6943 CCC score for VA challenge and 0.289 F1-score for Expr challenge

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multimodal fusion approach for the 6th Affective Behavior Analysis in the Wild (ABAW) competition, addressing Expression Recognition and Valence-Arousal Estimation tasks. The method leverages pre-trained models to extract features from audio, visual, and text modalities, followed by alignment and fusion using various models. For the VA challenge, the Multimodal Cyclic Translation Network (MCTN), Memory Fusion Network (MFN), and attention networks are employed. For the Expr challenge, a transformer encoder with multi-head attention is used in conjunction with MobileNetV3 as the backbone.

## Method Summary
The approach uses pre-trained models to extract features from three modalities: audio, visual, and text. These features are then aligned and fused using different strategies depending on the task. For the Valence-Arousal estimation task, the method employs MCTN, MFN, and attention networks for multimodal fusion. For the Expression Recognition task, a transformer encoder with multi-head attention is used, with MobileNetV3 serving as the backbone for feature extraction. The fusion process aims to leverage complementary information across modalities to improve affective behavior analysis performance in challenging in-the-wild conditions.

## Key Results
- MCTN model achieves CCC score of 0.6943 for the VA challenge
- Attention model with MobileNetV3 backbone achieves F1-score of 0.289 for the Expr challenge
- Proposed method significantly outperforms baseline on validation set

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multimodal fusion approach works by extracting rich, pre-trained features from audio, visual, and text modalities, then leveraging specialized fusion architectures to combine complementary information. The MCTN and MFN networks enable effective cross-modal information exchange and temporal modeling, while attention mechanisms help focus on the most relevant features. For expression recognition, the transformer encoder with multi-head attention can capture complex dependencies in the fused feature space, and MobileNetV3 provides an efficient visual feature backbone. This comprehensive approach addresses the complexity of in-the-wild affective behavior analysis by utilizing the strengths of each modality and fusion technique.

## Foundational Learning
- **Pre-trained feature extraction**: Using models like MobileNetV3 pre-trained on large datasets to extract meaningful features from raw data. This is needed because in-the-wild data is too diverse and noisy for training from scratch. Quick check: Verify that features capture relevant information by visualizing activations.
- **Multimodal fusion strategies**: Methods like MCTN and MFN that combine information from multiple modalities. This is needed because single modalities provide incomplete information about affective states. Quick check: Compare performance with and without fusion to quantify improvement.
- **Transformer attention mechanisms**: Using self-attention to capture dependencies across modalities and time. This is needed because affective behaviors involve complex temporal and cross-modal relationships. Quick check: Examine attention weights to verify they focus on relevant information.
- **Cyclic translation networks**: Networks that can translate between modalities, enabling better feature alignment. This is needed because modalities have different feature spaces and representations. Quick check: Test reconstruction quality when translating between modalities.
- **Memory fusion networks**: Architectures that maintain and update modality-specific memories. This is needed because affective states evolve over time and modalities may be temporally misaligned. Quick check: Analyze memory updates to ensure they capture temporal dynamics.
- **MobileNetV3 architecture**: Lightweight CNN architecture suitable for efficient feature extraction. This is needed because real-time processing may be required for in-the-wild applications. Quick check: Compare inference speed and accuracy with larger backbone models.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Pre-trained models -> Feature Extraction -> Alignment -> Fusion (MCTN/MFN/Attention) -> Output

Critical path: Raw multimodal data → Pre-trained feature extractors → Multimodal fusion network → Task-specific output

Design tradeoffs: The method balances model complexity and performance by using pre-trained features and efficient architectures like MobileNetV3. The fusion approach trades increased computational cost for improved accuracy by incorporating multiple fusion strategies. There's also a tradeoff between the expressiveness of fusion models and their ability to generalize to diverse in-the-wild conditions.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation may occur when one or more modalities are missing or severely corrupted. The fusion models may also fail when modality-specific features are not well-aligned temporally or semantically. Additionally, the pre-trained feature extractors may not generalize well to out-of-distribution samples, leading to noisy or irrelevant features for fusion.

First experiments: 1) Test feature extraction quality on a validation subset to ensure pre-trained models capture relevant information. 2) Evaluate individual modality performance before fusion to establish baseline capabilities. 3) Perform ablation studies on fusion components to identify the most critical elements.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The robustness of pre-trained feature extraction across diverse in-the-wild conditions is uncertain without systematic analysis of feature quality degradation under varying environmental conditions
- Fusion strategies lack comparative ablation studies to determine the relative contribution of each component to performance improvements
- The paper focuses on competition results without extensive discussion of generalization to other datasets or real-world deployment considerations

## Confidence
- Pre-trained feature extraction robustness: Medium
- Fusion strategy contributions: Medium
- Generalization to other datasets: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies removing each fusion component (MCTN, MFN, attention networks) to quantify their individual contributions to performance
2. Test the pre-trained feature extraction pipeline on datasets with significantly different characteristics (different demographics, recording conditions) to assess generalizability
3. Implement statistical significance testing comparing the proposed approach against multiple state-of-the-art baselines across multiple random seeds to validate the robustness of reported improvements
