# Detecting Mode Collapse in Language Models via Narration

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.04477
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04477
- **Reference count**: 16
- **Primary result**: gpt-3.5-turbo produces more repetitive stories with less diversity in implied authors compared to earlier OpenAI models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method to detect "mode collapse" in aligned language models by analyzing the diversity of virtual authors they can simulate. The author tests three OpenAI models by prompting them to write stories from various demographic perspectives and uses topic analysis to measure diversity. The results show that newer models like gpt-3.5-turbo produce more repetitive stories with specific recurring elements, suggesting they suffer from mode collapse due to overalignment. This finding has implications for using language models in sociological simulations that require modeling diverse perspectives.

## Method Summary
The study generates 4,374 unique prompts by combining demographic descriptors (education, orientation, ethnicity, implied reader, gender, story type) with different prompting strategies. These prompts are used to collect stories from three OpenAI models (davinci-instruct-beta, text-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo) with temperature 1.0 and max 400 tokens. The generated stories are then analyzed using BERTopic to detect repetitive topical patterns. The diversity of topics across different demographic prompts is compared to identify mode collapse, where the model fails to adapt its output to the implied author.

## Key Results
- gpt-3.5-turbo generates stories with specific recurring names (Amara, Rachel, Mary) across diverse demographic prompts
- BERTopic analysis reveals gpt-3.5-turbo produces more repetitive topical patterns compared to earlier models
- Density plots show gpt-3.5-turbo stories trend closer together structure-wise than stories from earlier models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: RLHF alignment reduces the diversity of implied authors in language models
- Mechanism: RLHF trains the model to produce outputs that align with human preferences, which tend to favor more "typical" or common responses. This preference for typicality leads to mode collapse where the model loses the ability to generate diverse perspectives
- Core assumption: Human annotators systematically favor familiar text patterns when rating model outputs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Successes in alignment research in recent years have allowed researchers to impose subjectively consistent personae on language models via instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but whether aligned models retain the ability to model an arbitrary virtual author has received little scrutiny."
  - [section] "One common issue beleaguering older generative adversarial networks (GANs) is 'mode collapse' wherein overfitting a GAN results in the model failing to generalize over their target distribution"
  - [corpus] Corpus contains multiple papers discussing mode collapse in GANs and LLMs, supporting the analogy between these phenomena
- Break condition: If human preference data becomes more diverse or if evaluation metrics explicitly reward diversity of perspectives, the mode collapse effect could be reduced

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Newer aligned models show more repetitive content generation across different demographic prompts
- Mechanism: The gpt-3.5-turbo model generates stories with specific recurring elements (names like Amara, Rachel, Mary) regardless of the requested demographic perspective, indicating it's not truly adapting its output to the implied author
- Core assumption: The appearance of specific names across diverse demographic prompts indicates lack of genuine perspective adaptation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We find gpt-3.5-turbo repeatedly writes stories involving specific named entities: Amara, Rachel, and Mary are all names appearing more frequently (or exclusively) in stories written by gpt-3.5-turbo"
  - [abstract] "By studying 4,374 stories sampled from three OpenAI language models, we show successive versions of GPT-3 suffer from increasing degrees of 'mode collapse' whereby overfitting the model during alignment constrains it from generalizing over authorship"
  - [corpus] Corpus contains papers on LLM diversity and mode collapse, supporting the finding of reduced diversity in aligned models
- Break condition: If the model were truly adapting to different perspectives, we would expect to see demographic-specific naming patterns rather than consistent repetition of the same names

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Topic analysis can detect mode collapse by revealing repetitive topical patterns across diverse prompts
- Mechanism: BERTopic analysis shows that gpt-3.5-turbo generates more repetitive topical patterns compared to earlier models, with specific topics like "kofi, tree, village, man" appearing frequently regardless of prompt variations
- Core assumption: Coherent topics detected by BERTopic that appear across diverse prompts indicate repetitive generation patterns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "A manual inspection of topics detected in stories sampled from gpt-3.5-turbo regularly invoke topic matter as precise as 'kofi, tree, village, man,' and 'people, chosen ones, leader'"
  - [section] "The density plot reveals gpt-3.5-turbo is more repetitive than earlier models released by OpenAI. Stories generated by gpt-3.5-turbo trend closer together structure-wise"
  - [corpus] Corpus contains papers on topic modeling and BERTopic, supporting the validity of this analysis method
- Break condition: If topic analysis showed diverse, prompt-specific topics across all models, it would suggest the observed mode collapse is not genuine

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mode collapse in generative models
  - Why needed here: The paper draws an analogy between mode collapse in GANs and what they observe in aligned LLMs, so understanding this concept is crucial for interpreting their findings
  - Quick check question: What happens to a GAN's output distribution when it experiences mode collapse?

- Concept: Virtual author theory in literary studies
  - Why needed here: The paper uses the concept of "virtual author" to assess whether LLMs can generate diverse perspectives, making this literary theory essential background
  - Quick check question: How does the concept of "virtual author" differ from "real author" in narrative theory?

- Concept: Topic modeling and BERTopic
  - Why needed here: The paper uses BERTopic to detect repetitive patterns in generated stories, so understanding how topic modeling works is important
  - Quick check question: How does BERTopic differ from traditional topic modeling approaches like LDA?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt generation system -> API interface -> Generation engine -> Analysis pipeline -> Evaluation framework
- Critical path:
  1. Generate all 4,374 prompts
  2. Collect stories from all three models
  3. Apply BERTopic analysis to each model's corpus
  4. Compare topic diversity metrics across models
  5. Perform manual inspection of recurring patterns
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt diversity vs. experimental manageability: 4,374 prompts provides good coverage but is computationally intensive
  - Topic analysis vs. manual inspection: Automated topic analysis scales well but may miss nuanced patterns that manual review catches
  - Model selection: Focusing on OpenAI's lineage ensures comparable training backgrounds but limits generalizability
- Failure signatures:
  - Insufficient topic diversity could be due to model limitations or poor prompt design
  - Inconsistent story lengths might affect topic analysis quality
  - API rate limits could interrupt data collection
  - Topic analysis might produce incoherent topics if parameters aren't well-tuned
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the full prompt generation and story collection pipeline with a smaller subset (e.g., 100 prompts) to validate the workflow
  2. Apply BERTopic with different parameter settings to find the configuration that produces the most coherent topics
  3. Manually inspect a sample of generated stories to verify that observed patterns match the topic analysis findings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does mode collapse occur in language models trained on specific genres beyond narrative fiction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on narrative fiction but notes "Future researchers will want to expand our study to include additional genres of text" and asks "Do language models experience mode collapse when predicting other textual genres, such as conversations or non-fictional writing?"
- Why unresolved: The current study only examines narrative fiction stories, leaving other genres untested
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the experiment with different genres (news articles, technical writing, poetry, dialogues) using similar demographic prompts and topic analysis

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific aspects of RLHF training cause mode collapse in language models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "We suspect the model suffers from mode collapse due to overalignment" and suggests "misapplied alignment can cause language models to exhibit worsened performance"
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies alignment as a potential cause but doesn't investigate which specific elements of RLHF (reward model design, human feedback selection, optimization process) are responsible
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying RLHF parameters, comparing models with different alignment strategies, or ablation studies removing specific alignment components

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does model size affect susceptibility to mode collapse?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] All tested models have the same 175B parameters, but the paper doesn't explore whether smaller or larger models would show similar behavior
- Why unresolved: The study only examines models of identical size, leaving the relationship between scale and mode collapse unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing models of varying sizes (like GPT-2, GPT-3, and larger models) with identical prompts to compare mode collapse severity across scales

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can mode collapse be reversed or mitigated through additional training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes "One common issue beleaguering older generative adversarial networks (GANs) is 'mode collapse'" and describes it as a training problem, but doesn't explore solutions
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem but doesn't investigate whether techniques like fine-tuning, continued pretraining, or architectural modifications can restore diversity
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying various mitigation strategies to collapsed models and measuring recovery of diversity through topic analysis or other metrics

## Limitations

- Limited generalizability across model families: Only tested OpenAI models from the same lineage, results may not apply to other model families or training approaches
- Topic analysis as proxy for perspective diversity: Topic analysis may not perfectly capture the nuance of perspective diversity, potentially conflating topical similarity with perspective diversity
- Potential confounding factors: Temperature setting and prompt design may influence results independently of mode collapse, and the study doesn't systematically vary these factors

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The observation that gpt-3.5-turbo produces more repetitive stories with specific recurring names across diverse demographic prompts.

**Medium confidence**: The conclusion that newer aligned models suffer from mode collapse compared to earlier versions, based on topic analysis and manual inspection.

**Low confidence**: The broader claim that RLHF alignment inherently causes mode collapse across all aligned models, extrapolating from a limited sample of OpenAI models.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-model validation**: Test the same methodology on models from different organizations (Anthropic Claude, Meta LLaMA, open-source alternatives) to determine if mode collapse is specific to OpenAI's alignment approach or a general phenomenon of aligned LLMs.

2. **Human evaluation validation**: Conduct human evaluations where raters assess the diversity of perspectives in stories without knowing which model generated them, to validate that topic analysis correlates with perceived perspective diversity.

3. **Prompt design sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary prompt structure, demographic descriptors, and temperature settings to determine how sensitive the observed mode collapse is to experimental conditions versus being an inherent property of the models.
