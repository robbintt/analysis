# A Semi-Automatic Approach to Create Large Gender- and Age-Balanced Speaker Corpora: Usefulness of Speaker Diarization & Identification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.17552
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17552
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: 10x reduction in manual processing time while achieving 14.7% diarization error rate

## Executive Summary
This study presents a semi-automatic pipeline for creating large, gender- and age-balanced speaker corpora from French broadcast media archives. The approach combines speech detection, music and noise removal, speaker diarization, and manual identification to dramatically reduce the manual processing burden compared to fully manual methods. The pipeline successfully extracted high-quality speech from 874 speakers across 32 demographic categories, achieving a diarization error rate of 14.7% on test data. A subjective evaluation revealed that while about 30% of utterances contained minor issues, these are unlikely to affect acoustic analyses.

## Method Summary
The semi-automatic pipeline processes French broadcast media by first detecting speech segments, then removing music and noise, followed by speaker diarization to segment different speakers within each program. The diarized segments are then manually identified to ensure accuracy. This approach significantly reduces the manual processing time compared to fully manual methods while maintaining sufficient quality for acoustic analysis. The system was tested on archived broadcast media and achieved a 10-fold reduction in manual processing time while maintaining a reasonable diarization error rate of 14.7%.

## Key Results
- Achieved 10x reduction in manual processing time compared to fully manual methods
- Speaker diarization achieved a 14.7% error rate on test data
- Successfully extracted speech from 874 speakers across 32 age/gender/period categories
- Subjective evaluation found 30% of utterances had minor issues (mostly backchannel or low-level noise)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pipeline leverages automation to handle the bulk of audio processing while maintaining human oversight for critical identification steps. Speaker diarization enables the system to automatically segment different speakers within broadcast programs, which is essential for building balanced corpora. The combination of automated speech detection and noise removal filters out irrelevant audio content, allowing the diarization system to focus on actual speech segments. This semi-automatic approach strikes an effective balance between processing speed and accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Speaker diarization**: Automatic segmentation of audio into speaker-specific segments; needed to identify who speaks when in broadcast media; quick check: measure diarization error rate on test data
- **Speech detection**: Identifying speech-containing segments in audio; needed to focus processing on relevant content; quick check: verify detection recall/precision on varied broadcast conditions
- **Music/noise removal**: Filtering non-speech audio components; needed to improve diarization accuracy; quick check: measure improvement in diarization error rate with and without preprocessing
- **Manual identification**: Human verification of speaker segments; needed to ensure corpus quality; quick check: measure inter-rater reliability on identification tasks
- **Demographic balancing**: Ensuring equal representation across age/gender categories; needed for creating representative corpora; quick check: verify distribution across 32 target categories
- **Subjective quality assessment**: Human evaluation of utterance usability; needed to establish practical quality thresholds; quick check: measure agreement between raters on quality ratings

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Speech Detection -> Music/Noise Removal -> Speaker Diarization -> Manual Identification

Critical Path: The manual identification step represents the current bottleneck, requiring 100% coverage of utterances despite the automation. The diarization error rate of 14.7% directly impacts the manual workload, as errors require correction.

Design Tradeoffs: The system prioritizes processing speed over perfect accuracy, accepting a 14.7% diarization error rate to achieve 10x speedup. This trade-off is justified by the finding that minor diarization errors rarely affect acoustic analysis quality.

Failure Signatures: High diarization error rates lead to increased manual identification workload. Poor speech detection or noise removal degrades diarization performance. Demographic imbalances in source material may prevent achieving target distributions.

First Experiments:
1. Measure diarization error rate on broadcast media from other languages to test cross-lingual robustness
2. Conduct inter-rater reliability studies on subjective quality assessments to quantify evaluation consistency
3. Benchmark speech detection and music/noise removal components independently to isolate their contribution to overall system performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Exclusive focus on French broadcast media limits generalizability to other languages and domains
- Manual identification remains necessary for 100% of utterances, indicating incomplete automation
- Subjective evaluation criteria may introduce inter-rater variability in quality assessment
- Pipeline effectiveness depends heavily on quality of speech detection and noise removal components
- Does not address potential demographic biases in broadcast media source material

## Confidence
- 10x processing time reduction: High confidence (well-supported quantitative result)
- 14.7% diarization error rate: High confidence (measured on test data)
- 30% utterances with minor issues: Medium confidence (subjective evaluation with potential rater variability)
- Cross-lingual applicability: Low confidence (only tested on French broadcast media)
- Complete automation feasibility: Low confidence (manual identification still required for all utterances)

## Next Checks
1. Test the pipeline on broadcast media from other languages and cultural contexts to evaluate cross-lingual robustness
2. Conduct inter-rater reliability studies on the subjective quality assessments to quantify evaluation consistency
3. Implement and evaluate an independent benchmark of the speech detection and music/noise removal components to isolate their contribution to overall system performance
