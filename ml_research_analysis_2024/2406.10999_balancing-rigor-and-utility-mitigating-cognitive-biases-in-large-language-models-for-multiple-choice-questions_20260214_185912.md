# Balancing Rigor and Utility: Mitigating Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models for Multiple-Choice Questions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.10999
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10999
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Not all cognitive biases are detrimental; targeted inspection combined with abstention options improves LLM accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how cognitive biases affect large language model (LLM) decision-making in multiple-choice questions. Rather than eliminating all biases, the research introduces a novel approach that combines heuristic moderation with an abstention option, allowing models to refrain from answering when uncertain. Using the Balance Rigor and Utility (BRU) dataset, the authors demonstrate that targeted inspection of specific cognitive biases significantly improves model performance. The results show that a balanced approach to cognitive biases—neither completely eliminating nor blindly accepting them—can align LLM decision-making more closely with human reasoning patterns.

## Method Summary
The study introduces the Balance Rigor and Utility (BRU) dataset and proposes a methodology combining Specific Bias Inspection (SBI) with an abstention option. The approach involves heuristic moderation where models can choose not to respond when uncertainty is high. The research systematically evaluates different strategies for managing cognitive biases, comparing traditional bias elimination approaches against more nuanced moderation techniques. The experimental framework tests various combinations of bias inspection methods and abstention mechanisms across multiple-choice question scenarios.

## Key Results
- Targeted inspection of cognitive biases through Specific Bias Inspection (SBI) significantly improves accuracy and reduces error rates
- Combining SBI with the abstention option achieved the highest valid vote accuracy (93.5%) and lowest error rate (3.9%)
- Properly balancing rational deviations and cognitive biases can align LLM decision-making more closely with human reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by recognizing that cognitive biases in LLMs can serve as useful heuristics in certain contexts, similar to how humans use bounded rationality. By implementing targeted inspection rather than wholesale bias elimination, the system preserves beneficial shortcuts while mitigating harmful ones. The abstention option adds a crucial layer of reliability by preventing the model from making overconfident errors when uncertainty is high, effectively implementing a form of calibrated confidence.

## Foundational Learning

**Cognitive bias**: Systematic patterns of deviation from rationality in judgment. *Why needed*: Understanding these patterns is essential for developing effective moderation strategies. *Quick check*: Can you identify common examples like anchoring or confirmation bias?

**Heuristic moderation**: Selective application of rules to manage biases rather than complete elimination. *Why needed*: Provides a balanced approach that preserves useful cognitive shortcuts. *Quick check*: Does the approach modify or eliminate specific biases?

**Bounded rationality**: The idea that decision-makers satisfice rather than optimize due to cognitive limitations. *Why needed*: Frames why some biases might be beneficial rather than purely detrimental. *Quick check*: How does this concept differ from perfect rationality assumptions?

**Abstention mechanisms**: Systems that allow models to decline answering when uncertainty is high. *Why needed*: Prevents overconfident errors and improves overall reliability. *Quick check*: What threshold determines when abstention should occur?

**Specific Bias Inspection (SBI)**: Targeted evaluation of particular cognitive biases rather than general bias detection. *Why needed*: Enables precise identification and management of problematic biases. *Quick check*: How does SBI differ from traditional bias mitigation approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input questions → Bias detection module → Specific Bias Inspection (SBI) → Decision module → Abstention threshold evaluation → Output (answer or abstain)

**Critical path**: The most important sequence is: Question input → Bias detection → SBI analysis → Confidence scoring → Abstention decision → Final output

**Design tradeoffs**: The system balances between providing answers (utility) and accuracy (rigor). The abstention option sacrifices coverage for reliability, while SBI adds computational overhead but improves precision. The choice of which biases to inspect versus ignore represents a key design decision.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Over-abstention leading to low coverage
- Missed bias detection resulting in systematic errors
- Incorrect confidence calibration causing premature abstention
- Bias inspection overhead slowing response times

**First experiments**:
1. Test the abstention mechanism alone on a simple multiple-choice dataset
2. Implement SBI on a controlled set of known cognitive bias examples
3. Combine both approaches and measure the accuracy-confidence tradeoff curve

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions beyond the general need for further validation across different LLM architectures and more diverse datasets.

## Limitations

- The study focuses specifically on multiple-choice question scenarios, limiting generalizability to other reasoning tasks
- The BRU dataset represents a specific domain of cognitive bias evaluation that may not capture all biases present in broader applications
- Results may be specific to certain model types and may not transfer to other LLM architectures

## Confidence

- **Not all cognitive biases are detrimental**: Medium confidence - based on specific experimental conditions
- **Targeted inspection significantly improves accuracy**: High confidence within controlled settings
- **Generalizability to other domains**: Low confidence - requires further validation

## Next Checks

1. Test the proposed methodology across different LLM architectures and sizes to verify consistency of results
2. Evaluate the approach on more diverse datasets including real-world decision-making scenarios beyond multiple-choice questions
3. Conduct longitudinal studies to examine whether observed improvements remain stable over time and with continued model use
