# HyperBrain: Anomaly Detection for Temporal Hypergraph Brain Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.02087
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02087
- Authors: Sadaf Sadeghian; Xiaoxiao Li; Margo Seltzer
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Achieves 92.33% and 93.78% AUC for ADHD and ASD detection respectively

## Executive Summary
HyperBrain introduces an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for temporal hypergraph brain networks that addresses limitations of existing methods by capturing higher-order interactions among brain regions. The method models fMRI data as temporal hypergraphs and employs a novel BrainWalk sampling technique to extract temporal higher-order patterns. When evaluated on ADHD and ASD datasets, HyperBrain outperformed all baseline methods with AUC scores of 92.33% and 93.78% respectively, while also identifying clinically relevant biomarkers aligned with current research.

## Method Summary
HyperBrain constructs temporal hypergraphs from fMRI BOLD time series using sliding windows and Pearson correlation thresholding to generate hyperedges representing synchronized activity among groups of brain regions. The method employs BrainWalk sampling with temporal proximity bias to extract higher-order temporal patterns, then uses neural encodings (MLP-Mixer and SetMixer) to learn normal co-activation patterns from healthy control data. Anomaly detection is performed through a two-step training process: pre-training on a subset of healthy brains followed by fine-tuning, using negative sampling to create normal vs abnormal pairs without requiring labeled disorder data.

## Key Results
- Achieved 92.33% AUC for ADHD dataset detection
- Achieved 93.78% AUC for ASD dataset detection
- Outperformed all baseline methods across both datasets
- Identified clinically relevant brain regions including Prefrontal Cortex for ADHD and Cerebellum for ASD

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Temporal hypergraph modeling captures higher-order brain region interactions better than pairwise graph methods by constructing hyperedges when similarity among BOLD signals across multiple ROIs exceeds a threshold, capturing synchronized activity among groups of regions rather than just pairs.

### Mechanism 2
Temporal walk sampling with backward traversal captures relevant historical brain state transitions through a time-biased approach where closer timestamps have higher probability, allowing the model to capture temporal dependencies and the lasting effects of previous brain states.

### Mechanism 3
Training exclusively on healthy control data enables anomaly detection without requiring balanced datasets by learning normal co-activation patterns and using negative sampling to create "normal" vs "abnormal" pairs, identifying deviations in disordered brains without needing labeled disorder data during training.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal hypergraphs
  - Why needed here: Standard graphs only capture pairwise relationships, but brain disorders often involve coordinated activity across multiple regions simultaneously
  - Quick check question: What is the minimum number of nodes required to form a hyperedge in a hypergraph?

- Concept: fMRI preprocessing and BOLD signal interpretation
  - Why needed here: The method relies on accurate extraction of temporal BOLD signals from raw fMRI data and proper windowing for temporal hypergraph construction
  - Quick check question: What preprocessing steps are typically applied to fMRI data before connectivity analysis?

- Concept: Random walk sampling on temporal graphs
  - Why needed here: BrainWalk sampling extracts higher-order temporal patterns from the hypergraph, which is essential for learning normal/abnormal co-activation dynamics
  - Quick check question: How does temporal proximity bias affect the distribution of sampled walks compared to uniform sampling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data → Sliding Window → Hyperedge Generation → BrainWalk Sampling → Neural Encoding → Anomaly Scoring → Evaluation
- Critical path: BOLD signals → Hyperedge construction (similarity thresholding) → Temporal walk sampling (BrainWalk) → Neural encoding (MLP-Mixer) → Anomaly score calculation
- Design tradeoffs: Higher-order hyperedges capture more complex patterns but increase computational complexity; temporal walks capture dynamics but require careful window size selection
- Failure signatures: Poor AUC scores could indicate incorrect similarity threshold, inadequate window size, or insufficient training data; false positives might suggest the model learned noise rather than signal
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate hyperedge construction by visualizing detected hyperedges against known functional networks for a single subject
  2. Test BrainWalk sampling bias by comparing sampled hyperedge sequences with different θ values on synthetic temporal data
  3. Evaluate anomaly detection performance using controlled synthetic anomalies injected into healthy brain networks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the computational efficiency of HyperBrain scale with increasing numbers of brain regions and temporal windows, and what specific optimizations could be implemented to improve scalability?

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal window length and stride for temporal hypergraph construction in fMRI data, and how sensitive is HyperBrain's performance to these parameters?

### Open Question 3
How does HyperBrain's performance compare when using different brain parcellation atlases, and what impact does atlas choice have on the identified biomarkers?

## Limitations

- BrainWalk sampling implementation details are not fully specified, requiring careful tuning of the temporal bias parameter θ
- Pearson correlation threshold for hyperedge construction (top 90th percentile) may not be optimal across different datasets or disorders
- Performance could degrade if abnormal patterns in disorders overlap significantly with normal variability

## Confidence

- High confidence: Higher-order hypergraph modeling captures more complex brain interactions than pairwise graphs
- Medium confidence: Temporal walk sampling approach effectiveness
- Medium confidence: One-class learning approach validity

## Next Checks

1. Validate BrainWalk temporal bias by systematically testing different θ values (0.1, 0.5, 1.0) on synthetic temporal hypergraph data with known state transition patterns
2. Compare AUC performance when using different hyperedge construction thresholds (80th, 85th, 90th, 95th percentiles) to assess sensitivity to this parameter
3. Test the model's robustness by evaluating performance when training data is limited (e.g., using only 10-20 healthy subjects) to determine minimum data requirements
