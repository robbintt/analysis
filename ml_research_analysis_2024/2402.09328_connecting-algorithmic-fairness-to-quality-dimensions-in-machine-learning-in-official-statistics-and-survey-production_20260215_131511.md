# Connecting Algorithmic Fairness to Quality Dimensions in Machine Learning in Official Statistics and Survey Production

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.09328
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09328
- Reference count: 22
- This paper extends the Quality Framework for Statistical Algorithms (QF4SA) by incorporating algorithmic fairness as a distinct quality dimension for machine learning applications in official statistics.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical intersection of algorithmic fairness and quality assessment in machine learning applications within official statistics. The authors propose extending the Quality Framework for Statistical Algorithms (QF4SA) to explicitly incorporate fairness as a distinct quality dimension. Through systematic mapping of fairness concepts from the fair ML literature onto existing QF4SA dimensions, the work provides a structured approach for National Statistical Offices (NSOs) to evaluate and implement fair ML models while maintaining established quality standards.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a conceptual mapping approach, systematically relating fairness concepts from fair ML literature to the established quality dimensions in QF4SA. They provide empirical illustrations using labor market data to demonstrate practical implementation, including evaluation of subgroup performance, fairness metrics calculation, and assessment of model stability across protected groups. The methodology emphasizes the importance of considering both statistical accuracy and fairness when developing ML models for official statistics production.

## Key Results
- Considerable variation in prediction accuracy across demographic subgroups was observed, highlighting the importance of subgroup fairness assessment
- The mapping of fairness concepts onto QF4SA dimensions provides a structured framework for NSOs to integrate fairness considerations into their ML workflows
- Practical guidance is offered for evaluating model performance across protected groups while maintaining other quality standards

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by providing a structured framework that bridges the gap between algorithmic fairness literature and the established quality assessment practices in official statistics. By mapping fairness concepts onto existing quality dimensions, the method enables NSOs to systematically evaluate both traditional quality metrics and fairness considerations within a unified framework. This integration ensures that fairness is not treated as an afterthought but as an integral component of ML quality assessment in statistical production.

## Foundational Learning
- **Quality Framework for Statistical Algorithms (QF4SA)**: Why needed - Provides standardized quality assessment for ML algorithms in official statistics; Quick check - Verify alignment with existing NSO quality protocols
- **Subgroup fairness metrics**: Why needed - Ensures equitable model performance across demographic groups; Quick check - Calculate and compare metrics across all protected subgroups
- **Model stability assessment**: Why needed - Evaluates consistency of fairness outcomes across different data subsets; Quick check - Perform cross-validation across demographic partitions
- **Fairness-accuracy tradeoff analysis**: Why needed - Balances statistical performance with equitable outcomes; Quick check - Compare Pareto frontier of fairness vs accuracy metrics

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Data Preprocessing -> Model Training -> Fairness Assessment -> Quality Evaluation -> Production Deployment
- **Critical path**: Data preparation and preprocessing directly impacts both model performance and fairness outcomes, making it a critical juncture
- **Design tradeoffs**: The framework must balance computational complexity of fairness metrics with practical implementation constraints in NSO environments
- **Failure signatures**: Models showing high overall accuracy but significant subgroup performance disparities indicate fairness failures requiring intervention
- **First experiments**: 1) Calculate baseline fairness metrics across all demographic subgroups; 2) Compare model performance using both accuracy and fairness-weighted metrics; 3) Test stability of fairness outcomes across temporal data partitions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions regarding the integration of fairness into official statistics production. These include the need for more comprehensive fairness metrics beyond subgroup fairness, consideration of intersectional fairness approaches, and the development of causal fairness frameworks appropriate for statistical contexts. The authors also note the importance of understanding how data processing steps may differentially impact minority groups and the need for longitudinal analysis of fairness outcomes.

## Limitations
- Limited scope of fairness dimensions addressed, primarily focusing on subgroup fairness while potentially overlooking intersectional and causal fairness considerations
- Empirical illustrations based on labor market data may not generalize to other domains within official statistics
- The conceptual mapping between fairness concepts and QF4SA dimensions requires further validation across diverse statistical production contexts

## Confidence
- High confidence in the importance of incorporating fairness as a distinct quality dimension for ML in official statistics
- Medium confidence in the proposed mapping between fairness concepts and existing QF4SA dimensions
- Medium confidence in the empirical examples demonstrating subgroup performance variations
- Low confidence in the completeness of fairness considerations beyond the scope of QF4SA dimensions

## Next Checks
1. Validate the proposed fairness dimension framework across multiple NSO use cases beyond labor market data, including social statistics and demographic surveys
2. Conduct systematic comparison of subgroup fairness metrics with causal fairness approaches to identify gaps and complementarities
3. Perform longitudinal analysis of model performance across demographic groups when applied to historical official statistics datasets to assess temporal stability of fairness outcomes
