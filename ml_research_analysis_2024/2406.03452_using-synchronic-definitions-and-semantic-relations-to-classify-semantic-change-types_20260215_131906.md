  a classifier on synchronic lexical relations from WordNet. The approach leverages
  generated sense definitions to capture latent word meanings and improves models

# Using Synchronic Definitions and Semantic Relations to Classify Semantic Change Types

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.03452
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03452
- Reference count: 20
- This paper introduces a method to classify semantic change types (specialization, generalization, co-hyponymous transfer, auto-antonymy) by training a classifier on synchronic lexical relations from WordNet

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to classify types of semantic change by leveraging synchronic lexical relations from WordNet to train a classifier. The method generates sense definitions to capture latent word meanings and applies this classifier to both semantic relatedness approximation and binary lexical semantic change detection tasks. The approach is evaluated on a novel benchmark derived from Blank (1997), demonstrating improved performance over state-of-the-art methods for graded Word-in-Context tasks.

## Method Summary
The proposed method trains a classifier on synchronic lexical relations (synonymy, hypernymy, co-hyponymy) extracted from WordNet to identify semantic change types. The classifier uses generated sense definitions as features to capture latent word meanings across different time periods. This trained model is then applied to two downstream tasks: improving semantic relatedness approximation and binary lexical semantic change detection. The approach operates by comparing synchronic relations across time periods to detect shifts in word meaning patterns.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.85 recall for specialization change type
- Achieves 0.68 recall for generalization change type  
- Improves state-of-the-art in graded Word-in-Context tasks from 0.623 to 0.646 Spearman correlation
- Shows limited performance (0.17 recall) for co-hyponymous transfer detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by capturing the structural relationships between words in a lexical network at different time points. By training on synchronic relations, the classifier learns patterns that distinguish between different types of semantic change. Generated sense definitions provide a dense representation of word meanings that can be compared across time periods, allowing the model to detect when words undergo specialization, generalization, or other change types based on how their relational patterns shift.

## Foundational Learning

**WordNet Lexical Relations**
Why needed: Provides the synchronic baseline for detecting semantic change
Quick check: Verify coverage of target words in WordNet synsets

**Semantic Change Types**
Why needed: Defines the classification target (specialization, generalization, co-hyponymous transfer, auto-antonymy)
Quick check: Ensure correct mapping between detected patterns and theoretical change types

**Sense Definition Generation**
Why needed: Creates dense representations of word meanings for comparison across time
Quick check: Validate generated definitions capture key semantic distinctions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Sense Definition Generator -> WordNet Relation Extractor -> Change Type Classifier -> Downstream Tasks

**Critical Path**
1. Extract synchronic relations from WordNet for target words
2. Generate sense definitions using pretrained language models
3. Train classifier to distinguish between change types
4. Apply trained model to detect semantic change in new data

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Relies heavily on WordNet coverage, limiting applicability to words not well-represented in the taxonomy
- Generated definitions may introduce noise compared to human-annotated definitions
- Binary change detection simplifies the complex nature of semantic evolution

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance on co-hyponymous transfer suggests model bias toward more common change patterns
- Limited recall indicates the approach may miss subtle semantic shifts
- WordNet coverage gaps result in incomplete change detection for specialized vocabulary

**3 First Experiments**
1. Evaluate classifier performance on words with known semantic shifts in historical corpora
2. Compare generated sense definitions against human-annotated definitions for quality assessment
3. Test classifier robustness by introducing controlled semantic perturbations in test data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Recall of 0.17 for co-hyponymous transfer indicates substantial difficulty detecting this change type
- Reliance on WordNet introduces potential coverage gaps for specialized vocabulary
- Single benchmark evaluation limits generalizability claims

## Confidence

**High**: Graded WSC task improvement (0.623 to 0.646 Spearman correlation) represents clear, measurable enhancement

**Medium**: Change-type classification results limited to single novel benchmark without external validation

**Low**: Claims about capturing "latent word meanings" lack deeper linguistic analysis of specific meaning aspects

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the classifier on established semantic change datasets beyond LSC-CTD to verify generalizability across different corpora and time periods.

2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the relative contribution of each synchronic relation type (synonymy, hypernymy, co-hyponymy) to classification performance.

3. Perform qualitative analysis of false positives and false negatives to identify systematic biases in the model's understanding of semantic change patterns.
