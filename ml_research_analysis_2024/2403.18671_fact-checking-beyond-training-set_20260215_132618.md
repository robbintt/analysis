# Fact Checking Beyond Training Set

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.18671
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18671
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Primary result**: Domain adaptation pipeline achieves F1 scores up to 0.648 on MultiFC and 0.643 on Snopes datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of domain adaptation in fact-checking by proposing methods to improve both retriever and reader components of fact-checking pipelines. The authors introduce adversarial training for the retriever using unlabeled target data and develop a reader model that is insensitive to the order of claims and evidence documents. The study constructs a multi-topic fact-checking dataset and evaluates the proposed methods across eight scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over strong baseline models including GPT-4-based approaches.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a two-pronged approach to domain adaptation in fact-checking. First, they enhance the retriever component through adversarial training with unlabeled target data, enabling the model to better handle out-of-domain queries. Second, they train the reader component to be insensitive to the order of claims and evidence documents, improving its robustness to different evidence presentations. The pipeline is evaluated on a newly constructed multi-topic fact-checking dataset across eight cross-domain scenarios.

## Key Results
- The proposed pipeline achieves F1 scores of up to 0.648 on MultiFC and 0.643 on Snopes datasets
- Adversarial training improves retriever performance on out-of-domain data
- Order-insensitive reader training enhances robustness to evidence presentation variations
- The approach outperforms strong baseline models including GPT-4-based synthetic data generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from addressing two key challenges in cross-domain fact-checking: domain shift in retrieval and evidence presentation variability. Adversarial training exposes the retriever to out-of-domain query distributions during training, improving its generalization capabilities. The order-insensitive reader training ensures the model focuses on content rather than positional information, making it more robust to different evidence arrangements.

## Foundational Learning

**Domain Adaptation**: Understanding how models trained on one domain perform on another - needed to recognize the core challenge being addressed; quick check: compare in-domain vs out-of-domain performance

**Adversarial Training**: Technique where model is trained against an adversary that generates challenging examples - needed to improve retriever generalization; quick check: verify adversarial examples improve model robustness

**Information Retrieval**: Process of finding relevant documents given a query - needed to understand the retriever's role; quick check: measure retrieval accuracy on target domain

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Retriever -> Evidence Selector -> Reader -> Factuality Prediction

**Critical Path**: Query -> Retriever (adversarial training) -> Unordered evidence aggregation -> Reader (order-insensitive) -> Factuality prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**: The adversarial training approach trades computational cost for improved generalization, while order-insensitive reader training trades positional information for robustness to evidence presentation variations.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Low recall in retrieval indicates insufficient adversarial training
- Inconsistent predictions with reordered evidence suggests inadequate order-insensitive training
- Poor performance on specific domains may indicate domain-specific bias

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Evaluate retrieval performance with and without adversarial training on target domain data
2. Test reader predictions with systematically reordered evidence documents
3. Compare F1 scores across different domain adaptation baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on F1 scores without precision-recall trade-offs or confidence intervals
- Potential bias introduction through GPT-4-based synthetic data generation not fully characterized
- Computational costs and latency implications of adversarial training not addressed

## Confidence
- **High**: Domain adaptation significantly impacts fact-checking performance (supported by multi-dataset results)
- **Medium**: Adversarial training improves retriever performance (robustness across diverse domains needs validation)
- **Medium**: Order-insensitive reader training enhances robustness (performance on complex claim-evidence relationships unexplored)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of adversarial training and unordered reader training
2. Evaluate pipeline on real-world fact-checking scenarios with temporal dynamics
3. Perform cost-benefit analysis comparing proposed approach against simpler domain adaptation techniques
