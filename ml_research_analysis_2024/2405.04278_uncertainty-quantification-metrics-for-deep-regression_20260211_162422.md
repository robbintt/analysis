# Uncertainty Quantification Metrics for Deep Regression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.04278
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04278
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: This paper analyzes four metrics for evaluating uncertainty quantification in deep regression models: AUSE, Calibration Error, Spearman's Rank Correlation, and NLL

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty quantification metrics for deep regression models, evaluating their stability, interpretability, and convergence properties across different types of uncertainty. The authors systematically compare four commonly used metrics - AUSE, CE, Spearman's correlation, and NLL - using synthetic datasets designed to represent homoscedastic, heteroscedastic, multimodal, and epistemic uncertainty scenarios. Their findings reveal significant differences in metric behavior, particularly regarding stability with varying test set sizes and model performance conditions.

The study establishes Calibration Error as the most reliable and interpretable metric for uncertainty quantification, while identifying AUSE as a useful secondary metric for correlation analysis. The authors demonstrate that Spearman correlation suffers from instability issues and recommend its replacement with AUSE. Through extensive experimental validation across multiple uncertainty types, they provide practical guidance for metric selection in uncertainty quantification tasks, addressing a critical gap in the literature where metric selection has often been arbitrary or based on convenience rather than systematic evaluation.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct a systematic evaluation of four uncertainty quantification metrics using synthetic datasets designed to represent four distinct types of uncertainty: homoscedastic (constant uncertainty), heteroscedastic (input-dependent uncertainty), multimodal (multiple possible outputs), and epistemic (model uncertainty). They generate these datasets with controlled uncertainty patterns to isolate metric behavior under known conditions. The evaluation framework varies test set sizes from small samples to larger datasets to assess metric stability and convergence properties. For each metric, they measure performance across different uncertainty types and model quality scenarios, analyzing stability, interpretability, and required sample sizes for reliable estimation. The study employs 25 related papers from the uncertainty quantification literature to validate their findings against current practice and identify patterns in metric selection.

## Key Results
- CE is the most stable and interpretable metric, with well-defined bounds and requiring minimal samples for convergence
- AUSE provides robust correlation measurement between predictive uncertainty and errors but lacks interpretability due to unbounded values
- Spearman correlation is unsuitable due to instability with small test sets and convergence to zero with larger sets
- NLL measures distribution shape quality but requires the largest sample size for stability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's systematic approach to metric evaluation works because it isolates metric behavior through controlled synthetic datasets, eliminating confounding factors present in real-world data. By generating datasets with known uncertainty patterns, the authors can directly measure how well each metric captures and quantifies different types of uncertainty. The variation in test set sizes reveals convergence properties and stability thresholds that would be difficult to observe in empirical datasets. This controlled environment enables precise comparison of metric characteristics including boundedness, interpretability, and sample efficiency, providing clear evidence for metric selection recommendations that would be obscured by the complexity of real-world data distributions.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Uncertainty Quantification Metrics**: Statistical measures for evaluating probabilistic predictions in regression models. Understanding these metrics is essential for assessing model reliability and risk assessment in safety-critical applications.

2. **Synthetic Data Generation for Controlled Experiments**: Creating datasets with known uncertainty patterns to isolate metric behavior. This approach enables precise control over experimental conditions and eliminates confounding variables present in real-world data.

3. **Metric Stability and Convergence**: The behavior of statistical metrics as sample sizes increase, including convergence rates and sensitivity to test set size. Critical for understanding when metrics provide reliable estimates in practical applications.

4. **Homoscedastic vs. Heteroscedastic Uncertainty**: Constant uncertainty across inputs versus input-dependent uncertainty patterns. These represent fundamental uncertainty types that models must handle differently for accurate quantification.

5. **Calibration Error**: Measures how well predicted probabilities match observed frequencies. Well-defined bounds and minimal sample requirements make it particularly useful for uncertainty quantification tasks.

6. **Negative Log-Likelihood**: Evaluates the quality of predicted probability distributions by measuring how well they fit observed data. Requires larger sample sizes but provides comprehensive distribution shape assessment.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data Generation -> Model Training -> Metric Evaluation -> Analysis

Critical Path: Synthetic dataset generation (homoscedastic/heteroscedastic/multimodal/epistemic) → Model training with uncertainty prediction → Metric computation (CE/AUSE/Spearman/NLL) → Stability analysis across test set sizes → Performance comparison

Design Tradeoffs: Controlled synthetic data enables precise metric comparison but may not capture real-world complexity; larger test sets improve metric stability but increase computational cost; bounded metrics (CE) offer better interpretability but may miss distribution shape details captured by unbounded metrics (NLL)

Failure Signatures: Spearman correlation instability with small test sets; NLL requiring excessive samples for convergence; AUSE lacking interpretability despite correlation strength; CE providing overly optimistic results on poorly calibrated models

First Experiments:
1. Generate synthetic homoscedastic dataset and evaluate all four metrics across test set sizes 10-1000
2. Create multimodal dataset with known uncertainty patterns and compare metric sensitivity to different uncertainty magnitudes
3. Train model with epistemic uncertainty and measure metric stability under varying levels of model uncertainty

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Major uncertainties remain regarding the generalizability of these findings to real-world datasets with complex, non-linear relationships and high-dimensional feature spaces
- The study's use of synthetic data, while valuable for controlled analysis, may not fully capture the challenges present in practical applications where uncertainty patterns are more complex and intertwined
- The sample size of 25 related papers provides some validation but may not be sufficient to establish comprehensive coverage of the uncertainty quantification literature

## Confidence
- High confidence in the relative performance rankings of the four metrics, supported by extensive experimental validation across multiple uncertainty types and test set sizes
- Medium confidence applies to the specific threshold recommendations (CE as primary metric, AUSE as secondary) due to the synthetic nature of the evaluation datasets
- Low confidence exists in the universal applicability of these recommendations across different domains and problem types

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the recommended metric selection strategy on real-world datasets with known uncertainty patterns, comparing against domain-specific performance requirements
2. Test metric stability under adversarial conditions, including data poisoning and model degradation scenarios
3. Assess computational efficiency trade-offs between CE and AUSE in large-scale deployment settings with varying resource constraints
