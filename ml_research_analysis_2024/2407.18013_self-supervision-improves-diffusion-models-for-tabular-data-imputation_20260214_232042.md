# Self-Supervision Improves Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Imputation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.18013
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18013
- Reference count: 40
- This paper addresses incomplete tabular data imputation using self-supervised diffusion models

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of incomplete tabular data imputation by proposing SimpDM, a self-supervised diffusion model that outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The approach addresses key limitations of diffusion models on tabular data, including sensitivity to noise, limited data samples, and poor scaling with data size. By introducing self-supervised alignment and state-dependent data augmentation, SimpDM achieves lower RMSE scores across 17 benchmark datasets and demonstrates robustness across various missing data scenarios.

## Method Summary
SimpDM extends vanilla diffusion models for tabular data imputation by incorporating three key innovations: hybrid input data combining observed and initialized values, pseudo missing training strategy, and value prediction instead of noise prediction. The method introduces self-supervised alignment through parallel diffusion channels with MSE loss to stabilize predictions, and state-dependent data augmentation that applies different perturbation strengths based on entry certainty (ground-truth, pseudo missing, or missing states). The model is trained using an MLP architecture and evaluated across 17 real-world tabular datasets with varying missing ratios and scenarios (MCAR, MAR, MNAR).

## Key Results
- SimpDM outperforms state-of-the-art imputation methods including KNN, MICE, MIRACLE, and GRAPE on 17 benchmark datasets
- The method achieves lower RMSE scores across various missing data scenarios and ratios
- SimpDM demonstrates efficient runtime scaling linearly with data size while maintaining high imputation accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Self-supervised alignment reduces variance in imputation outputs by encouraging consistent predictions across different noisy inputs. The model runs two parallel diffusion channels with different noise realizations but same observed data, using MSE loss between outputs to force similar imputations and suppress sensitivity to initialization noise.

### Mechanism 2
State-dependent data augmentation improves robustness by applying stronger perturbations to entries with lower certainty. Different perturbation strengths are allocated based on entry states (ground-truth, pseudo missing, or missing), creating more reliable synthetic training samples for entries that benefit most from stronger perturbations.

### Mechanism 3
Value prediction instead of noise prediction improves imputation accuracy for tabular data. Rather than predicting Gaussian noise added during diffusion, SimpDM directly predicts ground-truth values of missing entries, computing loss only on pseudo missing terms.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Diffusion process fundamentals (forward and reverse Markov chains)
  - Why needed here: SimpDM is built upon diffusion models, which rely on understanding the gradual noising and denoising process
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between the forward diffusion process and the reverse denoising process in diffusion models?

- **Concept:** Handling missing data scenarios (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
  - Why needed here: SimpDM needs to perform well across different missing data patterns and ratios
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), and Missing Not at Random (MNAR) scenarios?

- **Concept:** Self-supervised learning principles
  - Why needed here: SimpDM uses self-supervised alignment to regularize the model without requiring additional labels
  - Quick check question: How does self-supervised learning differ from supervised and unsupervised learning, and what are its advantages in the context of SimpDM?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Base diffusion model with hybrid input -> Self-supervised alignment module -> State-dependent augmentation module -> Value prediction head -> Missing mask embedding

- **Critical path:** Forward diffusion → State-dependent augmentation → Hybrid input construction → Diffusion model prediction → Self-supervised alignment loss → Backpropagation

- **Design tradeoffs:** Simple MLP architecture vs. complex U-Net reduces overfitting risk on small tabular datasets but may limit representational capacity; value prediction vs. noise prediction is more direct for imputation but may require different training dynamics; self-supervised alignment strength (γ) higher values enforce consistency but may harm accuracy if too dominant

- **Failure signatures:** High variance in imputation outputs across different runs → Self-supervised alignment not effective; degraded performance on datasets with very few samples → State-dependent augmentation not sufficient; slow convergence during training → Value prediction objective may require different learning rate scheduling

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Verify that the base diffusion model with hybrid input outperforms vanilla diffusion models on a small tabular dataset with MCAR missingness
  2. Test the impact of self-supervised alignment by comparing models with and without the alignment loss on the same dataset
  3. Evaluate different perturbation strength configurations for state-dependent augmentation to find the optimal setting for a specific dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does SimpDM's performance scale with extremely high missing ratios (e.g., 80-90%) compared to other imputation methods? The paper tests missing ratios up to 0.7 but does not explore higher ratios where imputation becomes significantly more challenging.

### Open Question 2
What is the theoretical upper bound on the number of samples needed for SimpDM to achieve near-optimal imputation performance? The paper discusses data scale mismatch as a challenge for diffusion models on tabular data but does not provide theoretical analysis of sample complexity requirements.

### Open Question 3
How does SimpDM perform on highly heterogeneous tabular datasets with mixed numerical and categorical features of varying cardinalities? The paper mentions extending SimpDM to mixed-type data but does not provide detailed experimental results on such datasets.

## Limitations

- The self-supervised alignment mechanism's optimal strength is dataset-dependent and not fully explored across all 17 datasets
- The state-dependent augmentation strategy relies on manual specification of perturbation strengths which may not generalize well to all data types
- The MLP architecture, while simpler, may limit representational capacity compared to more complex diffusion models for certain tabular datasets

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The overall improvement of SimpDM over baseline methods (KNN, MICE, MIRACLE, GRAPE) is well-supported by extensive experiments across 17 datasets
- **Medium Confidence:** The effectiveness of individual components (self-supervised alignment, state-dependent augmentation) is demonstrated, but their relative contributions and optimal configurations require further investigation
- **Medium Confidence:** The robustness claims across different missing ratios and scenarios (MAR, MNAR) are supported, but additional experiments with extreme ratios (>50%) and more diverse MAR/MNAR patterns would strengthen the evidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of self-supervised alignment and state-dependent augmentation to overall performance
2. Test SimpDM on datasets with extreme missing ratios (>50%) and more diverse MAR/MNAR patterns to validate robustness claims
3. Compare SimpDM's performance with other state-of-the-art diffusion models (e.g., MissDDIM, MissHDD) on a subset of datasets to benchmark against the latest methods in this space
