## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework for cognitive state classification from speech, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data in tasks requiring subjective assessment. The core method introduces a novel multi-view pseudo-labeling approach that leverages both acoustic and linguistic characteristics. By requiring consensus between acoustic (FAD-based) and linguistic (LLM-based) pseudo-labels, the framework identifies high-confidence data while iteratively training a bimodal classifier to label low-confidence data. The method demonstrates competitive performance compared to fully supervised learning using only 30% of labeled data.

## Method Summary
The proposed SSL framework employs a multi-view pseudo-labeling approach for cognitive state classification from speech. Acoustically, unlabeled data are compared to labeled data using Frechet audio distance (FAD) calculated from embeddings generated by multiple audio encoders (VGGish, EnCodec, Wav2vec 2.0, CLAP). Linguistically, ASR transcriptions are revised using large language models and task-specific knowledge prompts to predict labels. High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from both sources align. A bimodal classifier with HuBERT and RoBERTa encoders is trained iteratively on high-confidence data, labeling low-confidence data while accepting predictions that match either pseudo-label source. The framework is evaluated on IEMOCAP (emotion recognition) and ADReSSo (dementia detection) datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieves 75.10% Unweighted Accuracy (UA) in emotion recognition and 80.87% UA in dementia detection using only 30% labeled data
- Significantly outperforms two selected baselines while using 70% less labeled data than fully supervised learning
- Competitively matches fully supervised learning performance (75.53% and 81.23% UA respectively) with reduced labeling requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-view pseudo-labeling improves label quality by requiring consensus between acoustic and linguistic paths
- Mechanism: The framework identifies high-confidence data only when pseudo-labels from both acoustic (FAD-based) and linguistic (LLM-based) sources agree, reducing noise from individual source errors
- Core assumption: FAD and LLM predictions are conditionally independent given the true label
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] states "High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from both sources align, while mismatches are treated as low-confidence"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Iterative semi-supervised training with selective model label acceptance prevents error accumulation
- Mechanism: Low-confidence data are labeled by the bimodal classifier, but only accepted if the model's prediction matches either the acoustic or linguistic pseudo-label
- Core assumption: The bimodal classifier's errors are not systematically biased toward one pseudo-label source
- Evidence anchors: [section] describes the acceptance criterion: "If the model pseudo-label matches either the acoustic or linguistic pseudo-label, the data are added to the training set"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multiple audio encoders reduce bias in acoustic similarity measurement
- Mechanism: Using VGGish, EnCodec, Wav2vec 2.0, and CLAP provides diverse acoustic embeddings, averaging FAD scores to capture different aspects of audio similarity
- Core assumption: Different audio encoders capture complementary acoustic features relevant to cognitive state classification
- Evidence anchors: [section] states "We extract acoustic features from multiple audio encoders trained with different objectives to reduce the bias of relying on a single one"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labeling
  - Why needed here: Cognitive state classification requires subjective assessment, making labeled data scarce and expensive
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between self-training and co-training in SSL?

- Concept: Multi-view learning and fusion
  - Why needed here: Cognitive states manifest through both acoustic patterns and linguistic content, requiring integration of both modalities
  - Quick check question: How does early fusion differ from late fusion in multimodal systems?

- Concept: Frechet distance for distribution comparison
  - Why needed here: Acoustic similarity between labeled and unlabeled data needs a reference-free metric that captures perceptual similarity
  - Quick check question: Why might cosine similarity be less appropriate than FAD for comparing audio embeddings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Speech audio -> Multiple audio encoders -> FAD scores; Speech audio -> ASR systems -> LLM revision -> Label prediction; HuBERT/RoBERTa encoders -> Multimodal fusion -> Bimodal classifier

- Critical path: 1) Generate pseudo-labels from acoustic and linguistic paths; 2) Select high-confidence data where pseudo-labels agree; 3) Train bimodal classifier on high-confidence + labeled data; 4) Predict low-confidence data with classifier; 5) Accept predictions matching either pseudo-label source; 6) Iterate until convergence

- Design tradeoffs: Multiple audio encoders vs. computational cost; Strict consensus requirement vs. data utilization rate; Iterative refinement vs. potential error accumulation; Complex fusion methods vs. simpler concatenation

- Failure signatures: Low high-confidence data rate → acoustic/linguistic paths disagree frequently; Performance degradation over iterations → error accumulation in model predictions; One modality dominates → imbalance in audio/text feature quality or model capacity

- First 3 experiments: 1) Test FAD-based pseudo-labeling alone vs. LLM-based alone to establish baseline contributions; 2) Evaluate different fusion methods (early, cross-attention, tensor, modality-gated) on validation set; 3) Measure high-confidence data rate vs. performance to find optimal consensus threshold

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed SSL framework scale with increasing amounts of unlabeled data beyond what was tested?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "We use an 80/10/10 split for training, validation, and testing" and tests different ground-truth labeling rates (20%, 25%, 30%) but does not explore performance with varying amounts of unlabeled data
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses a fixed split ratio and does not investigate how the model performs when the amount of unlabeled data is varied
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the proportion of unlabeled data while keeping labeled data constant, showing performance trends and identifying saturation points

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed method perform on cognitive state classification tasks involving other modalities beyond speech, such as video or physiological signals?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The framework is described as a "semi-supervised learning framework" that could theoretically be extended to other modalities, but the paper only evaluates speech data
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses exclusively on speech data, leaving open whether the multi-view pseudo-labeling approach generalizes to other input modalities
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the same framework to video or physiological signal datasets and comparing performance to the speech-only approach

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different ASR error correction strategies on the linguistic pseudo-labeling accuracy, particularly for languages other than English?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a specific "R EVISE -REASON -RECOGNIZE (R3) prompting pipeline" with ASR error correction and mentions "the revised ASR transcriptions by R3 prompt yield word error rates of 11.48% and 30.25% for IEMOCAP and ADReSSo, respectively"
- Why unresolved: While the paper evaluates ASR error rates, it does not systematically investigate how different error correction methods affect pseudo-label quality, nor does it test performance on non-English languages
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing multiple ASR error correction approaches and evaluating performance across different languages with varying error characteristics

## Limitations
- The multi-view pseudo-labeling framework assumes conditional independence between acoustic and linguistic pseudo-label sources, which may not hold in practice
- Performance heavily depends on the quality of ASR transcriptions, which can introduce cascading errors through the LLM revision pipeline
- The iterative training procedure lacks clear stopping criteria beyond a "predefined criterion," potentially leading to overfitting or premature convergence

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The overall semi-supervised learning framework and the problem formulation for cognitive state classification from speech
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of FAD-based acoustic similarity measurement and the multi-encoder approach for reducing bias
- Medium Confidence: The consensus-based pseudo-label filtering mechanism for identifying high-confidence data
- Low Confidence: The specific implementation details of the multimodal fusion methods and their relative contributions to performance

## Next Checks

1. Perform ablation studies comparing FAD-only, LLM-only, and consensus-based pseudo-labeling to quantify the value of the multi-view approach
2. Evaluate the impact of different ASR transcription qualities on pseudo-label accuracy and downstream classification performance
3. Test the sensitivity of the iterative training procedure to the consensus threshold and stopping criteria across different data availability scenarios
