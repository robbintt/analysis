# An Adaptive Dimension Reduction Estimation Method for High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.05425
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05425
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Proposes a two-step framework for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization using MAVE for EDR subspace estimation and GP modeling in reduced space

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of extending Bayesian optimization (BO) to high-dimensional settings by proposing a two-step optimization framework. The method first identifies the effective dimension reduction (EDR) subspace for the objective function using the minimum average variance estimation (MAVE) method. It then constructs a Gaussian process model within this EDR subspace and optimizes it using the expected improvement criterion. The algorithm offers flexibility to operate these steps either concurrently or in sequence, balancing exploration-exploitation trade-off by distributing the sampling budget between subspace estimation and function optimization. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence rate in high-dimensional contexts, with the simple regret upper bound achieving OP(N^(-3/D+4) 0 log N0 + N^(-1/d) 1) when D ≥ 3d - 4. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of the method in challenging scenarios, demonstrating competitive performance through an alternating projection algorithm that handles general box constraints while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

## Method Summary
The method implements a two-step framework for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization. First, it estimates the Effective Dimension Reduction (EDR) subspace using Minimum Average Variance Estimation (MAVE), identifying the relevant lower-dimensional structure in the objective function. Second, it performs Bayesian optimization within this reduced d-dimensional subspace using a Gaussian Process model with Expected Improvement acquisition. The algorithm can operate in sequential mode (first estimate subspace, then optimize) or concurrent mode (alternate between estimation and optimization). An alternating projection algorithm handles box constraints when mapping between high-dimensional and reduced spaces. The sampling budget N is divided between subspace estimation (N0 samples) and function optimization (N-N0 samples), allowing the algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation.

## Key Results
- Theoretical convergence rate established as OP(N^(-3/D+4) 0 log N0 + N^(-1/d) 1) for sequential approach
- Alternating projection algorithm successfully handles general box constraints while maintaining theoretical guarantees
- Sequential approach demonstrates better theoretical guarantees compared to concurrent approach
- Method shows competitive performance on benchmark functions with known low-dimensional structure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The algorithm achieves better convergence in high dimensions by first identifying a low-dimensional effective subspace and then performing Bayesian optimization within that subspace.
- **Mechanism**: The algorithm uses Minimum Average Variance Estimation (MAVE) to estimate the Effective Dimension Reduction (EDR) subspace. Once the subspace is identified, the algorithm projects high-dimensional inputs into this lower-dimensional space and performs Bayesian optimization using a Gaussian Process model. This two-step approach reduces the curse of dimensionality by focusing optimization efforts on the relevant subspace.
- **Core assumption**: The objective function can be expressed as a low-dimensional function of a projection of the high-dimensional input, specifically f(x) = g(B^T x) where B is an orthogonal projection matrix and g is a smooth function.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Initially, we identify the effective dimension reduction (EDR) subspace for the objective function using the minimum average variance estimation (MAVE) method. Subsequently, we construct a Gaussian process model within this EDR subspace and optimize it using the expected improvement criterion."
  - [section] "Our main interest is to estimate the column vectors in B = (β1,β 2,...,β de ), which are referred to as EDR direction, and the corresponding dimension of the EDR space de."
  - [corpus] Found related papers on high-dimensional BO and dimension reduction methods, indicating this is an active research area.
- **Break condition**: The algorithm breaks down if the objective function does not have a low-dimensional structure or if the EDR subspace cannot be accurately estimated.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The alternating projection algorithm enables the method to handle general box constraints while maintaining theoretical guarantees.
- **Mechanism**: When projecting from the low-dimensional subspace back to the high-dimensional space, the resulting point may violate box constraints. The alternating projection algorithm projects the point alternately between the estimated EDR space and the constraint space until convergence, finding a point that satisfies both the subspace structure and the constraints.
- **Core assumption**: Both the constraint space (box constraints) and the estimated EDR space are closed convex sets, and their intersection is non-empty.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "Given that the input vector typically has a box-constraint, when a new point in the subspace is transformed back into high-dimensional space using a projection matrix, it may exceed this constraint. To address this issue, we propose an alternating projection algorithm."
  - [section] "Since both X and Y are closed convex sets, the alternating projection algorithm can be applied to find xz."
  - [corpus] Found related papers on projection methods and constraint handling in optimization.
- **Break condition**: The algorithm may fail to converge if the constraint space and EDR space do not intersect or if one of them is not convex.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The sequential approach allows balancing exploration-exploitation trade-off by distributing the sampling budget between subspace estimation and function optimization.
- **Mechanism**: The algorithm divides the total sampling budget N into two portions: N0 samples for estimating the EDR subspace and N-N0 samples for performing Bayesian optimization in the estimated subspace. This allocation allows the algorithm to first gather enough information to identify the relevant subspace before focusing on optimization within that subspace.
- **Core assumption**: The relationship between N0 and N can be chosen such that the subspace estimation error decreases sufficiently fast relative to the optimization error.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "In the sequential approach, we meticulously balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off by distributing the sampling budget between subspace estimation and function optimization."
  - [section] "In the sMAVE-BO, the budget is divided into two portions. The first portion is used to estimate the EDR directions and outputs a projection matrix estimator ˆB. The sampled point is then projected into the lower-dimensional space, and the algorithm uses the second portion to perform Bayesian optimization."
  - [section] "Corollary 1. Suppose both N0 → ∞ and N1 → ∞ as N → ∞. The simple regret of sMAVE-BO satisfies rN =OP (N^−3/D+4 0 logN0 + N^−1/d 1)."
- **Break condition**: If N0 is too small, the subspace estimation will be inaccurate; if N-N0 is too small, the optimization will be insufficient.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Effective Dimension Reduction (EDR) and the assumption that f(x) = g(B^T x)
  - Why needed here: This is the foundational assumption that makes high-dimensional Bayesian optimization tractable by reducing the problem to a lower-dimensional space.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the EDR space is uniquely defined under the orthonormality condition B^T B = I_d?

- **Concept**: Gaussian Process regression and the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)
  - Why needed here: The Gaussian Process model is used for optimization in the low-dimensional subspace, and understanding RKHS is crucial for the theoretical analysis of convergence rates.
  - Quick check question: How does the RKHS norm of the projected function g(B^T ˆB·) relate to the original function g and the estimation error of B?

- **Concept**: Alternating projection algorithms for finding points in the intersection of convex sets
  - Why needed here: This technique is essential for handling box constraints when mapping from the low-dimensional subspace back to the high-dimensional space.
  - Quick check question: Under what conditions does the alternating projection algorithm converge to a point in the intersection of two closed convex sets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data collection module -> MAVE estimator -> Projection module -> GP model -> Acquisition function optimizer -> Sampling -> Alternating projection module -> Sequential/Concurrent controller

- **Critical path**: Data collection → MAVE estimation → GP modeling → Acquisition optimization → Sampling → Alternating projection → Repeat

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Sequential vs. Concurrent approach: Sequential provides better theoretical guarantees but may be less adaptive; concurrent adapts EDR estimation but has weaker theoretical support
  - N0 allocation: Larger N0 improves subspace estimation but reduces optimization budget
  - Kernel choice: Different kernels affect GP performance and theoretical bounds

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor convergence: Indicates inaccurate EDR estimation or inappropriate kernel choice
  - Constraint violations: Suggests alternating projection is not converging
  - High regret: Could indicate either poor subspace estimation or insufficient optimization budget

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement MAVE estimation on synthetic data with known EDR structure and verify convergence
  2. Test alternating projection on simple box-constrained problems to verify constraint handling
  3. Run sequential algorithm on benchmark functions with known low-dimensional structure to validate performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal trade-off between exploration (subspace estimation) and exploitation (function optimization) in the sequential MA VE-BO algorithm?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the trade-off between subspace estimation and function optimization, but doesn't provide a definitive answer on the optimal balance.
- Why unresolved: The optimal balance likely depends on factors such as the true dimension of the EDR space, the smoothness of the function, and the available computational resources. Determining a universal optimal trade-off is challenging.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of sMA VE-BO with different allocation strategies between subspace estimation and function optimization across various benchmark functions and high-dimensional settings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of MA VE-BO scale with increasing dimensionality compared to other high-dimensional BO methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, but a comprehensive comparison with other methods across a wide range of dimensions is not provided.
- Why unresolved: Scaling behavior can be complex and depends on multiple factors. A thorough comparison across various dimensions and problem types is needed to understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of MA VE-BO.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive numerical studies comparing MA VE-BO with other high-dimensional BO methods (e.g., REMBO, SI-BO, PCA-BO) on benchmark functions across a wide range of dimensions (e.g., 10 to 1000).

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the alternating projection algorithm be extended to handle non-convex constraints in the high-dimensional BO setting?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper proposes an alternating projection algorithm for box constraints, but the extension to non-convex constraints is not discussed.
- Why unresolved: Non-convex constraints are common in many real-world optimization problems, but the convergence properties of alternating projection algorithms for non-convex sets are more complex and less well-understood.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of alternating projection algorithms for non-convex constraints, and numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of such an extension in the context of high-dimensional BO.

## Limitations
- Performance critically depends on existence of low-dimensional EDR structure in objective function
- Alternating projection algorithm may converge slowly or fail for complex constraint geometries
- Method's effectiveness diminishes when objective function cannot be well-approximated by low-dimensional structure

## Confidence
- Medium-High confidence in sequential approach theoretical guarantees
- Lower confidence in concurrent approach due to weaker theoretical foundations

## Next Checks
1. **EDR structure validation**: Test the algorithm on synthetic functions with known low-dimensional structure (f(x) = g(B^T x) + noise) to verify the theoretical convergence rate OP(N^(-3/D+4) 0 log N0 + N^(-1/d) 1) empirically holds across different dimension settings.
2. **Constraint handling robustness**: Evaluate the alternating projection algorithm's performance across problems with varying constraint geometries, measuring convergence rates and success rates in finding feasible points.
3. **Comparison with non-structured methods**: Benchmark against standard high-dimensional BO methods (random embeddings, additive models) on functions without clear EDR structure to quantify the method's limitations and identify failure modes.
