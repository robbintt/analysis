# Benchmarking the Fairness of Image Upsampling Methods

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2401.13555
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13555
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces fairness and diversity metrics for image upsampling, revealing significant bias across five tested methods when evaluated on both balanced and biased datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating fairness and diversity in image upsampling models, addressing a critical gap in conditional generative modeling research. The authors develop three novel fairness metrics inspired by supervised learning measures to quantify demographic representation in generated outputs. Through extensive experimentation with five upsampling methods (PULSE, pSp, fair-pSp, Posterior Sampling, and DDRM) across balanced and biased datasets, the study demonstrates that no tested method produces statistically fair results. The work establishes that dataset bias significantly impacts model fairness, with DDRM showing the most sensitivity to training data distribution, while highlighting the importance of unbiased datasets for achieving equitable representation in generated imagery.

## Method Summary
The authors create a benchmarking framework for conditional generative models focusing on image upsampling, introducing three new fairness metrics: Representation Demographic Parity (RDP), Proportional Representation (PR), and Conditional Proportional Representation (CPR). They construct UnfairFace, a deliberately biased subset of FairFace that replicates racial distributions found in common large-scale datasets. The framework evaluates five upsampling methods (PULSE, pSp, fair-pSp, Posterior Sampling, and DDRM) using these metrics alongside a diversity measure based on CLIP embeddings. Experiments compare model performance when trained on FairFace versus UnfairFace, revealing how dataset bias propagates through different architectural approaches to upsampling.

## Key Results
- No tested method (PULSE, pSp, fair-pSp, Posterior Sampling, DDRM) achieves statistically fair and diverse results when trained on either FairFace or UnfairFace
- DDRM shows the highest sensitivity to dataset bias, with fairness scores improving significantly when trained on FairFace versus UnfairFace
- Fairness metrics demonstrate high sensitivity to dataset imbalances, with RDP scores ranging from 0.83 to 1.00 and PR scores from 0.87 to 1.00 across different training conditions
- The proposed framework successfully identifies fairness violations across all methods, validating its effectiveness as a benchmarking tool

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None provided in source material.

## Foundational Learning

### Demographic Parity in Generative Models
- **Why needed:** Ensures generated outputs represent all demographic groups proportionally, preventing systematic exclusion of minorities
- **Quick check:** Verify demographic proportions in generated samples match those in training data

### CLIP-based Diversity Metrics
- **Why needed:** Provides quantitative measure of output variation across demographic attributes in high-dimensional feature space
- **Quick check:** Compare intra-class variance between generated and real images using CLIP embeddings

### Conditional Representation Analysis
- **Why needed:** Evaluates whether models generate appropriate representations for specific demographic conditions
- **Quick check:** Test model output consistency when conditioning on different demographic attributes

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Image conditioning → Upsampling network → Output generation → Fairness evaluation → Diversity assessment

### Critical Path
Input conditioning (identity/attributes) → Feature extraction → Upsampling layers → Pixel generation → Output filtering → Metric computation

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Dataset size vs. fairness:** Larger datasets may improve quality but can introduce bias if not carefully curated
- **Architectural complexity vs. fairness:** More complex models may better capture nuances but can amplify dataset biases
- **Evaluation speed vs. comprehensiveness:** Extensive fairness metrics provide thorough analysis but increase computational cost

### Failure Signatures
- Systematic underrepresentation of certain demographic groups in outputs
- Mode collapse showing reduced diversity across different conditions
- Conditional bias where specific attributes produce lower quality outputs

### First Experiments
1. Train DDRM on FairFace and UnfairFace, compare RDP and PR scores
2. Generate 1000 samples from each method with identity conditioning, evaluate demographic distribution
3. Apply CLIP-based diversity metrics to compare variation across methods on identical conditioning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in source material.

## Limitations
- Results are based on a single dataset split and may not generalize across different demographic groupings
- Experimental scope limited to five upsampling methods, constraining broader conclusions about method performance
- Focus on pixel-wise upscaling may not capture fairness issues in broader conditional generation contexts
- Fairness metrics depend heavily on chosen demographic categories from FairFace dataset

## Confidence
- **DDRM sensitivity to dataset bias:** High - clear quantitative improvements observed when trained on FairFace
- **Absolute fairness scores:** Medium - scores vary significantly with demographic distribution choices
- **Generalizability across methods:** Medium - limited to five specific upsampling approaches tested
- **Metric sensitivity to dataset imbalances:** High - consistent detection of fairness violations across all methods

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments across multiple random dataset splits and different demographic groupings to test stability of fairness metrics
2. Evaluate methods on additional diverse datasets with different demographic distributions to verify generalizability
3. Conduct user studies to correlate quantitative fairness metrics with human perception of generated image quality and demographic representation
