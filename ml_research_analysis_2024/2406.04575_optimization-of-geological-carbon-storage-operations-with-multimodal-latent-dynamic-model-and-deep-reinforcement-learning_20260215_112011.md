core_contribution: This study develops a deep learning framework called multimodal
  latent dynamic (MLD) model for geological carbon storage optimization. The MLD model
  uses a representation module to encode multimodal inputs (dynamic state variables,
  static parameters, fluid properties) into compressed latent states, a transition
  module to evolve these states in latent space, and a prediction module to forecast
  flow responses.

# Optimization of geological carbon storage operations with multimodal latent dynamic model and deep reinforcement learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.04575
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04575
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: MLD-RL framework achieves highest NPV for well control optimization while reducing computational costs by over 60% compared to traditional methods

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the computational challenges in geological carbon storage (GCS) optimization by developing a deep learning framework called the multimodal latent dynamic (MLD) model. The framework integrates representation learning, latent space dynamics modeling, and reinforcement learning to optimize well control decisions while significantly reducing computational costs. The MLD model processes multimodal inputs including dynamic state variables, static parameters, and fluid properties, encoding them into compressed latent states that evolve through time. When combined with soft actor-critic reinforcement learning, the resulting MSDRL algorithm demonstrates superior performance in maximizing net present value (NPV) for well control optimization while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The MLD model consists of three core components: a representation module that encodes multimodal inputs into latent states, a transition module that evolves these states in latent space, and a prediction module that forecasts flow responses. A novel training strategy combines regression loss with joint-embedding consistency loss to ensure temporal consistency and multi-step prediction accuracy. The framework employs soft actor-critic reinforcement learning to optimize well control decisions based on the MLD model's predictions. This approach enables efficient exploration of the decision space while maintaining accurate flow response predictions, achieving computational cost reductions exceeding 60% compared to traditional optimization methods.

## Key Results
- MLD-RL framework achieves the highest net present value (NPV) for well control optimization compared to traditional methods
- Computational costs reduced by over 60% while maintaining or improving optimization performance
- Strong generalization ability demonstrated across different geological scenarios
- Novel training strategy combining regression loss with joint-embedding consistency loss ensures temporal consistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MLD model's effectiveness stems from its ability to compress high-dimensional multimodal inputs into low-dimensional latent representations while preserving temporal dynamics. By operating in latent space rather than raw input space, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining predictive accuracy. The joint-embedding consistency loss ensures that the latent representations remain temporally consistent across multiple time steps, preventing error accumulation during multi-step predictions. The integration with soft actor-critic reinforcement learning allows for efficient exploration of the decision space while leveraging the MLD model's predictive capabilities to guide optimization toward high-NPV solutions.
