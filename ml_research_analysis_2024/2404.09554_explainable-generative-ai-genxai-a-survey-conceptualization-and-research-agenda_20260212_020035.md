# Explainable Generative AI (GenXAI): A Survey, Conceptualization, and Research Agenda

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.09554
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09554
- Reference count: 20
- This paper surveys and conceptualizes Explainable Generative AI (GenXAI) techniques, identifying novel challenges and desiderata arising from the unique characteristics of generative AI models.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Explainable Generative AI (GenXAI), addressing the growing need for transparency in generative AI models. The paper identifies unique challenges posed by GenAI's complex, high-impact outputs and proposes a taxonomy to categorize XAI methods based on explanation properties, input and internal characteristics, and foundational sources. The authors highlight the importance of verifiability, interactivity, and personalization in GenAI explanations and outline a research agenda with over ten future directions, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration to address open issues in the field.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a systematic literature review approach to survey existing XAI techniques and their applicability to generative AI models. The authors analyze various XAI methods, categorizing them based on explanation properties, input and internal characteristics, and foundational sources. They also conduct a thorough examination of the unique challenges posed by generative AI, such as complex outputs and high-stakes decision-making, to identify novel desiderata for GenXAI explanations. The research agenda is developed through synthesis of identified gaps and emerging trends in the field.

## Key Results
- Proposed taxonomy categorizes XAI methods for GenAI based on explanation properties, input and internal characteristics, and foundational sources.
- Identified novel challenges for GenXAI, including explaining interactions, dealing with complex outputs, and addressing ethical and regulatory concerns.
- Outlined a research agenda with over ten future directions, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in GenXAI development.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's approach works by systematically analyzing the intersection of XAI techniques and generative AI models, identifying unique challenges and opportunities. By proposing a comprehensive taxonomy and highlighting novel desiderata, the paper provides a structured framework for understanding and advancing GenXAI. The emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration addresses the complex nature of generative AI and its wide-ranging impacts, ensuring that diverse perspectives are considered in developing effective XAI solutions.

## Foundational Learning
- Generative AI models: Complex models that can create new data instances (e.g., text, images, audio).
  Why needed: Understanding the unique characteristics of GenAI is crucial for developing appropriate XAI techniques.
  Quick check: Can the model generate novel outputs beyond its training data?
- Explainable AI (XAI): Techniques and methods to make AI models more transparent and interpretable.
  Why needed: XAI is essential for building trust, ensuring fairness, and meeting regulatory requirements in AI applications.
  Quick check: Does the explanation method provide insights into the model's decision-making process?
- Taxonomy of XAI methods: A classification system for organizing and comparing different XAI approaches.
  Why needed: A taxonomy helps researchers and practitioners understand the landscape of XAI techniques and their applicability to different AI models.
  Quick check: Can the taxonomy accommodate new XAI methods as they emerge?
- Verifiability in XAI: The ability to confirm or refute the accuracy of explanations provided by AI models.
  Why needed: Verifiability is crucial for building trust and ensuring the reliability of AI systems, especially in high-stakes applications.
  Quick check: Can the explanations be independently verified or tested for accuracy?
- Interactivity in XAI: The capability of XAI systems to engage users in a dialogue or allow for dynamic exploration of explanations.
  Why needed: Interactive explanations can provide more tailored and context-specific insights, enhancing user understanding and trust.
  Quick check: Can users query or interact with the explanation system to gain deeper insights?
- Personalization in XAI: Adapting explanations to individual users' needs, background, and preferences.
  Why needed: Personalized explanations can improve user comprehension and trust, especially for non-expert users.
  Quick check: Can the explanation system adjust its output based on user characteristics or feedback?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: XAI Techniques -> Taxonomy Categories -> GenAI Challenges -> Research Agenda
Critical path: Literature Review → Taxonomy Development → Challenge Identification → Research Agenda Formulation
Design tradeoffs: Balancing comprehensiveness with specificity in the taxonomy; addressing general XAI challenges vs. GenAI-specific issues
Failure signatures: Incomplete coverage of emerging GenAI techniques; overlooking critical ethical considerations; failure to address real-world implementation challenges
First experiments:
1. Apply the proposed taxonomy to categorize a diverse set of existing XAI methods and evaluate its effectiveness.
2. Conduct a case study using the taxonomy to analyze a specific GenAI application and identify novel challenges.
3. Implement a prototype XAI system for a GenAI model based on the identified desiderata and evaluate its performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The rapidly evolving nature of generative AI may affect the survey's comprehensiveness shortly after publication.
- Many identified challenges and research directions are still in early stages, making practical feasibility difficult to assess.
- The applicability of the proposed taxonomy to future, unforeseen generative model architectures remains to be seen.

## Confidence
- Taxonomy and conceptualization: Medium
- Identification of novel challenges and desiderata: Medium
- Research agenda prioritization and importance: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a longitudinal study to assess how well the proposed taxonomy adapts to new GenAI techniques developed over the next 2-3 years.
2. Implement a subset of the proposed research directions to evaluate their practical feasibility and impact on real-world GenAI applications.
3. Perform user studies with diverse stakeholders (e.g., developers, end-users, regulators) to validate the identified desiderata for GenAI explanations and refine the proposed research agenda based on feedback.
