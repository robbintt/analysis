core_contribution: This paper introduces a non-autoregressive framework for accent
  conversion that learns accent-agnostic linguistic representations and employs them
  to convert the accent in the source speech. Specifically, the proposed system aligns
  speech representations with linguistic representations obtained from Text-to-Speech
  (TTS) systems, enabling training of the accent voice conversion model on non-parallel
  data.

- Primary result: Introduces a non-autoregressive framework for accent conversion using TTS-derived linguistic representations with non-parallel data

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel non-autoregressive framework for accent conversion that leverages linguistic representations extracted from Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of training accent conversion models without requiring parallel data by aligning speech representations with TTS-derived linguistic representations. The framework incorporates a pretraining strategy on native data and explores different acoustic features to enhance performance. Comprehensive evaluations using both subjective and objective metrics demonstrate significant improvements in audio quality and intelligibility.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework consists of two main components: a linguistic representation extractor and an accent conversion module. The system first extracts linguistic representations from TTS models, which serve as accent-agnostic features. These representations are then aligned with speech representations through a mapping mechanism. The accent conversion module learns to transform the source accent into the target accent using these aligned representations. A pretraining strategy on native data is employed to improve model performance, and various acoustic features are investigated to optimize the conversion process. The non-autoregressive nature of the framework enables efficient processing while maintaining conversion quality.

## Key Results
- The pretraining strategy on native data significantly enhances audio quality and intelligibility
- Incorporation of richer semantic features improves conversion performance
- The framework achieves effective accent conversion without requiring parallel training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by decoupling linguistic content from accent-specific features through the use of TTS-derived representations. By extracting accent-agnostic linguistic features from TTS systems, the framework can focus on learning accent transformation patterns independently of content preservation. The alignment between speech and linguistic representations enables the model to learn accent conversion mapping without parallel data constraints. The pretraining strategy helps the model better understand native speech patterns before learning accent conversion, while richer semantic features provide more detailed linguistic information for accurate conversion.

## Foundational Learning
- **Linguistic representations from TTS**: Abstract features capturing speech content independent of accent
  - Why needed: Provides accent-agnostic content features for conversion
  - Quick check: Verify TTS model quality and representation extraction capability
- **Non-parallel data training**: Learning accent conversion without paired source-target examples
  - Why needed: Addresses data scarcity in accent conversion tasks
  - Quick check: Ensure sufficient unpaired data coverage for both accents
- **Representation alignment**: Mapping between speech and linguistic feature spaces
  - Why needed: Enables learning accent conversion without parallel data
  - Quick check: Validate alignment accuracy across different speech segments
- **Pretraining strategy**: Initial training on native data before accent conversion
  - Why needed: Improves model understanding of target accent patterns
  - Quick check: Compare performance with and without pretraining
- **Acoustic feature selection**: Choice of features for speech representation
  - Why needed: Affects conversion quality and model efficiency
  - Quick check: Evaluate different feature sets for conversion accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: TTS System -> Linguistic Extractor -> Alignment Module -> Accent Conversion Model -> Output Speech

Critical path: Speech Input → Linguistic Representation Extraction → Alignment → Accent Conversion → Output Speech

Design tradeoffs:
- Non-autoregressive vs. autoregressive processing (speed vs. quality)
- Rich semantic features vs. computational efficiency
- Pretraining duration vs. final conversion performance
- Alignment complexity vs. conversion accuracy

Failure signatures:
- Poor alignment between speech and linguistic representations
- Loss of semantic content during conversion
- Inconsistent accent patterns in output
- Reduced audio quality compared to source speech

First 3 experiments:
1. Baseline accent conversion without pretraining or TTS representations
2. Impact of different acoustic feature sets on conversion quality
3. Comparison of various alignment strategies between speech and linguistic representations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
