# A Random Ensemble of Encrypted Vision Transformers for Adversarially Robust Defense

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.07183
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07183
- Authors: Ryota Iijima; Sayaka Shiota; Hitoshi Kiya
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes random ensemble of encrypted vision transformers for improved adversarial robustness

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel defense mechanism against adversarial examples in vision transformers (ViTs) through the use of encrypted image blocks and random ensemble selection. The approach combines block-wise encryption with a random ensemble strategy to create a robust defense system that maintains high accuracy on clean images while resisting various attack methods. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets against attacks including AutoAttack.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs block-wise encryption to transform input images before training individual vision transformer models. Multiple encrypted sub-models are created and combined into a random ensemble where test images are randomly assigned to sub-models for classification. This approach aims to introduce unpredictability and reduce the effectiveness of adversarial attacks by making it difficult for attackers to anticipate which encrypted version of the model will process a given input.

## Key Results
- Achieves high clean accuracy on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets
- Demonstrates robustness against various attack methods including AutoAttack
- Outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in terms of clean accuracy and robust accuracy
- Effective against both white-box and black-box attack scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The encryption introduces non-linearity and complexity that disrupts gradient-based optimization used in adversarial attacks. Random ensemble selection adds an additional layer of unpredictability, making it difficult for attackers to craft effective adversarial examples that work across all possible model variants. The combination of encryption and ensemble methods creates a defense that is robust to both known and unknown attack strategies.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Block-wise Encryption -> Encrypted ViT Models -> Random Ensemble Selection -> Classification Output

Critical Path:
1. Input image undergoes block-wise encryption
2. Encrypted image is processed by randomly selected ViT sub-model
3. Sub-model produces classification prediction
4. Random selection ensures different sub-models handle different inputs

Design Tradeoffs:
- Encryption adds computational overhead but improves robustness
- Random ensemble increases defense strength but may reduce consistency
- Multiple sub-models increase memory requirements but provide redundancy

Failure Signatures:
- Reduced accuracy on clean images if encryption is too aggressive
- Vulnerability to adaptive attacks that can bypass encryption
- Performance degradation if ensemble size is too small

First Experiments:
1. Test clean accuracy on CIFAR-10 with varying encryption strengths
2. Evaluate robustness against FGSM and PGD attacks
3. Measure inference time and memory usage for different ensemble sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for larger datasets and more complex models
- Computational overhead introduced by block-wise encryption
- Lack of comprehensive ablation studies to isolate method components' contributions
- Limited evaluation against diverse attack scenarios

## Confidence

High confidence in clean accuracy results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
Medium confidence in adversarial robustness claims against white-box attacks
Medium confidence in computational efficiency relative to baseline methods
Low confidence in generalizability to other model architectures and datasets

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of encryption and ensemble methods to overall robustness
2. Evaluate the method's performance under adaptive white-box attacks specifically designed to circumvent the encryption scheme
3. Perform computational complexity analysis and compare inference time and memory usage against non-encrypted baselines on larger-scale datasets
