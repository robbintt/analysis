# Predicting Ship Responses in Different Seaways using a Generalizable Force Correcting Machine Learning Method

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.08033
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08033
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: A hybrid ML method combining physics-based models with data-driven corrections achieves better generalizability across sea states than purely data-driven approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting ship responses in irregular waves that combines a low-fidelity physics-based model with a data-driven force correction term. The method is designed to improve generalizability across different sea states while requiring smaller training datasets compared to purely data-driven approaches. The approach is tested on two case studies: a nonlinear Duffing equation and a Fast Displacement Ship (FDS) in head seas. Results show the hybrid method outperforms LSTM benchmarks in prediction accuracy and generalizability, particularly in extreme wave conditions and when trained on small datasets. The inclusion of linear physics terms in the low-fidelity model is crucial for performance, especially in lower sea states where linear behavior dominates.

## Method Summary
The method embeds a data-driven force correction term into a low-fidelity equation of motion that includes linear physics terms (linear restoring forces, linear damping, and linearized wave excitation). A neural network learns the residual force corrections needed to match high-fidelity simulation data. The approach is trained on one wave condition and tested on others that differ in significant wave height and/or peak period. Performance is evaluated using L2 error, L∞ error, and Jensen-Shannon divergence of response distributions, with particular attention to extreme values and generalizability across varying sea states.

## Key Results
- The hybrid method achieves better prediction accuracy and generalizability than LSTM models, especially in extreme wave conditions
- The approach requires smaller training datasets while maintaining superior performance
- Including linear physics terms in the low-fidelity model is crucial for improving performance in lower sea states
- The method successfully generalizes from training on one wave condition to predicting responses in different sea states

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The hybrid method achieves better generalizability than the LSTM by retaining linear physics terms in the low-fidelity model. By embedding a data-driven force correction term into a low-fidelity model that includes linear physics (like linear restoring forces, linear damping, and linearized wave excitation), the hybrid model maintains correct dynamics at the linear limit while allowing the ML component to learn nonlinear corrections. This combination provides better performance in extreme wave conditions and smaller training datasets compared to purely data-driven models.

### Mechanism 2
The hybrid method requires a smaller training dataset than purely data-driven approaches while maintaining performance. The hybrid approach leverages existing physics-based knowledge to reduce the amount of data needed to learn the residual corrections. The ML component only needs to learn the differences between the low-fidelity and high-fidelity models, which is a smaller, more constrained problem than learning the entire system dynamics from scratch.

### Mechanism 3
The hybrid method provides more consistent performance across different wave conditions compared to purely data-driven approaches. By incorporating physics-based constraints, the hybrid model's predictions are bounded by the underlying physics model, preventing extreme prediction errors in conditions far from the training data. This leads to more stable performance across varying sea states.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Domain generalizability
  - Why needed here: The paper specifically addresses the challenge of making predictions on inputs (wave conditions) that differ from the training dataset, which is critical for design evaluations where novel conditions must be assessed.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes domain generalizability from interpolation performance in machine learning models?

- Concept: Physics-informed machine learning
  - Why needed here: The hybrid method combines physics-based models with ML techniques, requiring understanding of both domains and how they can be effectively integrated.
  - Quick check question: How does incorporating physics-based knowledge into ML models typically affect the amount of training data required?

- Concept: Zero-Up-Crossings (ZUCs) as a measure of training dataset size
  - Why needed here: The paper uses ZUCs as a meaningful metric for training dataset size, relating to the number of response periods rather than just time duration.
  - Quick check question: Why might measuring training dataset size in terms of wave Zero-Up-Crossings be more meaningful than using total time duration for seakeeping applications?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Low-fidelity physics model -> Neural network force correction -> Integration scheme -> Performance evaluation
- Critical path: Generate low-fidelity and high-fidelity response data for training conditions -> Compute force corrections by comparing low- and high-fidelity forces -> Train neural network to predict force corrections from state and wave elevation -> Use trained model to predict responses in new wave conditions -> Evaluate prediction accuracy against high-fidelity reference data
- Design tradeoffs: Including more physics in the low-fidelity model improves generalizability but reduces the learning capacity of the ML component; larger stencil sizes improve accuracy for systems with memory effects but increase computational cost; smaller training datasets reduce data requirements but may limit accuracy
- Failure signatures: Poor performance in low sea states suggests insufficient physics in the low-fidelity model; large errors in extreme wave conditions suggest the ML component cannot learn appropriate corrections; inconsistent performance across wave conditions suggests overfitting to training data
- First 3 experiments: Implement the hybrid method for the Duffing equation with different low-fidelity forcing models to observe the effect of physics inclusion on generalizability; vary the training dataset size (measured in ZUCs) to determine the minimum dataset required for acceptable performance; compare the hybrid method's performance against a pure LSTM approach across a range of wave conditions to quantify the benefits of physics integration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the neural-corrector method's performance compare to purely physics-based models in extreme sea states beyond those tested?
- How does the generalizability of the neural-corrector method hold up when trained on multiple seaways instead of just one?
- How does the neural-corrector method's performance scale with increasing ship size and complexity?

## Limitations

- The training data is limited to a single moderate wave condition, which may not capture the full range of nonlinearities present in extreme seas
- The comparison with LSTM models uses a relatively simple LSTM architecture that may not represent state-of-the-art data-driven approaches
- The low-fidelity physics model is based on linear strip theory, which may not adequately represent all aspects of ship dynamics for the Fast Displacement Ship hull form

## Confidence

- High confidence: The hybrid method's superior performance over LSTM in extreme wave conditions and with small training datasets is well-supported by experimental results
- Medium confidence: The claim that including linear physics terms is crucial for lower sea states where linear dynamics dominate is supported but could benefit from more systematic analysis
- Medium confidence: The assertion that the hybrid method requires smaller training datasets than purely data-driven approaches is demonstrated but the minimum dataset size needed is not rigorously established

## Next Checks

1. Systematically vary the training dataset size (measured in NZUC) across multiple orders of magnitude to identify the minimum dataset size required for acceptable performance, and compare this against the LSTM baseline under identical conditions.

2. Test the hybrid approach using different low-fidelity physics models (e.g., weakly nonlinear theory, different strip theory formulations) to assess whether the performance gains are robust to the choice of underlying physics.

3. Apply the method to full-scale experimental data from sea trials or model tests to verify that the model generalizes beyond synthetic simulation data, particularly for extreme sea states that are difficult to capture in controlled experiments.
