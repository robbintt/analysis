# Augmentations vs Algorithms: What Works in Self-Supervised Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.05726
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05726
- Reference count: 36
- This paper systematically compares self-supervised learning methods, showing that recent performance gains are largely driven by better data augmentations and larger models rather than algorithmic innovations.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically evaluates self-supervised learning (SSL) methods by unifying several frameworks to isolate the impact of different components. The authors find that recent SSL performance gains are primarily driven by data augmentation diversity and model scale rather than algorithmic innovations. By conducting extensive ablation studies, they demonstrate that prediction networks and momentum encoders have minimal average impact on downstream accuracy, while increasing augmentation diversity yields 2-4% gains and switching from ResNet-50 to ViT-B adds ~2.2%.

## Method Summary
The authors create a unified SSL framework that implements six different methods (SimCLR, BYOL, SwAV, MoCo-v2, DINO, MoCo-v3) using consistent architectures, training procedures, and hyperparameter tuning strategies. They systematically vary three key components: augmentations (five different strategies from simple cropping to multi-crop), algorithms (loss functions, momentum encoders, prediction networks), and architectures (ResNet-50 vs ViT-B). The evaluation uses ImageNet pretraining with linear probing as the downstream task.

## Key Results
- Augmentations constitute approximately 5% of reported performance improvement between early methods like SimCLR and modern methods like DINO
- Algorithmic improvements contribute a meager 2.1% to performance gains
- Model size increases (ResNet-50 to ViT-B) contribute an additional 2.3% improvement
- BYOL augmentations produced a 2.3% improvement by adding solarization and tweaking parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Recent SSL performance gains are driven primarily by data augmentation diversity and model scale rather than algorithmic innovations.
- Mechanism: The paper shows that increasing augmentation diversity yields 2-4% gains while switching from ResNet-50 to ViT-B adds ~2.2%, whereas algorithmic improvements like prediction networks and momentum encoders contribute only ~0.3% and ~1.8% respectively.
- Core assumption: The experimental framework can isolate the effects of each component (augmentations, algorithms, architectures) without confounding factors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our findings challenge the premise that SSL is being driven primarily by algorithmic improvements, and suggest instead a bitter lesson for SSL: that augmentation diversity and data / model scale are more critical contributors to recent advances"
  - [section 5] "we observe the surprising result that augmentations constitute approximately 5% of the reported performance improvement between early methods like SimCLR and modern methods like DINO, while model size appears to contribute an additional 2.3%. Algorithmic improvements constitute a meager 2.1%"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The pretraining task (training loss) has minimal impact on downstream task performance when augmentations and architectures are properly tuned.
- Mechanism: The paper demonstrates that with proper tuning of augmentations, momentum encoders, and prediction networks, all ResNet-based methods perform equivalently within margin of error, and MoCo v3 can match DINO's 78.2% accuracy.
- Core assumption: Different pretraining losses (contrastive, clustering, similarity-based) can achieve similar performance when other factors are controlled.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we compare the relative performance impact of algorithms and augmentations, and observe the surprising result that augmentations constitute approximately 5% of the reported performance improvement"
  - [section 5] "we find that the pretraining task is unimportant and that performance gains are mostly driven by increasing scale...and increasing augmentation diversity"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Subtle changes in augmentation hyperparameters can substantially affect results in SSL literature.
- Mechanism: The paper shows that BYOL augmentations (which only slightly modified SimCLR's augmentations by adding solarization and tweaking parameters) produced a 2.3% improvement on average across settings.
- Core assumption: The specific augmentation hyperparameters (strengths, probabilities, distributions) have significant impact beyond just the types of augmentations used.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "BYOL augmentations produced a fairly strong improvement relative to SimCLR augmentations, averaging 2.3% across settings...This suggests that subtle and often understated changes in the augmentation strategy can substantially affect results"
  - [section 5] "we also find that the impact of BYOL augmentations is more significant for models using a momentum encoder, with SimCLR and SwA V seeing a smaller benefit than other methods"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Joint embedding self-supervised learning
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on instance-based joint embedding methods, so understanding this framework is essential for interpreting the experimental results
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of the joint embedding framework described in Section 2 (towers, augmentations, loss functions, momentum encoders, prediction networks)?

- Concept: Data augmentation strategies and their hyperparameters
  - Why needed here: The paper systematically varies augmentation strategies from simple cropping to complex multi-crop approaches, showing their significant impact
  - Quick check question: How do the five augmentation strategies (Crop, Crop + Color, SimCLR, BYOL, Multi-crop) differ in terms of augmentation types and hyperparameters?

- Concept: Momentum encoders and prediction networks in SSL
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates the impact of these algorithmic components, finding they contribute less than augmentations but still have measurable effects
  - Quick check question: What is the functional difference between using a momentum encoder versus directly connecting both towers, and how does a prediction network prevent representation collapse?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input data → Augmentations → Two towers (encoder → projector → predictor) → Loss computation → Gradient updates (left tower parameters; momentum update for right tower if applicable)
- Critical path: Input data → Augmentations → Two towers (encoder → projector → predictor) → Loss computation → Gradient updates (left tower parameters; momentum update for right tower if applicable)
- Design tradeoffs: Using momentum encoders adds stability but may slow adaptation; prediction networks prevent collapse but add complexity; more diverse augmentations improve performance but increase training time and complexity
- Failure signatures: Training instability (especially with ViT-based methods), representation space collapse (when prediction networks are absent in similarity-based methods), performance degradation when batch sizes are too large or too small
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the augmentation ablation study by training SimCLR with each of the five augmentation strategies and measuring downstream accuracy
  2. Implement the algorithm ablation by training with and without momentum encoders and prediction networks for a contrastive method
  3. Test the architecture impact by training the same method with ResNet-50 vs ViT-B using identical augmentations and algorithms

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why do clustering methods like SwAV perform worse when prediction networks are added, while contrastive methods like SimCLR and MoCo-v2 improve?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper reports that clustering methods observe a performance degradation from adding prediction networks, while contrastive methods universally see an improvement.
- Why unresolved: The authors note they don't understand why prediction networks are detrimental to clustering methods, and the mechanism behind this difference remains unexplained.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of the learned representations from clustering vs contrastive methods with/without prediction networks, or theoretical analysis of how prediction networks affect the clustering loss landscape.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What causes the training instability in ViT-based SSL methods like MoCo-v3 when using multi-crop augmentations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that MoCo-v3 is negatively impacted by multi-crop due to training instability, similar to instability originally reported in Chen et al. (2021).
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the instability but doesn't investigate its root cause or propose a definitive solution.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments isolating the factors in multi-crop that trigger instability (e.g., local view resolution, batch size interactions, gradient norms) or theoretical analysis of how multi-crop affects the optimization dynamics in ViT-based SSL.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do data augmentations interact with different SSL algorithms at a mechanistic level?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows that BYOL augmentations provide more benefit to methods using momentum encoders, suggesting algorithmic-augmentation interactions, but doesn't explore why.
- Why unresolved: While the paper measures augmentation impacts, it doesn't investigate the underlying mechanisms of how specific augmentations interact with different algorithmic components.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed ablation studies testing individual augmentations across algorithms, or analysis of how augmentations affect representation similarity/distribution in different algorithmic frameworks.

## Limitations

- The unified framework may not fully capture all nuances of individual SSL methods, potentially missing method-specific optimizations
- Results are primarily based on ImageNet and may not generalize to other datasets or domains
- The analysis focuses on linear probing evaluation, which may not reflect performance on fine-tuning or other downstream tasks
- Architectural differences between ResNet and ViT (e.g., attention mechanisms) may have unmeasured interactions with specific algorithms

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The relative impact of augmentations vs algorithmic improvements (5% vs 2.1% contribution to performance gains)
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that pretraining task is unimportant when other factors are controlled
- **Medium confidence**: The specific numerical impact values (2-4% for augmentations, 2.2% for architecture) may vary with different implementations

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the augmentation ablation study on a different dataset (e.g., CIFAR-100) to test generalizability
2. Conduct fine-tuning experiments in addition to linear probing to verify the robustness of the findings
3. Implement additional SSL methods not covered in the study (e.g., Barlow Twins) to test if the conclusions hold across a broader range of algorithms
