# Unsupervised Composable Representations for Audio

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.09792
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09792
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Unsupervised audio source separation outperforming supervised baselines using latent diffusion models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an unsupervised framework for learning compositional representations of audio through diffusion models operating in the latent space of pre-trained neural audio codecs. The approach decomposes complex audio mixtures into interpretable latent variables that can be recomposed using simple operators. By leveraging a parameter-sharing diffusion model and learning a masking diffusion prior, the system achieves high-quality source separation and enables both unconditional and conditional generation of audio without supervision.

## Method Summary
The method maps raw audio to a pre-trained neural audio codec latent space, then compresses these latents through a semantic encoder into low-dimensional univariate latents. A parameter-sharing diffusion model conditions on these latents to reconstruct individual sources, which are recomposed using simple operators like mean or sum. The framework also learns a masking diffusion prior to enable joint unconditional and conditional generation tasks by randomly masking subsets of latents during training.

## Key Results
- Outperforms non-neural baselines and surpasses supervised state-of-the-art (Demucs) on SI-SIR metrics
- Achieves high-quality reconstructions with robust performance across different composition operators
- Enables seamless integration of source separation, unconditional generation, and variation generation
- Demonstrates lower computational cost by operating in pre-trained codec latent space

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The model learns interpretable, compositional latent variables by using a frozen neural audio codec as a bottleneck and constraining the semantic encoder to map to low-dimensional space. The pre-trained EnCodec compresses audio into a high-level latent space; the semantic encoder then further reduces this to a set of univariate latents, forcing each to capture a distinct semantic factor. These latents are fed to a parameter-shared diffusion model that reconstructs the mixture when recomposed via a simple operator (mean/sum). Core assumption: The frozen EnCodec already provides some disentanglement, and low-dimensional latents will align with individual sources.

### Mechanism 2
Using a parameter-shared diffusion model for all latent variables is as effective as training separate models, reducing computational cost while maintaining separation quality. A single diffusion model conditioned on different latents (via concatenation) learns a shared generative prior over all sources; this shared parameterization captures commonalities across sources while still conditioning on distinct latents. Core assumption: Source generation tasks share enough statistical structure to benefit from shared weights.

### Mechanism 3
Learning a masking diffusion prior in the latent space enables joint unconditional and conditional generation without additional supervision. By randomly masking subsets of the latent variables and training the diffusion model to reconstruct them, the model learns both unconditional generation (all masked) and conditional generation (some masked). This supports accompaniment generation and variation synthesis. Core assumption: The latent space is structured so that masking subsets corresponds to removing/keeping sources.

## Foundational Learning

- **Diffusion models and denoising score matching**: Why needed here: The paper builds the decoder as a diffusion model conditioned on semantic latents; understanding how diffusion reverses a noising process is essential to follow the training objective and architecture. Quick check question: What is the role of the noise level parameter α in IADB diffusion models?

- **Autoencoder latent spaces and disentanglement**: Why needed here: The framework uses a pre-trained codec plus a semantic encoder to compress data; knowing how bottlenecks encourage disentanglement helps explain why the method can separate sources without labels. Quick check question: Why does reducing the latent dimensionality help enforce compositional structure?

- **Source separation evaluation metrics (SI-SDR, SI-SIR, SI-SAR)**: Why needed here: The quantitative results are reported in these metrics; understanding their interpretation is critical to assess whether the model actually improves separation quality. Quick check question: Which metric best captures the amount of other sources present in a separated track?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw audio mixture -> EnCodec latent space -> Semantic encoder -> Univariate latents -> Parameter-sharing diffusion model -> Source estimates -> Composition operator -> Reconstructed mixture

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Encode mixture → latents
  2. Diffusion denoising conditioned on latents → source estimates
  3. Recombine estimates → reconstructed mixture
  4. (Optional) Mask latents → generate missing sources

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Using a frozen pre-trained codec speeds training and leverages existing disentanglement, but ties the method to that codec's quality
  - Parameter-sharing diffusion model reduces compute but may hurt if sources are very different
  - Simple composition operators (mean/sum) are fast and stable but may not capture complex interactions

- **Failure signatures**: 
  - Poor SI-SIR/SDR indicates latents are not source-aligned
  - High MSE in latent space indicates reconstruction collapse
  - FAD scores much worse than unconditional baselines suggest the prior model is not learning the latent distribution well

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train on Drums+Bass subset, evaluate SI-SDR/SI-SIR vs baselines
  2. Vary number of latent variables (N=2 vs N=3) and composition operator (mean vs sum)
  3. Train masking diffusion prior, generate missing source given the other, evaluate FAD and MSE against ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How can the learned latent variables be guaranteed to encode meaningful and disentangled information about distinct audio sources? The paper acknowledges this as a limitation and suggests further research into methods like those proposed by Wang et al. (2023) to address this issue.

- **Open Question 2**: How does the dimensionality of the latent space influence the representation content and performance of the model? The paper suggests that investigating strategies such as Information Bottleneck could help trade off expressiveness with compression, but does not provide a definitive answer.

- **Open Question 3**: How would using more complex functions or learnable operators affect the interpretability and performance of the learned representations? The paper mentions this as an interesting research direction for studying the interpretability of learned representations.

## Limitations
- Method depends heavily on quality of pre-trained EnCodec; performance could degrade if latent space doesn't align with source structure
- Parameter-sharing diffusion models may underperform when sources have highly distinct characteristics
- Masking-based prior model assumes source-aligned latents, but this alignment is not guaranteed without supervision

## Confidence
- **High**: General framework design and computational efficiency claims
- **Medium**: Unsupervised separation performance surpassing supervised baselines
- **Low**: Claims about seamless integration of decomposition and generation tasks

## Next Checks
1. **Latent space alignment test**: Visualize latent trajectories for individual sources versus mixtures to verify source-aligned structure in the EnCodec space
2. **Ablation on diffusion architecture**: Compare parameter-sharing diffusion model against separate models for each latent variable on a subset of sources
3. **Generalization evaluation**: Test the trained model on out-of-domain audio (different genres or source combinations) to assess robustness beyond Slakh2100
