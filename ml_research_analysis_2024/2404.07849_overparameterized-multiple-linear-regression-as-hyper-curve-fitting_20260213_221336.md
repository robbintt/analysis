# Overparameterized Multiple Linear Regression as Hyper-Curve Fitting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.07849
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07849
- Authors: E. Atza; N. Budko
- Reference count: 24
- This paper proposes a hyper-curve fitting approach to overparameterized multiple linear regression, addressing the problem of interpretability and prediction accuracy in the presence of noisy or improper predictors.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to overparameterized multiple linear regression by reinterpreting the problem as hyper-curve fitting. The method parameterizes data with a single scalar parameter, enabling predictor-focused analysis where each predictor is described as a function of this parameter. By leveraging this reformulation, the authors develop a regularization scheme using polynomial basis truncation and an algorithm for identifying and removing improper predictors. The approach is validated on both synthetic and experimental chemometric data, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional methods.

## Method Summary
The method involves sorting data by the dependent variable, constructing a monomial basis matrix, and computing coefficient matrices through ordinary least squares or exact methods. Regularization is achieved by truncating the polynomial basis to an optimal degree determined via cross-validation on training data. An algorithm for predictor removal identifies and eliminates predictors with large column-wise prediction errors. The approach is applied to both synthetic datasets with polynomial relationships and non-functional dependencies, as well as experimental chemometric data (28 NIR spectra of PET yarns).

## Key Results
- The hyper-curve approach produces exact predictions even with nonlinear dependencies in fundamentally overparameterized datasets
- Regularization through polynomial basis truncation effectively handles noise while maintaining prediction accuracy
- The predictor removal algorithm successfully identifies and eliminates improper predictors, improving model interpretability
- On experimental chemometric data, the method achieves significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to standard PCR/PLS approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Overparameterized linear regression can be reinterpreted as fitting a hyper-curve parameterized by a single scalar.
- Mechanism: When the dataset is fundamentally overparameterized (rank q ≤ p), the solution to the underdetermined system can be written as a function of a single parameter s, effectively reducing the model from a p-dimensional hyperplane to a 1-dimensional curve.
- Core assumption: The dataset has the topological structure of a curve in (p+1)-dimensional space, meaning all data points lie on a 1D manifold.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This equivalence allows for a predictor-focused approach, where each predictor is described by a function of the chosen parameter."
  - [section 2] "Topologically this means that on such datasets the MLR model is not a hyper-plane as suggested by its mathematical form, but a hyper-curve, parameterizable by a single scalar parameter"
- Break condition: If the data contains higher-dimensional manifolds or non-functional relationships that cannot be parameterized by a single scalar, the hyper-curve equivalence breaks down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The hyper-curve approach enables regularization by truncating the polynomial basis, effectively reducing sensitivity to noise.
- Mechanism: By representing predictor functions in a monomial basis and truncating higher-order terms, the method filters out noise contributions that manifest as high-frequency components in the polynomial expansion.
- Core assumption: Noise in the data primarily affects higher-degree polynomial coefficients, and the underlying signal can be captured with lower-degree polynomials.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "we shall nevertheless be sorting all our data by the magnitude of y + ϵ... the optimally regularized representation of a noisy data-column minimizes the error between the exact (noiseless) column and its regularized representation"
  - [section 4] "truncating the number of terms of the monomial basis used to represent the column functions appears to be the most natural regularization approach"
- Break condition: If noise affects lower-degree coefficients or if the signal itself requires high-degree polynomials, truncation regularization will degrade performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Predictor removal algorithm identifies and eliminates "improper" predictors that violate model assumptions, improving interpretability and prediction accuracy.
- Mechanism: By computing column-wise prediction errors on test data and setting a threshold based on training data, predictors that cannot be well-represented as functions of the dependent variable are removed from the model.
- Core assumption: Predictors that produce large prediction errors when modeled as functions of y are either noisy or have non-functional relationships to y.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "we introduce the column-wise test set prediction error... One would, naturally, like to remove the predictors with large χj's"
  - [section 5] "We define the optimal threshold τopt to be the one for which the feature-removal error ρ(y) with r = r* is minimal"
- Break condition: If the threshold selection is too conservative, useful predictors may be removed; if too permissive, improper predictors remain in the model.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and rank of matrices
  - Why needed here: Understanding dataset rank is crucial for identifying fundamentally overparameterized datasets and determining when the hyper-curve equivalence holds
  - Quick check question: Given a data matrix with rank 5 and 20 predictors, what is the maximum number of training samples needed for the dataset to be fundamentally overparameterized?

- Concept: Polynomial basis functions and Vandermonde matrices
  - Why needed here: The regularization approach relies on representing predictor functions in a polynomial basis, and understanding when the Vandermonde matrix is invertible
  - Quick check question: For what values of y will a Vandermonde matrix with monomial basis be invertible?

- Concept: Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
  - Why needed here: The method uses cross-validation to select the optimal polynomial degree and threshold for predictor removal
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper use the error in X-data (ρ(Xv)) rather than y-data (ρ(yv)) for cross-validation when tuning the polynomial degree?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing: sorting by dependent variable, applying Wiener filter for noise
  - Basis construction: building monomial basis matrix V
  - Coefficient estimation: solving for coefficient matrix A using OLS or exact methods
  - Regularization: determining optimal polynomial degree r* via cross-validation
  - Predictor removal: computing column-wise errors and applying threshold τopt
  - Prediction: using regularized model with retained predictors

- Critical path: Data → Basis + Coefficient Estimation → Regularization → Predictor Removal → Prediction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Global vs. per-column regularization: simpler implementation vs. more precise noise handling
  - Complete vs. overcomplete training: computational efficiency vs. numerical stability
  - Fixed threshold vs. adaptive threshold: simplicity vs. optimal performance

- Failure signatures:
  - Prediction errors not decreasing with increasing training samples: may indicate non-functional relationships
  - Optimal polynomial degree r* consistently high: may indicate excessive noise or need for higher-dimensional modeling
  - Many predictors removed: may indicate dataset contains significant noise or non-functional relationships

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the method to synthetic data with known polynomial relationships and varying noise levels to validate the regularization and predictor removal components
  2. Test the method on chemometric data (like the yarn dataset) to verify real-world applicability and compare with standard PCR/PLS approaches
  3. Evaluate the method on data with known non-functional relationships to confirm the predictor removal algorithm correctly identifies improper predictors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective is per-column regularization in the polynomial IR model compared to global regularization for detecting and removing 'improper' predictors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that a flexible per-column regularization approach does not necessarily result in better prediction of the test y data compared to the traditional global regularization approach, but suggest a separate investigation is warranted.
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents preliminary numerical experiments comparing these approaches and does not provide conclusive evidence on the superiority of one method over the other.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing the performance of per-column and global regularization approaches on various datasets, evaluating both the prediction accuracy and the effectiveness in detecting and removing 'improper' predictors.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the PARCUR model be effectively applied to predictor data that exhibit jump-like changes with the dependent variable, such as microbiome, metabolome, or genetic data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that successful application of the IR model to these types of data will depend on finding a suitable basis for the column function space, e.g., a piecewise-continuous finite-element basis.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any concrete examples or numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the PARCUR model on predictor data with jump-like changes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Numerical experiments applying the PARCUR model with different basis functions to datasets exhibiting jump-like changes in predictor variables, evaluating the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the results.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the PARCUR model be extended to handle higher-dimensional manifold data, such as two-parameter hyper-surface models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that a two-parameter hyper-surface model would be a natural extension of the present single-parameter hyper-curve model, as nonlinear functional relations between predictors and the dependent variable produce data situated on higher-dimensional manifolds.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any details on how to construct or implement such a two-parameter hyper-surface model, nor does it present any numerical experiments demonstrating its effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical framework and numerical experiments demonstrating the construction and implementation of a two-parameter hyper-surface model, evaluating its ability to handle higher-dimensional manifold data and improve prediction accuracy compared to the single-parameter hyper-curve model.

## Limitations

- The hyper-curve fitting approach relies critically on the assumption that fundamentally overparameterized datasets form 1-dimensional manifolds in predictor space, limiting applicability to datasets with complex multi-dimensional structures.
- The method's performance is sensitive to noise characteristics - if noise affects lower-degree polynomial coefficients or the signal requires high-degree polynomials, the regularization approach may degrade rather than improve predictions.
- The predictor removal algorithm depends on appropriate threshold selection, which may not generalize well across different datasets or noise regimes.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mathematical equivalence between overparameterized MLR and hyper-curve fitting for fundamentally overparameterized datasets is well-established through linear algebra arguments and supported by numerical experiments.
- **Medium confidence**: The predictor removal algorithm shows promise in identifying improper predictors, but its effectiveness depends heavily on the threshold selection process. The experimental validation on chemometric data provides encouraging results, but more diverse real-world datasets would strengthen confidence.
- **Low confidence**: The paper's claims about superior interpretability improvements are primarily demonstrated through qualitative assessment of predictor removal rather than quantitative metrics for interpretability.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Apply the method to multiple chemometric datasets with varying characteristics (different numbers of samples, predictors, and noise levels) to assess generalizability beyond the yarn dataset.

2. **Comparison with established methods**: Benchmark the hyper-curve fitting approach against state-of-the-art methods for handling overparameterized regression (like elastic net, LARS, or advanced PLS variants) on datasets with known ground truth relationships.

3. **Non-functional relationship stress test**: Systematically evaluate the predictor removal algorithm on datasets with increasing proportions of non-functional relationships to determine its sensitivity threshold and false positive/negative rates.
