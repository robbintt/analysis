# Holistic Evaluation for Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.14643
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14643
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: First comprehensive benchmark for interleaved text-and-image generation with novel evaluation metric

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces INTERLEAVED BENCH, the first benchmark designed for evaluating interleaved text-and-image generation, which requires models to generate content with both text and images in arbitrary order. The authors also propose INTERLEAVED EVAL, a reference-free evaluation metric based on GPT-4o that assesses five key aspects: text quality, perceptual quality, image coherence, text-image coherence, and helpfulness. The benchmark covers diverse real-world use cases, including multimodal script generation, visual storytelling, and document completion. Experiments show that INTERLEAVED EVAL correlates better with human judgments than previous metrics, and existing models struggle with the complexity of interleaved generation, especially on tasks requiring high image coherence. The work highlights significant challenges in this emerging area and provides a comprehensive framework for future research.

## Method Summary
The authors develop INTERLEAVED BENCH as a comprehensive benchmark for interleaved text-and-image generation tasks, covering real-world use cases like multimodal script generation, visual storytelling, and document completion. They propose INTERLEAVED EVAL, a reference-free evaluation metric based on GPT-4o that assesses five key dimensions: text quality, perceptual quality, image coherence, text-image coherence, and helpfulness. The evaluation framework uses GPT-4o to score model outputs without requiring reference outputs, making it more practical for real-world applications. The benchmark is designed to test models' ability to generate coherent multimodal content in arbitrary sequences, reflecting the complexity of real-world multimodal generation scenarios.

## Key Results
- INTERLEAVED EVAL shows better correlation with human judgments than existing metrics
- Existing models struggle significantly with interleaved generation, particularly image coherence tasks
- The benchmark successfully identifies key challenges in multimodal generation across diverse use cases
- Models show varying performance across different task types, with visual storytelling being particularly challenging

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by creating a realistic benchmark that mirrors actual use cases where text and images need to be generated in arbitrary sequences, rather than isolated tasks. By using GPT-4o as a reference-free evaluator, the system can assess the holistic quality of generated content without requiring perfect reference outputs, which are often unavailable in real-world scenarios. The five-dimensional evaluation captures the multifaceted nature of multimodal generation quality, including both individual modality quality and cross-modality coherence. This comprehensive approach reveals weaknesses in current models that simpler benchmarks might miss.

## Foundational Learning
**Multimodal generation** - Understanding how to generate both text and images in coherent sequences
*Why needed*: Interleaved generation requires seamless switching between modalities
*Quick check*: Can the system generate a coherent story with alternating text and images?

**Cross-modal coherence** - Ensuring text and images complement and support each other
*Why needed*: Without coherence, the multimodal output becomes disjointed
*Quick check*: Do the generated images accurately represent the accompanying text?

**Reference-free evaluation** - Assessing quality without perfect reference outputs
*Why needed*: Reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world scenarios
*Quick check*: Can the evaluation metric consistently score outputs of similar quality?

**Real-world use cases** - Focusing on practical applications rather than synthetic tasks
*Why needed*: Ensures the benchmark reflects actual user needs
*Quick check*: Does the benchmark cover scenarios users actually encounter?

**Perceptual quality assessment** - Evaluating the aesthetic and clarity aspects of generated images
*Why needed*: Image quality affects overall user experience
*Quick check*: Are the generated images visually clear and appealing?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: INTERLEAVED BENCH -> INTERLEAVED EVAL -> Five evaluation dimensions -> Model performance assessment

**Critical path**: Benchmark task generation -> Model output generation -> GPT-4o evaluation across five dimensions -> Performance aggregation

**Design tradeoffs**: Reference-free vs. reference-based evaluation (flexibility vs. potential bias), comprehensive vs. focused evaluation (completeness vs. complexity)

**Failure signatures**: Poor image coherence, weak text-image alignment, low perceptual quality, insufficient helpfulness in outputs

**First experiments**: 
1. Test INTERLEAVED EVAL on simple interleaved generation tasks with known quality levels
2. Compare model performance across different use case categories
3. Validate human correlation by having multiple evaluators score the same outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, though it implicitly raises questions about the generalizability of the evaluation framework across different cultural contexts and the optimal balance between text and image generation in various use cases.

## Limitations
- GPT-4o based evaluation may introduce bias from the underlying model's capabilities and training data
- Benchmark coverage may not represent all practical scenarios where interleaved generation is needed
- Correlation with human judgments needs validation across different evaluator groups and cultural contexts
- Performance gap between models and human-level quality remains unclear
- The five-dimensional evaluation may miss some aspects of multimodal quality

## Confidence
- High confidence: The benchmark is first-of-its-kind and covers diverse use cases
- Medium confidence: INTERLEAVED EVAL correlates better with human judgments than previous metrics
- Medium confidence: Existing models significantly struggle with interleaved generation complexity
- Low confidence: The evaluation framework's generalizability across cultural contexts

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-cultural human evaluation studies to validate the generalizability of INTERLEAVED EVAL across different demographic groups
2. Test the benchmark's coverage by applying it to real-world industrial applications beyond the current use cases
3. Compare INTERLEAVED EVAL's performance against human evaluators on tasks with varying complexity levels and cultural contexts
4. Investigate the impact of different text-image ratio preferences across various cultural contexts and use cases
