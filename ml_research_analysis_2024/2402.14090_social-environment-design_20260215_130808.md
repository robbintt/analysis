# Social Environment Design

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.14090
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14090
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Introduces a general framework for AI-assisted automated policy-making connecting Reinforcement Learning, EconCS, and Computational Social Choice communities.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes Social Environment Design as a general framework for using AI to assist in automated policy-making. The framework models economic policy design as a Stackelberg game between a Principal (policy-maker) and economic participants (followers), where the Principal commits to policies that induce a partially observable Markov game among followers. The framework incorporates voting on policy objectives and enables systematic analysis of government and economic policy through AI simulation, highlighting key open problems for future research including preference aggregation, democratic representation, and modeling human behavior.

## Method Summary
The method involves implementing and training a multi-agent reinforcement learning environment based on the Social Environment Design framework, using the Apple Picking Game as a specific example. The approach uses PPO training with parameter sharing for player agents, separate discrete action spaces for the principal, and a two-phase curriculum with tax annealing. Agents report types representing their values, which are processed by a social choice function to produce an objective that guides the Principal's policy design. The Principal then optimizes the induced POMG to maximize this objective while respecting a divergence constraint.

## Key Results
- Introduces a general framework connecting RL, EconCS, and Computational Social Choice for AI-assisted policy-making
- Demonstrates how preference elicitation and tax policy can align policy-maker incentives with sustainability and equality goals
- Releases a core implementation as a Sequential Social Dilemma Environment with code
- Characterizes open problems and prospective solution concepts for advancing AI's application in economic policy design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Stackelberg-Nash game structure allows the Principal to commit to a policy that induces a Nash equilibrium among followers, thereby achieving systematic policy optimization.
- Mechanism: By modeling the economy as a POMG and having the Principal commit to an action that induces a low-level game, the Principal can influence follower behavior through the design of the transition function and rewards while respecting a divergence constraint.
- Core assumption: Followers respond rationally to the induced POMG and converge to a Nash equilibrium or a δ-best response.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We suggest addressing the concern of a misaligned policy-maker with 'Voting on Values (Hanson, 2013),' coupled with a Principal policy-maker who seeks to achieve suggested policy goals."
  - [section] "At a high level, we frame the economic design problem as a Stackelberg game between the policy designer and economic participants."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers discuss taxation policy and economic simulation but do not directly validate the Stackelberg-Nash game mechanism.
- Break condition: If followers cannot compute or converge to a Nash equilibrium due to computational constraints or non-rational behavior, the Principal's optimization becomes ineffective.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Voting Mechanism aggregates diverse agent preferences into a social welfare objective that guides the Principal's policy design.
- Mechanism: Agents report types representing their values, which are processed by a social choice function to produce an objective. The Principal then optimizes the induced POMG to maximize this objective.
- Core assumption: The social choice function accurately aggregates preferences and the reported types reflect true agent values.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The framework seeks to capture general economic environments, includes voting on policy objectives, and gives a direction for the systematic analysis of government and economic policy through AI simulation."
  - [section] "Agents report types representing their values, which are processed by a social choice function to produce an objective."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers on mechanism design and computational social choice do not directly address the continuous type space and voting on objectives proposed here.
- Break condition: If the voting mechanism fails to represent minority views or the aggregation introduces bias, the Principal's objective may not align with collective welfare.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Apple Picking Game demonstrates how preference elicitation and tax policy can align policy-maker incentives with sustainability and equality goals.
- Mechanism: Players vote on Utilitarian vs. Egalitarian objectives, and the Principal designs tax rates to influence player behavior towards the chosen objective, balancing immediate rewards with long-term sustainability.
- Core assumption: The Principal can effectively influence player behavior through extrinsic rewards without direct control over intrinsic motivations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We release a core implementation of our framework as a Sequential Social Dilemma Environment along with code."
  - [section] "The Apple Picking Game demonstrates how preference elicitation and tax policy can align policy-maker incentives with sustainability and equality goals."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers discuss taxation and economic simulation but do not validate the specific game dynamics and preference elicitation mechanism.
- Break condition: If players do not respond to tax incentives or the Principal cannot accurately model player behavior, the policy design becomes ineffective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Stackelberg Games
  - Why needed here: The framework models the Principal as a leader committing to a policy that induces a follower game, requiring understanding of Stackelberg equilibria.
  - Quick check question: In a Stackelberg game, who moves first and how does this affect the follower's strategy?
- Concept: Partially Observable Markov Games (POMG)
  - Why needed here: The economic environment is modeled as a POMG where agents have partial observations and interact over time.
  - Quick check question: How does the observation function B in a POMG differ from the transition function T?
- Concept: Mechanism Design
  - Why needed here: The Voting Mechanism is a form of mechanism design where agents report types to influence the social choice function.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between direct and indirect mechanism design?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Voting Mechanism: Agents report types → Social choice function → Principal objective
  - Stackelberg Game: Principal commits to action → Induces POMG → Followers play → Principal optimizes
  - Induced Economy: POMG with agents → Transition function T, reward r, observation B → Agent policies π
- Critical path: Voting Mechanism → Stackelberg Game → Induced Economy → Policy optimization
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. computational tractability: More complex POMG increases realism but requires more computational resources.
  - Centralization vs. decentralization: Centralized control by the Principal simplifies optimization but may not capture distributed decision-making.
- Failure signatures:
  - Agents fail to converge to Nash equilibrium: Indicates issues with follower learning or non-rational behavior.
  - Voting mechanism produces unstable objectives: Suggests problems with preference aggregation or type reporting.
  - Principal optimization diverges: May indicate issues with divergence constraints or reward shaping.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple Stackelberg game with one Principal and two followers in a gridworld environment. Verify that the Principal can influence follower behavior through policy design.
  2. Extend the Stackelberg game to a POMG with partial observations. Test whether the Principal can still optimize its policy under observation constraints.
  3. Integrate the Voting Mechanism with the Stackelberg game. Validate that the Principal's objective aligns with the aggregated agent preferences and leads to desired outcomes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the framework handle simulating economies with thousands or millions of agents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need to scale the model to larger systems, including accommodating an increasing number of agents and more intricate interactions among them.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence or theoretical analysis on the scalability limits of the framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the framework with a significantly larger number of agents and analyzing its performance and computational requirements would provide evidence for its scalability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the role of scale in the effectiveness of the framework?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the importance of scaling the framework to model real-world complexities and the need to examine scaling laws of the model parameters and computational resources.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss the relationship between the scale of the simulated economy and the framework's effectiveness in capturing real-world complexities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying scales of simulated economies and analyzing the framework's performance and ability to capture real-world phenomena would provide insights into the role of scale.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the framework handle modeling bounded rationality and cognitive biases in human economic behavior?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the need to model human behavior within the simulator, including bounded rationality and cognitive biases such as time-inconsistent preferences and loss aversion.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any implementation details or empirical results on incorporating bounded rationality and cognitive biases into the framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and implementing agent behavior models that capture bounded rationality and cognitive biases, and evaluating their performance in the framework compared to human data, would provide evidence for the framework's ability to model these aspects of human behavior.

## Limitations

- The framework assumes followers will rationally converge to Nash equilibria, which may not hold for real-world economic agents with bounded rationality.
- The social choice function's ability to accurately aggregate diverse preferences is uncertain, especially for complex, multidimensional value spaces.
- The Apple Picking Game demonstration, while illustrative, may not capture the full complexity of real economic systems or generalize to broader policy domains.

## Confidence

- Stackelberg-Nash game mechanism: Medium confidence - While the theoretical framework is sound, empirical validation of convergence and effectiveness in complex economic environments is limited.
- Voting mechanism for preference aggregation: Medium confidence - The paper presents the mechanism but lacks comprehensive analysis of its robustness to strategic voting or preference misrepresentation.
- Apple Picking Game demonstration: Low confidence - The game serves as a proof-of-concept but may not capture the full complexity of real economic systems or generalize to broader policy domains.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct computational experiments to test the convergence properties of followers in POMGs with varying levels of complexity and partial observability. Measure the impact of non-convergence on the Principal's ability to optimize policy.
2. Implement and test the social choice function under different preference distributions and strategic voting scenarios to assess its robustness and fairness in aggregating diverse values.
3. Extend the Apple Picking Game to include multiple economic sectors and interdependent resources, validating whether the framework can scale to more complex policy problems while maintaining computational tractability.
