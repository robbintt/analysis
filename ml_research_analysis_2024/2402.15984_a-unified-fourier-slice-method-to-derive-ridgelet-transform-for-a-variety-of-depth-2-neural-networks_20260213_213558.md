# A unified Fourier slice method to derive ridgelet transform for a variety of depth-2 neural networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.15984
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15984
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Primary result**: Unified Fourier slice method derives ridgelet transforms for depth-2 neural networks on diverse domains (finite fields, group convolutions, symmetric spaces, pooling layers)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a unified Fourier slice method for systematically deriving ridgelet transforms across various depth-2 neural network architectures. The ridgelet transform acts as a pseudo-inverse operator mapping functions to parameter distributions that reproduce them through the network. The authors demonstrate that by converting network representations into Fourier expressions and applying a three-step process involving Fourier inversion, variable changes, and separation-of-variables assumptions, ridgelet transforms can be derived for classical fully-connected networks, group convolutional networks on abstract Hilbert spaces, networks on finite fields, networks on noncompact symmetric spaces, and pooling layers. The method provides constructive proofs of universal approximation theorems for these network types.

## Method Summary
The unified Fourier slice method transforms neural networks into Fourier space to systematically derive ridgelet transforms. The three-step process involves: (1) converting the network into a Fourier expression using convolution identities, (2) changing variables to separate principal and auxiliary components, and (3) assuming a separation-of-variables form for the unknown parameter distribution. This approach unifies the derivation of ridgelet transforms across diverse architectures including finite field networks, group convolutional networks, networks on noncompact symmetric spaces, and pooling layers. The method relies on Fourier transform and inversion formulas being valid for the function classes involved and assumes the network operator and ridgelet operator are mutual inverses up to a scalar factor.

## Key Results
- Systematic derivation of ridgelet transforms for depth-2 networks across diverse architectures (finite fields, group convolutions, symmetric spaces, pooling layers)
- Constructive proofs of universal approximation theorems for corresponding networks
- Unified framework that generalizes classical ridgelet analysis beyond fully-connected networks
- Demonstrated that the Fourier slice method can handle various activation functions without relying on specific properties of ReLU

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The Fourier slice method systematically derives ridgelet transforms by converting neural networks into Fourier expressions and applying Fourier inversion.
- **Mechanism**: The network is first transformed into Fourier space via convolution identities, then variables are changed to separate principal and auxiliary components, and finally a separation-of-variables form is assumed to solve for the parameter distribution.
- **Core assumption**: The Fourier transform and inversion formulas are valid for the function classes involved (e.g., tempered distributions, Schwartz functions).
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "we explain a systematic method using Fourier expressions to derive ridgelet transforms"
  - [section]: "Using the convolution in b, we can turn the network into the Fourier expression... Change variables... Put unknown γ in the separation-of-variables form"
  - [corpus]: Weak—no explicit citations about Fourier slice methodology in neighbors.
- **Break Condition**: If the Fourier inversion fails (e.g., due to insufficient decay or singularities), the reconstruction formula breaks.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The ridgelet transform acts as a pseudo-inverse operator mapping a target function to a parameter distribution that reproduces it via the network.
- **Mechanism**: Given a function f, the ridgelet transform computes a distribution γ such that S[γ] = f, effectively inverting the network's integral representation.
- **Core assumption**: The network operator S and ridgelet operator R are mutual inverses up to a scalar factor ((σ, ρ)).
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The ridgelet transform is a pseudo-inverse operator that maps a given function f to the parameter distribution γ so that a network NN[γ] reproduces f"
  - [section]: "Theorem 1.1 (Reconstruction Formula)... S[R[f; ρ]] = ((σ, ρ))f"
  - [corpus]: Missing—neighbors do not discuss ridgelet transform properties.
- **Break Condition**: If ((σ, ρ)) = 0 or the function classes violate invertibility conditions, the reconstruction fails.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The method extends ridgelet analysis from classical fully-connected networks to diverse architectures (finite fields, group convolutions, symmetric spaces, pooling layers).
- **Mechanism**: Each architecture's specific integral representation is Fourier-transformed, variables changed to isolate principal/auxiliary parts, and a separable form is assumed to derive the corresponding ridgelet transform.
- **Core assumption**: Each network type admits a Fourier expression that decouples into principal and auxiliary factors in a tractable way.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "derive ridgelet transforms for a variety of modern networks such as networks on finite fields Fp, group convolutional networks on abstract Hilbert space H..."
  - [section]: Case studies in §§ 3-6 systematically apply the 3-step method to each architecture.
  - [corpus]: Weak—neighbors mention neural networks and ridgelets but not the unified Fourier slice method.
- **Break Condition**: If the network's structure does not permit a clean Fourier expression or variable change, the method cannot be applied.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Fourier transform and inversion on Euclidean and abstract spaces
  - Why needed here: The entire derivation hinges on converting network representations into Fourier space and inverting them.
  - Quick check question: Can you state the Fourier inversion formula for L² functions on ℝᵐ and explain when it holds?

- **Concept**: Integral representations and pseudo-inverse operators
  - Why needed here: The ridgelet transform is defined as a pseudo-inverse to the integral representation of the network.
  - Quick check question: What is the reconstruction formula linking S and R, and under what conditions does it hold?

- **Concept**: Group representation theory and homogeneous spaces
  - Why needed here: Cases II and III involve group convolutions and functions on symmetric spaces, requiring understanding of group actions and invariant measures.
  - Quick check question: How does the Iwasawa decomposition facilitate the Fourier analysis on noncompact symmetric spaces?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Network integral representation → Fourier expression → Variable change → Separation-of-variables form → Ridgelet transform
- **Critical path**: Apply Fourier slice method → Validate reconstruction formula → Test universality on sample functions
- **Design tradeoffs**: General applicability vs. need for explicit Fourier expressions; choice of auxiliary function ρ for convergence
- **Failure signatures**: Non-invertible Fourier transforms, singular ((σ, ρ)), failure of separation-of-variables assumption
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate the classical fully-connected case and verify S[R[f; ρ]] = ((σ, ρ))f numerically.
  2. Apply the method to a group convolutional network with finite cyclic group and check equivariance preservation.
  3. Test the ridgelet transform for a pooling layer (k-affine) and confirm it captures singularities.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the Fourier slice method be extended to deep neural networks beyond depth-2 architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "Good News: After the initial submission of this manuscript, the authors have successfully developed the ridgelet transform for deep networks in Sonoda et al. (2023a,b)."
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions success in extending the method to deep networks, the specific details and limitations of this extension are not discussed in the current paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed explanation of the methodology used to extend the Fourier slice method to deep networks, including any new challenges encountered and how they were overcome.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of activation function σ affect the properties of the ridgelet transform and the resulting neural network's expressiveness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "the ridgelet transform for the specific case of fully-connected ReLU layers" has been investigated, and that "we do not need to rely on the specific features of ReLU, nor need to rely on Taylor expansions/density arguments/randomized assumptions to deal with nonlinear activation functions."
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions that the method can handle various activation functions, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how different activation functions affect the ridgelet transform or the network's expressiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing the ridgelet transforms and network expressiveness for various activation functions, including ReLU, leaky ReLU, sigmoid, and others.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the Fourier slice method be applied to other types of neural network architectures, such as recurrent or graph neural networks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on depth-2 fully-connected networks, group convolutional networks, and fully-connected networks on noncompact symmetric spaces, but does not discuss other types of architectures.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the applicability of the Fourier slice method to other neural network architectures, leaving open the question of whether the method can be generalized to these domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: A demonstration of the Fourier slice method applied to recurrent or graph neural networks, including the derivation of the corresponding ridgelet transforms and analysis of their properties.

## Limitations

- The paper's claims heavily rely on the validity of Fourier transforms and inversion formulas across various function spaces, yet explicit conditions for these operations are not thoroughly established for all network types
- The separation-of-variables assumption in step 3 is not proven to be necessary or unique; alternative forms may exist or be required for certain architectures
- The treatment of measure-theoretic aspects for infinite-dimensional cases (particularly for group convolutional networks on abstract Hilbert spaces) remains underdeveloped

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The general framework and three-step methodology are logically coherent and well-structured
- **Medium confidence**: The classical fully-connected network case (Case I) follows established Fourier analysis techniques
- **Low to Medium confidence**: The extensions to group convolutions, symmetric spaces, and pooling layers, while promising, lack detailed validation of the underlying mathematical assumptions

## Next Checks

1. **Convergence verification**: For each network architecture, explicitly verify the convergence conditions for the Fourier inversion step, particularly for tempered distributions and Schwartz functions
2. **Separation assumption testing**: Systematically explore whether the assumed separation-of-variables form is indeed necessary or if alternative forms could yield valid ridgelet transforms for the same networks
3. **Numerical reconstruction validation**: Implement the ridgelet transforms for each network type and numerically verify the reconstruction formula S[R[f; ρ]] = ((σ, ρ))f for a diverse set of test functions, including singular functions and compactly supported functions
