# Weakly-Supervised Residual Evidential Learning for Multi-Instance Uncertainty Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.04405
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04405
- Authors: Pei Liu; Luping Ji
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces MIREL, improving instance-level uncertainty estimation in MIL by up to 16.67% in confidence estimation and 10.39% in out-of-distribution detection.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Multi-Instance Residual Evidential Learning (MIREL), a novel approach for uncertainty estimation in multiple instance learning (MIL) where only weak instance annotations are available. MIREL jointly models high-order predictive distributions at both bag and instance levels using Dirichlet distributions, enabling more accurate quantification of predictive uncertainty. The method introduces a residual estimator derived via the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions, allowing separate learning of instance-specific uncertainties. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing MIL uncertainty estimation methods, particularly for instance-level tasks, and show that MIREL can enhance the uncertainty capabilities of existing MIL architectures.

## Method Summary
MIREL addresses uncertainty estimation in MIL by modeling predictive distributions at two levels: bag and instance. At the bag level, it estimates the overall distribution over possible labels. For instance-level uncertainty, MIREL uses the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions to derive a residual estimator that captures instance-specific uncertainties beyond what can be inferred from the bag-level distribution. The method employs Dirichlet distributions to represent both levels of uncertainty, allowing principled probabilistic reasoning. MIREL is designed to be compatible with existing MIL architectures, enhancing their uncertainty estimation capabilities without requiring complete architectural overhauls.

## Key Results
- Improves instance-level confidence estimation by up to 16.67% compared to existing methods
- Enhances out-of-distribution detection performance by up to 10.39%
- Demonstrates effectiveness across benchmark MIL datasets for both bag and instance-level uncertainty tasks
- Shows that MIREL can be integrated with existing MIL networks to improve their uncertainty estimation capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MIREL works by addressing the fundamental challenge in MIL where instance-level labels are unavailable. Traditional MIL approaches aggregate instance features to predict bag labels, but this aggregation obscures instance-level uncertainties. MIREL's key insight is to use Dirichlet distributions to model the uncertainty at both bag and instance levels separately. The residual estimator, derived from the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions, captures the gap between what can be inferred from the bag-level distribution and the true instance-level uncertainty. This separation allows MIREL to learn instance-specific uncertainties even when only bag-level supervision is available, providing more accurate and calibrated uncertainty estimates for downstream tasks.

## Foundational Learning

### Dirichlet Distribution Modeling
- **Why needed**: Provides a principled way to represent uncertainty over categorical distributions, essential for modeling predictive uncertainty in classification tasks
- **Quick check**: Verify that the concentration parameters of the Dirichlet distribution remain positive and well-conditioned during training

### Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Functions
- **Why needed**: Enables decomposition of symmetric functions (like bag-level predictions) into individual instance contributions, critical for deriving the residual estimator
- **Quick check**: Confirm that the symmetric function decomposition preserves the probabilistic semantics of the original distribution

### Multiple Instance Learning Framework
- **Why needed**: Understanding the bag-instance relationship and weak supervision paradigm is crucial for appreciating MIREL's contribution
- **Quick check**: Ensure the MIL dataset follows the standard assumption that a positive bag contains at least one positive instance

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Bag-Level Predictor -> Dirichlet Distribution -> Instance-Level Predictor -> Residual Estimator -> Final Uncertainty Estimation

### Critical Path
The most critical path is: Instance features → Bag-Level Predictor → Dirichlet Distribution parameters → Instance-Level Predictor → Residual Estimator. This path determines how instance-level uncertainties are derived from bag-level information.

### Design Tradeoffs
MIREL trades computational complexity for improved uncertainty estimation accuracy. The use of Dirichlet distributions and symmetric function decomposition increases model parameters and inference time but provides more nuanced uncertainty quantification. The residual estimator adds a separate learning objective but enables instance-specific uncertainty modeling.

### Failure Signatures
Performance degradation may occur when: (1) the bag-level predictor fails to capture meaningful patterns, (2) the residual estimator overfits to noise due to weak supervision, or (3) the Dirichlet concentration parameters become degenerate (near-zero or extremely large values).

### First Experiments
1. Verify baseline MIL performance on a simple dataset before adding MIREL components
2. Test the residual estimator's ability to capture known instance-level uncertainties in a controlled synthetic dataset
3. Evaluate uncertainty calibration using proper scoring rules (e.g., negative log-likelihood) on held-out data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily on synthetic and benchmark MIL datasets, potentially limiting real-world applicability
- Computational overhead of modeling high-order distributions may be prohibitive for large-scale applications
- Effectiveness of the residual estimator may be sensitive to hyperparameter choices and problem-specific structures
- Limited exploration of performance in noisy, high-dimensional, or domain-shifted real-world scenarios

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Theoretical foundation using Dirichlet distributions is sound | High |
| Empirical improvements in uncertainty metrics are promising | Medium |
| Scalability and robustness in real-world scenarios | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MIREL on diverse real-world MIL datasets with varying degrees of label noise and class imbalance to assess robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the residual estimator and Dirichlet distribution modeling to overall performance improvements
3. Benchmark MIREL against state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation methods in both MIL and non-MIL contexts to determine generalizability and comparative advantages
