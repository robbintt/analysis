# Benchmarking Defeasible Reasoning with Large Language Models -- Initial Experiments and Future Directions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.12509
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12509
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Preliminary experiments show LLMs can perform monotonic reasoning correctly but struggle with nonmonotonic patterns involving conflicting rules without clear priorities

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating defeasible reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), adapted from an existing defeasible logic reasoner test suite. The benchmark translates defeasible rules into natural language statements suitable for LLM evaluation. Initial experiments using ChatGPT reveal that while the model performs well on monotonic reasoning tasks, it struggles significantly with nonmonotonic reasoning patterns, particularly when dealing with conflicting rules without explicit priorities. The authors observe that ChatGPT tends to assume a closed-world view and requires well-structured input for interpretable inference steps. These findings suggest that while LLMs show promise for defeasible reasoning, substantial work remains to enhance their nonmonotonic reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a benchmark for defeasible reasoning by adapting an existing defeasible logic reasoner test suite. They translated formal defeasible rules into natural language statements that LLMs could process. Preliminary experiments were conducted using ChatGPT across various reasoning patterns, comparing performance on monotonic versus nonmonotonic reasoning tasks. The evaluation focused on how well the model could handle defeasible rules, particularly in scenarios involving conflicting rules and priority assignments.

## Key Results
- ChatGPT correctly performs monotonic reasoning tasks but struggles with nonmonotonic reasoning patterns
- The model has difficulty handling conflicting rules without clear priority assignments
- ChatGPT tends to apply monotonic rules to derive conclusions and assumes a closed-world view
- Well-structured input is necessary for interpretable inference steps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark leverages the ability of LLMs to process natural language instructions and perform logical reasoning tasks when presented with clearly structured input. By translating formal defeasible rules into natural language statements, the approach bridges the gap between formal logic systems and the text-based processing capabilities of LLMs. The mechanism relies on the model's capacity to parse relationships between statements, apply reasoning patterns, and generate conclusions based on the provided rules and facts.

## Foundational Learning

**Defeasible Reasoning**: Nonmonotonic reasoning that allows conclusions to be retracted when new information becomes available. Why needed: Forms the core evaluation domain for the benchmark. Quick check: Verify understanding of how conclusions can be overturned by new conflicting evidence.

**Monotonic vs Nonmonotonic Reasoning**: Monotonic reasoning maintains conclusions once derived, while nonmonotonic reasoning allows retraction of conclusions. Why needed: The paper distinguishes between these two types of reasoning in evaluating LLM performance. Quick check: Confirm ability to identify scenarios where conclusions should be retractable.

**Closed-World Assumption**: The assumption that what is not known to be true is false. Why needed: The paper identifies this as a limitation in LLM reasoning behavior. Quick check: Recognize when an LLM might incorrectly assume facts not explicitly stated.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Benchmark Translation -> Natural Language Rules -> LLM Input -> Reasoning Output -> Evaluation
**Critical Path**: Rule translation → Prompt construction → LLM inference → Result validation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Natural language translation enables LLM compatibility but may introduce semantic ambiguity; single model evaluation provides focused insights but limits generalizability
**Failure Signatures**: Incorrect handling of conflicting rules, application of monotonic reasoning to nonmonotonic scenarios, closed-world assumption errors
**First Experiments**:
1. Test monotonic reasoning patterns with varying complexity levels
2. Evaluate performance on simple conflicting rule scenarios with explicit priorities
3. Assess closed-world assumption tendencies by introducing implicit information

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental scope limited to a single model (ChatGPT) rather than multiple LLM architectures
- Small subset of the full benchmark evaluated, lacking statistical significance measures
- Translation process from formal rules to natural language not validated for semantic preservation
- Closed-world assumption critique not systematically investigated with different prompting strategies

## Confidence
- **LLMs have promising but limited defeasible reasoning abilities**: Medium
- **ChatGPT struggles with nonmonotonic reasoning involving conflicting rules**: Medium
- **Natural language translation may introduce semantic artifacts**: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments across multiple LLM architectures (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) to determine whether observed limitations are model-specific or represent broader architectural constraints
2. Conduct ablation studies on the natural language translation process, testing formal rule representations alongside natural language versions to isolate translation effects
3. Systematically vary prompt structure and formatting to assess the impact of input presentation on defeasible reasoning performance, particularly for conflicting rule scenarios
