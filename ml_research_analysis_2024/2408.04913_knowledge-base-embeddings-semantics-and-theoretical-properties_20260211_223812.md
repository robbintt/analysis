# Knowledge Base Embeddings: Semantics and Theoretical Properties

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.04913
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04913
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Knowledge base embedding methods lack strong theoretical guarantees, particularly for handling role disjointness and the bottom concept

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a theoretical analysis of knowledge base embedding methods through the lens of geometric-based semantics. The authors introduce formal definitions for properties like soundness, completeness, and faithfulness, and systematically evaluate recent embedding methods against these criteria. The study reveals that while some methods satisfy certain properties, none achieve all desirable characteristics. The research highlights fundamental limitations in current approaches, particularly in handling role disjointness and the bottom concept, and calls for future work to address these theoretical gaps to improve the foundations of KB embeddings.

## Method Summary
The paper examines knowledge base embedding methods through a theoretical lens, focusing on their geometric-based semantics and properties like soundness, completeness, and faithfulness. The authors introduce formal definitions for these properties and investigate how recent embedding methods, such as Convex Geometric Models, Al-Cone Models, ELEm, EmEL++, ELBE, BoxEL, Box2EL, BoxE, and ExpressivE, fit into this theoretical framework. The study reveals that while some methods satisfy certain properties, none achieve all desirable characteristics, particularly in handling role disjointness and the bottom concept.

## Key Results
- No existing embedding method satisfies all desirable theoretical properties simultaneously
- Role disjointness and bottom concept representation remain major challenges for current methods
- Soundness and completeness are difficult to achieve together in practical embedding methods
- Strong faithfulness prevents novel fact prediction, creating a trade-off with practical utility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Embedding methods that preserve classical model properties (soundness and completeness) can guarantee that the geometric-based model captures the true logical structure of the knowledge base.
- Mechanism: Soundness ensures that if a geometric-based model exists, the knowledge base is satisfiable in the classical sense; completeness ensures that every satisfiable knowledge base has a geometric-based model. Together, these properties create a bridge between the classical and geometric semantics.
- Core assumption: The geometric-based model's satisfaction relation aligns closely enough with classical model satisfaction that properties like entailment closure and faithfulness can be meaningfully defined and checked.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This paper examines knowledge base embedding methods through a theoretical lens, focusing on their geometric-based semantics and properties like soundness, completeness, and faithfulness."
  - [section] "Property 1 (Embedding method soundness)... We say that M under SM is sound for L if the existence of an M-model (under SM ) for a KB K in L implies that K is satisfiable."
  - [corpus] "Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies..."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The ability to capture logical patterns (like symmetry, hierarchy, and composition) in the embedding method ensures that the geometric model can represent complex relational structures inherent in the knowledge base.
- Mechanism: Embedding methods that can capture specific patterns ensure that the geometric representation respects the logical constraints encoded in the knowledge base, allowing for more accurate reasoning and prediction tasks.
- Core assumption: The geometric regions and transformations used in the embedding method are expressive enough to represent the logical patterns without loss of information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The authors conclude that practical embedding methods often lack strong theoretical guarantees, and future research should focus on addressing these limitations to improve the theoretical foundations of KB embeddings."
  - [section] "Definition 7 (Capturing patterns (adapted from (Abboud et al., 2020))). Let L be a language of patterns and let E be an M-embedding. E interpreted under SM..."
  - [corpus] "Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link prediction, and recommendation systems."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Strong faithfulness guarantees that the geometric-based model only satisfies axioms that are logical consequences of the knowledge base, preventing the model from making spurious inferences.
- Mechanism: By ensuring that only entailed axioms are satisfied in the geometric model, strong faithfulness maintains the integrity of the logical reasoning process, preventing the model from drawing conclusions not supported by the knowledge base.
- Core assumption: The embedding method's semantics are precise enough to distinguish between entailed and non-entailed axioms, and the model can accurately represent this distinction geometrically.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We identify several relevant theoretical properties, which we draw from the literature and sometimes generalize or unify."
  - [section] "Definition 6 (Strong faithfulness of an M-model (adapted from ( ¨Ozc ¸ep, Leemhuis, and Wolter, 2020))) . Let T be a TBox in L and A an ABox such that K = T ∪ A is satisfiable. We say that an M-model E of K is..."
  - [corpus] "Despite the ubiquity of vector search applications, prevailing search algorithms overlook the metric structure of vector embeddings, treating it as a constraint rather than exploiting its underlying properties."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Description Logic (DL) syntax and semantics
  - Why needed here: Understanding the basic syntax and semantics of DL is crucial for grasping how knowledge bases are represented and how embedding methods aim to preserve their logical structure.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a TBox and an ABox in DL, and how are they used to represent conceptual and factual knowledge, respectively?

- Concept: Geometric regions and transformations in vector spaces
  - Why needed here: Embedding methods rely on representing concepts and roles as geometric regions (e.g., convex cones, boxes) and transformations (e.g., affine transformations) in vector spaces, so understanding these concepts is essential for grasping how the logical structure is encoded geometrically.
  - Quick check question: How do convex cones, boxes, and affine transformations differ in their ability to represent logical relationships, and what are the trade-offs between them?

- Concept: Properties of embedding methods (soundness, completeness, faithfulness, expressiveness)
  - Why needed here: These properties define the theoretical guarantees of embedding methods and determine their ability to accurately represent and reason over knowledge bases, so understanding them is crucial for evaluating and comparing different methods.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between weak and strong faithfulness, and why is strong faithfulness a stronger guarantee for ensuring the integrity of logical reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Knowledge Base (KB) -> Embedding Method -> Geometric-Based Semantics -> Loss Function -> Scoring Function

- Critical path:
  1. Parse the KB and identify its components (concepts, roles, individuals).
  2. Apply the embedding method to map KB components to geometric structures.
  3. Define the geometric-based semantics to interpret the embedding.
  4. Optimize the embedding using the loss function to satisfy the KB knowledge.
  5. Use the scoring function to evaluate and rank facts or axioms.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. Computational Efficiency: More expressive geometric structures (e.g., convex cones) can represent more complex logical relationships but may be computationally more expensive to optimize.
  - Theoretical Guarantees vs. Practical Performance: Methods with strong theoretical guarantees (e.g., soundness, completeness) may not always perform best in practice, while methods with weaker guarantees may be more efficient but less reliable.
  - Handling Role Disjointness and Bottom Concept: Many methods struggle to accurately represent these constructs, leading to failures in soundness, completeness, or faithfulness.

- Failure signatures:
  - Inability to represent role disjointness or the bottom concept: Indicates limitations in the expressiveness of the geometric structures used.
  - Violation of soundness or completeness: Suggests that the geometric model does not accurately capture the logical structure of the KB.
  - Failure of faithfulness properties: Indicates that the model is making spurious inferences not supported by the KB.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple embedding method (e.g., BoxE) and test its ability to represent basic DL concepts (e.g., concept inclusion, role assertions) in a small KB.
  2. Evaluate the soundness and completeness of the embedding method by checking if the geometric model accurately captures the satisfiability of the KB.
  3. Test the faithfulness properties (weak and strong) by verifying if the geometric model only satisfies axioms that are logical consequences of the KB.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a region-based embedding method achieve soundness and completeness while handling role disjointness and the bottom concept?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "the main difficulties encountered for fulfilling the properties are related to the ability of representing role disjointness (together with facts!) and the bottom concept."
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that current methods either fail to represent role disjointness or the bottom concept correctly, leading to issues with soundness, completeness, or both. No existing method satisfies all desired properties simultaneously.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new embedding method that provably satisfies soundness and completeness for a DL language including role disjointness and the bottom concept, with theoretical guarantees and/or empirical validation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is there a trade-off between expressiveness (e.g., full KB-expressiveness) and the ability to make novel predictions in KB embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors suggest that "strong ABox-faithful M-models are unable to predict new plausible facts that are not entailed by the KB," implying a potential trade-off between expressiveness and prediction ability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between expressiveness and prediction performance. It remains unclear whether more expressive methods necessarily sacrifice predictive capabilities.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study comparing the prediction performance of different embedding methods with varying levels of expressiveness, demonstrating the trade-off or lack thereof.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the theoretical properties of KB embeddings relate to their practical performance in downstream tasks like query answering?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that "recent works in the KG literature focus on query answering" and suggest extending their properties to consider queries.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on theoretical properties but does not empirically evaluate how these properties impact performance in practical tasks like query answering. The relationship between theory and practice remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: An empirical study evaluating the performance of different embedding methods in query answering tasks, correlating their theoretical properties with their practical effectiveness.

## Limitations

- Current methods cannot simultaneously achieve soundness, completeness, and proper handling of role disjointness and bottom concept
- Theoretical analysis lacks extensive empirical validation of practical performance
- No standardized benchmarks exist for evaluating expressiveness of embedding methods

## Confidence

- Soundness and Completeness Analysis: Medium-High
- Faithfulness Properties: Medium-Low
- Expressiveness Evaluation: Low

## Next Checks

1. **Formal Verification**: Implement automated theorem proving to verify the soundness and completeness of selected embedding methods against formal DL axioms.

2. **Empirical Evaluation**: Design experiments to test the practical performance of embedding methods on KBs with known logical structures, focusing on their ability to capture role disjointness and the bottom concept.

3. **Benchmark Development**: Create standardized benchmarks for evaluating the expressiveness of embedding methods, including a diverse set of logical patterns and complex KB structures.
