# The Case for Globalizing Fairness: A Mixed Methods Study on Colonialism, AI, and Health in Africa

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.03357
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03357
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Colonialism is proposed as a fairness attribute for ML health applications in Africa, with expert consensus on its relevance despite general population skepticism

## Executive Summary
This paper explores fairness considerations for machine learning in health applications across Africa, focusing on how colonial history shapes disparities and biases. Through a scoping review and mixed-methods research involving 672 general population participants and 28 experts across Africa, the authors identify colonialism, national income level, and country of origin as critical fairness attributes. The study reveals a divergence between expert and general population perceptions of colonialism's impact on AI, with experts generally acknowledging its relevance while many in the general population do not see a direct connection. The research provides practical recommendations for developing fairness-aware ML solutions in African healthcare contexts.

## Method Summary
The study employs a mixed-methods approach combining a scoping review to identify fairness attributes and qualitative research to understand stakeholder perspectives. The scoping review analyzed existing literature to propose axes of disparities, including colonialism, national income level, and country of origin. This was followed by survey administration to 672 general population participants and 28 experts across Africa, supplemented by qualitative interviews. The research design aimed to capture diverse perspectives on how these attributes influence fairness in ML-based health solutions and their connection to historical and ongoing power dynamics.

## Key Results
- Colonialism is proposed as a novel fairness attribute that captures structural health disparities missed by standard demographic proxies
- Experts across Africa generally agree that colonial history impacts AI implementation, while general population participants are less convinced of this link
- There is a clear divergence between expert and general population perceptions of how colonialism relates to AI in health contexts
- The study provides practical recommendations for developing contextually appropriate ML solutions in African healthcare settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Including colonialism as a fairness attribute captures structural health disparities that standard demographic proxies miss.
- Mechanism: Colonialism creates persistent economic, infrastructural, and educational gaps that affect data collection, model performance, and trust in AI health tools across Africa.
- Core assumption: Historical and ongoing colonial power imbalances directly shape the technical feasibility and social acceptance of ML health interventions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our analysis focuses on colonialism as the attribute of interest and examines the interplay between artificial intelligence (AI), health, and colonialism."
  - [section] "Colonial history has been put forward by several scholars as a social determinant of health... We propose colonial history as a fairness attribute..."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus does not include studies that validate colonialism as a machine learning fairness axis.
- Break condition: If no measurable link between colonial history and health outcomes is found, the attribute becomes irrelevant for bias mitigation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The divergence between expert and general population perceptions of AI-colonialism links reveals differing levels of historical awareness and lived experience.
- Mechanism: Experts are more likely to recognize indirect effects of colonialism on AI because of their familiarity with structural inequities, while the general population may focus on immediate, tangible interactions.
- Core assumption: Awareness of historical context influences how stakeholders evaluate fairness in AI deployment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Whereas experts generally expressed a shared view about the relevance of colonial history... the majority of the general population participants surveyed did not think there was a direct link between AI and colonialism."
  - [section] "Opinions by both experts and general population respondents on the impact of colonialism... are divided."
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence directly compares expert vs. general population perceptions of AI-colonialism links.
- Break condition: If both groups converge in perception after education or experience, the divergence is not fundamental.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Contextualizing fairness attributes to Africa is necessary because global fairness definitions embed Western legal and cultural frameworks.
- Mechanism: Reinterpreting axes like race, religion, and language to reflect African realities avoids importing inappropriate bias definitions and uncovers local sources of unfairness.
- Core assumption: Fairness criteria developed for Western contexts may not translate directly to African settings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This paper seeks to explore fairness for global health, with Africa as a case study."
  - [section] "Fairness considerations in the development of ML-based solutions for health have particular implications for Africa... we use the definition proposed by [16]: 'collaborative trans-national research and action for promoting health for all.'"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus does not contain studies that recontextualize fairness attributes specifically for Africa.
- Break condition: If local definitions of fairness align perfectly with Western ones, recontextualization is unnecessary.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Structural determinants of health
  - Why needed here: Understanding how colonialism and national income level shape health outcomes is essential to identifying fairness attributes.
  - Quick check question: What are two structural factors that colonialism has introduced into African health systems?

- Concept: Machine learning bias taxonomy
  - Why needed here: Knowing the types of bias (historical, representation, measurement, etc.) clarifies how each fairness attribute can induce unfairness.
  - Quick check question: Which bias type arises when training data underrepresents a subgroup?

- Concept: Global vs. local axes of disparity
  - Why needed here: Distinguishing between global fairness attributes and their African-specific framing ensures relevant attribute selection.
  - Quick check question: How does the concept of "race" differ in fairness considerations between Africa and the West?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Scoping review module -> Survey module -> Qualitative analysis module -> Recommendations module

- Critical path:
  1. Conduct scoping review → 2. Define fairness attributes → 3. Administer surveys → 4. Analyze qualitative data → 5. Generate recommendations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Survey language: English only excludes low-literacy populations but ensures technical clarity
  - Expert selection: Broad expertise ensures diverse perspectives but may introduce inconsistent domain knowledge
  - Focus on colonialism: Provides deep dive but may overshadow other important attributes

- Failure signatures:
  - Low survey response rates or skewed demographics → biased attribute validation
  - Inconsistent interview coding → unreliable theme extraction
  - Weak evidence for colonialism as a fairness axis → undermines main contribution

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test whether inclusion of colonialism as a fairness attribute improves model fairness metrics in African health datasets
  2. Compare expert vs. general population survey responses on attribute relevance to identify perception gaps
  3. Evaluate how recontextualized fairness attributes affect bias mitigation performance compared to standard Western definitions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can fairness criteria be effectively contextualized and operationalized for ML applications in health across diverse African contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the need for "contextualizing fairness criteria" and developing "fairness-aware ML solutions for health in Africa," highlighting the unique challenges posed by Africa's diverse cultural, historical, and socioeconomic landscape.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies key axes of disparities and potential biases, it does not provide specific methodologies for adapting existing fairness metrics or developing new ones that account for the complex interplay of factors such as colonialism, language, ethnicity, and rural-urban divides within different African countries.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies testing the effectiveness of various fairness metrics in real-world African health settings, along with qualitative research exploring stakeholder perspectives on appropriate fairness criteria for their specific contexts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can historical biases stemming from colonialism be mitigated in the development and deployment of ML-based health solutions in Africa?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper extensively discusses the impact of colonialism on AI implementation in Africa, highlighting issues such as mistrust, data exploitation, and power imbalances. It emphasizes the need for "awareness of historical biases" and "cautious adoption of AI applications."
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the significance of colonial history, it does not provide concrete strategies for addressing these biases throughout the ML pipeline, from data collection and model development to deployment and evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating successful interventions for mitigating colonial biases in ML health applications, including community engagement strategies, culturally sensitive data collection methods, and bias detection and correction techniques.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective ways to promote inclusive and equitable access to ML-based health solutions in Africa, considering the diverse needs and challenges across the continent?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the importance of "collaborative problem selection" and "socially inclusive development" of AI for health in Africa. It acknowledges the need to address disparities in access to technology, healthcare infrastructure, and education.
- Why unresolved: While the paper emphasizes the importance of inclusivity, it does not provide specific recommendations for ensuring equitable access to ML-based health solutions across different demographic groups, geographical regions, and socioeconomic strata.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies of successful ML health initiatives in Africa that demonstrate equitable access and positive health outcomes across diverse populations, along with research on effective strategies for overcoming barriers to access and adoption.

## Limitations
- The study proposes colonialism as a fairness attribute but does not empirically validate its effectiveness in improving ML model fairness in African health contexts
- The English-only survey approach may have excluded important perspectives from populations with lower literacy levels or different language preferences
- The scoping review methodology provides a foundation for identifying attributes but does not establish causality or measurable impact on AI system outcomes

## Confidence
- Colonialism as a fairness attribute: Medium confidence - supported by theoretical arguments and expert consensus but lacking empirical ML validation
- Expert-general population perception divergence: High confidence - clearly demonstrated through survey results
- Practical recommendations: Medium confidence - contextually grounded but not yet tested in real-world implementations

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation study: Test whether explicitly incorporating colonialism-related variables into ML fairness frameworks improves model fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity) when applied to African health datasets.

2. Cross-cultural perception assessment: Replicate the survey across multiple African countries using local languages and cultural mediators to determine if the expert-general population perception gap persists or varies by region.

3. Implementation trial: Pilot the recommended contextualization practices in an actual ML health project in Africa, measuring both technical fairness improvements and stakeholder acceptance compared to standard approaches.
