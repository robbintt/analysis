core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of designing a control policy
  for an infinite-horizon discounted cost Markov decision process when only an approximate
  model is available. The main question is how well an optimal policy for the approximate
  model performs when used in the original model.

# Model approximation in MDPs with unbounded per-step cost

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.08813
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08813
- Reference count: 40
- This paper addresses model approximation in MDPs with unbounded per-step costs, providing bounds on policy performance using Bellman mismatch functionals.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the problem of designing control policies for infinite-horizon discounted cost Markov decision processes when only an approximate model is available. The authors develop a framework to analyze how well an optimal policy for the approximate model performs when applied to the original model. By introducing Bellman mismatch functionals, they provide bounds on the weighted norm of the difference between the value function of the approximate policy in the original model and the optimal value function of the original model. The results are extended to include affine transformations of the per-step cost, potentially leading to tighter bounds. The paper contributes valuable theoretical tools for analyzing model approximation in MDPs with unbounded per-step costs.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce Bellman mismatch functionals as a key tool to analyze model approximation in MDPs with unbounded per-step costs. They establish bounds on the performance of policies derived from approximate models when applied to the original model. The framework involves calculating weighted norms of differences between value functions and extends to include affine transformations of costs for potentially tighter bounds. The method is demonstrated through examples, including an inventory management problem and a linear quadratic regulator.

## Key Results
- Introduced Bellman mismatch functionals to bound performance of approximate policies
- Derived bounds on weighted norm of difference between approximate policy value function and optimal value function
- Extended results to include affine transformations of per-step costs for potentially tighter bounds
- Provided upper bounds explicitly depending on weighted distance between cost functions and transition kernels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by quantifying the mismatch between the Bellman operators of the original and approximate models. By introducing Bellman mismatch functionals, the authors can bound the performance degradation when using a policy optimized for an approximate model in the true model. The extension to affine transformations allows for more flexible cost function modeling, potentially leading to tighter bounds in practice.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Bellman Operators**
   - Why needed: Fundamental for defining value functions and optimal policies in MDPs
   - Quick check: Verify that the Bellman operator is a contraction mapping under the discount factor

2. **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
   - Why needed: The framework for modeling sequential decision-making under uncertainty
   - Quick check: Ensure the MDP satisfies the Markov property and has well-defined transition probabilities

3. **Value Function Approximation**
   - Why needed: Essential for analyzing performance of approximate policies
   - Quick check: Confirm that the approximate value function converges to the true value function as approximation error decreases

4. **Normed Vector Spaces**
   - Why needed: Used to define weighted norms for bounding value function differences
   - Quick check: Verify that the chosen norm satisfies the properties of a normed vector space

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
- MDP Model -> Bellman Operator -> Value Function
- Approximate Model -> Approximate Bellman Operator -> Approximate Value Function
- Bellman Mismatch Functional -> Performance Bounds

### Critical Path
1. Define MDP with original and approximate models
2. Construct Bellman operators for both models
3. Introduce Bellman mismatch functionals
4. Derive bounds on value function differences
5. Extend to affine transformations of costs
6. Apply to example problems

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Bounded vs. Unbounded Costs**: The paper addresses unbounded costs, which is more general but requires additional assumptions
- **Affine Transformations**: Adding affine transformations can tighten bounds but increases complexity
- **Weighted Norms**: Choice of weight function affects the tightness of bounds

### Failure Signatures
- **Inconsistent Value Function Bounds**: May indicate issues with the choice of weight function or assumptions
- **Non-converging Approximate Value Function**: Could suggest problems with the approximation method or insufficient exploration
- **Tightness of Bounds**: If bounds are too loose, it may indicate the need for more sophisticated approximation techniques

### First Experiments
1. Verify Bellman operator properties for a simple MDP example
2. Compare value functions and bounds for original and approximate models in a toy problem
3. Test the effect of affine transformations on bound tightness in a linear quadratic regulator example

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumptions of bounded value functions and discounted costs may not hold in many practical scenarios
- Extension to affine transformations, while theoretically interesting, may have limited practical applicability
- Examples provided are relatively simple and may not fully capture real-world complexities

## Confidence

**Theoretical framework and main results**: High
- The mathematical framework appears sound and well-developed
- Results are clearly stated and supported by proofs

**Practical applicability and real-world relevance**: Medium
- The framework provides valuable theoretical insights
- However, practical applicability may be limited by assumptions and complexity of real-world problems

**Extension to affine transformations**: Low
- While theoretically interesting, the practical benefits of this extension are not clearly demonstrated
- May add complexity without significant real-world improvements

## Next Checks

1. Apply the framework to a more complex, real-world problem to assess practical applicability and scalability
2. Investigate the sensitivity of the bounds to different discount factors and value function ranges
3. Develop empirical studies comparing the proposed method with existing model approximation techniques in MDPs
