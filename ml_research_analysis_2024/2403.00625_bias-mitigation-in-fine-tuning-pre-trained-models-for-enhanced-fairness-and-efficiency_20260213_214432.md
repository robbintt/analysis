# Bias Mitigation in Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models for Enhanced Fairness and Efficiency

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.00625
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00625

- Primary result: Proposed method mitigates bias in fine-tuned models while maintaining or improving prediction performance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness concerns in fine-tuning pre-trained models for new tasks, which can lead to biased outcomes even when the original model was developed with fairness considerations. The authors propose a weight importance neutralization strategy that leverages Fisher information to identify and balance the influence of parameters affecting predictions across different demographic groups. This method is integrated with a matrix factorization technique using singular value decomposition to create a low-rank approximation of the weight matrix, reducing computational demands. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in mitigating bias while maintaining or improving prediction performance compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
The method combines Fisher information-based weight importance neutralization with SVD-based low-rank approximation. First, Fisher information is computed for each parameter in the final linear layer to quantify its influence on predictions for different demographic groups. These importance scores are then neutralized to balance their impact across groups. The weight matrix is decomposed using SVD, creating two smaller linear layers that approximate the original while reducing parameters. The SVD optimization is modified to include the neutralized Fisher information, ensuring the low-rank approximation recovers weights crucial for predicting both demographic groups equally. The final model is fine-tuned using these low-rank layers on the new task.

## Key Results
- The proposed method effectively mitigates bias as measured by improved Demographic Parity (∆DP) and Equalized Odds (∆EO) metrics
- Prediction performance is maintained or improved compared to baseline fine-tuning approaches
- Computational efficiency is enhanced through reduced parameter count via low-rank approximation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Weight importance neutralization reduces bias by balancing the Fisher information across demographic groups.
- Mechanism: The method computes Fisher information scores for each parameter's influence on predictions for different demographic groups, then neutralizes these scores to balance their impact. This prevents the model from relying on group-specific patterns that lead to bias.
- Core assumption: Parameters that affect predictions differently across demographic groups are the primary source of bias in fine-tuned models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our empirical analysis shows that the parameters in the pre-trained model that affect predictions for different demographic groups are different, so based on this observation, we employ a transfer learning strategy that neutralizes the importance of these influential weights, determined using Fisher information across demographic groups."
  - [section]: "From Fig. 3, it is clear that the influential weights for prediction across two demographic groups vary. Taking inspiration from this observation, we employ Fisher information to quantify the impact of parameters on the performance of the model trained by DS=1 or DS=2, and our goal is to mitigate this difference by neutralizing it."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct support found in corpus for Fisher information-based neutralization mechanism.
- Break condition: If the neutralized Fisher information fails to adequately balance the weight importance across groups, or if other sources of bias not captured by parameter influence remain significant.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Low-rank approximation via SVD reduces computational demands while maintaining prediction performance.
- Mechanism: The weight matrix in the final linear layer is decomposed using SVD, creating two smaller linear layers that approximate the original. This reduces the number of parameters and speeds up fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: The weight updates during adaptation exhibit a low "intrinsic rank," meaning they can be well-approximated by a lower-dimensional representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we integrate this weight importance neutralization strategy with a matrix factorization technique, which provides a low-rank approximation of the weight matrix using fewer parameters, reducing the computational demands."
  - [section]: "Through SVD, the weight matrix is factorized into three matrices, denoted as U, S, and V. Specifically, assuming the final linear layer with weight matrix W ∈ Rd×k and bias b ∈ R1×k, the final linear layer can be approximated via SVD as: Z = XW + b ≈ (XU S)V ⊤ + b."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct support found in corpus for SVD-based low-rank approximation in this specific bias mitigation context.
- Break condition: If the low-rank approximation introduces significant reconstruction error, leading to degraded prediction performance or if the computational savings are minimal relative to the complexity added.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Weighted SVD with neutralized Fisher information ensures fairness while maintaining efficiency.
- Mechanism: The SVD optimization objective is modified to include the neutralized Fisher information, making the decomposed matrix recover weights crucial for predicting both demographic groups equally.
- Core assumption: By weighting the SVD with neutralized Fisher information, the resulting low-rank approximation will inherently favor weights important for both groups, thus mitigating bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we enhance the method by approximating the weights in the linear layer with fewer parameters using singular value decomposition (SVD) [Golub and Reinsch, 1971]."
  - [section]: "Specifically, we modify the SVD optimization objective ∥W − AB∥2 to include the neutralized Fisher information and obtain a weighted SVD: min A,B ||ˆIN W − ˆIN AB||2."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct support found in corpus for weighted SVD with Fisher information for fairness.
- Break condition: If the weighting scheme fails to properly balance the importance of weights across groups, or if the optimization becomes unstable or computationally prohibitive.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained Model -> Fisher Information Calculator -> Weight Importance Neutralizer -> SVD Processor -> Fine-tuning Module
- Critical path:
  1. Compute Fisher information for each parameter across demographic groups
  2. Neutralize the Fisher information scores
  3. Perform weighted SVD using the neutralized scores
  4. Replace the original linear layer with the low-rank layers
  5. Fine-tune the low-rank layers on the new task
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. Fairness: Increasing fairness constraints can lead to decreased prediction performance
  - Computational Efficiency vs. Model Complexity: Low-rank approximation reduces parameters but may introduce reconstruction error
  - Model Architecture vs. Bias: The impact of different model architectures on bias mitigation is not significant
- Failure signatures:
  - Increased prediction error after applying the bias mitigation technique
  - Fairness metrics (∆DP and ∆EO) not improving or worsening
  - Computational cost not reducing as expected
  - Instability or divergence during the optimization process
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate Fisher information calculation: Compare the Fisher information scores for different demographic groups on a simple dataset (e.g., Adult Income) to ensure they capture meaningful differences.
  2. Test SVD approximation: Apply standard SVD to the weight matrix and measure the reconstruction error and computational savings to verify the low-rank approximation works as expected.
  3. Evaluate weighted SVD: Apply the weighted SVD with neutralized Fisher information and compare the fairness metrics and prediction performance against the baseline methods (TL and f+SVD) on a small-scale dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of α in the weight importance neutralization formula affect the fairness-performance trade-off across different types of datasets and models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.5 ablation study varies α in the formula ˆIN = αˆIS=1 + (1 − α)ˆIS=2 and observes changes in prediction error and fairness metrics.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests α ∈ [0.5, 1) on the Adult dataset. It's unclear how different α values would perform on image datasets or with different model architectures, or whether there's an optimal α that generalizes across tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying α across all three datasets (Adult, LFW+a, CelebA) with different model architectures (MLP, ResNet, DenseNet) and measuring the fairness-performance Pareto frontier for each α value.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the minimum rank r needed in the SVD decomposition to maintain both fairness and performance, and how does this minimum vary with dataset characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.3 mentions truncating U∗, S∗, V∗ to preserve only the top r ranks but doesn't provide systematic analysis of the impact of different r values.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't explore how different rank truncation values affect the balance between model efficiency, fairness, and prediction performance. The optimal r likely depends on dataset size, feature dimensionality, and inherent bias levels.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments systematically varying r from very low (2-5) to full rank across all datasets while measuring changes in prediction error, fairness metrics (∆DP and ∆EO), and parameter reduction percentage.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the weight importance neutralization approach maintain its effectiveness when applied to larger, more complex pre-trained models like BERT or GPT-style architectures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The experiments use relatively small models (MLP for tabular data, ResNet-18 for images) and acknowledge in the conclusion that future research should investigate applicability to larger models.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates effectiveness on moderate-sized models but doesn't test whether the Fisher information-based weight importance approach scales to billion-parameter models where the parameter interactions become much more complex.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the method to transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, or smaller GPT variants and measuring whether the weight importance neutralization still effectively reduces bias while maintaining performance, along with computational efficiency comparisons.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks specific implementation details for key components like Fisher information computation and rank truncation strategy
- Evaluation focuses primarily on gender as the sensitive attribute, limiting exploration of intersectional bias
- Computational efficiency claims are based on parameter reduction but lack rigorous timing benchmarks across different hardware configurations

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using Fisher information to quantify parameter importance across demographic groups is theoretically sound and aligns with established statistical learning principles.

**Medium Confidence**: The integration of Fisher information with SVD-based low-rank approximation shows promise, but the weighted optimization formulation requires more rigorous validation across diverse datasets and model architectures.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that model architecture has negligible impact on bias mitigation requires further empirical validation, as architectural choices often significantly influence learning dynamics and fairness outcomes.

## Next Checks

1. **Fisher Information Stability Test**: Conduct sensitivity analysis on Fisher information computation by varying batch sizes and training epochs to assess numerical stability and convergence properties across different demographic splits.

2. **Rank Selection Impact Study**: Systematically evaluate how different rank truncation values affect both computational efficiency (parameter count, inference time) and fairness-performance tradeoff across multiple datasets with varying complexity.

3. **Architecture Transferability Validation**: Test the proposed method across diverse model architectures (CNN, Transformer, MLP) on the same dataset to empirically verify or refute the claim that architectural choices minimally impact bias mitigation effectiveness.
