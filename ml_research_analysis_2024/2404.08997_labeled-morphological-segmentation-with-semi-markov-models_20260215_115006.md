# Labeled Morphological Segmentation with Semi-Markov Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08997

- The paper presents CHIPMUNK, a semi-Markov CRF model that unifies morphological segmentation, stemming, and morphological tag classification with 2-6 F1 point improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces labeled morphological segmentation (LMS), a framework that extends traditional morphological segmentation by assigning fine-grained morphotactic tags to segments. The authors develop CHIPMUNK, a semi-Markov conditional random field model that explicitly models morphotactics and unifies three morphological analysis tasks. Experiments on six languages show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with absolute gains of 2-6 F1 points in morphological segmentation. The approach also yields significant improvements in stemming (up to 50% accuracy gains for agglutinative languages) and morphological tag classification (over 6% accuracy gains).

## Method Summary
CHIPMUNK is a semi-Markov conditional random field model that jointly models morphological segmentation and labeling. The model uses a hierarchical morphotactic tagset with 5 levels of granularity and incorporates novel features including affix gazetteers from Wiktionary, spell checker features from ASPELL dictionaries, and conjunctive features from cross-product of tagsets and features. The model is trained using maximum-likelihood criterion with L-BFGS optimization and L2 regularization. Evaluation is conducted on six languages (English, Finnish, German, Indonesian, Turkish, Zulu) across three tasks: unlabeled morphological segmentation, stemming, and morphological tag classification.

## Key Results
- CHIPMUNK achieves 2-6 absolute F1 point improvements in morphological segmentation over state-of-the-art methods
- Significant improvements in stemming accuracy, with up to 50% gains for agglutinative languages like Turkish
- Morphological tag classification accuracy improves by over 6% compared to baseline methods
- The semi-CRF architecture consistently outperforms linear-chain CRF approaches across all six languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The semi-CRF model naturally handles morphological segmentation because it jointly models segment boundaries and labels.
- Mechanism: Unlike linear-chain CRFs, semi-CRFs allow features to look at entire segments rather than just single characters, capturing morphological regularities like affix patterns.
- Core assumption: Segments are contiguous character spans with consistent morphotactic behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CHIPMUNK is a semi-Markov conditional random field model, which explicitly models morphotactics."
  - [section] "Semi-CRFs generalize linear-chain CRFs and model segmentation jointly with sequence labeling."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; neighbor papers do not directly cite semi-CRF usage.
- Break condition: If a language has non-contiguous morphological phenomena or overlapping segments, the contiguous segment assumption fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-grained morphotactic tagsets improve segmentation accuracy by encoding linguistically motivated transitions.
- Mechanism: The hierarchical tagset (levels 0-5) increases expressivity, allowing the model to learn constraints like "prefix → root → suffix" and disallow invalid morpheme sequences.
- Core assumption: Morphotactic constraints are language-specific but systematic enough to learn from labeled data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The labels in our supervised discriminative model... capture the distinctions between different types of morphemes and directly model the morphotactics of the language."
  - [section] "We create a hierarchical tagset with increasing granularity... designed by creating a standard representation from heterogeneous resources for six languages."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no direct neighbor citations to hierarchical tagsets.
- Break condition: If tagset granularity exceeds available training data, overfitting or sparsity may degrade performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: External linguistic resources (affix lists, spell checkers) act as effective feature priors for unseen morphological patterns.
- Mechanism: Binary features fire when a substring matches known affixes or dictionary words, guiding segmentation toward linguistically plausible boundaries.
- Core assumption: Morphological knowledge can be effectively encoded as finite lists and integrated into the model without hand-crafted rules.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Providing a supervised learner with such a list is a great boon... we simply use suffix lists from English Wiktionary."
  - [section] "Spell-check features act as an effective proxy for a root detector."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no direct neighbor citations to affix gazetteer usage.
- Break condition: If affix lists are incomplete or contain noise, model predictions may be biased or incorrect.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields
  - Why needed here: They allow segmentation and labeling to be modeled jointly, unlike standard CRFs which only model per-character tags.
  - Quick check question: How does the semi-CRF forward recursion differ from the standard CRF forward recursion?

- Concept: Hierarchical Morphotactic Tagsets
  - Why needed here: They provide a way to incrementally add linguistic granularity, improving segmentation accuracy as more fine-grained distinctions are encoded.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between level 2 and level 3 in the morphotactic tagset hierarchy?

- Concept: Feature Engineering with External Resources
  - Why needed here: It allows the model to leverage pre-existing linguistic knowledge (affixes, dictionary entries) without hand-crafting rules.
  - Quick check question: How do affix gazetteer features and spell-checker features differ in their impact on segmentation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Raw word strings
  - Segmentation layer: Semi-CRF model with feature extraction
  - Feature sources: N-gram context, affix gazetteers, spell-check dictionaries, morphotactic tagsets
  - Output: Labeled segmentation (segments + tags)

- Critical path:
  1. Tokenize input word
  2. Extract features (gazetteers, dictionary matches, n-grams)
  3. Run semi-CRF inference (Viterbi or forward-backward)
  4. Return best-labeled segmentation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Feature complexity vs. model overfitting: More features improve coverage but increase sparsity.
  - Tagset granularity vs. data availability: Finer tags improve accuracy only if sufficient training data exists.
  - Semi-CRF vs. CRF: Semi-CRFs allow segment-level features but are computationally heavier.

- Failure signatures:
  - Over-segmentation: Model splits words into too many small segments, often due to noisy affix lists.
  - Under-segmentation: Model fails to split known affixes from roots, often due to insufficient morphotactic constraints.
  - Unknown morpheme errors: Model mislabels segments when affix lists or dictionaries lack coverage.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train semi-CRF with only n-gram features and evaluate baseline segmentation accuracy.
  2. Add affix gazetteer features and measure improvement in segmentation F1.
  3. Vary tagset granularity (levels 0-5) on a single language to identify optimal level for that language.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper suggests several directions for future work, including integrating the model into context-sensitive POS taggers and exploring applications to languages with even more complex morphology than those tested in this study.

## Limitations
- Limited language coverage with only six languages tested, restricting generalization claims
- No ablation studies to isolate the contribution of individual feature types
- No evaluation on out-of-domain or low-resource settings to assess robustness

## Confidence
- CHIPMUNK unifies morphological segmentation, stemming, and tag classification: High confidence
- Hierarchical morphotactic tagsets improve segmentation accuracy: Medium confidence
- External linguistic resources significantly enhance performance: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study across languages**: Remove each feature type (affix gazetteers, spell-checker features, hierarchical tagsets) individually and measure performance degradation to isolate their contributions.

2. **Cross-linguistic generalization test**: Evaluate CHIPMUNK on an additional language from an underrepresented family (e.g., a polysynthetic language) to assess whether the model generalizes beyond the six languages tested.

3. **Data sparsity analysis**: Systematically reduce training data size for each language and measure how quickly performance degrades compared to baseline methods, revealing the model's data efficiency.
