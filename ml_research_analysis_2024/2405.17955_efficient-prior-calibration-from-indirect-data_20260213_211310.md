# Efficient Prior Calibration From Indirect Data
## Quick Facts

- Proposes methodology to learn generative models for priors from indirect PDE-constrained data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel methodology for learning generative models of function-space priors from indirect and noisy observations in PDE inverse problems. The approach addresses the challenge of calibrating priors when data is observed through the solution of a PDE rather than directly. By leveraging bilevel optimization and neural operators, the method jointly estimates prior parameters and learns an approximation of the forward model, providing a practical solution for scenarios where traditional Bayesian inference struggles due to computational complexity.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs a bilevel optimization strategy to jointly learn prior parameters and a neural operator approximation of the forward model. It minimizes a loss functional based on distributional divergences computed from indirect observations. The approach uses the Banach Wasserstein distance as a computational proxy for the optimal transport distance between posterior measures. Theoretical analysis proves that for N=1 observations, the learned prior recovers the Bayesian posterior. The method is demonstrated on steady-state Darcy flow problems in both 1D and 2D settings, testing two different parametric priors: level set and lognormal distributions.

## Key Results
- Recovers Bayesian posterior theoretically guaranteed for N=1 observations from a single physical system
- Successfully applied to 1D and 2D steady-state Darcy flow problems
- Validated across two different parametric priors (level set and lognormal)
- Demonstrates accurate prior calibration from indirect PDE-constrained observations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by formulating prior calibration as a bilevel optimization problem where the outer level learns prior parameters while the inner level approximates the forward model through a neural operator. The use of distributional divergences as the loss functional allows learning directly from the structure of the indirect observations rather than requiring explicit reconstruction of the true parameters. The Banach Wasserstein distance provides a computationally tractable approximation of optimal transport that enables efficient gradient-based optimization while preserving the theoretical guarantees of convergence to the correct posterior distribution.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bilevel optimization** - Why needed: To jointly optimize both prior parameters and forward model approximation simultaneously. Quick check: Verify the nested structure where the inner optimization (forward model learning) depends on the outer optimization (prior parameters).
- **Neural operators** - Why needed: To approximate infinite-dimensional forward maps arising from PDEs. Quick check: Confirm the operator can handle function-space inputs and outputs without discretization constraints.
- **Optimal transport theory** - Why needed: To measure distances between probability measures on function space. Quick check: Validate the choice of Banach Wasserstein as a computable proxy for Wasserstein distance.
- **PDE-constrained inverse problems** - Why needed: To understand the mathematical structure of observations that are indirect measurements through PDE solutions. Quick check: Identify how the observation operator couples parameters to measurements through the PDE.
- **Function-space priors** - Why needed: To represent uncertainty in infinite-dimensional parameter spaces common in inverse problems. Quick check: Ensure the prior parametrization can capture relevant spatial correlations and structures.
- **Distributional divergences** - Why needed: To compare probability measures without requiring explicit density functions. Quick check: Verify the divergence computation remains stable under finite sampling.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Prior parameters -> Bilevel optimizer -> Neural operator (forward model) -> Distributional divergence loss -> Data observations
**Critical Path:** Prior parameters → Neural operator forward solve → Solution comparison via distributional divergence → Gradient backprop through bilevel structure
**Design Tradeoffs:** Uses Banach Wasserstein distance for computational tractability vs. exact Wasserstein distance; employs neural operators for function-space approximation vs. traditional discretization; bilevel optimization for joint learning vs. alternating optimization schemes
**Failure Signatures:** Divergence of bilevel optimization; neural operator failing to capture PDE solution structure; distributional divergence becoming numerically unstable; convergence to incorrect local minima due to non-convexity
**First 3 Experiments:** 1) Verify neural operator can approximate the forward map on synthetic test cases, 2) Test bilevel optimization convergence on a simplified problem with known solution, 3) Validate distributional divergence computation on benchmark probability measures
