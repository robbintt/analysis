# TIMIT Speaker Profiling: A Comparison of Multi-task learning and Single-task learning Approaches

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2404.12077
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12077
- **Reference count**: 3
- **Primary result**: Multi-task learning showed slight improvements in age estimation but reduced accent prediction accuracy on TIMIT dataset

## Executive Summary
This study systematically compares multi-task learning (MTL) versus single-task learning (STL) approaches for four speaker profiling tasks using the TIMIT dataset: gender classification, accent classification, age estimation, and speaker identification. The experiments reveal that MTL is most effective for tasks of similar complexity, showing slight improvements in age estimation while reducing accent prediction accuracy. The authors emphasize that despite advances in deep learning, skillful feature engineering remains crucial for speaker recognition tasks, with non-sequential features favored over sequential approaches. Accent classification proved particularly challenging due to nuanced pronunciation differences among eight American English accents.

## Method Summary
The study uses the TIMIT dataset with 630 speakers and 10 utterances each, covering 8 US accent regions. Four tasks were evaluated: gender classification, accent classification, age estimation, and speaker identification. Single-task models included 3-layer MLPs for gender/accent, CNNs for age, and LSTMs/MLPs for speaker ID. Multi-task models combined shared layers with task-specific heads. Feature engineering involved MFCCs (13-40 coefficients), Mel, Chroma, Tonnetz, and Contrast features. The experiments compared STL versus MTL performance using appropriate metrics for each task, including accuracy, MAE, RMSE, and F1 scores.

## Key Results
- Multi-task learning improved age estimation performance slightly but reduced accent classification accuracy
- Accent classification achieved only 25-30% accuracy despite data balancing and feature engineering
- Speaker identification outperformed accent recognition even with 629 classes and limited samples per speaker
- Feature engineering remained critical, with non-sequential features preferred for speaker recognition tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Multi-task learning benefits tasks of similar complexity by sharing feature extraction layers.
- **Mechanism**: When tasks are closely related and have comparable difficulty, the shared layers in a multi-task model can learn a joint representation that improves performance across tasks. For example, gender and age estimation share some acoustic features like pitch and vocal tract length, so their shared layers can reinforce these features.
- **Core assumption**: The tasks must be positively correlated and have similar complexity levels.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "multi-task learning is found advantageous for tasks of similar complexity"
  - [section]: "Multi-task learning, through a unified model, seeks to improve the performance of multiple related tasks. While our findings indicate that multi-task models deliver performances on par with single-task models in gender and age estimation..."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found in corpus, though related papers discuss multi-task learning for speaker-related tasks.
- **Break condition**: If tasks have vastly different complexities or are negatively correlated (e.g., accent classification vs. gender classification), the shared layers may introduce noise and degrade performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Feature engineering remains crucial for speaker recognition tasks even with deep learning.
- **Mechanism**: Unlike automatic speech recognition where end-to-end models can learn directly from raw audio, speaker recognition benefits from carefully engineered features that capture stable, speaker-specific characteristics. Non-sequential features (e.g., averaged MFCCs) provide a more stable representation by reducing frame-level variability.
- **Core assumption**: Speaker recognition requires stable, speaker-specific features that are less sensitive to short-term variations.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "emphasize the undiminished significance of skillful feature

## Foundational Learning

### Multi-task Learning Architecture
- **Why needed**: Enables simultaneous learning of multiple related tasks to improve generalization and reduce training time
- **Quick check**: Verify shared layers are appropriately sized and task-specific heads are properly separated

### Feature Engineering for Speaker Recognition
- **Why needed**: Speaker identification requires stable, speaker-specific features that capture vocal characteristics
- **Quick check**: Compare performance of engineered features versus raw audio input for speaker ID tasks

### Accent Classification Challenges
- **Why needed**: TIMIT's limited accent diversity and subtle pronunciation differences create inherent classification difficulties
- **Quick check**: Evaluate class distribution and inter-speaker variance within accent categories

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Feature Extraction -> Shared Layers -> Task-Specific Heads (Gender, Accent, Age, Speaker ID)

### Critical Path
MFCC Feature Extraction -> Shared CNN Layers -> Gender/Age Task Heads -> Accuracy/MAE Metrics

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Shared vs. separate layers**: MTL uses shared layers for efficiency but may introduce task interference
- **Sequential vs. non-sequential features**: Non-sequential features reduce variability but may lose temporal information
- **Weighted vs. equal loss**: Weighted loss addresses task imbalance but requires careful tuning

### Failure Signatures
- Poor accent classification (<25% accuracy) indicates task incompatibility or data imbalance
- Overfitting on speaker ID with 629 classes suggests insufficient regularization or model capacity issues
- MTL performance worse than STL indicates negative task correlation or complexity mismatch

### First Experiments
1. Train single-task MLP for gender classification with MFCC features (13-40 coefficients)
2. Implement multi-task model with shared CNN layers for gender and age estimation
3. Compare accent classification performance with balanced versus imbalanced class weights

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How do transformer-based models compare to conventional models (DNN, CNN, LSTM) for speaker profiling tasks?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors note that due to limitations in time and computational resources, their study did not explore cutting-edge techniques like transformers-based models for improved speaker recognition.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper focuses on conventional models and does not provide experimental results or comparisons with transformer-based architectures.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experiments comparing the performance of transformer-based models against conventional models (DNN, CNN, LSTM) on the same speaker profiling tasks (gender classification, accent classification, age estimation, and speaker identification) using the TIMIT dataset.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What is the optimal approach to balance multi-task learning losses when tasks have varying complexities?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors experimented with weighted loss functions to address complexity disparities between tasks but found that adjusting loss weights improved accent prediction accuracy at the expense of age estimation performance.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper demonstrates the challenges of balancing multi-task losses but does not provide a definitive solution or framework for optimal loss balancing.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A systematic study of different loss weighting strategies and their impact on multi-task learning performance across various task combinations and complexities.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does speaker embedding-based approach compare to traditional feature engineering methods for speaker identification?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors mention that due to limitations, they did not explore speaker-embedding methods, which could potentially improve speaker recognition performance.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper relies on traditional feature engineering approaches and does not evaluate the effectiveness of speaker embeddings like i-vectors or x-vectors.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative experiments between traditional feature engineering methods and speaker embedding approaches for speaker identification on the TIMIT dataset.

## Limitations
- TIMIT's limited accent diversity (only 8 US accents) and small sample sizes per speaker restrict generalizability
- Study did not explore alternative multi-task architectures beyond MLP and CNN+LSTM
- No investigation of dynamic task weighting strategies to address imbalanced task performance
- Reported improvements in age estimation were slight while accent classification degraded

## Confidence

### Multi-task learning benefits for similar complexity tasks: High confidence
Supported by consistent findings across experiments where age and gender estimation showed comparable or improved performance

### Feature engineering remains crucial for speaker recognition: High confidence
Demonstrated through superior performance of non-sequential features despite deep learning approaches

### Accent classification difficulty is inherent to TIMIT: Medium confidence
While the study attributes poor performance to nuanced pronunciation differences, the limited dataset size and class imbalance may be confounding factors

## Next Checks

1. **Replicate with larger, more diverse accent datasets** - Test the accent classification results on datasets like Common Voice or VoxCeleb that include non-US accents and more speakers per accent to determine if TIMIT-specific limitations drive poor performance

2. **Implement dynamic task weighting** - Compare static weighted loss approaches with adaptive methods that adjust task weights based on real-time performance to potentially improve multi-task learning outcomes

3. **Experiment with alternative multi-task architectures** - Test mixture-of-experts models or hierarchical task grouping to determine if task compatibility issues can be mitigated through architectural innovations rather than forcing all tasks through shared layers
