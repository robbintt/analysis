# CoEvo: Continual Evolution of Symbolic Solutions Using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.18890
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18890
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based symbolic regression methods on four scientific benchmarks with significantly lower NMSE

## Executive Summary
This paper presents CoEvo, a framework that addresses the challenge of discovering symbolic solutions in scientific and engineering domains through continual, open-ended evolutionary processes. The framework integrates large language models with evolutionary algorithms and a dynamic knowledge library to generate and refine solutions in multiple representations including natural language, mathematical expressions, and code. Experimental results demonstrate that CoEvo achieves significantly lower normalized mean squared errors (NMSE) while maintaining high valid solution rates compared to existing LLM-based symbolic regression methods.

## Method Summary
CoEvo combines evolutionary algorithms with large language models and a dynamic knowledge library to discover symbolic solutions. The framework uses tree-based idea search with multi-phased reasoning to generate initial solutions, evaluates them using a task-specific evaluator, and evolves them through crossover and mutation operators. The knowledge library stores and clusters discovered insights, enabling their reuse during subsequent generations through either random or similarity-based retrieval. Solutions are generated in multiple representations including natural language, mathematical expressions, and code, allowing parallel exploration of different solution spaces.

## Key Results
- CoEvo achieves significantly lower normalized mean squared errors (NMSE) compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based symbolic regression methods
- The framework maintains high valid solution rates while improving solution quality through continual evolution
- Knowledge reuse through the dynamic knowledge library contributes to continuous improvement of symbolic solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The knowledge library enables continual improvement by storing and reusing discovered insights during evolutionary search
- Mechanism: The framework maintains a dynamic knowledge library that clusters discovered ideas and retrieves them during solution generation. When solutions improve scores, the LLM summarizes the effective ideas and stores them in the library. During subsequent generations, this knowledge is randomly reused for exploration or similarity-based reused for refinement.
- Core assumption: The LLM can accurately summarize effective ideas from improved solutions and that these summarized ideas are useful for generating new solutions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The knowledge library stores and organizes discovered ideas, enabling their reuse and continual refinement during the search process"
  - [section]: "Idea summarization occurs when solutions improve the score during the tree-based search and offspring generation processes. The LLM is asked to analyze the improved performance and store the effective idea into the knowledge library"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using multiple representations (natural language, mathematical expressions, code) enhances search efficiency by exploring different solution spaces
- Mechanism: The framework generates solutions in various formats including natural language, mathematical formulas, Python code, and logic expressions. This allows parallel exploration of different representation spaces, with each format potentially capturing different aspects of the solution landscape.
- Core assumption: Different solution representations can capture complementary information about the problem space
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "CoEvo integrates large language models with evolutionary algorithms and a dynamic knowledge library to generate and refine solutions in multiple representations including natural language, mathematical expressions, and code"
  - [section]: "With these definitions of solution representations, our method can generate comprehensive solutions for a variety of tasks, rather than being restricted to symbolic solutions"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The tree-based idea search process with multi-phased reasoning mimics human problem-solving to generate better initial solutions
- Mechanism: The framework uses a tree structure where initial ideas serve as root nodes, and subsequent levels develop Nk ideas through inference based on evaluator feedback. This creates a network-like structure for deeper refinement through explicit reasoning in thought sections.
- Core assumption: Structured multi-phased reasoning can generate more effective ideas than random generation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "CoEvo integrates large language models with evolutionary algorithms"
  - [section]: "At each subsequent k-th level, Nk ideas are developed through direct inference based on the evaluator's feedback and existing ideas. This enhances the initial concepts and forming a network-like structure for deeper refinement"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Evolutionary algorithms and genetic operators (crossover, mutation, selection)
  - Why needed here: The framework uses evolutionary search with positive/negative crossover and mutation operators to evolve solutions
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between positive-crossover and negative-crossover operators?

- Concept: Large language models and their capabilities in code generation and reasoning
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on LLMs for generating solutions in multiple representations and for idea summarization
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o-mini in terms of knowledge cutoff and capabilities?

- Concept: Knowledge representation and retrieval systems
  - Why needed here: The framework uses a knowledge library with clustering and similarity-based retrieval
  - Quick check question: How does cosine similarity work for comparing sentence embeddings in a knowledge library?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LLM backbone -> Tree-based idea search -> Evolutionary algorithm (crossover/mutation) -> Knowledge library (clustering/retrieval) -> Task evaluator

- Critical path: Initialize population using tree-based search → Evaluate solutions and update population → Generate offspring using crossover/mutation → Apply tree-based search for refinement → Update knowledge library with improved solutions → Repeat until convergence

- Design tradeoffs: Using simpler GPT-3.5 vs more capable GPT-4o-mini (tradeoff between cost and performance) | Number of initial ideas (N0) vs computational resources | Size of knowledge library vs retrieval efficiency | Random vs similarity-based knowledge reuse

- Failure signatures: Knowledge pollution (irrelevant or misleading knowledge accumulating) | Premature convergence to suboptimal solutions | LLM query limits being exceeded | Invalid solution generation rate increasing

- First 3 experiments: Run with GPT-3.5 only on a simple benchmark to verify basic functionality | Compare random knowledge reuse vs similarity-based reuse on a mid-difficulty problem | Test with knowledge library disabled to measure its contribution to performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can CoEvo's knowledge library mechanism effectively distinguish between genuinely useful knowledge and "knowledge pollution" that degrades performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies knowledge pollution as a problem where misleading or irrelevant knowledge entries accumulate in the knowledge library, specifically noting the case of numpy.gradient knowledge negatively impacting the Oscillation 2 problem.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that knowledge can enhance performance, it also shows that poor quality knowledge can harm it. The mechanism for filtering out harmful knowledge versus beneficial knowledge remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing CoEvo's performance with different knowledge filtering mechanisms, or analysis showing how the system could identify and remove misleading knowledge entries.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of CoEvo scale with increasing problem complexity beyond the four benchmark problems tested?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tests only four specific scientific benchmarks, all of which are relatively constrained problems. There is no analysis of how the framework performs on more complex, higher-dimensional problems or problems with more variables.
- Why unresolved: The current experiments focus on simple symbolic regression problems. The scalability of the tree-based search process and knowledge library management to more complex scientific problems is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on more complex scientific problems with higher dimensionality, longer computation times, or problems requiring more sophisticated mathematical expressions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical limit of how much knowledge CoEvo can effectively manage before the knowledge library becomes counterproductive?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that knowledge can improve performance but also demonstrates knowledge pollution effects. It mentions that knowledge is clustered but doesn't analyze the optimal size or organization of the knowledge library.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't explore the relationship between knowledge library size and performance degradation, nor does it provide theoretical analysis of knowledge management limits.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the knowledge library size and measuring performance degradation points, or theoretical analysis of the relationship between knowledge complexity and search efficiency in CoEvo's framework.

## Limitations

- The framework's performance depends heavily on the LLM's ability to accurately summarize effective ideas, but this summarization quality is not quantitatively validated
- The claimed efficiency benefits of multiple representations lack ablation studies showing performance differences with single vs multiple representations
- Computational resource usage (runtime, token consumption, memory) is not reported, making it difficult to assess practical trade-offs

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The framework architecture is well-defined with clear integration of evolutionary algorithms, LLMs, and knowledge library components
- **Medium confidence**: Experimental results show CoEvo outperforms baselines on NMSE metrics, though the sample size (4 benchmarks) limits generalizability
- **Low confidence**: The claimed mechanism of continual improvement through knowledge reuse is theoretically sound but lacks empirical validation of knowledge library quality and impact

## Next Checks

1. **Knowledge Library Quality Analysis**: Implement a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the knowledge library's effectiveness by measuring the similarity between stored knowledge and actual successful solution patterns, and track how knowledge reuse correlates with performance improvements across generations

2. **Ablation Study on Representations**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing CoEvo's performance when using single representations (only natural language, only code, only mathematical expressions) versus the full multi-representation approach to validate the claimed efficiency benefits

3. **Computational Resource Analysis**: Measure and report wall-clock time, LLM token usage, and memory consumption for CoEvo versus baseline methods to assess the practical trade-offs between improved performance and computational costs
