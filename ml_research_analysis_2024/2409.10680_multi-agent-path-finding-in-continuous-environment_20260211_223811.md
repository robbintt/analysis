# Multi-agent Path Finding in Continuous Environment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.10680
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10680
- Reference count: 4
- This work proposes CE-CBS, a novel algorithm for MAPF in continuous environments that outperforms discrete CBS and SMT-CBS in terms of path length and computational efficiency.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem in continuous environments where agents move along smooth curves and collisions are resolved in the space domain. The authors propose CE-CBS, a new algorithm that combines conflict-based search (CBS) for high-level path coordination with RRT* for low-level path planning. CE-CBS allows agents to move continuously without stopping, satisfying kinematic constraints like minimal turning angles. The algorithm is tested on various scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in finding collision-free paths while minimizing the sum of path costs. Results show that CE-CBS outperforms discrete CBS and SMT-CBS in terms of path length and computational efficiency, especially in continuous environments.

## Method Summary
The CE-CBS algorithm combines CBS for high-level conflict resolution with RRT* for low-level path planning in continuous environments. Agents are modeled as circles with fixed radius, and collisions are detected by checking trajectory intersections and computing unsafe time intervals. RRT* is enhanced with kinematic constraints to ensure smooth, feasible paths that satisfy minimum turning angle requirements. After RRT* generates a path, a B-spline curve is fitted through the waypoints to smooth the path while preserving collision avoidance and kinematic constraints. The algorithm is tested on various scenarios, comparing its performance with discrete CBS and SMT-CBS in terms of path length, computational efficiency, and the number of conflicts.

## Key Results
- CE-CBS outperforms discrete CBS and SMT-CBS in terms of path length and computational efficiency in continuous environments.
- The algorithm effectively finds collision-free paths while minimizing the sum of path costs and satisfying kinematic constraints like minimal turning angles.
- The model's parameters, such as the maximum number of RRT* nodes and agent radius, significantly impact the solution quality and computational time.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The algorithm resolves agent collisions by introducing dynamic constraints in time intervals where paths intersect, rather than relying on discrete grid cells.
- Mechanism: Conflicts are detected by checking trajectory intersections and then computing unsafe time intervals. If the time difference between two agents reaching the intersection is within their movement capabilities, a constraint is added to prevent the collision.
- Core assumption: Agent bodies are modeled as circles with fixed radius, and collision occurs when the distance between agents is less than twice the radius.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Collisions between agents are resolved via avoidance in the space domain."
  - [section] "An unsafe interval is created from these time variables, which is necessary to take the agent mass into account."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RRT* path planning is enhanced with kinematic constraints to ensure smooth, feasible paths that satisfy minimum turning angle requirements.
- Mechanism: RRT* is modified to check both static obstacles and dynamic constraints. Paths are validated to ensure all angles between consecutive segments exceed a minimum threshold. If not, vertices are either eliminated or repositioned to increase the angle.
- Core assumption: The environment allows for continuous movement and path segments can be adjusted without introducing new collisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The algorithm first tries to eliminate the vertex which is shared by the two path segments and connect the other two vertices instead."
  - [section] "A sufficient path must satisfy the given kinematic constraints. In this work, angles between path segments (pre-smoothing) are constrained to be bigger than 90 degrees."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: B-spline curve interpolation smooths RRT* paths while preserving collision avoidance and kinematic constraints.
- Mechanism: After RRT* generates a path, a B-spline curve is fitted through the waypoints. Additional points are interpolated along the curve at regular intervals. The smoothed path is then validated against obstacles and constraints.
- Core assumption: The B-spline interpolation does not introduce new collisions or violate kinematic constraints when done conservatively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The path resulting from interpolation is then validated in the same manner as the path resulting from RRT*, and interpolation can also be done multiple times to try and find a sufficient path."
  - [section] "A B-spline curve is fitted onto a path with concrete path points being curve control points, and additional points are then interpolated laying on the smooth curve."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: B-spline curves and their basis functions
  - Why needed here: To understand how the smoothing mechanism works and how control points influence the final curve shape.
  - Quick check question: What is the degree of a B-spline curve if it is composed of cubic Bézier segments joined with C² continuity?

- Concept: RRT* algorithm and its convergence properties
  - Why needed here: To understand the path planning component and why it is probabilistically complete.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between RRT and RRT* that ensures asymptotic optimality?

- Concept: Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and its high-level vs. low-level decomposition
  - Why needed here: To understand the overall algorithm structure and how conflicts are resolved at the high level while paths are planned at the low level.
  - Quick check question: In CBS, what information is contained in a constraint, and how does it affect the low-level path planner?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - High-level: CE-CBS (CBS variant) - manages conflicts and coordinates agents
  - Low-level: Modified RRT* - plans individual paths with constraints
  - Smoothing: B-spline interpolation - generates smooth, feasible trajectories
  - Validation: Obstacle and constraint checking - ensures safety and feasibility

- Critical path: CE-CBS → GetFirstConflict → RRT* planning with constraints → Path validation → B-spline smoothing → Conflict resolution

- Design tradeoffs:
  - ηmax vs. computational time: Higher values yield better paths but increase runtime
  - Angle constraint vs. path feasibility: Stricter angles may make some environments unsolvable
  - Agent radius vs. path length: Larger agents require longer detours

- Failure signatures:
  - No solution found: Likely due to overly restrictive constraints or poor ηmax setting
  - Long computational time: Indicates many conflicts requiring repeated RRT* replanning
  - Paths with sharp turns: Suggests angle constraint is too lenient or smoothing failed

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary ηmax (1000, 5000, 10000) on a simple 3-agent scenario and measure path length and computation time.
  2. Test different agent radii (1, 5, 10) in a narrow corridor scenario to observe path deviation.
  3. Compare CE-CBS vs. discrete CBS on a grid map with diagonal moves allowed, measuring sum of costs and runtime.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the CE-CBS algorithm scale in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality as the number of agents increases in continuous environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the performance of CE-CBS under various settings and parameters, including the impact of the maximum number of RRT* nodes and agent radius. However, it does not explicitly address how the algorithm scales with an increasing number of agents.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on testing CE-CBS with a limited number of agents (up to 4) and does not provide a detailed analysis of scalability with larger numbers of agents.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing the performance of CE-CBS with a significantly larger number of agents, including computational time, path length, and the number of conflicts, would provide insights into its scalability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the minimal turning angle constraint on the quality of the paths and the computational efficiency of CE-CBS?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the minimal angle constraint is set to 90 degrees to ensure that simulated robots can perform the turns. However, it does not explore the effects of varying this constraint.
- Why unresolved: The paper sets a fixed minimal angle constraint without investigating how different values affect the algorithm's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with different minimal turning angle constraints, comparing path quality and computational efficiency, would reveal the impact of this parameter on CE-CBS.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does CE-CBS perform in environments with varying levels of obstacle density and complexity compared to other MAPF algorithms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares CE-CBS with CBS and SMT-CBS in simplified environments but does not extensively test its performance in environments with different obstacle densities and complexities.
- Why unresolved: The comparison is limited to specific scenarios, and there is no comprehensive analysis of CE-CBS's performance across a range of environmental complexities.
- What evidence would resolve it: A series of experiments testing CE-CBS in environments with varying obstacle densities and complexities, compared to other MAPF algorithms, would provide a clearer understanding of its robustness and adaptability.

## Limitations
- Lack of comprehensive experimental comparisons with other continuous MAPF algorithms.
- Limited exploration of the impact of agent shape (circular vs. non-circular) and varying speeds on the algorithm's performance.
- No discussion of the algorithm's scalability to large-scale problems or its performance in highly dynamic environments.

## Confidence
- Confidence in the major claims is moderate. The mechanism for conflict resolution and the integration of RRT* with kinematic constraints appear sound, but the lack of detailed implementation information and limited experimental results prevent a higher confidence assessment.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments comparing CE-CBS with other continuous MAPF algorithms, such as SMT-CBS or MAPF-POST, on a diverse set of scenarios.
2. Investigate the impact of agent shape and varying speeds on the algorithm's performance, particularly in terms of path quality and computational efficiency.
3. Assess the scalability of CE-CBS to large-scale problems with numerous agents and evaluate its performance in highly dynamic environments with frequent obstacle changes or agent arrivals/departures.
