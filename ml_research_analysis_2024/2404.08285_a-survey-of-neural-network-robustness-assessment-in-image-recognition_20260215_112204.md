# A Survey of Neural Network Robustness Assessment in Image Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08285
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08285
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Surveys methods for assessing neural network robustness in image recognition, covering adversarial and corruption robustness

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of methods for assessing neural network robustness in image recognition tasks. The authors analyze existing concepts, metrics, and assessment approaches, categorizing them into local (point-specific) and global (system-wide) robustness. The survey covers formal verification, statistical verification, adversarial testing, and benchmark testing approaches, along with test adequacy metrics. The authors identify key challenges in the field including computational inefficiency for large models and lack of standardized benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews robustness assessment methods in image recognition by first establishing clear distinctions between adversarial robustness (AR) against deliberate attacks and corruption robustness (CR) against natural data corruptions. The authors then categorize assessment approaches into local and global metrics, followed by an analysis of formal verification methods, statistical verification techniques, adversarial testing approaches, and benchmark testing methodologies. The survey synthesizes findings from existing literature to provide a comprehensive taxonomy of robustness assessment approaches.

## Key Results
- Proposes taxonomy categorizing robustness assessment into local vs global metrics and formal/statistical verification vs adversarial/benchmark testing
- Identifies computational inefficiency as major challenge for large models, limiting practical deployment of verification methods
- Concludes that testing-based assessment approaches show more promise for future development than formal verification methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's methodology works by systematically categorizing robustness assessment approaches based on their scope (local vs global) and methodology (verification vs testing). This classification enables clear comparison between different assessment strategies and helps identify their respective strengths and limitations. The distinction between adversarial robustness and corruption robustness provides a framework for understanding different threat models and their corresponding assessment needs.

## Foundational Learning

**Formal Verification** - Mathematical methods proving properties about neural networks; needed for guaranteed robustness bounds, quick check: can verify small networks but struggles with scalability

**Statistical Verification** - Probabilistic approaches using sampling and statistical methods; needed when formal guarantees are computationally prohibitive, quick check: provides probabilistic bounds rather than deterministic guarantees

**Adversarial Testing** - Generating worst-case inputs to probe model vulnerabilities; needed for practical assessment of real-world attack scenarios, quick check: effectiveness depends on attack strategy diversity

**Benchmark Testing** - Using standardized corrupted datasets to evaluate model robustness; needed for reproducible and comparable evaluations, quick check: requires diverse corruption types and severity levels

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Formal Verification -> Statistical Verification -> Adversarial Testing -> Benchmark Testing

Critical path: Problem formulation (AR vs CR distinction) → Assessment method selection (local vs global) → Evaluation approach (verification vs testing) → Metric application (specific tests)

Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency vs completeness of assessment; formal guarantees vs practical applicability; attack diversity vs computational cost

Failure signatures: Incomplete coverage of robustness space; computational intractability for large models; lack of standardized evaluation protocols

First experiments: 1) Compare assessment results across multiple CNN architectures on CIFAR-10; 2) Evaluate scalability of formal verification methods on progressively larger networks; 3) Test correlation between adversarial and corruption robustness scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Survey focuses primarily on image recognition, potentially limiting generalizability to other domains
- Analysis lacks quantitative benchmarks comparing computational costs across different assessment approaches
- Limited discussion of how existing robustness benchmarks address emerging threat vectors and attack strategies

## Confidence
High: Taxonomy of robustness assessment methods (formal verification, statistical verification, adversarial testing, benchmark testing)
Medium: Testing-based approaches are "more promising" without systematic comparison across model architectures
Low: Standardized benchmarks are needed despite existing datasets like CIFAR-10-C and ImageNet-C

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic comparison of assessment method performance across multiple model architectures (CNNs, Transformers) and dataset sizes to validate computational efficiency claims
2. Develop and evaluate standardized metric that combines AR and CR scores for fair model comparison across robustness types
3. Test survey's taxonomy against emerging robustness assessment methods from past two years to verify continued relevance and identify missing categories
