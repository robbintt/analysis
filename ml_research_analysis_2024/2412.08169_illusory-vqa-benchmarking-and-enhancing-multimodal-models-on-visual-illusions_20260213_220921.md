# Illusory VQA: Benchmarking and Enhancing Multimodal Models on Visual Illusions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.08169
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08169
- Reference count: 38
- State-of-the-art multimodal models struggle with visual illusions, but Gaussian and blur low-pass filters significantly improve performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Illusory VQA, a novel task and four datasets (IllusionMNIST, IllusionFashionMNIST, IllusionAnimals, IllusionChar) to evaluate multimodal models on visual illusions. State-of-the-art models struggle with illusory images, but applying Gaussian and blur low-pass filters significantly improves performance. For example, BLIP-2 on IllusionAnimals without fine-tuning outperforms humans. Fine-tuning further enhances results, and the proposed method demonstrates robustness across datasets. The work bridges the gap between human and model perception of illusions, suggesting future directions like adaptive filters and broader dataset exploration.

## Method Summary
The method involves generating synthetic illusory images using ControlNet-based image generation from LLM descriptions. The proposed solution applies Gaussian and blur low-pass filters to these images to remove fine details that confuse models. The approach is evaluated through zero-shot performance testing of multimodal models (BLIP, BLIP-2, CLIP, LLaVA) on the four datasets, followed by fine-tuning experiments. Models are fine-tuned using LoRA for LLaVA due to hardware constraints, with specific hyperparameters for each model.

## Key Results
- BLIP-2 on IllusionAnimals without fine-tuning outperforms human performance
- Gaussian and blur low-pass filters significantly improve model performance across all datasets
- Fine-tuning enhances results, with improved performance on both illusory and raw images
- Disparity between human and model perception of illusions is demonstrated

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Gaussian and blur low-pass filters improve model performance on illusory images by removing fine details that confuse the models.
- Mechanism: Applying Gaussian blur and low-pass filtering smooths out high-frequency components in the image, which are often responsible for creating the illusion. This preprocessing step makes the underlying real concept more prominent, allowing the model to focus on the correct class rather than being misled by illusory details.
- Core assumption: The fine details and high-frequency components in illusory images are the primary source of confusion for the models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose a simple yet effective solution for illusion detection using Gaussian and blur low-pass filters. We show that this method increases the performance of models significantly..."
  - [section]: "Our approach involves the application of a fixed Gaussian and blur filter to illusory images."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. The related papers do not specifically discuss the use of Gaussian and blur filters for improving model performance on illusory images.
- Break condition: If the illusion is not primarily based on high-frequency components, or if the model relies on other cues that are also removed by the filter, the performance improvement may not be observed.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning the models on illusory images improves their ability to detect and interpret illusions.
- Mechanism: By exposing the models to a dataset containing illusory images during training, they learn to recognize the patterns and characteristics of illusions. This exposure allows the models to develop a better understanding of how illusions work and how to distinguish them from the real concept.
- Core assumption: The models can learn to recognize and interpret illusions through exposure during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We assess the zero-shot performance of various models, fine-tune selected models on our datasets, and propose a simple yet effective solution for illusion detection..."
  - [section]: "We further enhance the evaluation by fine-tuning some of the multimodal models on the training set and then re-evaluating their performance on the test set."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. The related papers do not specifically discuss fine-tuning models on illusory images to improve their performance.
- Break condition: If the model architecture is not capable of learning the complex patterns and characteristics of illusions, or if the training data is not diverse enough to cover a wide range of illusions, the fine-tuning may not lead to significant improvements.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The disparity between human and model perception of illusions highlights the need for more human-like visual understanding in multimodal models.
- Mechanism: Humans have a remarkable ability to perceive and interpret illusions, often seeing both the real and illusory concepts in an image. By developing models that can mimic this human-like perception, we can create more robust and accurate systems for visual understanding and reasoning.
- Core assumption: Mimicking human perception of illusions can lead to more robust and accurate visual understanding in models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our findings highlight the disparity between human and model perception of illusions..."
  - [section]: "This work contributes to the development of more human-like visual understanding in multimodal models..."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. The related papers do not specifically discuss the need for more human-like visual understanding in multimodal models based on the disparity between human and model perception of illusions.
- Break condition: If the goal is not to mimic human perception, or if the model architecture is not suitable for incorporating human-like visual understanding, this mechanism may not be applicable.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Data generation pipeline (LLM descriptions + raw images) → ControlNet-based image generation → Model evaluation (zero-shot and fine-tuned) → Preprocessing (Gaussian and blur filters) → Performance analysis
- Critical path: Data generation → Model evaluation (zero-shot and fine-tuned) → Preprocessing (filters) → Performance analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Synthetic vs. real-world data: Using synthetically generated illusory images allows for controlled experimentation but may not fully capture the complexity of real-world illusions.
  - Filter selection: The choice of Gaussian and blur low-pass filters is based on their effectiveness in improving model performance, but other filters or preprocessing techniques may also be explored.
- Failure signatures:
  - Models struggle with zero-shot performance on illusory images, indicating a lack of inherent understanding of illusions.
  - Fine-tuning on illusory images improves performance, but the extent of improvement may vary depending on the model architecture and dataset characteristics.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the zero-shot performance of a pre-trained multimodal model (e.g., CLIP) on the Illusory VQA task using the IllusionMNIST dataset.
  2. Apply the Gaussian and blur low-pass filters to the illusory images in the IllusionMNIST dataset and re-evaluate the model's performance.
  3. Fine-tune the model on the training set of the IllusionMNIST dataset and assess its performance on the test set, both with and without the application of filters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Question: How would VLMs perform on illusory images if adaptive, learnable filters were used instead of the fixed Gaussian and blur low-pass filters?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention "future directions for adapting filters using learnable parameters" and suggest that adaptive filters could be explored.
  - Why unresolved: The paper only tested fixed filters and showed their effectiveness, but did not investigate adaptive or learnable filters that could potentially perform better.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of VLMs using fixed filters versus adaptive/learned filters on the same illusory image datasets, with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Question: Can fine-tuning VLMs on illusory images improve their performance on non-illusory images?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observed that fine-tuning on illusory data sometimes increased performance on raw images.
  - Why unresolved: While the paper noted this phenomenon, it did not systematically investigate whether this improvement is consistent across different models, datasets, or fine-tuning strategies.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study analyzing the transfer learning effects of fine-tuning on illusory images, including ablations and control experiments on various VLMs and datasets.
- Question: How would VLMs perform on illusory images with multiple large objects or multi-object scenes?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledged a limitation that their datasets focused on single large objects to simplify evaluation, suggesting this could affect the task's difficulty.
  - Why unresolved: The current datasets and experiments do not test the models' ability to handle more complex illusory scenarios with multiple objects.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using illusory image datasets with multi-object scenes, measuring VLMs' accuracy and robustness in detecting and interpreting illusions in such complex scenarios.

## Limitations
- Synthetic datasets may not fully capture the complexity of real-world illusions
- Limited exploration of why specific filters work best for illusion detection
- Potential biases in synthetic data generation process not discussed
- Focus on single large objects in images may not reflect real-world scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence in the experimental setup and methodology for evaluating model performance on illusory images.
- Medium confidence in the proposed solution using Gaussian and blur low-pass filters, as the mechanism is plausible but not extensively validated.
- Low confidence in the generalizability of the results to real-world scenarios, given the synthetic nature of the datasets.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a comparative analysis of different preprocessing techniques (e.g., other types of filters, image transformations) to determine the most effective approach for improving model performance on illusory images.
2. Investigate the robustness of the proposed solution across a wider range of visual illusions, including real-world examples, to assess its generalizability.
3. Explore the use of adaptive filtering techniques that can dynamically adjust based on the specific characteristics of each illusory image, rather than relying on fixed filter parameters.
