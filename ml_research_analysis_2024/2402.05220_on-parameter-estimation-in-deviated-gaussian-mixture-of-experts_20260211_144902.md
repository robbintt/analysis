core_contribution: This paper studies parameter estimation in deviated Gaussian mixture
  of experts (DGME), a model arising in goodness-of-fit testing where data are generated
  from a mixture of a known function and a Gaussian mixture of experts. The main challenge
  is that the known function interacts with the mixture part, making parameter estimation
  more complex than in standard Gaussian mixture of experts.

- Introduces novel Voronoi-based loss functions for parameter estimation in deviated Gaussian mixture of experts

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the parameter estimation problem in deviated Gaussian mixture of experts (DGME), a specialized mixture model where data are generated from a combination of a known function and a Gaussian mixture of experts. The proposed approach introduces novel Voronoi-based loss functions designed to capture local convergence rates more accurately than standard generalized Wasserstein loss, particularly in settings where the known function interacts with the mixture component. The theoretical framework establishes parametric convergence rates under both distinguishable and non-distinguishable parameter settings, with the convergence behavior determined by the solvability of associated polynomial equations.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce Voronoi-based loss functions as an alternative to generalized Wasserstein loss for parameter estimation in DGME models. These loss functions are designed to accurately capture the local convergence rates of maximum likelihood estimation by accounting for the interaction between the known function and the Gaussian mixture experts. The method establishes parametric convergence rates under two distinct settings: distinguishable parameters (where the known function and mixture components can be separated) and non-distinguishable parameters (where the interaction is more complex). The convergence rates are characterized by the solvability of a system of polynomial equations that determine the model's identifiability and estimation accuracy.

## Key Results
- Voronoi-based loss functions outperform generalized Wasserstein loss in characterizing distinct parameter estimation rates
- Parametric convergence rates established under both distinguishable and non-distinguishable parameter settings
- Convergence rates determined by solvability of polynomial equations
- Theoretical results validated through simulation studies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Voronoi-based loss functions work by partitioning the data space into regions based on the Voronoi tessellation associated with the Gaussian mixture components. This partitioning allows the loss function to capture local convergence properties more accurately than global distance metrics like the generalized Wasserstein loss. The method leverages the structure of the deviated Gaussian mixture model to create loss functions that are sensitive to the specific interaction patterns between the known function and the mixture experts, enabling more precise parameter estimation.

## Foundational Learning

**Gaussian Mixture Models** - Why needed: Foundation for understanding mixture of experts framework; Quick check: Verify understanding of EM algorithm for standard GMMs.

**Mixture of Experts** - Why needed: Core model architecture being extended; Quick check: Understand gating networks and expert specialization.

**Voronoi Tessellations** - Why needed: Basis for the proposed loss functions; Quick check: Can construct Voronoi diagrams for simple point sets.

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation** - Why needed: Primary estimation method being analyzed; Quick check: Derive MLE for simple parametric distributions.

**Polynomial Equation Systems** - Why needed: Determines convergence rate characterization; Quick check: Solve small systems of polynomial equations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data → Known Function + Gaussian Mixture Experts → Voronoi Partitioning → Voronoi-based Loss → Parameter Estimation

**Critical Path**: The estimation pipeline follows: data generation → mixture component identification → Voronoi tessellation construction → loss computation → parameter optimization via MLE.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice of Voronoi-based loss functions over generalized Wasserstein loss prioritizes local convergence accuracy at the potential cost of computational complexity. The approach trades off global distance minimization for more nuanced local structure capture.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance when polynomial equation systems are unsolvable, indicating non-identifiability; failure to converge when the known function and mixture components are too entangled; computational issues with high-dimensional Voronoi constructions.

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify Voronoi-based loss captures local structure in simple 2D cases; 2) Compare convergence rates with generalized Wasserstein loss on synthetic data; 3) Test polynomial equation solvability across different parameter regimes.
