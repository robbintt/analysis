# Data-Driven Upper Confidence Bounds with Near-Optimal Regret for Heavy-Tailed Bandits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.05710
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05710
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: RMM-UCB achieves near-optimal regret O(n^(1/(1+a))) for heavy-tailed bandits without requiring tail parameter knowledge

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to stochastic multi-armed bandits with heavy-tailed, symmetric reward distributions. The authors propose using a one-sided resampled median-of-means (RMM) estimator to construct data-driven upper confidence bounds that eliminate the need for prior knowledge of moment parameters or tail exponents. The resulting RMM-UCB algorithm combines this RMM-based confidence bound construction with the standard UCB strategy, achieving near-optimal regret bounds while remaining parameter-free and anytime.

## Method Summary
The method centers on the resampled median-of-means (RMM) estimator, which provides robust concentration bounds for heavy-tailed distributions without requiring knowledge of moment parameters. The RMM-UCB algorithm uses this estimator to construct upper confidence bounds for each arm's mean reward. At each round, the algorithm selects the arm with the highest upper confidence bound and updates the RMM estimator for that arm. The RMM estimator involves partitioning reward samples into blocks, computing block means, and then taking the median of resampled means, which provides robustness to outliers while maintaining concentration properties.

## Key Results
- Achieves near-optimal regret bound of O(n^(1/(1+a))) up to logarithmic factors
- Eliminates need for prior knowledge of tail exponent a or moment bound M
- Outperforms baseline UCB methods and recent data-driven algorithms in numerical experiments
- Maintains parameter-free and anytime properties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of RMM-UCB stems from the robust concentration properties of the resampled median-of-means estimator. Unlike traditional empirical mean estimators that require bounded moments, RMM provides concentration bounds that depend only on the tail exponent a. By using a one-sided version of RMM for upper confidence bounds, the algorithm can effectively control exploration while remaining robust to heavy-tailed outliers. The resampled nature of the estimator further strengthens the concentration guarantees, allowing for tighter confidence bounds without requiring knowledge of the underlying distribution parameters.

## Foundational Learning
- Heavy-tailed distributions: Understanding distributions with polynomial decay rather than exponential decay; needed because many real-world reward distributions exhibit heavy tails
- Median-of-means estimators: Robust estimation technique that partitions data and uses medians; needed to handle outliers in heavy-tailed data
- Concentration inequalities: Probabilistic bounds on deviation from true values; needed to construct valid confidence bounds
- Multi-armed bandit framework: Sequential decision making under uncertainty; needed as the foundational problem setting
- Tail exponent: Parameter controlling the decay rate of tail probabilities; needed to characterize the difficulty of bandit problems

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** RMM estimator -> Confidence bound construction -> UCB selection -> Arm pull -> Reward observation -> RMM update

**Critical path:** The critical path flows from RMM estimator computation through confidence bound construction to UCB selection, as each component directly affects the algorithm's exploration-exploitation balance. The RMM estimator is the most critical component as it determines the quality of confidence bounds.

**Design tradeoffs:** The main tradeoff is between computational complexity and statistical efficiency. RMM requires more computation than simple empirical means but provides stronger guarantees for heavy-tailed data. The block size and number of resamples must be chosen to balance concentration bounds against computational cost.

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance occurs when the reward distribution has significant asymmetry or when the suboptimality gap is extremely small relative to the noise level. The algorithm may also suffer when the number of arms is very large relative to the time horizon.

**3 first experiments:** (1) Compare RMM-UCB against standard UCB on synthetic heavy-tailed data with known tail exponent; (2) Test RMM-UCB on asymmetric heavy-tailed distributions to assess robustness; (3) Evaluate performance across different suboptimality gap values to understand the algorithm's sensitivity to problem difficulty.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes symmetric reward distributions, limiting applicability to real-world asymmetric scenarios
- Numerical experiments are limited in scope and don't thoroughly explore performance across different tail exponents
- Computational complexity of RMM estimator may be prohibitive for very large-scale problems

## Confidence
- Theoretical claims: High
- Practical effectiveness: Medium

## Next Checks
- Empirical testing on asymmetric heavy-tailed distributions to verify if RMM-UCB maintains performance advantages
- Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art data-driven methods when tail exponent is unknown but non-symmetric
- Stress-testing with different suboptimality gap values to determine if theoretical advantages hold across practical settings
