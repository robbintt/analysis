# Automatic Prediction of the Performance of Every Parser

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.05116
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05116
- Authors: Ergun Biçici
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: MTPPS-PPP achieves state-of-the-art parser performance prediction (MAE 0.0678, RAE 0.85) using only extrinsic features without parser or language-specific information.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MTPPS-PPP, a novel parser performance prediction (PPP) model that uses machine translation performance prediction system (MTPPS) features to predict the performance of any parser in any language. The method relies solely on extrinsic features based on textual, link structural, and bracketing tree structural information, making it statistically independent of any language or parser. The MTPPS-PPP system can predict parser performance without actually parsing, without using a reference parser output, and without any parser or language dependent information.

## Method Summary
The MTPPS-PPP method extracts features from raw text using textual n-grams, link structures from an unsupervised parser (CCL), and tree structure statistics. These features are combined with optional comparative F1 (CF1) scores when available. Dimensionality reduction techniques (FS, PLS) are applied before training regression models (SVR, RR, TREE) to predict the bracketing F1 score of any parser. The approach is designed to be parser-independent and language-independent by relying only on extrinsic features that measure similarity of grammatical structures, vocabulary, and their distributions.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art PPP results with MAE of 0.0678 and RAE of 0.85 on WSJ23 test set
- Corresponds to approximately 7.4% error in bracketing F1 score prediction
- Can predict performance without parsing, without reference parser output, and without parser or language dependent information
- Achieves SoA prediction performance with only 11 labeled instances for RAE of 0.85

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MTPPS-PPP achieves parser-independent performance prediction by using only extrinsic features derived from text, link structures, and tree structures.
- Mechanism: The model relies on features that measure similarity of grammatical structures, vocabulary, and their distributions without needing parser-specific or language-specific information. This allows prediction across any parser and language.
- Core assumption: Extrinsic features (textual n-grams, link-based metrics from unsupervised parsing, and tree structural statistics) are sufficient to capture the essential characteristics that determine parsing performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states MTPPS-PPP "relies only on extrinsic and novel features based on textual, link structural, and bracketing tree structural information" and is "statistically independent of any language or parser."
  - [section] explains features like "n-grams as the basic units of information," "link structures from unsupervised parser CCL," and "tree structure statistics" are used.
- Break condition: If the extrinsic features fail to capture parser-specific nuances or if the unsupervised parser (CCL) provides insufficient structural information for certain languages or domains.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The model can predict parser performance without actually parsing or using reference parser output.
- Mechanism: By using machine translation performance prediction system (MTPPS) features, the model estimates parsing difficulty and performance based on how close a sentence is to the training data and how difficult it is to translate to known instances.
- Core assumption: MTPPS features that measure similarity to training data and translation difficulty are good proxies for parsing performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states MTPPS-PPP "can predict without parsing using only the text, without a supervised parser using only an unsupervised parser, without any parser or language dependent information, without using a reference parser output."
  - [section] describes MTPPS as measuring "closeness of a given sentence to be parsed to the training set available, the difficulty of retrieving close sentences from the training set, and the difficulty of translating them to a known training instance."
- Break condition: If the relationship between translation difficulty and parsing difficulty is not consistent across different parsers or languages.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relatively small number of labeled instances.
- Mechanism: Statistical analysis shows that prediction error decreases with more training instances, and the model achieves RAE of 0.85 with only 11 labeled instances.
- Core assumption: The feature set is highly informative, allowing accurate predictions with limited data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] presents "Statistical Lower Bound on Error" showing that "we can reach SoA prediction performance" with 11 instances for RAE of 0.85.
  - [section] states "We achieve 0.0678 MAE and 0.85 RAE in setting +Link, which corresponds to about 7.4% error."
- Break condition: If the feature space is not sufficiently rich or if the relationship between features and performance is highly non-linear and requires more data to model accurately.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Statistical learning and feature selection
  - Why needed here: The model uses various learning algorithms (SVR, RR, TREE) and feature selection techniques (FS, PLS) to predict parser performance.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between SVR (Support Vector Regression) and RR (Ridge Regression) in the context of this model?

- Concept: Unsupervised parsing and tree structure analysis
  - Why needed here: The model uses an unsupervised parser (CCL) to derive link structures and tree statistics without needing labeled training data.
  - Quick check question: How does an unsupervised parser like CCL differ from a supervised parser in terms of input requirements and output?

- Concept: Machine translation performance prediction (MTPPS)
  - Why needed here: MTPPS features are adapted to predict parser performance by measuring similarity to training data and translation difficulty.
  - Quick check question: How are MTPPS features typically used in machine translation, and how are they adapted for parser performance prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw text -> Textual features, Link features (CCL), Tree features -> Dimensionality reduction (FS, PLS) -> Learning models (SVR, RR, TREE) -> Predicted F1 score

- Critical path:
  1. Extract textual features from input text
  2. Parse text with CCL to get link structures
  3. Extract tree structure statistics
  4. Calculate CF1 if available
  5. Apply dimensionality reduction
  6. Train learning model
  7. Predict performance

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using unsupervised parser (CCL) vs. supervised parser: CCL allows parser-independent prediction but may be less accurate than supervised parsers.
  - Feature richness vs. computational cost: More features can improve prediction but increase computation time.
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability: Complex models may perform better but are harder to interpret.

- Failure signatures:
  - High RMSE or MAE on test set: Model is not generalizing well.
  - Low correlation (r) between predicted and actual performance: Model is not capturing the relationship between features and performance.
  - Dimensionality reduction removes important features: Model loses critical information.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run feature extraction on a small set of sentences and verify the output dimensions and values.
  2. Train a simple regression model (e.g., RR) with a subset of features and evaluate performance.
  3. Compare the performance of different learning models (SVR, RR, TREE) on the same feature set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Reliance on CCL unsupervised parser for link structure features may not capture all linguistic nuances needed for accurate performance prediction across diverse languages.
- Model's effectiveness depends on the assumption that MTPPS features generalize well from machine translation to parsing tasks.
- Does not address performance on very short sentences or highly domain-specific texts that may not be well-represented in the training data.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The state-of-the-art performance metrics (MAE 0.0678, RAE 0.85) reported for WSJ23 test set prediction, as these are based on standard evaluation protocols and datasets.
- **Medium Confidence**: The parser-independent claim, as it relies on the assumption that extrinsic features capture all necessary information for performance prediction across different parsers.
- **Medium Confidence**: The language-independence claim, as the experiments are primarily conducted on English corpora with limited validation on other languages.

## Next Checks
1. Test the MTPPS-PPP model on non-English treebanks to verify the language-independence claim and assess performance degradation across language families.
2. Evaluate the model's predictions across a wider range of parser types (e.g., neural parsers, dependency parsers) beyond the PCFG and CJ parsers used in the study.
3. Conduct a systematic feature ablation study to quantify individual contributions of textual, link, tree, and CF1 features to prediction accuracy.
