## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15477
- Reference count: 15
- Introduces weakly supervised learning method for debiasing models with continuous sensitive attributes

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses algorithmic bias in supervised machine learning models when dealing with continuous-valued sensitive attributes. The authors propose a novel approach that combines a small amount of labeled data with distributional constraints based on the Wasserstein distance to effectively debias model outputs while requiring minimal expert intervention. Through extensive numerical simulations on 1D and 2D signals, the method demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional approaches like instrumental variables. The approach also shows promise in tracking time-varying notions of fairness, making it adaptable to dynamic real-world scenarios.

## Method Summary
The proposed method leverages weakly supervised learning by utilizing a small amount of labeled data alongside a distributional constraint based on the Wasserstein distance. This combination allows the model to learn debiased representations while maintaining predictive performance. The approach requires minimal expert intervention, making it practical for real-world deployment. The Wasserstein distance constraint ensures that the model's outputs respect certain fairness criteria across different values of the sensitive attribute, effectively mitigating bias without sacrificing model accuracy.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates superior debiasing performance compared to traditional instrumental variables approach on 1D and 2D signal datasets
- Shows effectiveness in tracking time-varying notions of fairness in dynamic environments
- Requires minimal labeled data and expert intervention while maintaining theoretical guarantees on performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by combining the strengths of weak supervision with distributional constraints. The small amount of labeled data provides ground truth for the learning process, while the Wasserstein distance constraint ensures that the model's predictions are fair across the distribution of sensitive attributes. This dual approach allows the model to learn meaningful representations that are both accurate and unbiased, without requiring extensive labeled data or complex intervention from domain experts.

## Foundational Learning
- Wasserstein distance: A metric for measuring the distance between probability distributions, crucial for enforcing fairness constraints. Quick check: Understand its properties and how it differs from other distribution distances.
- Weak supervision: A machine learning paradigm that leverages noisy, limited, or imprecise sources to provide supervision signal for labeling training data. Quick check: Know the main advantages and limitations of weak supervision approaches.
- Instrumental variables: A traditional statistical technique for addressing confounding bias, which the proposed method outperforms. Quick check: Understand when and why instrumental variables are typically used in causal inference.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data -> Weak Supervision Layer -> Wasserstein Constraint Module -> Debiased Model -> Fair Outputs

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves processing the input data through the weak supervision layer to extract useful signals, applying the Wasserstein distance constraint to ensure fairness, and finally generating debiased outputs. The Wasserstein constraint module is crucial as it directly enforces the fairness requirements across the distribution of sensitive attributes.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Labeled data vs. model performance: Balancing the amount of labeled data required against the quality of debiasing
- Computational complexity vs. theoretical guarantees: Ensuring the method remains computationally feasible while providing robust theoretical assurances
- Flexibility vs. specificity: Designing the approach to handle both static and time-varying fairness notions

**Failure Signatures:**
- If the Wasserstein constraint is too weak, the model may not effectively debias the outputs
- Insufficient labeled data could lead to poor model performance despite the debiasing efforts
- In dynamic environments, failure to track time-varying fairness notions could result in outdated or inappropriate debiasing

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Apply the method to a synthetic dataset with known bias and measure the reduction in bias while maintaining predictive accuracy
2. Test the method's ability to track time-varying fairness notions by simulating a dynamic environment with changing fairness requirements
3. Compare the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed method against traditional debiasing techniques on large-scale datasets
