# Acquiring Linguistic Knowledge from Multimodal Input

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.17936
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17936
- Authors: Theodor Amariucai; Alex Warstadt
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: Multimodal pretraining does not consistently improve language-only performance compared to text-only baselines across grammar (BLiMP), understanding (GLUE), and generalization (MSGS) benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether multimodal training can improve the data efficiency of language models by testing the hypothesis that vision helps language acquisition. The authors perform an ablation study on FLA V A, a multimodal vision-and-language model, varying text and vision input volumes during pretraining. To address catastrophic forgetting, they use multitask pretraining with both unimodal and multimodal objectives, training on WiT, a Wikipedia-based dataset pairing images with diverse text. Results show that multimodal pretraining does not consistently improve language-only performance compared to text-only baselines across grammar (BLiMP), understanding (GLUE), and generalization (MSGS) benchmarks. While some minor improvements appear at smaller data scales, the authors conclude that the lack of visual input alone does not explain the data efficiency gap between language models and humans, suggesting that better architectures and training techniques are needed for multimodal approaches to be effective.

## Method Summary
The authors investigate multimodal language acquisition using FLA V A, a multimodal vision-and-language model, with an ablation study varying text and vision input volumes during pretraining. To prevent catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning on captions data, they employ multitask pretraining with five objectives: masked language modeling, masked image modeling, masked multimodal modeling, image-text matching, and cross-modal contrastive learning. The models are trained on WiT, a Wikipedia-based dataset that pairs images with a mixture of strongly aligned captions and weakly aligned article text. Eight different model configurations are trained with varying combinations of text volume (10M or 100M words) and image volume (none, 40K, 400K, or 4M images). Language-only performance is evaluated on grammar (BLiMP), understanding (GLUE), and generalization (MSGS) benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Multimodal pretraining does not consistently improve language-only performance compared to text-only baselines across grammar, understanding, and generalization benchmarks
- At smaller data scales (10M words), multimodal pretraining shows some minor improvements in BLiMP performance, suggesting a potential regularizing effect
- Pseudo-perplexity is consistently higher (by 1-3 units) for vision-infused models, indicating that multimodal pretraining may degrade language modeling capacity
- The lack of visual input alone does not explain the data efficiency gap between language models and humans

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal pretraining can regularize language model learning at smaller data scales by preventing overfitting.
- Mechanism: The addition of vision data introduces a second task that shares parameters with the language encoder. This multitask learning objective acts as a regularizer, forcing the model to maintain general representations that can handle both modalities. When training data is limited (e.g., 10M words), this regularization effect can prevent the language encoder from overfitting to the limited text corpus.
- Core assumption: The vision and language encoders share sufficient parameter space that multitask training on vision data constrains the language encoder's capacity to memorize training examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "While we must leave open the possibility that multimodal input explains some of the gap in data efficiency between LMs and humans, positive evidence for this hypothesis will require better architectures and techniques for multimodal training."
  - [section] "We observe that multimodal pretraining may have a regularizing effect at smaller data scales: BLiMP performance improves at times although the pseudo-perplexity (i.e., test loss) is consistently higher (by 1-3 units) for the vision-infused models."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus search returned no directly relevant papers on regularization effects in multimodal training.
- Break condition: If the vision and language encoders become too specialized to their respective modalities, the regularization effect diminishes and the language encoder may still overfit to limited text data.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Vision data provides additional grounding signals that can help disambiguate linguistic meaning through cross-situational learning.
- Mechanism: When a language model sees an image paired with text describing the same scene, it can use the visual features as additional context to resolve ambiguities in word meaning. Over multiple examples, the model accumulates statistical evidence about which visual features correspond to which linguistic concepts, similar to how children learn through cross-situational learning.
- Core assumption: The vision encoder can extract relevant features from images that are semantically related to the paired text, and these features provide complementary information to the language encoder.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To address the first point, one cognitively-motivated mechanism for how children integrate nonlinguistic sensory data in language learning is cross-situational learning (XSL) (Smith and Smith, 2012)."
  - [section] "Encour-agingly, Nikolaus and Fourtassi (2021) find that, in a highly constrained visual-linguistic domain, computational multimodal models do benefit from cross-situational learning."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus search returned papers on cross-situational learning but none specifically validating its effectiveness in large-scale multimodal pretraining.
- Break condition: If the vision-text alignments are too weak or noisy (as in Wikipedia articles where images may not directly illustrate the text), the cross-situational learning signal becomes unreliable and may even introduce confusion.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multimodal pretraining can improve the model's ability to handle out-of-distribution text by exposing it to more diverse contexts.
- Mechanism: Wikipedia images are paired with both formulaic captions and complex article text. This diverse pairing exposes the language encoder to a wider variety of linguistic constructions than text-only pretraining on Wikipedia alone would provide. The model learns to associate the same visual content with different linguistic styles, improving its robustness.
- Core assumption: The diversity of text paired with images in the training data is sufficient to expose the language encoder to meaningful linguistic variation beyond what it would encounter in text-only pretraining.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we train on the Wikipedia-based WiT dataset (Srinivasan et al., 2021), which pairs images with a mixture of strongly aligned (but formulaic) captions and weakly aligned (but syntactically complex) articles."
  - [section] "Furthermore, WiT features multiple types of text aligned with a given image. From most strongly aligned to most weakly aligned, these include alt text, captions, article text from the same section as the image, and article text from the lead section."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus search returned no papers specifically addressing how multimodal pretraining affects out-of-distribution generalization in language models.
- Break condition: If the majority of image-text pairs in the dataset have weak alignment (as appears to be the case in WiT), the language encoder may learn to ignore the visual modality entirely, negating any potential benefits from increased linguistic diversity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Catastrophic forgetting in neural networks
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly addresses catastrophic forgetting as a concern when fine-tuning pretrained language models on captions data. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for interpreting why the authors chose multitask pretraining instead.
  - Quick check question: What happens to a neural network's performance on task A when it is fine-tuned on task B without any mechanism to preserve knowledge of task A?

- Concept: Cross-situational learning
  - Why needed here: The paper hypothesizes that vision might help language learning through cross-situational learning, a mechanism observed in child language acquisition. Understanding this cognitive mechanism helps evaluate whether the experimental design adequately tests this hypothesis.
  - Quick check question: How does a learner accumulate evidence about word meanings when observing multiple instances of words paired with objects across different situations?

- Concept: Multitask learning and task scheduling
  - Why needed here: The paper uses multitask pretraining with five different objectives. Understanding how task scheduling and early stopping work in this context is important for interpreting the experimental results and limitations.
  - Quick check question: In multitask learning, how do you determine when to stop training on one task to prevent it from overfitting while ensuring other tasks continue to learn?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text encoder (ViT-B/16 based) -> Multimodal encoder (concatenates text and vision encoder outputs) -> Five task-specific heads (masked language modeling, masked image modeling, masked multimodal modeling, image-text matching, cross-modal contrastive learning) -> Three data loaders (text-only, vision-only, multimodal)

- Critical path: Text encoder → Multimodal encoder → Task heads for language evaluation
  The text encoder's performance on language tasks is the primary outcome measure, so understanding how vision data affects its representations through the multimodal encoder is critical.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Shared vs. separate parameters: The text and vision encoders share the multimodal encoder but have separate parameters. This design balances parameter efficiency with modality-specific processing.
  - Multitask vs. sequential training: The authors chose multitask training to prevent catastrophic forgetting, but this may lead to slower convergence on individual tasks.
  - Data alignment: WiT contains weakly aligned text, which may reduce the effectiveness of cross-situational learning but increases linguistic diversity.

- Failure signatures:
  - If pseudo-perplexity consistently degrades with more vision data while language performance remains flat, this suggests the model is sacrificing language modeling capacity for multimodal objectives.
  - If BLiMP performance improves at small data scales but not at large scales, this suggests a regularization effect that diminishes as more text data becomes available.
  - If cross-modal retrieval performance is near chance, this indicates the model has not learned to align visual and linguistic representations effectively.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run a baseline experiment with only the text encoder (no vision or multimodal components) to establish the performance ceiling for language-only training.
  2. Test different task scheduling strategies (uniform vs. proportional sampling) to optimize the balance between language and multimodal objectives.
  3. Evaluate cross-modal retrieval on a dataset with stronger image-text alignment (like Conceptual Captions) to determine if the weak alignment in WiT is limiting the model's ability to learn grounded representations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the architectural difference between unimodal and multimodal models (unused visual encoder parameters) contribute to observed performance differences, or are improvements primarily due to visual grounding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Finally, there is an architectural difference between the unimodal and multimodal models in our experiments... they may have an indirect effect on what the language encoder learns"
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares models with different architectures and cannot isolate the effect of unused parameters
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments replacing visual input with random noise while maintaining multimodal architecture would determine if improvements are due to visual grounding versus increased parameter count

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between modality-specific and shared learning rates in multitask multimodal pretraining to maximize language performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We use two distinct learning rates... Multiple strategies for correctly choosing modality-specific learning rates are treated extensively in Yao and Mihalcea (2022)"
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a simple "Keep" strategy without exploring alternatives or conducting systematic hyperparameter search
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive comparison of different learning rate scheduling strategies and their effects on language-only performance metrics

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can multimodal pretraining improve data efficiency for language acquisition at scales approaching human language exposure (100M+ words) when using alternative training methodologies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "positive evidence for this hypothesis will require better architectures and techniques for multimodal training"
- Why unresolved: Current experiments show no consistent improvements even with attempts to prevent catastrophic forgetting
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of reliable language performance improvements in multimodal models trained on human-scale datasets using novel architectures or training objectives beyond current masking-based approaches

## Limitations

- The weak alignment between images and text in the WiT dataset (only ~5% of text comes from captions or alt-text) may have severely limited the potential for cross-situational learning benefits
- The multitask pretraining approach, while preventing catastrophic forgetting, may have created interference between objectives that masked potential benefits
- The ablation design varies both text and image volumes simultaneously, making it difficult to isolate whether the lack of improvement stems from insufficient data scale, modality-specific factors, or interactions between them

## Confidence

- High confidence: The technical implementation of the multimodal training framework (FLA V A architecture, multitask pretraining with five objectives, modality-specific early stopping) is well-specified and reproducible. The experimental results showing no consistent improvements across benchmarks are robust to the tested conditions.
- Medium confidence: The conclusion that "the lack of visual input alone does not explain the data efficiency gap between LMs and humans" is reasonable given the evidence, but the strong qualification about needing "better architectures and techniques for multimodal training" suggests the authors themselves are uncertain about the broader implications.
- Low confidence: The interpretation that cross-situational learning would not be effective in this setup based on weak image-text alignment, while plausible, is not directly tested. The paper speculates about this mechanism but does not provide evidence for or against its potential effectiveness with better-aligned data.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate with stronger alignment: Train the same model architecture on a dataset with high-quality image-text alignment (e.g., Conceptual Captions or localized Wikipedia images with strong caption-article correspondence) while keeping all other experimental conditions constant to test whether alignment strength is the limiting factor.

2. Isolate modality effects: Design an experiment that varies text volume and image volume independently rather than jointly, training separate models with only text scaling, only image scaling, and both scaling together to identify whether the lack of improvement is due to insufficient text data, insufficient image data, or modality interactions.

3. Test downstream generalization: Evaluate the pretrained models on out-of-distribution language tasks that might benefit more from grounded representations, such as visual question answering or grounded commonsense reasoning benchmarks, to determine if multimodal pretraining provides benefits not captured by traditional language benchmarks.
