# Noise-robust zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis conditioned on self-supervised speech-representation model with adapters

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2401.05111
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05111
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Achieves high-quality speech synthesis with noisy reference speech through adapter-based adaptation of self-supervised speech representation models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of noise-robust zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis using self-supervised learning (SSL) models. The proposed method introduces adapters into the SSL model to adapt the embedding extractor to noisy conditions. By fine-tuning adapters jointly with a TTS model, optimal embeddings in noisy conditions are ensured while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Adapters are applied to both transformers and CNN feature extractors within the SSL model. A speech enhancement (SE) front-end is also employed to further reduce the influence of noise. Objective and subjective evaluations confirm that the proposed method achieves high-quality speech synthesis with noisy reference speech and effectively works in combination with SE.

## Method Summary
The method introduces adapter modules into a self-supervised speech representation model to create noise-robust zero-shot TTS synthesis. These adapters are trained jointly with the TTS model, allowing the embedding extractor to adapt to noisy conditions while preventing catastrophic forgetting. The adapters are applied to both transformer and CNN components of the SSL model. Additionally, a speech enhancement front-end is incorporated to further reduce noise influence. This approach enables the system to generate high-quality speech even when reference audio contains noise.

## Key Results
- Achieves high-quality speech synthesis with noisy reference speech through adapter-based adaptation
- Adapter-based fine-tuning prevents catastrophic forgetting while optimizing embeddings for noisy conditions
- Speech enhancement front-end effectively reduces noise influence when combined with adapter-based approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed method works by introducing adapter modules into the SSL model, which allows the embedding extractor to adapt to noisy conditions without modifying the original SSL parameters. This prevents catastrophic forgetting while ensuring optimal embeddings for TTS synthesis. The adapters can be applied to both transformer and CNN components of the SSL model, providing flexibility in adaptation. The speech enhancement front-end further reduces noise influence, creating a robust pipeline for zero-shot TTS synthesis.

## Foundational Learning
- **Self-supervised speech representation learning**: Needed to extract meaningful embeddings from speech without requiring manual labels; quick check: verify SSL model can generate useful representations for TTS
- **Adapter-based fine-tuning**: Required to adapt SSL models to new domains while preventing catastrophic forgetting; quick check: ensure adapter training doesn't degrade SSL model performance
- **Zero-shot TTS synthesis**: Essential for generating speech from unseen speakers; quick check: verify system can handle speakers not in training data
- **Speech enhancement**: Needed to reduce noise influence before processing; quick check: confirm SE front-end improves signal quality
- **Catastrophic forgetting prevention**: Critical for maintaining SSL model capabilities while adapting; quick check: monitor SSL model performance during adapter training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Speech Input -> SE Front-end -> SSL Model with Adapters -> TTS Model -> Synthesized Speech

**Critical Path:**
Reference speech → SE front-end → SSL model with adapters → TTS model → synthesized output

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Adapter-based adaptation vs. full model fine-tuning: Adapters prevent catastrophic forgetting but may have limited adaptation capacity
- SE front-end integration: Improves robustness but adds complexity and potential failure points
- Joint training of adapters and TTS: Ensures compatibility but requires careful optimization

**Failure Signatures:**
- Degraded speech quality when noise exceeds adapter training conditions
- TTS model instability when adapters are not properly tuned
- Reduced performance when SE front-end introduces artifacts

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate adapter effectiveness on clean reference speech before testing noisy conditions
2. Test SE front-end performance independently before integration
3. Conduct ablation study comparing full system with variants (adapters only, SE only, both combined)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Adapter-based adaptation may struggle with extreme noise conditions not seen during training
- SE front-end integration adds complexity and potential points of failure
- Evaluation focuses primarily on speech quality, lacking comprehensive testing across diverse acoustic environments and speaker characteristics

## Confidence
- **Adapter-based adaptation effectiveness**: High confidence based on objective and subjective evaluation results
- **SE front-end combination effectiveness**: Medium confidence, demonstrated improvements but limits not fully explored
- **Overall system robustness**: Low confidence due to limited testing across diverse real-world scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate system performance across a wider range of noise types and signal-to-noise ratios to establish robustness boundaries
2. Test approach with speakers and acoustic conditions not present in training data to assess generalization capabilities
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of adapters, SE front-end, and their combination under various noise conditions
