# Continual Learning on Graphs: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.06330
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06330
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey of continual graph learning methods categorized into replay-based, regularization-based, architecture-based, and representation-based approaches

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of continual graph learning (CGL), a learning paradigm that combines continual learning with graph learning to handle dynamic graph-structured data. CGL aims to address the catastrophic forgetting problem while improving continuous performance. The survey categorizes CGL methods into four groups: replay-based, regularization-based, architecture-based, and representation-based. Each category is analyzed in terms of overcoming catastrophic forgetting and achieving continuous performance improvement. The survey also discusses open issues and future directions for CGL, including convergence, scalability, robustness, privacy preservation, unsupervised CGL, explainability, and continual learning for large graph models.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically categorizes CGL methods into four main approaches. Replay-based methods store historical data or exemplars to mitigate forgetting during sequential learning tasks. Regularization-based approaches impose constraints on model parameters to preserve knowledge from previous tasks. Architecture-based methods dynamically adjust network structures to accommodate new information. Representation-based techniques focus on learning task-invariant or discriminative graph representations. Each category is evaluated based on its effectiveness in addressing catastrophic forgetting and enabling continuous performance improvement across evolving graph data.

## Key Results
- CGL methods are systematically categorized into four groups: replay-based, regularization-based, architecture-based, and representation-based
- Each category addresses catastrophic forgetting and continuous performance improvement in different ways
- The survey identifies future research directions including scalability, privacy preservation, and explainability for CGL

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CGL methods work by addressing the fundamental challenge of learning from dynamic graph-structured data without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The mechanisms vary by approach: replay-based methods maintain knowledge through stored samples, regularization-based methods constrain parameter updates to preserve past learning, architecture-based methods adapt network capacity for new tasks, and representation-based methods learn stable embeddings that transfer across tasks. These approaches collectively enable models to incrementally learn from evolving graph structures while maintaining performance on previously encountered data distributions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Catastrophic forgetting**: The tendency of neural networks to rapidly forget previously learned information when trained on new tasks; this is the core problem CGL addresses
- **Graph neural networks**: Neural architectures designed to operate on graph-structured data by aggregating information from neighboring nodes
- **Continual learning**: Learning paradigms that enable models to incrementally acquire knowledge without revisiting previous data
- **Graph representation learning**: Techniques for encoding graph structures into vector representations suitable for machine learning
- **Dynamic graphs**: Graph structures that evolve over time with changing nodes, edges, or attributes
- **Knowledge transfer**: The ability to apply learned knowledge from one task or domain to another

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Graph data -> GNN backbone -> Task-specific head -> Continual learning module (replay/regularization/architecture/representation) -> Prediction/output

**Critical Path**: Graph data ingestion → Graph neural network processing → Continual learning constraint application → Task-specific prediction → Performance evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Memory efficiency vs. performance retention, computational overhead vs. forgetting prevention, task-specific vs. task-agnostic representations, online vs. offline processing capabilities

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation on previous tasks when learning new ones, increased computational complexity with task accumulation, memory constraints limiting replay buffer size, representation drift causing loss of discriminative power

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare replay-based CGL with naive fine-tuning on a dynamic social network dataset with node attribute changes
2. Evaluate regularization-based CGL against replay-based methods on molecular graph property prediction with evolving structures
3. Test architecture-based CGL on knowledge graph completion with incrementally added facts and relationships

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open research directions for CGL including convergence guarantees for CGL algorithms, scalability to large dynamic graphs, robustness to noisy graph data, privacy preservation in graph learning, unsupervised CGL scenarios, explainability of CGL decisions, and continual learning for large graph models.

## Limitations
- The four-category classification may not capture all emerging hybrid approaches that combine multiple strategies
- Effectiveness across diverse graph types remains largely theoretical without extensive empirical validation
- Focus primarily on supervised CGL scenarios potentially overlooks important unsupervised and semi-supervised variants

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The fundamental definition of CGL and its distinction from traditional graph learning and continual learning paradigms
- **Medium Confidence**: The four-category classification system and its associated methodology descriptions
- **Low Confidence**: The practical effectiveness of CGL methods across different graph domains and real-world applications

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic experiments comparing all four CGL categories across multiple graph types (social, molecular, knowledge graphs) using standardized benchmarks
2. Evaluate the scalability of representative CGL methods on large-scale dynamic graphs with millions of nodes and evolving structures
3. Investigate the privacy preservation claims by testing CGL methods under differential privacy constraints and measuring performance trade-offs
