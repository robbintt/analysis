# A Preliminary Analysis of Automatic Word and Syllable Prominence Detection in Non-Native Speech With Text-to-Speech Prosody Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.08283
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08283
- Reference count: 29
- FastSpeech2 prosody embeddings (duration, energy, pitch) achieve up to 16.2% relative improvement in word prominence detection over Wav2Vec-2.0 features for non-native speech.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the use of FastSpeech2 prosody embeddings for automatic word and syllable prominence detection in both native and non-native English speech. The embeddings are extracted from the variance adaptor module, which captures duration, pitch, and energy at the phoneme level. Two training conditions are compared: "text-only" (inference mode) and "speech plus text" (training mode using actual speech). Results show that energy embeddings perform best, especially for native speech, and that "speech plus text" consistently outperforms "text-only." German speakers achieve higher accuracy than Italians, likely due to closer phonological similarity to English.

## Method Summary
The study uses FastSpeech2 pre-trained on LJSpeech to extract prosody embeddings (duration, pitch, energy) from the variance adaptor. These embeddings are obtained under two conditions: "text-only" (model in inference mode) and "speech plus text" (model trained with actual speech). The embeddings are averaged at the word and syllable levels and evaluated for prominence detection on Tatoeba (native) and ISLE (German/Italian non-native) corpora. Performance is compared with heuristics-based features and Wav2Vec-2.0 representations using K-Means clustering and DNN classification.

## Key Results
- Energy embeddings provide the best discrimination between stressed and unstressed elements, especially in native speech.
- "Speech plus text" training yields up to 13.7% relative improvement in word-level and 6.9% in syllable-level prominence detection over baselines.
- German non-native speakers achieve higher prominence detection accuracy than Italians, likely due to closer phonological similarity to English.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- FastSpeech2's variance adaptor extracts phoneme-level embeddings capturing duration, pitch, and energy tied to prominence. During training, it learns a mapping from speech features to text, producing embeddings that encode prosodic variation.
- Core assumption: The variance adaptor's learned embeddings directly represent prominence-relevant acoustic correlates rather than only linguistic content.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "prosody embeddings...could generate word- and syllable-level prominence in the synthesized speech as natural as in native speech"; [section] "The variance adaptor...extract embeddings, which correspond to the following three acoustic components associated with the prosody: duration, energy and pitch."
- Break condition: If the variance adaptor collapses prosody into a flat latent space, prominence cues may be lost.

### Mechanism 2
- Including actual speech during training ("speech plus text") yields embeddings that better discriminate stressed vs unstressed elements. Real speech provides direct prosodic targets, allowing the model to capture natural prominence patterns.
- Core assumption: Non-native speech contains systematic prosodic differences that are learnable from parallel speech-text data.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The highest relative improvement...with the TTS embeddings are found to be 13.7% & 5.9%...compared to those with the heuristic-based features and self-supervised Wav2Vec-2.0 representations"; [section] "The study reveals that the embeddings obtained under 'speech plus text' case show better discrimination than those obtained under 'text-only' case in native and non-native speech."
- Break condition: If the corpus contains minimal prosodic variation or non-native speech deviates too far from native prosody, improvements may vanish.

### Mechanism 3
- Energy embeddings provide stronger separation between stressed and unstressed elements than duration or pitch. Energy correlates most directly with prominence perception; the variance adaptor's energy embeddings capture this cue more robustly.
- Core assumption: Energy is the most reliable acoustic correlate of prominence across native and non-native speech.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "energy embeddings perform best, especially in native speech"; [section] "The observations from the figure indicate that there is less overlap between stressed (purple dots) and unstressed (yellow dots) elements in energy embeddings as compared to duration and pitch embeddings."
- Break condition: If other acoustic features (e.g., formant dynamics) dominate prominence perception in a given language, energy may be less discriminative.

## Foundational Learning

- **Text-to-speech prosody modeling**: Understanding how FastSpeech2's variance adaptor extracts prosodic embeddings is essential to interpreting results.
  - Quick check: What three acoustic components does the variance adaptor learn, and how are they extracted during training vs inference?

- **Prosodic correlates of prominence**: Energy, duration, and pitch are the acoustic cues used; knowing their role clarifies why embeddings might discriminate stress.
  - Quick check: Which of duration, energy, or pitch is most consistently linked to prominence across languages?

- **Native vs non-native phonological proximity**: German speakers outperform Italians because English and German are both Germanic languages; this informs model generalization.
  - Quick check: Why might phonological similarity between L1 and L2 improve TTS-based prominence detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Text → phoneme sequence → Variance adaptor → embeddings (duration, pitch, energy) → word/syllable averaging → classification/clustering
- **Critical path**: 1. Text → phoneme sequence (lexicon lookup) 2. Variance adaptor → embeddings (duration, pitch, energy) 3. Embeddings → word/syllable averaging 4. Embeddings → classification / clustering
- **Design tradeoffs**: "Speech plus text" gives richer embeddings but requires parallel data; "text-only" is cheaper but less discriminative. Using a native English lexicon for non-native speech risks pronunciation errors; manual lexicon adaptation mitigates this.
- **Failure signatures**: Flat embeddings with low variance → loss of prominence cues; high overlap in PCA → embeddings not discriminative; epoch-wise accuracy plateaus early → embeddings saturated
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Compare PCA scatterplots of "speech plus text" vs "text-only" embeddings for a small native subset. 2. Measure cosine distance between stressed/unstressed groups for each embedding type. 3. Train a simple K-Means clusterer on energy embeddings and record accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the performance of TTS prosody embeddings compare to human expert annotations in native vs. non-native speech?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The study focuses on automatic detection using TTS embeddings but does not validate against human expert annotations, especially for non-native speech.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper uses manually annotated word-level prominence but does not compare the embeddings' detection accuracy to human expert judgments.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A study comparing TTS embedding-based prominence detection accuracy with human expert annotations for both native and non-native speech.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can TTS prosody embeddings be fine-tuned for languages with phonological structures significantly different from English?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper notes that German speakers perform better than Italian speakers, likely due to phonological similarity to English, suggesting challenges for more distant languages.
- **Why unresolved**: The study only examines German and Italian, leaving open how embeddings would perform for languages with very different phonological structures.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Testing TTS embeddings on languages with phonological structures significantly different from English (e.g., Mandarin, Arabic) and comparing performance.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How do TTS prosody embeddings perform in real-time computer-assisted language learning applications?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The study emphasizes the importance of prominence detection for computer-assisted language learning but does not evaluate real-time application performance.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper focuses on accuracy metrics but does not address latency, computational efficiency, or practical usability in real-time applications.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Implementing and testing TTS embedding-based prominence detection in a real-time CALL system, measuring latency and user feedback.

## Limitations
- Results are limited to English, German, and Italian; generalization to languages with very different phonological structures is untested.
- Reliance on manually modified lexicons for non-native speech may introduce annotation bias and not fully capture authentic non-native pronunciation.
- The study does not evaluate real-time performance or practical usability in computer-assisted language learning applications.

## Confidence

- **Energy embeddings best discriminate prominence**: High
- **"Speech plus text" outperforms "text-only"**: Medium
- **Overall effectiveness for non-native speech**: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the same framework on a non-Germanic L2 language (e.g., Spanish or Mandarin) to assess cross-linguistic robustness.
2. Conduct ablation studies by training FastSpeech2 on limited parallel data to determine the minimum required for "speech plus text" benefits.
3. Evaluate embeddings on a different TTS architecture (e.g., Tacotron2) to confirm that results are not model-specific.
