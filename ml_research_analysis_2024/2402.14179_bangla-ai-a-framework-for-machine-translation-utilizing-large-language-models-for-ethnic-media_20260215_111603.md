## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.14179
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14179
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Proposes a framework integrating LLMs and MMT for ethnic media journalism, specifically targeting the Bangladeshi community in the US to enhance news accessibility and combat misinformation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Bangla AI, a framework designed to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multilingual Machine Translation (MMT) for ethnic media journalism, with a focus on the Bangladeshi community in the US. The framework addresses the language barrier and information access challenges faced by ethnic media journalists and audiences by collecting and processing news data using NLP techniques, classifying articles into relevant categories, and translating selected news from English to Bangla using advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5/4 or BERT. The goal is to enhance news accessibility, accuracy, and cultural relevance for marginalized communities while combating misinformation and fake news.

## Method Summary
The Bangla AI framework involves three main steps: (1) Data Collection using NLP techniques to extract relevant information from news articles, (2) Classification of news articles into categories using a trained classifier, and (3) Translation of selected news from English to Bangla using advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5/4 or BERT. The framework aims to improve news accessibility for ethnic media audiences by bridging the language gap between mainstream English media and Bangla-speaking communities. It also addresses the issue of misinformation by sourcing data from authentic news outlets and applying NLP techniques to ensure reliable and trustworthy content.

## Key Results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The proposed framework improves translation accuracy by leveraging large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5/4 for contextual translation from English to Bangla.
- Mechanism: LLMs can understand and generate text in multiple languages, providing more accurate and contextually relevant translations compared to traditional translation tools.
- Core assumption: LLMs have sufficient training data and capabilities to handle the nuances and context of news translation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Translating selected news from English to Bangla using advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5/4 or BERT."
  - [section] "Emerging large language models (LLM) exhibit the potential to overcome these limitations and, in the future, could provide better translation capabilities and generate content in diverse languages through machine learning and machine translation."
- Break condition: If the LLM lacks sufficient training data for Bangla or struggles with domain-specific news terminology.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework enhances news accessibility for ethnic media audiences by bridging the language gap between mainstream English media and Bangla-speaking communities.
- Mechanism: By translating news from English to Bangla, the framework ensures that important information is accessible to non-English speaking audiences.
- Core assumption: There is a significant demand for news in Bangla among the Bangladeshi community in the US.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The framework aims to enhance news accessibility, accuracy, and cultural relevance for marginalized communities."
  - [section] "This research paper proposed an algorithm for the uses of the Large Language model (LLM) and multi-lingual machine translations (MMT) in language translation and news searching for ethnic media journalists in the USA, with a specific focus on the Bangladeshi ethnic media in New York City."
- Break condition: If the translated news fails to resonate with the target audience due to cultural differences or if the audience's language preferences change.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework combats misinformation by using curated datasets from authentic news sources.
- Mechanism: By sourcing data from reputable news outlets and applying NLP techniques, the framework ensures that the translated content is reliable and trustworthy.
- Core assumption: Authentic news sources are less likely to spread misinformation, and NLP can effectively filter and classify news articles.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The framework aims to enhance news accessibility, accuracy, and cultural relevance for marginalized communities, while also combating misinformation and fake news."
  - [section] "Google search engine and other social media platforms are leaders in spreading false news, misinformation, and disinformation. Additionally, implementing these gatekeeping measures will aid in mitigating the dissemination of misinformation and disinformation originating from this dataset."
- Break condition: If authentic sources become compromised or if NLP techniques fail to accurately classify or filter news content.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Why needed here: NLP techniques are used to extract and process information from news articles, enabling the classification and translation of content.
  - Quick check question: What are the primary tasks involved in NLP when processing news articles for classification and translation?

- Concept: Machine Learning (ML) Classification
  - Why needed here: Classification algorithms are employed to categorize news articles into relevant topics, which is essential for organizing and selecting content for translation.
  - Quick check question: How do classification algorithms determine the category of a news article based on its content?

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - Why needed here: LLMs like GPT-3.5/4 are utilized for their advanced translation capabilities, providing more accurate and contextually relevant translations than traditional methods.
  - Quick check question: What makes LLMs particularly effective for translating complex and context-rich content compared to standard translation tools?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Collection -> Data Processing -> Classification -> Translation -> Output

- Critical path:
  1. Collect news data using NLP techniques.
  2. Process and represent data in a structured format.
  3. Train and apply classification algorithms.
  4. Translate selected news articles using LLMs.
  5. Distribute translated content to the audience.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. Speed: LLMs provide high accuracy but may be slower than traditional methods.
  - Complexity vs. Usability: Advanced NLP and ML techniques increase complexity but improve functionality.
  - Data Privacy: Using authentic sources ensures quality but may limit data availability.

- Failure signatures:
  - Inaccurate translations due to insufficient LLM training data.
  - Misclassification of news articles leading to irrelevant translations.
  - Delays in data processing affecting timely news delivery.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test LLM translation accuracy on a sample of English to Bangla news articles.
  2. Evaluate classification algorithm performance on a subset of news data.
  3. Assess the impact of translated content on audience engagement and accessibility.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
