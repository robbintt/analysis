# ZeFaV: Boosting Large Language Models for Zero-shot Fact Verification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.11247
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11247
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Achieved F1-scores up to 86.74% on FEVEROUS-S dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
ZeFaV is a zero-shot fact verification framework that enhances large language models by leveraging in-context learning for relation extraction and evidence re-organization (InfoRE). The framework extracts entity relations from claims, refines evidence relations, and restructures evidence into hierarchical forms to improve model comprehension. Evaluated on HoVer and FEVEROUS-S datasets using Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct, ZeFaV achieved F1-scores of up to 86.74% on FEVEROUS-S, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like ProgramFC, QACheck, and InfoRE.

## Method Summary
ZeFaV uses in-context learning to perform relation extraction from claims and evidence, then applies InfoRE to reorganize evidence into hierarchical structures. The framework combines extracted relations with restructured evidence and the original claim to create comprehensive prompts for zero-shot fact verification using Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct. The approach involves fine-tuning on FewRel for relation extraction, applying closure algorithms to refine evidence relations, and restructuring evidence to improve LLM comprehension without requiring model fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Achieved F1-score of 86.74% on FEVEROUS-S dataset
- Outperformed state-of-the-art methods including ProgramFC, QACheck, and InfoRE
- Demonstrated effectiveness of relation-guided reasoning and structured evidence in zero-shot fact verification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ZeFaV improves LLM fact verification by using relation extraction to guide reasoning.
- Mechanism: The framework extracts entity relations from claims and evidence, then uses these structured relations as prompts to guide the LLM's reasoning process.
- Core assumption: Structured relational information reduces cognitive load and helps LLMs focus on relevant evidence connections rather than processing raw text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ZeFaV is a zero-shot fact verification framework that enhances large language models by leveraging in-context learning for relation extraction and evidence re-organization"
  - [section] "Few-shot Relation extraction identifies entities in the claim and evidence and their relationships, using these relations to guide LLMs in understanding and verifying the claim"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting relation extraction specifically
- Break condition: If relation extraction fails to capture meaningful connections between entities, or if the LLM cannot effectively use the structured relations for reasoning.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: InfoRE restructures evidence into hierarchical forms to improve model comprehension.
- Mechanism: The framework reorganizes raw evidence text into hierarchical structures that represent parallel and causal relationships, making the evidence more digestible for the LLM.
- Core assumption: Hierarchical organization of information mirrors human cognitive processing and makes complex evidence relationships more transparent to the model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "refines evidence relations, and restructures evidence into hierarchical forms to improve model comprehension"
  - [section] "InfoRE reconstructs the evidence provided with the claim to help LLMs better comprehend it"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting hierarchical restructuring effectiveness
- Break condition: If the hierarchical restructuring becomes too complex or loses critical information in the process of reorganization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining extracted relations with re-organized evidence creates optimal prompting context.
- Mechanism: The framework merges the structured relation information with the hierarchically organized evidence to create a comprehensive prompting context that guides the LLM's verification decision.
- Core assumption: The combination of structured relations and organized evidence provides multiple complementary signals that enhance the LLM's understanding beyond either component alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "combine the above information with the original evidence to generate the context from which our fact-checking model provide verdicts"
  - [section] "we combined the extracted relations, the reorganized context, and the claim as the prompt below to perform zero-shot Fact verification"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting the combination approach specifically
- Break condition: If the combined prompt becomes too long or complex, causing the LLM to lose focus on the core verification task.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: In-context learning
  - Why needed here: ZeFaV relies on LLMs' ability to learn from examples within prompts rather than fine-tuning, making relation extraction and evidence reorganization possible without model retraining.
  - Quick check question: How does in-context learning differ from traditional fine-tuning approaches in terms of data requirements and model adaptation?

- Concept: Relation extraction
  - Why needed here: The framework needs to identify and classify relationships between entities in claims and evidence to provide structured guidance for the LLM's reasoning process.
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in performing relation extraction on claims that contain implicit or indirect entity relationships?

- Concept: Hierarchical information organization
  - Why needed here: InfoRE transforms flat evidence text into structured hierarchies that better represent knowledge relationships and improve LLM comprehension.
  - Quick check question: How does hierarchical organization of information affect a model's ability to identify causal versus parallel relationships in evidence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Relation Extraction Module -> Evidence Restructuring Module -> Prompt Construction Module -> LLM Interface
- Critical path: Claim → Relation Extraction → Evidence Restructuring → Prompt Construction → LLM → Verification Output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Zero-shot approach eliminates need for training data but may limit performance compared to fine-tuned models
  - Hierarchical restructuring improves comprehension but adds processing overhead and potential information loss
  - Combining multiple information sources creates rich context but risks overwhelming the LLM with too much information
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor relation extraction results in irrelevant or missing relationships in prompts
  - Over-aggressive evidence restructuring loses critical information needed for verification
  - Excessive prompt length causes truncation or context window issues
  - Inconsistent verification outputs suggest the LLM is not effectively using the provided structure
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test relation extraction accuracy on sample claims from HoVer dataset using the FewRel-based prompt
  2. Validate InfoRE restructuring by comparing human comprehension of original vs. restructured evidence samples
  3. Measure prompt effectiveness by running controlled tests with and without relation/InfoRE components on small claim subsets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does ZeFaV's performance scale with different LLM sizes and architectures beyond Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper only evaluates ZeFaV on Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct and compares it with InfoRE using llama2-70B architecture.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't explore performance across various LLM sizes or architectures, which would help understand the framework's generalizability and computational trade-offs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of ZeFaV across multiple LLM architectures (GPT, Claude, open-source models) and parameter sizes (7B, 13B, 70B), comparing F1-scores and computational costs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between relation extraction and InfoRE for different types of claims and evidence structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The ablation study shows that both InfoRE and relation extraction improve performance, but the paper doesn't determine when one approach is preferable over the other or how to optimally combine them.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows both components are beneficial but doesn't provide guidance on when to emphasize one over the other based on claim complexity, evidence structure, or computational constraints.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies varying the weight or presence of relation extraction vs. InfoRE across different claim types (multi-hop, numerical, entity disambiguation) to establish optimal configurations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does ZeFaV handle out-of-distribution claims and evidence that don't follow typical patterns seen in HoVer and FEVEROUS-S datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only evaluates on two specific datasets and shows weaknesses in numerical reasoning (72.83% F1-score), suggesting potential limitations with non-standard claim types.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation is limited to two multi-hop datasets, and the paper doesn't test ZeFaV's robustness to different claim types, evidence formats, or real-world scenarios with noisy, incomplete, or contradictory information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing ZeFaV on diverse fact-checking datasets with varying claim structures, evidence formats (including real-time web data), and adversarial examples to measure robustness and generalization.

## Limitations
- Weak empirical validation of individual components through limited ablation testing
- Dataset-specific performance that may not generalize to other fact verification scenarios
- Unknown implementation details for critical components like InfoRE restructuring

## Confidence
- High confidence: Overall framework architecture and evaluation methodology
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of relation extraction for fact verification
- Low confidence: InfoRE restructuring contribution to model comprehension

## Next Checks
1. Run ablation study removing relation extraction and InfoRE components individually to measure their isolated impact on verification accuracy.
2. Evaluate ZeFaV on additional fact verification datasets (e.g., LIAR-PLUS, MultiFC) to assess generalization across different claim types.
3. Independently assess relation extraction accuracy against FewRel gold standards and conduct human studies to verify InfoRE restructuring improves comprehension.
