core_contribution: This paper proposes a method to incorporate domain knowledge into
  Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) via learned priors. The key idea is to define a
  domain knowledge loss function that measures how well a model satisfies the desired
  properties, then learn a prior distribution that upweights models with low values
  of this loss.

# Bayesian Neural Networks with Domain Knowledge Priors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.13410
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13410
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Domain knowledge priors improve BNN performance across fairness, clinical rules, and physics tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method to incorporate domain knowledge into Bayesian neural networks through learned priors. The approach defines a domain knowledge loss function that measures how well models satisfy desired properties, then learns a prior distribution that upweights models with low loss values. Using variational inference, the authors learn low-rank Gaussian priors that encode domain constraints, evaluated on unlabeled data. The method demonstrates improved performance across multiple domains including fairness, clinical rules, and physics constraints.

## Method Summary
The method learns domain knowledge priors by defining a loss function that measures how well a model satisfies desired properties. This loss is evaluated on unlabeled data, and variational inference is used to learn a low-rank Gaussian prior that upweights models with low loss values. The approach also includes techniques for transferring learned priors across different model architectures, allowing the domain knowledge to be preserved when scaling or modifying network structures.

## Key Results
- Domain knowledge priors improve BNN performance on fairness, clinical rules, and physics tasks compared to standard uninformative priors
- Learned priors assign higher probability to models that better satisfy domain knowledge constraints
- The transfer learning approach enables prior knowledge to be preserved across different model architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by explicitly encoding domain constraints into the prior distribution over network parameters. By learning priors that upweight models satisfying domain knowledge, the Bayesian framework naturally incorporates these constraints during inference. The variational inference approach efficiently approximates the posterior while respecting the learned prior, and the low-rank Gaussian assumption provides a tractable way to represent complex domain constraints.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian inference** - Needed to understand how priors influence posterior distributions; check by verifying understanding of Bayes' rule and posterior computation
- **Variational inference** - Required for approximating intractable posteriors; check by confirming ability to derive ELBO and understand mean-field approximation
- **Gaussian distributions** - Essential for understanding the low-rank Gaussian prior structure; check by validating familiarity with multivariate Gaussian properties
- **Domain knowledge specification** - Critical for formulating appropriate loss functions; check by ability to translate domain constraints into mathematical expressions
- **Transfer learning** - Important for understanding prior transfer across architectures; check by confirming knowledge of parameter sharing and initialization strategies

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Domain knowledge loss -> Variational inference -> Low-rank Gaussian prior -> BNN inference -> Model evaluation

**Critical Path:** Domain knowledge loss definition → Prior learning via variational inference → BNN training with learned prior → Performance evaluation on task-specific metrics

**Design Tradeoffs:** Low-rank Gaussian approximation provides computational efficiency but may not capture all domain constraint structures; unlabeled data requirement may limit applicability in data-scarce domains

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance on domain constraints, instability in variational inference optimization, failure to transfer priors across architectures

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate learned priors improve performance on simple synthetic domain constraints
2. Test sensitivity of learned priors to quantity and quality of unlabeled data
3. Evaluate prior transfer capability across architectures with controlled architectural differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Reliance on unlabeled data may limit performance when such data is limited or unrepresentative
- Low-rank Gaussian assumption may not capture complex, non-Gaussian domain constraint structures
- Transfer learning across architectures remains largely empirical without theoretical guarantees

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core methodology of learning priors via domain knowledge loss functions is well-founded and empirically validated
- **Medium confidence**: Transfer learning approach for priors across architectures shows promise but needs more extensive validation
- **Medium confidence**: Variational inference implementation appears sound, though computational efficiency could vary with problem scale

## Next Checks
1. Test learned priors' sensitivity to quantity and quality of unlabeled data across different domain knowledge types
2. Evaluate whether low-rank Gaussian approximation adequately captures complex domain constraints by comparing against higher-rank alternatives
3. Systematically assess transfer learning capability across increasingly dissimilar network architectures to establish bounds on effectiveness
