# Tackling Electrode Shift In Gesture Recognition with HD-EMG Electrode Subsets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.02773
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02773
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Training on HD-EMG electrode subsets (8 channels each) improves intersession gesture recognition robustness by 6.9% over central subset and 20.7% over using all channels without dimensionality reduction.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses electrode shift in high-density electromyography (HD-EMG) gesture recognition, which causes significant performance drops across sessions. The authors propose a method that trains models on subsets of 8 HD-EMG channels at different proximal-distal positions, effectively augmenting the training distribution to cover spatial variations. This approach simultaneously mitigates electrode shift effects and reduces input dimensionality. Results show significantly higher intersession performance across subjects and classification algorithms compared to traditional approaches.

## Method Summary
The method involves sampling electrode subsets from HD-EMG data (128 bipolar channels from Capgmyo system), where each subset contains 8 channels evenly spaced along the forearm circumference. Models are trained on all valid subsets to simulate electrode shift and improve robustness. A Temporal VGGNet (TVGGNet) architecture is used with standard preprocessing (band-stop filter at 45-55Hz, standardization). The approach is evaluated across intrasession and intersession scenarios, comparing performance with central subset only, all channels, and with/without PCA dimensionality reduction.

## Key Results
- Training on all electrode subsets resulted in 6.9% higher intersession accuracy compared to using only the central subset
- The subset approach achieved 20.7% improvement over using all 128 channels without dimensionality reduction
- Model performance was consistent across four feature sets (TD, ETD, NinaPro, SampEn) and classification algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Training on multiple electrode subsets augments the training distribution to cover spatial variations caused by electrode shift.
- Mechanism: By sampling different subsets of HD-EMG channels, the model learns to map shifted electrode configurations to the same gesture class, effectively learning spatial invariance.
- Core assumption: The EMG signal patterns for a gesture remain classifiable even when electrodes are shifted, provided enough spatial context is preserved in the subsets.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "augmenting our training distribution with data from different electrode locations" [section 2.2] "By treating electrode shift as a transformation T {.} to the inputs, our method can be interpreted as a data augmentation technique"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reducing input dimensionality to 8 channels per subset while training on all subsets prevents overfitting and improves generalization.
- Mechanism: Instead of using all 128 channels (leading to high dimensionality and overfitting), the model trains on smaller, fixed-size inputs. The dataset augmentation across subsets compensates for the reduced per-sample information.
- Core assumption: A subset of 8 bipolar channels contains sufficient discriminative information for gesture classification when combined across multiple electrode placements.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "simultaneously targeting electrode shift and reducing input dimensionality" [section 2.2] "Given 128 bipolar channels, an electrode subset comprised eight channels (Ch = 8) evenly spaced along the circumference of the forearm"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The proposed method achieves better intersession performance by mitigating the effects of electrode shift without requiring complex domain adaptation.
- Mechanism: Instead of retraining or adapting models per session, the method embeds electrode shift robustness directly into the training process via subset augmentation, so the model naturally generalizes across sessions with shifted electrodes.
- Core assumption: Electrode shift is the dominant source of intersession performance drop compared to other factors like limb position or force variation.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "This method increases robustness against electrode shift and results in significantly higher intersession performance" [section 3.2] "training on all valid channel subsets results in significantly greater generalization"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Electrode shift in sEMG
  - Why needed here: Understanding that electrode displacement causes significant drops in gesture recognition accuracy is key to appreciating the motivation and impact of the proposed method.
  - Quick check question: What is the approximate accuracy drop caused by a 1-cm electrode shift in simple gesture tasks?
    - Answer: About 25% (as mentioned in the paper).

- Concept: HD-sEMG vs. traditional sEMG
  - Why needed here: HD-sEMG provides higher spatial resolution and more channels, which enables the subset sampling strategy. Understanding this difference is crucial for grasping why the method is effective.
  - Quick check question: How many channels does the Capgmyo HD-sEMG system provide, and how many are used per subset in this study?
    - Answer: 128 total channels; 8 per subset.

- Concept: Data augmentation via spatial transformations
  - Why needed here: The core idea is to treat electrode shift as a spatial transformation and augment the training data accordingly. This concept is borrowed from computer vision and adapted here for EMG.
  - Quick check question: In the context of this paper, what does "data augmentation" mean?
    - Answer: Including training data from multiple electrode subsets (different spatial positions) to simulate electrode shift and improve robustness.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: HD-EMG data -> Band-stop filter (45-55Hz) -> Standardization -> Electrode subset sampling (8 channels) -> TVGGNet -> Gesture class probabilities

- Critical path:
  1. Load and preprocess HD-sEMG data (filtering, normalization)
  2. Sample electrode subsets (8 channels each, different positions)
  3. Train TVGGNet on all subsets (data augmentation)
  4. Test on central subset (or across sessions)
  5. Compare performance with baseline (central-only or all-channels) and with/without PCA

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using 8 channels reduces dimensionality and computational cost but may lose some spatial information
  - Training on all subsets increases data diversity but requires careful handling of subset sampling
  - TVGGNet is simple and interpretable but may not capture all temporal dynamics compared to more complex models

- Failure signatures:
  - Large drop in performance when testing on a subset not seen during training
  - Overfitting indicated by high training accuracy but low test accuracy
  - Poor intersession generalization if electrode shift is not the dominant factor

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the intrasession experiment: Train/test on central subset vs. all subsets vs. electrode-shifted test sets; compare accuracy drops.
  2. Replicate the intersession experiment: Train on session 1, test on session 2; compare (A VS), (CS), and (AC) conditions with and without PCA.
  3. Ablation study: Train on subsets but only from one direction (e.g., only proximal shifts); compare performance to full augmentation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would training on larger HD-sEMG datasets with more expressive networks improve generalization across electrode shifts beyond proximal-distal displacements?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "future studies should use larger HD-sEMG datasets to train larger, more expressive networks to evaluate the generalization across these shifts."
- Why unresolved: This study only considered proximal-distal shifts, and the authors acknowledge that clockwise/anticlockwise shifts typically result in larger performance drops. The limited dataset size and network complexity may have constrained the evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the proposed method on larger HD-sEMG datasets with networks that can capture more complex patterns and evaluating performance across all types of electrode shifts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed method be effectively applied to inter-subject and cross-session scenarios where additional confounding factors such as gesture technique, limb position, and contraction level vary?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "the high variability in intersession performance improvement across subjects" suggests other factors may be the largest contributors to performance degradation, "occluding the true robustness benefits of the proposed method."
- Why unresolved: The study focused on intersession performance but did not thoroughly investigate how the method performs when multiple confounding factors vary simultaneously across subjects and sessions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the method across diverse subjects with varying gesture techniques, limb positions, and contraction levels to determine its effectiveness in more complex real-world scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the proposed method compatible with domain adaptation techniques to enable transfer of learned models across different HD-sEMG acquisition systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that "beyond robustness and computational complexity benefits, the input dimensionality chosen will enable future research on domain adaptation across acquisition systems with publicly available datasets."
- Why unresolved: While the authors propose this as a future direction, they did not investigate whether the method can be integrated with domain adaptation techniques to transfer models across different HD-sEMG systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the method's performance when applied to data from different HD-sEMG acquisition systems and evaluating the effectiveness of combining it with domain adaptation techniques for model transfer.

## Limitations
- The method only considers proximal-distal electrode shifts, not lateral or rotational displacements
- Small sample size for intersession experiments (9 subjects with two sessions each)
- The choice of 8 channels per subset is empirically motivated but not validated through systematic ablation studies
- Other factors like limb position and force variation may contribute to intersession performance drops but are not controlled for

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Training on multiple electrode subsets improves intersession performance compared to using only the central subset (6.9% improvement)
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism by which subset training mitigates electrode shift (data augmentation via spatial transformations) is plausible but not directly validated
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that electrode shift is the dominant source of intersession performance drop is inferred but not explicitly tested

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on Subset Size**: Systematically vary the number of channels per subset (e.g., 4, 8, 12) and evaluate the impact on intersession performance to confirm that 8 is optimal.

2. **Cross-Subject Generalization**: Train a model on subsets from a subset of subjects and test on held-out subjects to assess whether the method generalizes across different users.

3. **Lateral Shift Robustness**: Extend the electrode subset sampling to include lateral shifts (in addition to proximal-distal) and evaluate whether the method remains effective for these transformations.
