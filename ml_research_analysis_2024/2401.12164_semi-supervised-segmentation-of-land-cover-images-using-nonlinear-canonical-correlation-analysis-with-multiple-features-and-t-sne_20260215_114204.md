# Semi-supervised segmentation of land cover images using nonlinear canonical correlation analysis with multiple features and t-SNE

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2401.12164
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12164
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Semi-supervised land cover segmentation using RBF-CCA with multi-feature fusion achieves 87.3% accuracy and IOU 0.87-0.96

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a semi-supervised approach for segmenting remotely sensed land cover images using nonlinear canonical correlation analysis (CCA) with multiple feature types. The method constructs high-dimensional feature vectors by combining local patches and texture features (LBP, GLCM) from multi-band images, embeds them into 3D using t-SNE, and applies a modified RBF-CCA model with labeled pixels to generate canonical variables that are then clustered using k-means. The approach demonstrates superior performance compared to linear and polynomial CCA variants, achieving high segmentation accuracy and mean IOU across land cover classes on multiple remote sensing datasets.

## Method Summary
The proposed method begins by extracting multi-band image patches and texture features (LBP and GLCM) to form a high-dimensional feature vector for each pixel. These features are embedded into a 3D space using t-SNE, creating a compact representation suitable for canonical correlation analysis. A small set of labeled pixels is used to train a radial basis function CCA (RBF-CCA) model, where the canonical variables are learned as functions of the input features and class labels. The learned canonical variables for all pixels are then clustered using k-means to produce the final land cover segmentation. This semi-supervised framework leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve segmentation accuracy compared to fully supervised or unsupervised approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 87.3% segmentation accuracy across multiple land cover classes
- Obtained high mean IOU values ranging from 0.87 to 0.96
- Outperformed linear and polynomial CCA variants, as well as k-means baseline methods
- Demonstrated effectiveness with minimal labeled samples (5-10 per class)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by effectively combining spatial, spectral, and textural information through multi-feature fusion, which captures complementary characteristics of land cover types. The t-SNE embedding reduces dimensionality while preserving local structure, making the data more amenable to CCA analysis. The RBF-CCA learns nonlinear relationships between features and class labels, enabling better separation of complex land cover patterns compared to linear methods. The semi-supervised approach leverages a small amount of labeled data to guide the clustering of the remaining unlabeled pixels, reducing the reliance on extensive manual annotation while maintaining high accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

**Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)** - A statistical method for finding linear combinations of variables from two datasets that are maximally correlated. *Why needed:* To discover relationships between multi-feature representations and land cover classes. *Quick check:* Verify that canonical correlations are significant and meaningful for the dataset.

**Radial Basis Function Networks** - Neural networks using radial basis functions as activation functions, capable of modeling nonlinear relationships. *Why needed:* To extend CCA to nonlinear feature-label mappings. *Quick check:* Ensure RBF centers and widths are properly tuned for the data distribution.

**t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)** - A nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that preserves local structure in high-dimensional data. *Why needed:* To embed high-dimensional features into a lower-dimensional space suitable for CCA. *Quick check:* Validate that t-SNE preserves class separability in the embedded space.

**Local Binary Patterns (LBP)** - A texture descriptor that encodes local spatial patterns by comparing pixel intensities. *Why needed:* To capture fine-scale texture information for land cover discrimination. *Quick check:* Confirm LBP histograms effectively differentiate between land cover textures.

**Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)** - A statistical method for examining texture by calculating how often pairs of pixels with specific values occur in an image. *Why needed:* To quantify spatial relationships and texture properties in land cover images. *Quick check:* Verify GLCM features capture relevant texture patterns for each land cover class.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Image patches, LBP, GLCM -> Feature Concatenation -> t-SNE Embedding -> RBF-CCA Training (labeled subset) -> Canonical Variables -> K-means Clustering -> Segmentation Map

**Critical Path:** Multi-feature extraction -> t-SNE embedding -> RBF-CCA training with labeled samples -> Canonical variable generation -> K-means clustering

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational complexity (high-dimensional feature extraction, t-SNE, RBF-CCA) for improved accuracy with minimal labeled data. The choice of t-SNE for dimensionality reduction prioritizes local structure preservation over global relationships, which may affect class separation in some cases.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor segmentation quality may arise from insufficient labeled samples, inappropriate t-SNE perplexity settings, or RBF-CCA parameters that fail to capture the true feature-label relationships. Overfitting to specific datasets is also a potential failure mode.

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate segmentation performance with varying numbers of labeled samples per class (5-50) to assess semi-supervised benefits
2. Compare t-SNE embedding with alternative dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, UMAP) for feature representation
3. Perform ablation studies by removing individual feature types (patches, LBP, GLCM) to quantify their contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to only two remote sensing datasets, potentially limiting generalizability
- Small number of labeled samples (5-10 per class) may not represent true land cover variability
- Performance metrics may be inflated due to dataset-specific characteristics and preprocessing choices
- Limited comparative analysis against only three CCA variants provides narrow context for claimed superiority

## Confidence
- **Segmentation accuracy (87.3%):** Medium - dependent on specific datasets and preprocessing
- **Mean IOU (0.87-0.96):** Medium - metrics sensitive to dataset characteristics
- **Superiority over baselines:** Medium - limited comparison scope with only three CCA variants
- **Generalizability:** Low - validation on only two datasets with specific sensor types

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on additional diverse remote sensing datasets with varying spatial resolutions and sensor types to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the multi-feature fusion (patches, LBP, GLCM) and t-SNE embedding components
3. Evaluate performance sensitivity to labeled sample size variations (5-50 per class) to determine the practical utility of the semi-supervised approach
