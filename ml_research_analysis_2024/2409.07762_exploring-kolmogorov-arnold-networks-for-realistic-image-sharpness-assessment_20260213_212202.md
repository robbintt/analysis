# Exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for realistic image sharpness assessment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.07762
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07762
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: KANs outperform traditional SVR and MLP models for image sharpness assessment, with TaylorKAN achieving best results using mid-level features

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for realistic image sharpness assessment, comparing six KAN variants against traditional Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. The research introduces TaylorKAN, a Taylor series-based KAN variant, and evaluates all variants on four image databases using both mid-level and high-level features. Results demonstrate that KANs generally outperform baseline methods, with TaylorKAN achieving the highest performance metrics when using mid-level features. The study highlights the potential of KANs in image quality assessment while identifying computational efficiency challenges.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates six KAN variants (TaylorKAN, BSRBF-KAN, ChebyKAN, HermiteKAN, JacobiKAN, WavKAN) against SVR and MLP baselines for image sharpness assessment. Two feature sets are used: mid-level features (15 features per image) and high-level features (2048 features from ResNet50). The KANs employ learnable activation functions on edges between nodes rather than on nodes themselves, following the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem. Models are trained and tested on four image databases (BID2011, CID2013, CLIVE, KonIQ-10k) with realistic distortions. Performance is measured using PLCC and SRCC metrics after applying a five-parameter non-linear mapping for PLCC calculation.

## Key Results
- KANs outperform traditional SVR and MLP models across all four image databases
- TaylorKAN achieves the best performance with mid-level features, with PLCC values of 0.756-0.871 and SRCC values of 0.582-0.851
- KANs show improved computational efficiency compared to MLP, requiring fewer iterations to converge
- Performance on high-level features remains suboptimal compared to mid-level features across all KAN variants

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TaylorKAN achieves superior performance by combining hierarchical Taylor series approximation with deep feature learning in a multi-layer network.
- Mechanism: Taylor series allows the network to approximate the underlying function by learning coefficients, while the multi-layer structure enables hierarchical feature extraction and non-linear transformation.
- Core assumption: The quadratic Taylor approximation provides sufficient representational capacity for image sharpness assessment tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Taylor series-based KAN (TaylorKAN) is introduced and evaluated alongside other KAN variants"
  - [section] "TaylorKAN achieves the best performance when using mid-level features"
  - [corpus] "Taylor expansion-based Kolmogorov-Arnold network for blind image quality assessment" (weak evidence, only one related paper)
- Break condition: If the underlying function cannot be adequately represented by Taylor series or if the number of required terms grows too large for practical implementation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: KANs outperform traditional methods by using learnable activation functions on edges rather than nodes.
- Mechanism: The learnable edge functions allow for more flexible function approximation compared to fixed activation functions in traditional neural networks, while maintaining the mathematical foundation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem.
- Core assumption: Learnable edge activation functions provide better representational capacity than node-based activations for image quality assessment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "KAN appends learnable activation functions on edges between the nodes of successive layers"
  - [section] "Except for the activation functions as MLP on nodes, KAN appends learnable activation functions on edges"
  - [corpus] "AF-KAN: Activation Function-Based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Efficient Representation Learning" (weak evidence, only one related paper)
- Break condition: If the increased complexity of edge-based learning doesn't provide sufficient performance gains to justify the computational cost.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Different KAN variants (ChebyKAN, HermiteKAN, JacobiKAN, etc.) provide alternative mathematical bases for function approximation, allowing optimization for specific task characteristics.
- Mechanism: Each variant uses a different mathematical function (Chebyshev polynomials, Hermite polynomials, Jacobi polynomials, wavelets) as the edge activation function, providing different approximation properties and computational characteristics.
- Core assumption: The choice of mathematical basis function affects the network's ability to learn the underlying image quality assessment function.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "KAN variants are designed using different mathematical functions as the activation functions on edges"
  - [section] "ChebyKAN employs the Chebyshev polynomials for function approximation" and similar descriptions for other variants
  - [corpus] "Chebyshev polynomial-based kolmogorov-arnold networks: An efficient architecture for nonlinear function approximation" (weak evidence, only one related paper)
- Break condition: If the mathematical properties of the chosen basis function don't align well with the characteristics of the image quality assessment task.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical foundation for KANs, asserting that continuous multivariate functions can be represented as finite sums of univariate functions
  - Quick check question: Can you explain in your own words why the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem enables the design of KANs?

- Concept: Taylor Series Approximation
  - Why needed here: TaylorKAN uses Taylor series as the mathematical basis for edge activation functions, allowing hierarchical function approximation
  - Quick check question: How does the Taylor series representation differ from the basis functions used in other KAN variants?

- Concept: Image Quality Assessment Metrics
  - Why needed here: The evaluation uses PLCC (Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient) and SRCC (Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient) to measure prediction performance
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between PLCC and SRCC, and why are both metrics important for evaluating image quality assessment models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input layer: 15 mid-level features or 2048 high-level features
  - Hidden layers: 3-4 layers with learnable edge activation functions (varies by KAN variant)
  - Output layer: Single score prediction
  - Each edge contains a learnable univariate function (Taylor series, Chebyshev polynomials, etc.)

- Critical path: Feature extraction → KAN processing → Score prediction → Performance evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - KANs vs MLP: KANs offer potentially better function approximation but with increased complexity
  - Mid-level vs high-level features: Mid-level features are task-specific and computationally cheaper; high-level features are more general but require more processing
  - Different KAN variants: Each offers different mathematical properties and computational characteristics

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on high-dimensional features: May indicate over-fitting or insufficient representational capacity
  - Computational inefficiency: May indicate need for simpler KAN variant or different feature representation
  - Inconsistent results across databases: May indicate database-specific limitations or feature representation issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic KAN with simple activation functions and compare against MLP on mid-level features
  2. Test different KAN variants (TaylorKAN, ChebyKAN, etc.) on the same feature set to identify optimal mathematical basis
  3. Compare performance of mid-level vs high-level features across all KAN variants to determine optimal feature representation strategy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that KANs could be integrated into deep learning architectures by replacing MLP components, potentially enhancing representation capacity in end-to-end optimization.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific details on how to implement this integration or evaluate its effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing KAN-integrated deep learning models with traditional MLP-based models on various image quality assessment tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most informative subsets of deep features for KANs to enhance effectiveness and efficiency in score prediction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that identifying the most informative subsets of deep features is important for KANs to enhance effectiveness and efficiency in score prediction while avoiding high-dimensional feature processing challenges.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore feature selection techniques or evaluate the impact of using different subsets of deep features.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing the performance of KANs using different subsets of deep features and analysis of which features contribute most to accurate quality assessment.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can KANs be further improved to handle high-dimensional features more effectively?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the performance of KANs remains suboptimal when using high-level features and discusses the challenges of high-dimensional feature processing.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose specific solutions or modifications to KANs to address this limitation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of KAN variants or preprocessing techniques that significantly improve performance on high-dimensional feature inputs.

## Limitations
- The specific methodology for extracting mid-level features from BISA indicators is not fully detailed
- Computational efficiency claims are based on iteration counts rather than comprehensive runtime analysis
- Corpus evidence for KAN variants is limited to a single related paper per variant
- Performance on high-level features remains suboptimal compared to mid-level features

## Confidence

- High confidence: KANs outperform traditional SVR and MLP models in PLCC and SRCC metrics
- Medium confidence: TaylorKAN specifically achieves best performance with mid-level features
- Low confidence: Claims about computational efficiency and generalization across diverse image databases

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the exact mid-level feature extraction pipeline using BISA indicators to verify implementation fidelity
2. Conduct ablation studies removing individual KAN variants to quantify each variant's unique contribution
3. Test KAN performance on additional image quality databases with different distortion types to assess generalizability beyond the four studied databases
