# Incremental Joint Learning of Depth, Pose and Implicit Scene Representation on Monocular Camera in Large-scale Scenes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.06050
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06050
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Incremental joint learning framework achieves PSNR up to 29.04 on Tanks and Temples, with pose accuracy ATE 0.012 and RPE 0.046 in large-scale scenes

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an incremental joint learning framework for simultaneous depth estimation, pose estimation, and large-scale scene reconstruction from monocular camera input. The method addresses critical challenges in robotic navigation scenarios where accurate 3D understanding is essential for tasks like obstacle avoidance and path planning. By combining vision transformer-based depth estimation, feature-metric bundle adjustment for pose optimization, and incremental construction of local radiance fields, the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets including Tanks and Temples and Static Hikes.

## Method Summary
The proposed method tackles the interdependent challenges of depth estimation, pose estimation, and scene representation in large-scale environments. The framework employs a vision transformer-based network for depth estimation that captures long-range dependencies for better scale information. Pose estimation is handled through feature-metric bundle adjustment that jointly optimizes camera poses and scene geometry. For large-scale scenes, the method incrementally constructs multiple local radiance fields using tri-plane representation, allowing the system to scale beyond the memory limitations of traditional neural radiance fields while maintaining reconstruction quality.

## Key Results
- Achieves PSNR values up to 29.04 on Tanks and Temples benchmark datasets
- Demonstrates robust pose estimation with absolute trajectory error (ATE) of 0.012 and relative pose error (RPE) of 0.046
- Successfully reconstructs large-scale scenes spanning hundreds of meters using over 1000 images
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets including proprietary data from robotic wheelchair platform

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by addressing the fundamental interdependencies between depth, pose, and scene representation through joint optimization. Vision transformers capture global context in depth estimation, improving scale accuracy. Feature-metric bundle adjustment provides robustness to illumination changes and viewpoint variations that challenge photometric methods. The incremental approach to scene representation breaks down large-scale reconstruction into manageable local components, each represented as a tri-plane radiance field, enabling scalability while preserving detail.

## Foundational Learning
- Vision Transformers for depth estimation: Why needed - to capture long-range spatial dependencies for accurate scale information; Quick check - compare depth predictions with and without global attention mechanisms
- Feature-metric bundle adjustment: Why needed - to jointly optimize poses and geometry while being robust to illumination changes; Quick check - measure improvement in pose accuracy versus photometric BA under varying lighting
- Tri-plane representation for radiance fields: Why needed - to enable memory-efficient storage and querying of 3D scene information; Quick check - evaluate reconstruction quality versus NeRF with same number of parameters
- Incremental scene construction: Why needed - to handle large-scale scenes that exceed memory limits of single radiance fields; Quick check - measure reconstruction quality degradation with increasing scene size

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Images -> Depth Estimation (ViT) -> Pose Estimation (FBA) -> Local Radiance Fields (Tri-plane) -> Scene Reconstruction

**Critical Path:** Camera frames → Depth estimation → Feature extraction → Pose optimization → Scene representation → Output reconstruction

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational complexity for accuracy by using vision transformers instead of CNNs for depth estimation, enabling better global context understanding at the cost of increased parameters. The incremental approach sacrifices real-time performance for scalability to large scenes.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation in textureless regions, failure to handle dynamic objects or changing illumination conditions, and memory constraints when scaling beyond tested scene sizes.

**First Experiments:** 1) Ablation study removing vision transformer attention to quantify its contribution to depth accuracy, 2) Comparison of feature-metric versus photometric bundle adjustment under varying illumination conditions, 3) Scalability test measuring reconstruction quality versus scene size on synthetic large-scale environments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- Performance primarily validated on static scenes with limited evaluation of dynamic object handling
- Computational requirements for vision transformer and incremental representation not thoroughly analyzed for real-time robotic applications
- Limited testing across diverse environmental conditions including varying illumination and sensor noise profiles

## Confidence
- High confidence in incremental scene representation approach using tri-plane radiance fields
- Medium confidence in vision transformer-based depth estimation improvements over traditional methods
- Medium confidence in feature-metric bundle adjustment robustness across diverse real-world conditions

## Next Checks
1) Test the method on dynamic scenes with moving objects to assess robustness to non-rigid scene elements
2) Evaluate performance under varying illumination conditions and sensor noise levels to verify generalizability
3) Conduct ablation studies on the incremental learning strategy to quantify the contribution of each component to the overall performance improvement
