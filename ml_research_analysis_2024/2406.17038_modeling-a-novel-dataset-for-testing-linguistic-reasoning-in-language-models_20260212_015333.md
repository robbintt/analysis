# modeLing: A Novel Dataset for Testing Linguistic Reasoning in Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.17038
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17038
- Reference count: 14
- A benchmark of 48 Rosetta stone puzzles testing few-shot linguistic reasoning in language models using 19 extremely low-resource languages

## Executive Summary
modeLing is a novel dataset of 48 Linguistics Olympiad-style puzzles designed to evaluate few-shot linguistic reasoning in language models. The dataset covers four problem types—noun-adjective order, word order, possession, and semantics—using 19 extremely low-resource languages to mitigate training data contamination. Evaluating open-source models and GPT-4 on modeLing shows non-negligible accuracy, demonstrating emergent few-shot reasoning ability, though performance varies by problem type and language orthography.

## Method Summary
The authors created modeLing by designing 48 new puzzles across four linguistic problem types, each using 19 extremely low-resource languages selected to minimize training data contamination. They evaluated multiple large language models (Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama-3-70B, Mixtral-8x22B, Gemma-7B, Alpaca-7B, Llama-2-7B) and GPT-4 using four prompting strategies: minimal, hand-tuned, basic chain-of-thought, and full chain-of-thought. Performance was measured using exact match accuracy on translation tasks without any training pairs, testing the models' ability to generalize from few examples.

## Key Results
- modeLing demonstrates non-negligible accuracy across models, showing emergent few-shot reasoning ability
- Larger models (Llama-3-70B, Mixtral-8x22B) significantly outperform smaller models (Gemma-7B, Alpaca-7B, Llama-2-7B)
- Performance varies by problem type and is impacted by language orthography, with diacritic-free problems showing 3.1% higher accuracy for GPT-4

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The dataset effectively tests few-shot linguistic reasoning by using novel, low-resource languages
- Mechanism: The problems require inferring grammatical rules from minimal examples, leveraging compositional generalization
- Core assumption: The chosen languages are sufficiently rare that models haven't encountered them during training
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Consisting solely of new puzzles written specifically for this work, modeLing has no risk of appearing in the training data of existing AI systems"
  - [section]: "Consisting solely of new puzzles written specifically for this work, modeLing has no risk of appearing in the training data of existing AI systems"
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus neighbors are related but not directly confirming the low-resource nature of the specific languages used
- Break condition: If any of the languages have significant presence in web corpora or are included in multilingual training datasets

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different problem types (noun-adj order, word order, possession, semantics) create a comprehensive evaluation of linguistic reasoning
- Mechanism: Each problem type targets distinct linguistic phenomena requiring different types of pattern recognition and generalization
- Core assumption: The problem types are well-differentiated and accurately reflect distinct linguistic capabilities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The dataset covers four problem types—noun-adjective order, word order, possession, and semantics"
  - [section]: "It includes 272 questions falling into four types, each testing a model's ability to handle a distinct element of linguistic typology"
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus doesn't provide direct evidence about the validity of the problem type distinctions
- Break condition: If problem types overlap significantly in the skills they test, reducing the comprehensiveness of the evaluation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The performance differences across prompting styles and model sizes reveal meaningful insights about model capabilities
- Mechanism: Comparing minimal, hand-tuned, basic CoT, and full CoT prompts isolates the contribution of reasoning scaffolding
- Core assumption: The differences in performance are attributable to the prompting strategies rather than other factors
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Evaluating several large open source language models and GPT on our benchmark, we observe non-negligible accuracy, demonstrating few-shot emergent reasoning ability"
  - [section]: "Across prompting approaches, we observe roughly similar accuracies"
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus doesn't address prompting strategies
- Break condition: If performance differences are dominated by model-specific factors rather than prompting

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Few-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The dataset is designed to test models' ability to learn from very few examples
  - Quick check question: What is the maximum number of examples typically provided in these puzzles before requiring translation?

- Concept: Compositional generalization
  - Why needed here: Models must apply learned rules to novel combinations of linguistic elements
  - Quick check question: How does compositional generalization differ from simple pattern matching in this context?

- Concept: Linguistic typology
  - Why needed here: Understanding different language structures is essential for designing and interpreting the puzzles
  - Quick check question: What are the six possible basic word orders (SVO, SOV, etc.) that models must identify?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data generation -> Problem design -> Prompt engineering -> Model evaluation -> Analysis
- Critical path: Problem design -> Prompt engineering -> Model evaluation (each step depends on the previous)
- Design tradeoffs: Low-resource languages ensure no data leakage but may limit generalizability to more common languages
- Failure signatures: Uniform high accuracy across all models suggests data leakage; uniform low accuracy suggests problems are too difficult
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate GPT-4 with minimal prompt on a subset of 5 problems to establish baseline
  2. Compare performance across all four prompting styles on the same subset
  3. Test zero-shot performance (without any examples) to verify data leakage mitigation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does model performance on modeLing problems correlate with model size, and is there a clear performance threshold where reasoning ability emerges?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates several model sizes (Gemma-7B, Llama-2-7B, Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama-3-70B, Mixtral-8x22B) and finds that smaller models (Gemma, Alpaca, Llama-2) perform much worse than larger models
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows a general trend of larger models performing better, it doesn't explicitly analyze whether there's a specific size threshold where reasoning ability emerges, or if performance scales smoothly with model size
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis plotting model size against performance on modeLing problems, with statistical tests to determine if there's a non-linear relationship or a clear performance jump at a specific model size

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the presence of diacritics in a language's orthography significantly impact a model's ability to reason about that language's structure?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper conducted an experiment replacing diacritics with standard romanizations and found that GPT-4's performance increased by 3.1% on diacritic-free problems
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows a performance difference, it doesn't fully explore why this occurs or how significant this impact is across different models and problem types
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study varying the amount and type of diacritics across multiple languages, measuring performance changes across different models and problem categories to quantify the impact of orthography on reasoning ability

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can modeLing be used to measure progress in linguistic reasoning capabilities over time as models improve?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "even the hardest problems in our benchmark are relatively easy by Linguistics Olympiad standards" and suggests that the benchmark can be scaled by producing more challenging problems
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide a concrete framework for how to use modeLing to track progress over time or how to determine when the benchmark needs to be made more challenging
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal study tracking model performance on modeLing problems over time, with a clear methodology for when and how to introduce more difficult problems based on model performance trends

## Limitations

- The dataset uses only 19 extremely low-resource languages, which may limit generalizability to more commonly studied languages
- Claims about emergent few-shot reasoning ability lack deeper analysis of what cognitive processes are actually occurring
- The four problem types may not comprehensively evaluate all aspects of linguistic reasoning

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The dataset construction methodology and its novelty (no training data contamination) are well-supported by the evidence provided
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about emergent few-shot reasoning ability are supported by observed non-zero accuracy but lack deeper analysis of what cognitive processes are actually occurring
- **Low confidence**: The claim that the dataset comprehensively evaluates "linguistic reasoning" is questionable given the limited scope of four problem types and 19 languages

## Next Checks

1. Test model performance on a holdout set of problems where the training examples are intentionally permuted to verify true compositional generalization rather than surface pattern matching
2. Evaluate the same models on a parallel benchmark using more commonly studied languages to assess generalizability beyond low-resource language settings
3. Conduct ablation studies removing linguistic features (diacritics, specific morphological markers) to isolate which aspects of the input drive model performance
