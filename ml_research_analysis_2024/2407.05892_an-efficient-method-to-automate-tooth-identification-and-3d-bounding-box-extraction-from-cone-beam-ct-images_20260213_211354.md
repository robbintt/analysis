# An efficient method to automate tooth identification and 3D bounding box extraction from Cone Beam CT Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.05892
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05892
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Automated tooth detection and 3D bounding box extraction from CBCT scans with 98.93% detection rate and 96.24% volumetric accuracy

## Executive Summary
This work presents an automated pipeline for detecting, identifying, and extracting individual teeth from 3D Cone Beam CT (CBCT) scans. The approach leverages a two-dimensional object detector applied to axial slices of the 3D image, achieving an mAP@0.5 of 0.889. Detected bounding boxes are merged into three-dimensional volumes using optimal assignment via the Hungarian algorithm. In cases where adjacent teeth lack interocclusal space, a graph-based segmentation corrects artifacts. Across 89 CBCT images, the method achieved a detection rate of 98.93%, with 96.24% of teeth reconstructed with good volumetric accuracy when space was present. The pipeline runs efficiently, avoids extensive 3D training data, and has been integrated into the Dentomo clinical tool, reducing expert workload.

## Method Summary
The method processes CBCT scans by dividing them into equispaced axial slices and applying a YOLOv7 object detector to identify and classify teeth. The Hungarian algorithm matches 2D detections across slices to form 3D bounding boxes, interpolating gaps where necessary. A graph-based segmentation corrects fused volumes when interocclusal space is absent. The system targets eight tooth classes (FDI notation) without distinguishing upper/lower or left/right symmetry. Training uses 250 anonymized CBCT images with 15 slices each; evaluation is on 89 images, achieving high detection and reconstruction accuracy.

## Key Results
- Detection rate of 98.93% across 89 CBCT images
- 96.24% of teeth reconstructed with good volumetric accuracy when interocclusal space was present
- mAP@0.5 of 0.889 for the 2D detection model
- Integrated into Dentomo clinical tool, reducing expert workload

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The method reduces complexity by detecting teeth in 2D axial slices instead of directly in 3D volumes.
- Mechanism: By dividing the 3D CBCT scan into 2D axial slices, the detection problem becomes a standard 2D object detection task, which is computationally cheaper and requires less labeled data. The Hungarian algorithm then reconstructs 3D bounding boxes from the 2D detections by optimally matching them across slices.
- Core assumption: Teeth appear clearly and consistently in axial slices, and a single-stage 2D detector can reliably identify them.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our approach involves dividing the three-dimensional images into axial slices for image detection."
  - [section]: "The three-dimensional CBCT image is divided into axial slices where the present teeth are located and identified with a one-stage object detector."
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus support—most related papers focus on full 3D or segmentation methods, not slice-wise detection.
- Break condition: If teeth are occluded or poorly visible in axial slices, the 2D detector may fail, leading to missed or inaccurate 3D reconstruction.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Hungarian algorithm efficiently reconstructs 3D bounding boxes by optimally matching 2D detections across slices.
- Mechanism: Each tooth's detections across consecutive axial slices are matched based on proximity (Euclidean distance) and overlap (IoU), forming a 3D volume. Missing detections are tolerated within a limit, and mismatched labels are penalized to handle occasional detector errors.
- Core assumption: Tooth shape and position vary smoothly along the axial axis, so matching detections across slices yields coherent 3D volumes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The Hungarian algorithm to match all the bounding boxes that belong to the same tooth... This process begins by analyzing the top axial slice... and proceeds downward."
  - [abstract]: "Detected bounding boxes are merged into three-dimensional volumes using optimal assignment via the Hungarian algorithm."
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus support—tracking-based reconstruction is mentioned in one neighbor paper, but not the Hungarian matching specifically.
- Break condition: If teeth are too close or overlapping in the axial dimension, the matching may incorrectly merge or split volumes.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A graph-based segmentation corrects artifacts when adjacent teeth lack interocclusal space.
- Mechanism: For fused tooth volumes, the algorithm models the region as a graph, assigns density-based penalties, and computes a division boundary that adapts to the actual geometry of the interocclusal space.
- Core assumption: Even without physical separation, the density profile in axial slices reveals a valley between teeth that can be detected and used for division.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In cases where adjacent teeth lack interocclusal space, a graph-based segmentation corrects artifacts."
  - [section]: "We treat the images as graphs... These weights help trace the interocclusal space division boundary."
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus support—most related works do not address artifact correction in fused volumes.
- Break condition: If density profiles are ambiguous or corrupted, the graph-based division may fail or produce inaccurate boundaries.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Axial slice processing in 3D imaging
  - Why needed here: Understanding how 3D volumes are represented as stacks of 2D slices is key to grasping why slice-wise detection is efficient.
  - Quick check question: What is the advantage of detecting objects in 2D slices rather than directly in 3D volumes?
- Concept: Hungarian algorithm for optimal assignment
  - Why needed here: This algorithm is used to match detections across slices into coherent 3D volumes; knowing its purpose and mechanics is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does the Hungarian algorithm help in reconstructing 3D bounding boxes from 2D detections?
- Concept: Intersection over Union (IoU) for bounding box overlap
  - Why needed here: IoU is used to measure how well detections in adjacent slices correspond to the same tooth, which is crucial for accurate matching.
  - Quick check question: Why is IoU an important metric when matching bounding boxes across axial slices?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: 3D CBCT image -> Slice extraction: Equispaced axial slices (1.4 mm apart) -> Detection model: YOLOv7 fine-tuned for 8 tooth classes -> Matching engine: Hungarian algorithm with distance and IoU metrics -> Correction module: Graph-based segmentation for fused volumes -> Output: Set of 3D bounding boxes (teeth + context)
- Critical path:
  Slice extraction -> 2D detection -> Hungarian matching -> Interpolation -> Artifact correction -> Final 3D boxes
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using 2D detection simplifies training and reduces compute but may miss complex 3D relationships.
  - Allowing label mismatch during matching improves robustness but can propagate errors.
  - Graph-based correction handles fused teeth but adds complexity and potential failure modes.
- Failure signatures:
  - Missing detections in axial slices -> Gaps in 3D reconstruction
  - Poor IoU matches -> Incorrectly merged or split volumes
  - Ambiguous density profiles -> Failed artifact correction
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test detection accuracy on a subset of axial slices with known labels.
  2. Validate Hungarian matching by comparing reconstructed 3D boxes to ground truth on simple cases.
  3. Evaluate artifact correction on fused tooth volumes with simulated interocclusal gaps.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly called out in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance degrades for dental prosthetics (implants, bridges) due to reflections and image quality issues.
- Graph-based correction assumes symmetric interocclusal space; irregular or asymmetric cases are not tested.
- The method has not been validated across different CBCT scanner resolutions or voxel sizes.

## Confidence
- Detection and 2D model performance: Medium
- Hungarian matching and 3D reconstruction: Medium
- Graph-based artifact correction: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the detection accuracy on a subset of axial slices with known labels to assess the 2D detector's robustness.
2. Validate the Hungarian matching by comparing reconstructed 3D boxes to ground truth on simple cases to ensure correct 3D volume assembly.
3. Evaluate the artifact correction on fused tooth volumes with simulated interocclusal gaps to assess the graph-based segmentation's effectiveness.
