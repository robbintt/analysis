# Towards Controllable Time Series Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.03698
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03698
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CTS framework decouples mapping process from standard VAE training, enabling precise learning of interplay between latent features and external conditions

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses controllable time series generation (CTSG) under data scarcity, where the goal is to generate synthetic time series that can adapt to various user-specified external conditions. The proposed CTS framework consists of three core modules: Data Selection (using DCS and NNS), Condition Clustering, and Condition Mapping. Extensive experiments on three real-world time series datasets demonstrate CTS's exceptional generation fidelity, attribute coherence, and controllability, outperforming various CTS variants and validation sets. The framework also shows versatility by extending to the image domain, surpassing advanced supervised disentangled VAEs.

## Method Summary
The CTS framework is a VAE-agnostic approach that decouples the mapping process from standard VAE training. It consists of three core modules: Data Selection (using DCS and NNS), Condition Clustering, and Condition Mapping. The Data Selection module selects time series similar to the user-input but with diverse external conditions. The Condition Clustering module partitions the dataset into k clusters based on external condition vectors using k-means clustering. The Condition Mapping module learns the mapping between latent features and external conditions. The framework is evaluated on three real-world time series datasets, demonstrating superior generation fidelity, attribute coherence, and controllability.

## Key Results
- Exceptional generation fidelity with low ED and DTW metrics
- Superior attribute coherence with high C-FID and ACD scores
- Strong controllability with high ACC and W-F1 for interpolation, and high ACC and AUC for extrapolation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CTS framework works by decoupling the mapping process from standard VAE training, allowing for precise learning of the interplay between latent features and external conditions. The Data Selection module selects time series similar to the user-input but with diverse external conditions, ensuring a diverse and representative dataset. The Condition Clustering module partitions the dataset into k clusters based on external condition vectors, enabling efficient learning of condition-specific patterns. The Condition Mapping module learns the mapping between latent features and external conditions, facilitating controllable generation of time series with desired attributes.

## Foundational Learning
1. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
   - Why needed: To learn a latent representation of time series data
   - Quick check: VAE reconstructs input time series with low reconstruction error

2. k-means Clustering
   - Why needed: To partition the dataset into k clusters based on external condition vectors
   - Quick check: Clusters are well-separated and correspond to distinct external conditions

3. Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS)
   - Why needed: To select time series similar to the user-input but with diverse external conditions
   - Quick check: Selected time series are similar to the input but have diverse external conditions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
VAE -> Data Selection (DCS + NNS) -> Condition Clustering (k-means) -> Condition Mapping

Critical Path:
1. Train VAE on time series data to learn latent representation
2. Select time series using Data Selection module
3. Cluster selected time series using Condition Clustering module
4. Learn mapping between latent features and external conditions using Condition Mapping module
5. Generate controllable time series by sampling from the learned mapping

Design Tradeoffs:
- Decoupling mapping process from VAE training allows for precise learning of interplay between latent features and external conditions
- Data Selection module ensures diversity in selected time series, but may introduce additional computational overhead
- Condition Clustering enables efficient learning of condition-specific patterns, but requires careful choice of k

Failure Signatures:
- Poor generation fidelity: Check VAE training and reconstruction error
- Insufficient attribute coherence: Analyze C-FID and ACD scores, check if generated series preserve essential patterns from input data
- Limited controllability: Evaluate ACC, W-F1, and AUC metrics for interpolation and extrapolation

First Experiments:
1. Implement and evaluate the VAE model (TimeVAE) for Time Series Generation using the provided datasets and evaluate generation fidelity with ED and DTW metrics.
2. Implement the Condition Clustering module using k-means clustering to partition the dataset into k clusters based on external condition vectors.
3. Implement the Data Selection module using DCS and NNS to select a subset of time series similar to the user-input time series but with diverse external conditions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Unknown implementation details of the Data Selection module, particularly the Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) component
- Specific hyperparameters and settings for the VAE model, such as the number of latent features (d_l) and the learning rate, are not explicitly stated
- Scalability and generalization to larger and more diverse datasets are not thoroughly explored

## Confidence
- Generation Fidelity and Attribute Coherence: High
- Controllability: High
- Versatility and Extension to Image Domain: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Implement and evaluate the Data Selection module: Reproduce the Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) component and assess its impact on the selection of similar time series with diverse external conditions. Compare the results with the paper's findings to validate the module's effectiveness.
2. Perform sensitivity analysis on VAE hyperparameters: Conduct experiments to investigate the impact of different VAE hyperparameters, such as the number of latent features (d_l) and learning rate, on the generation quality and controllability. Analyze how these parameters affect the framework's performance and identify the optimal settings.
3. Test scalability and generalization: Apply the framework to larger and more diverse time series datasets to assess its scalability and generalization capabilities. Compare the results with the paper's findings on the three real-world datasets to determine the framework's robustness and adaptability to different data characteristics and scales.
