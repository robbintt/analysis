# Clustering-based Multitasking Deep Neural Network for Solar Photovoltaics Power Generation Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.05989
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05989
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: CM-DNN with clustering and knowledge transfer outperforms single models for PV power generation prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a clustering-based multitasking deep neural network (CM-DNN) framework for solar photovoltaic power generation prediction. The approach clusters PV data by customer type using K-means, trains independent DNNs on each cluster, and employs inter-model knowledge transfer optimized by PSO. The framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy compared to single models trained on the entire dataset, with CM-LSTM and CM-GRU showing the highest performance. The work highlights the effectiveness of clustering and knowledge transfer strategies for improving PV power generation forecasting.

## Method Summary
The CM-DNN framework first applies K-means clustering to separate PV power generation data into four customer types (residential, agricultural, industrial, commercial). For each cluster, a deep neural network (DNN) is trained independently using gradient descent optimization. After initial training, inter-model knowledge transfer is performed using PSO to optimize source task selection and transfer coefficients. The PSO searches for optimal binary vectors (source task selection) and continuous vectors (coefficients) that minimize prediction error. The final predictions combine knowledge from multiple customer types based on the optimized transfer parameters.

## Key Results
- CM-DNN variants (CM-RNN, CM-CNNLSTM, CM-LSTM, CM-GRU) outperform single models on both training and testing datasets
- CM-LSTM and CM-GRU achieve the highest prediction accuracy among CM-DNN variants
- Lower RMSE achieved across all customer types compared to models trained on entire dataset without clustering
- Clustering and inter-model knowledge transfer strategies effectively improve PV power generation prediction performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Clustering separates PV power generation data by customer type, allowing each group to be modeled independently
- Mechanism: K-means groups days based on PV power generation patterns, avoiding one model learning conflicting patterns from different customer types
- Core assumption: PV power generation patterns are distinct enough across customer types that single model will be suboptimal
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "K-means is applied to cluster the data into different customer types"
  - [section] "K-means is applied [18] to category the PV power data into different groups"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence found in corpus; supported by paper's own results

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Inter-model knowledge transfer improves prediction accuracy by sharing useful information between customer types
- Mechanism: Source task selection chooses subset of other customer types; coefficients determine how much model knowledge is transferred
- Core assumption: Useful shared information exists between customer types that can improve prediction when transferred
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "inter-model knowledge transfer is performed among the trained models using source task selection and coefficients"
  - [section] "inter-model knowledge transfer is conducted to enhance its training accuracy"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence found for PV-specific inter-model knowledge transfer

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: PSO effectively optimizes the combinatorial problem of selecting source tasks and determining transfer coefficients
- Mechanism: PSO searches for optimal binary vector (source task selection) and continuous vector (coefficients) minimizing prediction error
- Core assumption: PSO can effectively navigate high-dimensional search space to find good solutions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to obtained the optimal subset of source tasks and coefficients"
  - [section] "PSO [22], proposed by Kennedy et al. in 1995, is a population-based optimization algorithm"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence found for PSO being used for PV forecasting transfer learning

  - Quick check question: What are the two types of decision variables PSO must handle in this paper's inter-model knowledge transfer problem?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Clustering (K-means) -> Separate datasets by customer type -> Independent DNN training -> PSO-based transfer optimization -> Final predictions
- Critical path: Clustering → Individual DNN training → PSO-based transfer optimization → Final predictions
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Clustering granularity vs. data availability per cluster
  - Number of source tasks to transfer from vs. transfer accuracy
  - PSO parameters (population size, generations) vs. optimization quality
  - Model complexity (hidden neurons) vs. overfitting risk
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor clustering results in similar customer types being separated
  - Transferred knowledge introduces noise rather than improving predictions
  - PSO fails to find good transfer configurations
  - Overfitting in individual DNNs due to small cluster sizes
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run clustering on the full dataset and visualize the separated clusters to verify distinct patterns
  2. Train individual DNNs on each cluster without transfer to establish baseline performance
  3. Implement and test PSO optimization on a simplified transfer scenario (e.g., fixed source task subset) before full optimization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed CM-DNN framework perform when incorporating additional external factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed into the prediction model?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that many existing works consider input features like temperature to facilitate forecasting accuracy, but it does not investigate the impact of these factors on the proposed CM-DNN framework
- Why unresolved: The authors did not conduct experiments to assess the influence of these external factors on the CM-DNN's performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments by incorporating temperature, humidity, and wind speed data into the CM-DNN framework and comparing the prediction performance with the current model

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of clusters (K) for different types of PV power generation data, and how does it affect the prediction performance of the CM-DNN framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses K-means to cluster the data into four groups but does not explore the optimal number of clusters for different datasets
- Why unresolved: The authors fixed the number of clusters to four without investigating the impact of different K values on the prediction performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different K values and evaluating the prediction performance of the CM-DNN framework for each K

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the CM-DNN framework compare to other advanced deep learning models, such as transformer-based models or graph neural networks, for PV power generation prediction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares the CM-DNN framework with several popular time series forecasting models but does not explore the performance of more advanced deep learning models
- Why unresolved: The authors did not investigate the potential benefits of using more advanced deep learning architectures
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments by implementing transformer-based models or graph neural networks and comparing their prediction performance with the CM-DNN framework

## Limitations

- Lack of detailed specifications for DNN architectures beyond mention of 10 hidden neurons
- Inadequate specification of PSO parameters and implementation details for handling binary decision variables
- Claims of superior performance supported only by paper's own results without external validation
- No exploration of optimal number of clusters or comparison with more advanced deep learning models

## Confidence

- High confidence: The general framework structure (clustering → independent training → transfer learning) is clearly described and logically sound
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of inter-model knowledge transfer is demonstrated but lacks comparison to other transfer learning approaches
- Low confidence: The PSO optimization process for transfer parameters is inadequately specified, making reproduction difficult

## Next Checks

1. Verify clustering quality by visualizing the separated customer types and confirming distinct PV generation patterns exist between clusters
2. Test individual DNN performance on each cluster without transfer to establish baseline accuracy and identify potential overfitting issues
3. Validate PSO optimization by testing simplified transfer scenarios with fixed source task subsets before implementing full optimization
