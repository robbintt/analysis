# Beyond Persuasion: Towards Conversational Recommender System with Credible Explanations
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.14399
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14399
- Authors: Peixin Qin; Chen Huang; Yang Deng; Wenqiang Lei; Tat-Seng Chua
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: PC-CRS improves both persuasiveness and credibility of CRS explanations, leading to better user acceptance and recommendation accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical issue in conversational recommender systems (CRSs) where explanations used for persuasion can mislead users due to their lack of credibility. The authors propose PC-CRS, a method that enhances explanation credibility through two key mechanisms: credibility-aware persuasive strategies during generation and post-hoc self-reflection refinement. The approach aims to balance persuasiveness with factual accuracy, ensuring recommendations are both compelling and trustworthy. Experimental results demonstrate that PC-CRS significantly outperforms existing methods on both persuasiveness and credibility metrics while improving recommendation accuracy.

## Method Summary
PC-CRS operates through a two-stage process to generate credible persuasive explanations in conversational recommender systems. First, it employs credibility-aware persuasive strategies that guide the explanation generation process to maintain factual accuracy while being persuasive. This involves incorporating credibility signals and constraints during the generation phase. Second, the system applies post-hoc self-reflection, where generated explanations are analyzed and refined to identify and correct any credibility issues. This dual approach ensures that explanations are not only persuasive but also grounded in factual item descriptions rather than merely catering to user utterances.

## Key Results
- PC-CRS significantly improves both persuasiveness and credibility metrics compared to baseline methods
- The method leads to better user acceptance rates and higher recommendation accuracy
- Analysis reveals that current methods produce incredible explanations by prioritizing user utterance alignment over faithful item description

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of PC-CRS stems from its dual focus on credibility during both generation and refinement phases. By incorporating credibility-aware strategies during initial generation, the system establishes a foundation of factual accuracy. The post-hoc self-reflection mechanism then acts as a quality control step, catching and correcting any credibility issues that may have emerged. This approach addresses the fundamental tension in CRS between being persuasive (which often involves emotional appeal) and being credible (which requires factual accuracy), creating explanations that satisfy both criteria.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Credibility-aware persuasive strategies** - Why needed: Ensures explanations are factually accurate while maintaining persuasive power. Quick check: Compare explanation accuracy metrics with and without credibility constraints.
2. **Post-hoc self-reflection** - Why needed: Provides a safety net to catch and correct credibility issues after initial generation. Quick check: Measure improvement in credibility scores before and after reflection step.
3. **Conversation context analysis** - Why needed: Helps distinguish between explanations that cater to user preferences versus those that accurately describe items. Quick check: Analyze correlation between context quality and recommendation accuracy.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: User Utterance -> Item Selection -> Explanation Generation -> Credibility Assessment -> Post-hoc Reflection -> Final Explanation
Critical path: User Utterance → Item Selection → Explanation Generation → Credibility Assessment → Final Explanation (post-hoc reflection as optimization)
Design tradeoffs: Balances computational overhead of credibility checks against explanation quality gains; prioritizes factual accuracy over maximum persuasiveness
Failure signatures: Explanations become overly cautious and lose persuasive power; credibility assessment misses subtle factual inaccuracies
First experiments: 1) Compare persuasiveness scores of PC-CRS vs baselines, 2) Measure credibility metric improvements, 3) Evaluate recommendation accuracy impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on automated metrics rather than direct human judgment of explanation quality
- Post-hoc self-reflection may not generalize well to diverse conversational scenarios
- Analysis of current methods' failures is correlational rather than based on controlled ablation studies

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core experimental results showing PC-CRS outperforms baselines on both persuasiveness and credibility metrics
- Medium confidence: Specific mechanisms by which credibility-aware strategies and self-reflection contribute to improvements
- Medium confidence: Claim about current methods catering to user utterances rather than item faithfulness

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with human evaluators to validate automated credibility and persuasion metrics against actual user perception and acceptance
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the individual contributions of credibility-aware strategies versus post-hoc self-reflection to the observed improvements
3. Test the method across diverse domains and conversation lengths to assess generalizability beyond the current experimental setup
