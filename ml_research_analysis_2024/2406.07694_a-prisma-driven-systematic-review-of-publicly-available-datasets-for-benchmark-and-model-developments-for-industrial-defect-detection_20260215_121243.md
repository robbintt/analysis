# A PRISMA Driven Systematic Review of Publicly Available Datasets for Benchmark and Model Developments for Industrial Defect Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.07694
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07694
- **Reference count**: 4
- **Primary result**: Review of 15 publicly available industrial defect detection datasets (2015-2023) found significant gaps in standardized, annotated datasets across industries, with domain-specific data outperforming general-purpose datasets.

## Executive Summary
This systematic review examined 15 publicly available datasets for industrial defect detection between 2015-2023, finding that while several comprehensive datasets exist (NEU-CLS, NEU-DET, DAGM, KolektorSDD), there remains a significant gap in standardized, annotated defect datasets across different industries. The review revealed that datasets primarily focused on surface defect detection in steel and textured surfaces, with limited representation of other industrial applications. Despite the availability of benchmark datasets, case-specific data often yields superior results compared to general-purpose datasets. The findings suggest the importance of developing more comprehensive, industry-specific datasets to advance defect detection algorithms and methodologies in industrial manufacturing.

## Method Summary
The review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines with four phases: identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion. Literature was searched across ACM Digital Library, Scopus, ProQuest, and IEEE Xplore using specific keywords related to image datasets and defect detection. Studies were included if they focused on image-based industrial defect detection, were published in English between 2015-2023, and contained empirical data. Data extraction focused on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and findings, with synthesis grouping studies by industrial sector, defect type, methodology, and dataset used. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus or third-party consultation.

## Key Results
- 15 publicly available datasets identified for industrial defect detection (2015-2023)
- Significant gaps exist in standardized, annotated defect datasets across different industries
- Domain-specific datasets consistently outperform general-purpose datasets in defect detection tasks
- Limited representation of defect types beyond surface defects in steel and textured surfaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Standardized, annotated defect datasets are critical for benchmarking and model development in industrial defect detection.
- **Mechanism**: Consistent data structures allow algorithms to be compared fairly, and annotated defects enable supervised learning for automated detection.
- **Core assumption**: Quality and consistency of dataset annotations directly impact model performance and generalizability.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "A critical barrier to progress is the scarcity of comprehensive datasets featuring annotated defects, which are essential for developing and refining automated defect detection models."
  - [section] "The NEU dataset has established itself as a widely utilized resource for surface defect detection and classification, particularly in the context of hot-rolled steel strips."
- **Break condition**: If annotations are inconsistent or incomplete, model training will be unreliable, and cross-dataset benchmarking will be meaningless.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Domain-specific datasets yield better defect detection performance than general-purpose datasets.
- **Mechanism**: Manufacturing processes and defect types are highly specialized; models trained on domain-relevant data learn context-specific features more effectively.
- **Core assumption**: The distribution of defect appearances and manufacturing environments in the training data matches the target deployment scenario.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Despite the availability of benchmark datasets, the study revealed that case-specific data often yields superior results compared to general-purpose datasets."
  - [section] "Our analysis identified a need for more diversified datasets encompassing a broader range of defects and manufacturing processes."
- **Break condition**: If domain-specific data is unavailable or too limited, reliance on general datasets will degrade detection accuracy.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: PRISMA-guided systematic reviews ensure comprehensive and unbiased dataset evaluation.
- **Mechanism**: Following a structured protocol (identification, screening, eligibility, inclusion) minimizes selection bias and ensures methodological rigor.
- **Core assumption**: The inclusion and exclusion criteria are well-defined and consistently applied across reviewers.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "In this systematic review, we thoroughly adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, ensuring a comprehensive, transparent, and unbiased approach."
  - [section] "Discrepancies were resolved through consensus or by consulting a third reviewer, ensuring an unbiased and comprehensive inclusion of relevant studies."
- **Break condition**: If reviewer agreement is low or criteria are inconsistently applied, bias will be introduced and review validity compromised.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews
  - **Why needed here**: Ensures the review is methodologically sound and reproducible, increasing credibility of dataset findings.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the four main phases of a PRISMA-guided review?

- **Concept**: Image processing and defect detection fundamentals
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding image preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation is essential to interpret dataset suitability and limitations.
  - **Quick check question**: What role do annotated defects play in supervised learning for defect detection?

- **Concept**: Dataset diversity and domain specificity
  - **Why needed here**: Helps evaluate whether a dataset can generalize across industries or is best suited for niche applications.
  - **Quick check question**: Why might a general-purpose dataset underperform compared to a domain-specific one in defect detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Literature search -> Study screening -> Data extraction -> Dataset evaluation -> Benchmark analysis -> Model development
- **Critical path**: Dataset quality (annotations + diversity) -> Model accuracy -> Benchmarking reliability
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balancing dataset comprehensiveness vs. specificity; high annotation quality vs. cost and time to create
- **Failure signatures**: Poor model generalization, inconsistent benchmark results, inability to detect rare defect types
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train baseline model (e.g., Faster R-CNN) on NEU-CLS dataset and evaluate on held-out samples.
  2. Compare performance of models trained on general vs. domain-specific datasets on same defect types.
  3. Test algorithm robustness using synthetic defects from DAGM to simulate real-world variability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: What specific characteristics of case-specific datasets lead to superior performance compared to benchmark datasets in industrial defect detection?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "while publicly available datasets are commonly used for training computer vision models, case-specific data often yield superior results" (Singh et al., 2023b)
- **Why unresolved**: The paper mentions superior performance of case-specific data but does not detail the specific characteristics that contribute to this advantage.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative studies analyzing feature differences between case-specific and benchmark datasets, including factors like image resolution, defect diversity, lighting conditions, and manufacturing process representation.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can synthetic datasets like DAGM be improved to better represent real-world industrial defect detection scenarios?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "DAGM dataset...artificially generated, a design choice that allows it to effectively mimic real-world problems"
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper discusses the utility of synthetic datasets, it does not address specific limitations or propose improvements for better real-world representation.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Studies comparing synthetic and real-world datasets, identifying gaps in synthetic data representation, and developing methodologies to enhance synthetic dataset realism.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What are the key factors limiting the generalizability of defect detection algorithms across different industries and defect types?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The review identifies a need for more diverse datasets that better represent real-world manufacturing scenarios and encompass a broader range of defect types.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper highlights the need for diverse datasets but does not specify the factors that limit algorithm generalizability across industries and defect types.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comprehensive studies analyzing algorithm performance across various industries and defect types, identifying commonalities and differences in dataset requirements and algorithm adaptability.

## Limitations
- Search restricted to four major databases and English-language publications only, potentially excluding relevant datasets from non-English sources or regional repositories.
- Focus on publicly available datasets inherently biases the review toward open-source resources, potentially overlooking valuable proprietary or unpublished datasets.
- Temporal scope (2015-2023) may miss earlier foundational datasets that continue to influence current research.

## Confidence
- **Core finding (standardized datasets essential)**: High confidence
- **Domain-specific datasets outperform general-purpose**: Medium confidence
- **PRISMA methodology adherence**: High confidence
- **Significant gaps in industry-specific datasets**: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. **Database Coverage Expansion**: Replicate the systematic review including regional databases (e.g., China National Knowledge Infrastructure, SciELO) and non-English sources to verify whether the identified 15 datasets represent the complete landscape or if additional relevant datasets exist in underrepresented regions.

2. **Comparative Performance Analysis**: Conduct controlled experiments training identical defect detection models (e.g., Faster R-CNN) on both domain-specific and general-purpose datasets for identical defect types, measuring performance differences across multiple industrial applications to quantify the practical impact of dataset specificity.

3. **Annotation Quality Assessment**: Develop a standardized annotation quality rubric and apply it to the identified datasets to evaluate annotation consistency, completeness, and labeling accuracy, then correlate these quality metrics with reported model performance to establish the relationship between annotation quality and detection effectiveness.
