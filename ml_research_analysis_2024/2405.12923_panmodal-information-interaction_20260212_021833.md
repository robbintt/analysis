# Panmodal Information Interaction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.12923
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12923
- Reference count: 13
- Users prefer search for broad information needs and chat for direct, personalized assistance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces panmodal information interaction, encompassing multimodal, crossmodal, and transmodal experiences in search and chat interfaces. Through a survey of over 100 users, the authors identify distinct modality preferences and switching behaviors, with users favoring search for comprehensive information and chat for personalized assistance. The study reveals that modality transitions occur when initial choices fail to meet user needs, particularly from search to chat. The authors propose a future where AI agents seamlessly integrate various modalities to provide more effective information interaction experiences, especially for complex tasks requiring transmodal support.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a survey of over 100 users who had recently used search and chat modalities, collecting both multiple choice and open-ended text responses about their experiences and preferences. The qualitative analysis focused on understanding modality selection patterns, reasons for switching between modalities, and identification of transmodal usage for complex tasks. Data cleaning removed low-quality responses before thematic analysis of the remaining data to categorize modality usage patterns and extract insights about user preferences and behaviors.

## Key Results
- Users prefer search for broad information needs and chat for direct, personalized assistance
- Transitions from search to chat are more common than reverse transitions when initial modality fails to meet needs
- Complex tasks requiring transmodal support were identified, where multiple modalities are used together in coordinated sequences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Users switch from search to chat when search results lack interactivity or personalization needed for their task.
- Mechanism: When users need tailored, interactive responses that search engines cannot provide, they transition to chat modalities which support multi-turn dialog and dynamic personalization.
- Core assumption: Users recognize when their information need shifts from broad exploration to specific, personalized assistance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Users switch modalities when their initial choice doesn't meet their needs, with transitions from search to chat being more common than the reverse."
  - [section] "We learned that users switch from search to chat modality when what they are getting through search is not sufficiently interactive or tailored to their needs."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for this specific switching behavior
- Break condition: This mechanism breaks if the system cannot accurately detect when a user's need shifts from exploratory to specific assistance, or if chat systems cannot provide sufficiently personalized responses.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Users prefer search for broad information needs and chat for direct, personalized assistance.
- Mechanism: Users develop mental models of modality strengths - search for comprehensive, diverse information sources, chat for quick, direct answers and creative tasks.
- Core assumption: Users have sufficient experience with both modalities to form accurate mental models of their respective strengths and limitations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Users prefer search for broad information needs and chat for direct, personalized assistance."
  - [section] "Respondents reported that they preferred traditional search engines when they wanted more options, details, or more diversity/comprehensiveness in their information."
  - [section] "Users find chat-based systems more effective when they need direct and quick answers to specific questions, without having to sift through unrelated information."
- Break condition: This mechanism breaks if users cannot accurately assess their information needs or if modality capabilities change significantly from current expectations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Transmodal support enables tasks that cannot be accomplished through monomodal or even multimodal approaches alone.
- Mechanism: By integrating multiple modalities in coordinated sequences or concurrently, users can tackle complex information tasks that require diverse capabilities (e.g., search for examples, chat for drafting).
- Core assumption: There exist information tasks whose complexity exceeds what any single modality or simple modality combination can handle.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The study also identified a need for transmodal support, where multiple modalities are used together for complex tasks."
  - [section] "Several respondents reported complex information needs that require more dynamic support... These needs were often related to tasks such as healthcare (e.g., diagnosis and mitigation), legal (e.g., seeking legal advice), or research (e.g., creating summary reports for a business need)."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for transmodal concept
- Break condition: This mechanism breaks if the integration of multiple modalities creates more confusion than benefit, or if the overhead of managing multiple modalities outweighs the advantages.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mental models of information system capabilities
  - Why needed here: Users must understand what each modality can and cannot do to make effective modality choices
  - Quick check question: Can a user explain why they would choose search over chat for finding a restaurant review versus choosing chat for writing a work report?

- Concept: Information task complexity classification
  - Why needed here: Understanding when a task requires simple, complex, or transmodal support is crucial for appropriate modality selection
  - Quick check question: Given a task to research a medical condition and then create a care plan, can you identify which parts would benefit from search versus chat support?

- Concept: Crossmodal transition triggers
  - Why needed here: Users need to recognize when their initial modality choice is insufficient and when to switch
  - Quick check question: What specific indicators would tell you that you should switch from search to chat when looking for information about a complex topic?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Task analyzer → Modality broker → Context persistence layer → GenAI orchestrator
- Critical path: Task input → Task analysis → Modality selection → Information retrieval/synthesis → User feedback → (Optional) Modality switch
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Seamless integration vs. user control: Balancing automated modality transitions with user agency
  - System complexity vs. user comprehension: Adding powerful features without overwhelming users
  - Personalization depth vs. privacy concerns: Using personal data to improve modality suggestions while maintaining trust
- Failure signatures:
  - Users repeatedly switching between modalities without task progress
  - Users consistently choosing suboptimal modalities for their tasks
  - Users abandoning complex tasks due to modality management overhead
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic modality routing for common task types and measure user success rates compared to monomodal approaches
  2. Add simple crossmodal transition suggestions and measure whether users adopt recommended switches
  3. Develop transmodal support for complex tasks and evaluate task completion quality versus sequential monomodal approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do users make modality switching decisions when encountering complex or ambiguous information needs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Survey findings showed users switch modalities based on specific needs (e.g., search to chat for more direct answers, chat to search for broader results)
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies switching patterns but doesn't deeply explore the cognitive processes or decision-making frameworks users employ when choosing to switch between modalities
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies using think-aloud protocols or eye-tracking to capture real-time decision-making during modality switching

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the optimal methods for representing and preserving task state across multiple modalities?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses transmodal interactions but notes that current interfaces lack clear support for running concurrent modalities with seamless integration
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the need for transmodal support, it doesn't provide concrete solutions for how task state should be represented and maintained when users switch between or combine multiple modalities
- What evidence would resolve it: Prototype systems demonstrating effective task state preservation and transfer mechanisms across different modalities

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can GenAI agents effectively broker transitions between different information interaction modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors envision future systems where "selections and transitions could be brokered by agents engaging with users and/or other agents"
- Why unresolved: The paper presents this as a future possibility but doesn't detail the technical requirements, user experience considerations, or evaluation metrics for such agent-mediated modality transitions
- What evidence would resolve it: Working implementations of GenAI agents that can successfully mediate modality transitions and measurable improvements in task completion efficiency compared to manual switching

## Limitations

- Survey methodology relies on self-reported preferences and retrospective task analysis rather than real-time observation
- Transmodal interaction concept lacks rigorous definition and empirical validation beyond identifying user-reported complex needs
- Sample size of 100+ users may not provide sufficient statistical power for robust conclusions across diverse user populations

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The observation that users prefer search for broad information needs and chat for direct, personalized assistance is well-supported by the survey data
- Medium Confidence: The finding that transitions from search to chat are more common than the reverse is based on survey responses but may be influenced by specific tasks or participant experience
- Low Confidence: The concept of transmodal support and its necessity for complex tasks is identified through qualitative analysis but lacks strong empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled experiment where participants perform both simple and complex information tasks using search, chat, and transmodal approaches, measuring task completion time, accuracy, and user satisfaction to empirically validate the claimed modality preferences and transmodal benefits.
2. Implement an observational study tracking real-time user interactions with search and chat systems to verify the retrospective survey findings about modality switching patterns and the triggers that prompt these transitions.
3. Develop a prototype transmodal information system and conduct usability testing to identify specific design principles and interaction patterns that enable effective transmodal experiences, validating whether the proposed benefits outweigh the increased complexity of managing multiple modalities.
