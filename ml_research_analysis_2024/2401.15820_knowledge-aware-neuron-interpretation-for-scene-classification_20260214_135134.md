# Knowledge-Aware Neuron Interpretation for Scene Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.15820
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15820
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Over 23% gain in neuron interpretation with concept filtering and 26.7% improvement in model performance through retraining with core concepts

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of explaining deep neural network predictions for scene classification by proposing a knowledge-aware neuron interpretation framework. The framework leverages ConceptNet to define core concepts that ensure concept completeness, uses MinMax-based NetDissect to identify neuron-concept relationships, and introduces Concept Filtering to merge semantically-equivalent concepts. It also proposes model manipulation techniques to improve performance by identifying and utilizing positive/negative neurons. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both interpretability and model performance across multiple datasets and architectures.

## Method Summary
The framework addresses three key limitations in current neuron interpretation methods: neglecting concept completeness, lacking concept fusion, and difficulty in manipulating model behavior. It extracts concepts from images, defines scoping and identifier core concepts using ConceptNet to ensure completeness, and applies MinMax-based NetDissect to establish neuron-concept relationships. Concept Filtering groups semantically-equivalent concepts using knowledge graph embeddings, while Model Manipulation identifies positive/negative neurons and retrains models using core concepts and explanation metrics. The approach is evaluated on ADE20k and Opensurfaces datasets across ResNet, DenseNet, AlexNet, and MobileNet architectures.

## Key Results
- Over 23% point gain in neuron interpretation achieved through Concept Filtering by merging semantically-equivalent concepts
- 26.7% improvement in original model performance through retraining with core concepts and explanation metrics
- Framework demonstrates effectiveness across multiple datasets (ADE20k, Opensurfaces) and model architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, AlexNet, MobileNet)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework improves model interpretability by leveraging external knowledge from ConceptNet to define core concepts, ensuring concept completeness.
- Mechanism: The framework uses ConceptNet to identify scoping core concepts (SCC) and identifier core concepts (ICC) for each scene, ensuring that the set of concepts used for interpretation is both complete and specific to the scene.
- Core assumption: The knowledge graph (ConceptNet) contains all necessary concepts for scene classification and that these concepts are accurately represented and related.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a novel knowledge-aware neuron interpretation framework to explain model predictions for image scene classification. Specifically, for concept completeness, we present core concepts of a scene based on knowledge graph, ConceptNet, to gauge the completeness of concepts."
  - [section] "Core concepts (CC) are the fundamental elements that are strong candidates for scene concepts... Therefore, we leverage ConceptNet to help to define two types of CC to address the challenge of concept completeness, including scoping core concepts (SCC) and identifier core concepts (ICC)."
- Break condition: If ConceptNet lacks critical concepts for certain scenes or if the relationships between concepts in ConceptNet are inaccurate, the framework's effectiveness in ensuring concept completeness would be compromised.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework enhances neuron interpretation by merging semantically-equivalent concepts using Concept Filtering.
- Mechanism: Concept Filtering groups semantically-equivalent concepts based on their embeddings in ConceptNet, reducing redundancy and improving the clarity of neuron interpretations.
- Core assumption: Concepts that are semantically equivalent will have similar embeddings in ConceptNet, and these embeddings can be used to accurately group concepts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, for concept fusion, we introduce a knowledge graph-based method known as Concept Filtering, which produces over 23% point gain on neuron behaviors for neuron interpretation."
  - [section] "In context of image classification and object detection, there could be a large number of concepts and many of which might have similar semantics... To address this challenge, given each set of scene associated concepts Cyj, we compute the embeddings of the concepts in Cyj and align them to concepts in a KG like ConceptNet, using classic KG embeddings techniques, such as TransE, Dismult and TransD, then group them w.r.t. their distances, into clusters Cl 1(Cyj), ..., Clr(Cyj)."
- Break condition: If the KG embeddings do not accurately reflect semantic equivalence or if the clustering algorithm fails to group truly equivalent concepts, the effectiveness of Concept Filtering would be reduced.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework improves model performance by identifying and utilizing positive and negative neurons based on core concepts, and by retraining models with core concept loss.
- Mechanism: The framework identifies neurons that contribute positively or negatively to the prediction of a scene based on core concepts, and then uses this information to manipulate model behavior through neuron disabling or model retraining.
- Core assumption: The contribution of neurons to the prediction of a scene can be accurately measured based on their alignment with core concepts, and that manipulating these neurons will lead to improved model performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "At last, we propose Model Manipulation, which aims to study whether the core concepts based on ConceptNet could be employed to manipulate model behavior... The results show that core concepts can effectively improve the performance of original model by over 26%."
  - [section] "Neuron Identification via CC aims to identify the positive and negative neurons by calculating contribution score to see the model behavior... For true prediction, we disable top-k positive neurons... For false prediction, we disable top-k negative neurons... and see whether the model can make better prediction."
- Break condition: If the contribution score does not accurately reflect the importance of neurons to the prediction, or if disabling neurons leads to unintended consequences in model behavior, the effectiveness of model manipulation would be compromised.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
  - Why needed here: KGs like ConceptNet provide a structured representation of concepts and their relationships, which is essential for defining core concepts and ensuring concept completeness.
  - Quick check question: How does ConceptNet represent the relationship between the concepts "bed" and "bedroom"?

- Concept: Neuron Interpretation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how individual neurons in a neural network respond to specific concepts is crucial for interpreting model decisions and identifying positive/negative neurons for model manipulation.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the intersection over union (IoU) score in determining whether a neuron can be considered a detector for a specific concept?

- Concept: Concept Embedding
  - Why needed here: Concept embeddings are used to measure the semantic similarity between concepts, which is essential for grouping semantically-equivalent concepts in Concept Filtering.
  - Quick check question: How does the TransE embedding technique represent the relationship between two concepts in a knowledge graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Images -> Concept Extraction -> Core Concept Definition (ConceptNet) -> MinMax-based NetDissect -> Concept Filtering -> Model Manipulation -> Interpreted Predictions

- Critical path:
  1. Extract concepts from input images
  2. Define core concepts (SCC and ICC) using ConceptNet
  3. Apply MinMax-based NetDissect to learn neuron-concept relationships
  4. Apply Concept Filtering to merge semantically-equivalent concepts
  5. Use core concepts for model manipulation (neuron identification and model retraining)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using external knowledge (ConceptNet) increases interpretability but may introduce dependencies on the quality and completeness of the knowledge graph.
  - Merging semantically-equivalent concepts simplifies interpretation but may oversimplify complex relationships between concepts.
  - Manipulating model behavior based on core concepts can improve performance but may lead to overfitting if not done carefully.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor concept completeness: Model predictions are not well-explained by the identified core concepts.
  - Ineffective concept fusion: Neuron interpretations remain cluttered with redundant concepts after applying Concept Filtering.
  - Negative impact on model performance: Model performance degrades after applying model manipulation techniques.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify concept completeness: Check if the identified core concepts (SCC and ICC) cover the essential elements of each scene in the dataset.
  2. Evaluate concept fusion: Measure the reduction in concept redundancy after applying Concept Filtering using metrics like the number of unique concepts or the average similarity between concepts.
  3. Test model manipulation: Disable positive and negative neurons identified based on core concepts and observe the impact on model performance and interpretability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of clustering technique (e.g., TransE, Dismult, ProjE, TransD) impact the quality and interpretability of neuron-level explanations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares different KG embedding techniques (TransE, Dismult, ProjE, TransD) and their impact on the number of optimal clusters and interpretability of neurons.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates a subset of ADE20k concepts and does not explore the full potential of different clustering techniques on other datasets or with varying numbers of clusters.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive evaluation of different clustering techniques on multiple datasets with varying numbers of clusters and neuron architectures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the core concepts and explanation metrics be used to improve the performance of models on more complex tasks beyond scene classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of core concepts and explanation metrics on scene classification tasks but does not explore their potential on other tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on scene classification and does not investigate the generalizability of the approach to other domains or tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on other tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, or natural language processing tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the knowledge-aware neuron interpretation framework be extended to incorporate additional types of external knowledge beyond ConceptNet?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper utilizes ConceptNet as the primary source of external knowledge but does not explore other knowledge sources.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the potential benefits of incorporating other knowledge sources such as domain-specific ontologies or structured knowledge bases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments incorporating different knowledge sources and evaluating their impact on model interpretability and performance.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness heavily relies on ConceptNet's coverage and accuracy for scene concepts, with no validation provided for ConceptNet's completeness across diverse scene types
- The claimed improvements in interpretability focus on neuron interpretation metrics rather than whether merged concepts actually improve semantic understanding or practical interpretability for end-users
- The 26.7% performance improvement through retraining is demonstrated only on tested datasets and may not generalize to other architectures or domains

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The methodology for core concept definition using ConceptNet is well-grounded in established knowledge graph techniques. The mathematical framework for neuron-concept relationships and contribution scoring is clearly specified.
- Medium Confidence: The claimed improvements in interpretability and performance are supported by quantitative metrics, but the evaluation could benefit from user studies to validate whether the explanations are actually more understandable to practitioners.
- Low Confidence: The long-term stability and transferability of the manipulated models across different datasets or domains is not evaluated. The approach may lead to overfitting to specific concept sets.

## Next Checks

1. **ConceptNet Coverage Analysis** - Systematically evaluate ConceptNet's concept coverage across all scenes in ADE20k and Opensurfaces to identify potential gaps that could limit framework effectiveness.

2. **Cross-Domain Transferability** - Test the framework on additional scene classification datasets (e.g., Places365) to assess whether core concept definitions and performance improvements transfer across domains.

3. **Ablation Studies on Concept Filtering** - Conduct controlled experiments disabling concept filtering to quantify its exact contribution to both interpretability improvements and any potential information loss from merging semantically-related concepts.
