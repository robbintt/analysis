# ConKE: Conceptualization-Augmented Knowledge Editing in Large Language Models for Commonsense Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.11418
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11418
- Authors: Liyu Zhang; Weiqi Wang; Tianqing Fang; Yangqiu Song
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: CONCEPT EDIT improves commonsense reasoning in LLMs by integrating conceptualization and instantiation with automated knowledge verification, achieving significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
CONCEPT EDIT addresses the challenge of improving commonsense reasoning in large language models by combining automated knowledge verification with conceptualization and instantiation techniques. The framework uses VERA to identify implausible commonsense knowledge triples, then enriches this knowledge through abstraction to general concepts and generation of novel instances. Finally, it applies established knowledge editing methods (MEMIT, GRACE, ROME) to modify the LLM's internal representations. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach produces more plausible commonsense knowledge and significantly improves performance on commonsense question-answering benchmarks.

## Method Summary
CONCEPT EDIT operates through a three-stage pipeline: first, it uses VERA (an automated commonsense plausibility verifier) to score generated knowledge triples from AbstractATOMIC, flagging those below 0.5 as implausible. Second, it applies conceptualization (abstracting instances to general concepts via GPT-4o) and instantiation (generating novel instances from these concepts) to enrich the knowledge. Third, it employs knowledge editing methods like MEMIT, GRACE, and ROME to integrate the enriched knowledge into the LLM. The framework is evaluated using both VERA's plausibility scores and downstream commonsense reasoning benchmarks including aNLI, CSQA, PIQA, SocialIQA, and CommonsenseQA.

## Key Results
- CONCEPT EDIT significantly improves plausibility rates of edited commonsense knowledge compared to baseline methods
- The framework achieves notable performance gains on multiple commonsense question-answering benchmarks, particularly aNLI and SocialIQA
- Conceptualized variants consistently outperform non-conceptualized counterparts in both plausibility and downstream task accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Automated plausibility verification with VERA reduces reliance on manual annotations while maintaining accurate detection of implausible commonsense knowledge.
- Mechanism: VERA, a discriminative LLM trained to score commonsense statement plausibility, evaluates generated triples by outputting a score in [0,1]. Triples with scores below 0.5 are flagged as implausible and targeted for editing.
- Core assumption: VERA's scoring correlates with human judgments of plausibility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We employ VERA (Liu et al., 2023), an automated commonsense plausibility verifier, which prompts an LLM to generate commonsense knowledge and determines its plausibility."
  - [section 3.1] "VERA then evaluates the plausibility of the generated knowledge by producing a score in the range [0, 1], where values above 0.5 are considered plausible, and those below 0.5 are deemed implausible."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus only shows related papers but no direct VERA performance data.
- Break condition: If VERA's scoring systematically diverges from human plausibility judgments or fails to capture context-sensitive variations in commonsense knowledge.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Conceptualization and instantiation enrich semantic coverage and improve generalizability of edited knowledge.
- Mechanism: For each target triple, the framework first abstracts instances into general concepts via GPT-4o prompting, then instantiates these concepts into novel, context-specific instances, forming an enriched knowledge base.
- Core assumption: Abstracting to concepts and then instantiating creates more robust and generalizable knowledge representations than editing at the instance level alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We integrate conceptualization and instantiation into the KE pipeline for LLMs to enhance their commonsense reasoning capabilities."
  - [section 3.2] "We augment the knowledge to be edited by implementing both conceptualization and instantiation, following Wang et al. (2024c). For each triple targeted for editing, we first abstract its instances into more general concepts by prompting GPT-4o, producing abstract knowledge triples."
  - [section 4.3] "The conceptualized variants consistently outperform their non-conceptualized counterparts, achieving higher plausibility and improved downstream task accuracy."
- Break condition: If conceptualization leads to overly abstract representations that lose specific, useful details or if instantiation generates invalid or nonsensical instances.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Knowledge editing methods (MEMIT, GRACE, ROME) can effectively integrate enriched commonsense knowledge into LLMs, improving downstream reasoning performance.
- Mechanism: After VERA identifies implausible triples and conceptualization/instantiation generates enriched knowledge, the framework applies established editing methods to modify the LLM's internal representations or parameters.
- Core assumption: The chosen editing methods can successfully incorporate the enriched knowledge without disrupting existing knowledge or causing catastrophic forgetting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Finally, it edits the LLM using established methods like MEMIT, GRACE, and ROME."
  - [section 3.3] "To accomplish this, we experiment with three established knowledge editing methods: MEMIT (Meng et al., 2023), ROME (Meng et al., 2022), and GRACE (Hartvigsen et al., 2023)."
  - [section 4.2] "Models edited with CONCEPT EDIT achieve significant performance improvements across all benchmarks, with particularly notable gains in aNLI and SocialIQA."
- Break condition: If editing methods fail to properly integrate the new knowledge, cause degradation in other tasks, or introduce inconsistencies across related knowledge triples.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Editing (KE) principles
  - Why needed here: Understanding how KE methods like MEMIT, GRACE, and ROME modify LLM representations is crucial for implementing CONCEPT EDIT.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between parameter-based editing (MEMIT, ROME) and adapter-based editing (GRACE)?

- Concept: Commonsense knowledge representation and evaluation
  - Why needed here: CONCEPT EDIT operates on commonsense knowledge triples and uses VERA for plausibility scoring, requiring understanding of how commonsense knowledge is structured and evaluated.
  - Quick check question: How do commonsense knowledge bases like AbstractATOMIC represent relationships between events and their effects/intentions?

- Concept: Conceptualization and instantiation in NLP
  - Why needed here: These are core components of CONCEPT EDIT that require understanding how to abstract instances to concepts and generate new instances from concepts.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between entity-level and event-level conceptualization, and why is event-level conceptualization particularly relevant for commonsense reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: VERA -> Conceptualization/Instantiation -> Knowledge Editing (MEMIT/GRACE/ROME)
- Critical path:
  1. Input: AbstractATOMIC triples
  2. LLM generation of completions for each triple
  3. VERA scoring of generated triples
  4. Flagging of implausible triples (score < 0.5)
  5. Conceptualization and instantiation of flagged triples
  6. Knowledge editing with enriched knowledge
  7. Evaluation on downstream benchmarks
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using VERA vs human annotation: VERA is scalable but may have systematic biases; human annotation is more accurate but not scalable.
  - Conceptualization vs direct editing: Conceptualization improves generalizability but adds complexity and computational cost.
  - Choice of editing method: MEMIT and ROME modify internal parameters (risk of interference), GRACE uses adapters (additional inference overhead).
- Failure signatures:
  - VERA consistently misclassifies plausible knowledge as implausible or vice versa
  - Conceptualization produces overly abstract or invalid concepts
  - Instantiation generates nonsensical or irrelevant instances
  - Knowledge editing causes catastrophic forgetting or degrades performance on other tasks
  - Downstream benchmarks show no improvement or degradation after editing
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run VERA on a small sample of AbstractATOMIC triples and compare its scores to human judgments to validate the plausibility scoring mechanism.
  2. Test the conceptualization and instantiation pipeline on a few example triples to ensure it produces valid, enriched knowledge.
  3. Apply one editing method (e.g., MEMIT) to a small LLM with a few enriched triples and verify that the edits are successful using both VERA scoring and manual inspection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does CONCEPT EDIT handle knowledge drift when editing related commonsense knowledge iteratively?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that iterative updates risk knowledge drift where successive edits subtly conflict with or overwrite prior facts, and emphasize the need for robust frameworks to maintain consistency.
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses the problem but doesn't provide a concrete solution for preventing knowledge drift during iterative editing of related commonsense knowledge.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis showing how CONCEPT EDIT maintains consistency across multiple editing iterations, with specific metrics comparing knowledge stability before and after sequential edits.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can CONCEPT EDIT be effectively scaled to handle the full diversity of commonsense knowledge beyond the AbstractATOMIC and CANDLE datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that existing commonsense knowledge bases offer limited coverage and focus on isolated facts rather than forming hierarchical structures that enable generalization.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates effectiveness on two specific datasets but doesn't show whether the framework generalizes to the broader, more diverse landscape of commonsense knowledge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing consistent performance improvements across multiple diverse commonsense knowledge bases, with quantitative measures of coverage expansion.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does CONCEPT EDIT perform when editing commonsense knowledge that varies significantly across different cultural contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that the lack of stable ground truth for commonsense, which is often context-sensitive and culturally variable, complicates standardization.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't address how the framework handles cultural variations in commonsense knowledge or whether its automated verification system accounts for cultural differences.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-cultural evaluation showing how CONCEPT EDIT performs on commonsense knowledge from different cultural contexts, with metrics comparing performance across cultural groups.

## Limitations

- Heavy reliance on GPT-4o for conceptualization and instantiation introduces significant computational costs and API dependencies
- Performance is contingent on VERA's accuracy in identifying implausible knowledge, with limited evaluation of VERA's reliability across different commonsense knowledge types
- Limited comparative analysis across different LLM architectures and sizes, focusing primarily on specific benchmarks without extensive ablation studies

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The automated plausibility verification mechanism using VERA scores below 0.5 as implausible knowledge is well-supported by the methodology section and aligns with established practices in commonsense knowledge evaluation.
- **Medium confidence**: The conceptualization and instantiation pipeline's effectiveness in improving downstream performance is supported by experimental results, but the specific implementation details and potential failure modes are not fully elaborated.
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the approach across different types of commonsense knowledge and LLM architectures, as the paper focuses primarily on specific benchmarks and model sizes without extensive ablation studies.

## Next Checks

1. **VERA Validation Study**: Conduct a systematic evaluation of VERA's plausibility scoring accuracy by comparing its judgments against human annotations on a diverse sample of commonsense knowledge triples, particularly focusing on edge cases and context-dependent knowledge.
2. **Ablation Analysis**: Perform controlled experiments removing either the conceptualization or instantiation components to quantify their individual contributions to the framework's performance gains, and identify scenarios where each component adds the most value.
3. **Cross-Architecture Testing**: Apply CONCEPT EDIT to a broader range of LLM architectures (different sizes, training paradigms) to assess the framework's robustness and identify any architecture-specific limitations or optimizations needed.
