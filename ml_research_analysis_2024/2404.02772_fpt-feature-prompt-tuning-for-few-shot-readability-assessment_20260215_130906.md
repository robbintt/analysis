# FPT: Feature Prompt Tuning for Few-shot Readability Assessment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.02772
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02772
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes Feature Prompt Tuning (FPT) that significantly outperforms previous methods in few-shot readability assessment, achieving up to 43.19% accuracy improvement on Chinese data in 2-shot settings

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of readability assessment in few-shot learning settings by proposing a novel prompt-based tuning framework called Feature Prompt Tuning (FPT). The core method idea involves extracting linguistic features from text and embedding them into trainable soft prompts, while also devising a new loss function to calibrate the similarity ranking order between categories. Experimental results demonstrate that FPT significantly outperforms previous prompt-based tuning approaches and feature fusion methods, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 43.19% on Chinese data and 11.55% on English WeeBit data in the 2-shot setting. The proposed method also outperforms the large language model gpt-3.5-turbo-16k in most cases, establishing a new architecture for prompt tuning that effectively incorporates linguistic knowledge into readability assessment tasks.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes Feature Prompt Tuning (FPT), a novel approach that combines linguistic feature extraction with prompt tuning for few-shot readability assessment. The method extracts linguistic features from text and embeds them into trainable soft prompts, creating a framework that leverages both linguistic knowledge and the flexibility of prompt tuning. A key innovation is the introduction of a new loss function designed to calibrate the similarity ranking order between different readability categories. The approach is evaluated on both Chinese and English datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in few-shot scenarios.

## Key Results
- FPT achieves accuracy improvements of up to 43.19% on Chinese data and 11.55% on English WeeBit data in the 2-shot setting
- The proposed method outperforms previous prompt-based tuning approaches and feature fusion methods
- FPT demonstrates superior performance compared to gpt-3.5-turbo-16k in most evaluation cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper establishes that FPT's effectiveness stems from its novel integration of linguistic features with soft prompt tuning. By embedding extracted linguistic features into trainable prompts, the model can leverage domain-specific knowledge while maintaining the flexibility of prompt-based approaches. The calibration loss function plays a crucial role in ensuring proper ranking between readability categories, addressing a key challenge in few-shot settings where limited training data makes accurate category discrimination difficult.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Text -> Linguistic Feature Extractor -> Feature Embedding Layer -> Soft Prompt Generator -> Readability Classifier
Critical path: Input text flows through feature extraction, embedding, and prompt generation before classification
Design tradeoffs: Balances linguistic knowledge incorporation with prompt tuning flexibility
Failure signatures: Poor feature extraction or embedding could lead to degraded performance
First experiments: 1) Test feature extraction quality on diverse text samples, 2) Validate soft prompt generation with different embedding dimensions, 3) Evaluate calibration loss function stability across varying shot settings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential overfitting due to small dataset sizes in few-shot settings
- Heavy reliance on linguistic features that may not generalize across all text types
- Limited evaluation to Chinese and English datasets without broader multilingual validation

## Confidence
- Performance improvements (43.19% on Chinese, 11.55% on English): Medium
- Superiority over gpt-3.5-turbo-16k: Medium
- Architectural novelty of linguistic feature integration: High

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain evaluation by testing FPT on diverse text genres (technical, literary, conversational) to assess robustness beyond the current datasets
2. Perform ablation studies systematically removing linguistic features versus soft prompts to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains
3. Test the calibration loss function's sensitivity to hyperparameter settings across different few-shot scenarios to establish stability requirements
