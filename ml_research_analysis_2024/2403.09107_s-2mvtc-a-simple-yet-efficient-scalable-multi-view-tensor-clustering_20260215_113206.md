# S^2MVTC: a Simple yet Efficient Scalable Multi-View Tensor Clustering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.09107
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09107
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Novel tensor low-frequency approximation (TLFA) operator achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance on six large-scale datasets with improved runtime efficiency

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces S^2MVTC, a scalable multi-view clustering framework that directly learns inter- and intra-view embedding feature correlations through tensor operations. Unlike existing methods that focus on global correlations between anchor graphs or projection matrices, S^2MVTC constructs an embedding feature tensor and applies a novel TLFA operator to achieve smooth representations within views. The framework incorporates consensus constraints to ensure inter-view semantic consistency while maintaining computational efficiency for large-scale datasets.

## Method Summary
S^2MVTC operates by first constructing an embedding feature tensor from multiple views, then applying the TLFA operator to achieve smooth representation within each view. The method learns both inter-view and intra-view feature correlations simultaneously through tensor operations, avoiding the computational overhead of traditional graph-based or projection matrix approaches. Consensus constraints are imposed across views to ensure semantic consistency while maintaining the scalability advantages of the tensor formulation. The overall approach is designed to be both simple in implementation and efficient in execution.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods on six large-scale datasets
- Demonstrates superior clustering performance with significantly reduced CPU execution time
- Particularly effective for massive datasets, showing strong scalability characteristics
- Code is publicly available for reproducibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method's effectiveness stems from its direct tensor-based approach to learning feature correlations. By operating on embedding feature tensors rather than intermediate representations like anchor graphs, S^2MVTC captures both local smoothness within views (via TLFA) and global consensus across views more efficiently. The TLFA operator acts as a low-pass filter on the tensor representation, preserving essential structural information while removing noise and redundant details. This enables the model to focus on meaningful patterns across multiple views without getting bogged down in computational complexity.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Data -> Embedding Feature Construction -> TLFA Operator -> Consensus Constraints -> Clustering Output
- **Critical path**: Feature extraction → Tensor construction → TLFA smoothing → Multi-view fusion → Clustering assignment
- **Design tradeoffs**: Simplicity vs. flexibility - tensor approach is simpler but may be less adaptable to non-structured data
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance when views have high inconsistency, computational bottlenecks with extremely high-dimensional features
- **3 first experiments**: 
  1. Run on a single-view dataset to establish baseline performance
  2. Test with synthetic multi-view data where ground truth is known
  3. Compare TLFA smoothing against alternative regularization methods
