# A Survey on 3D Skeleton Based Person Re-Identification: Taxonomy, Advances, Challenges, and Interdisciplinary Prospects

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.15296
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15296
- Reference count: 21
- First comprehensive survey on 3D skeleton-based person re-identification (SRID), systematically reviewing existing approaches and identifying key challenges

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on 3D skeleton-based person re-identification (SRID), systematically reviewing existing approaches including hand-crafted methods, sequence learning models, and graph learning methods. The authors analyze the strengths and limitations of each approach while identifying key challenges such as data scarcity, model interpretability, and the need for more robust and generalizable solutions. The survey proposes potential solutions and highlights future research directions including multi-level skeleton sequence learning, data augmentation, and the development of prompt-based skeletal foundation models.

## Method Summary
The survey follows a systematic literature review approach, categorizing existing SRID methods into three main paradigms: hand-crafted feature extraction, sequence learning models, and graph learning methods. It identifies three key design principles for SRID models: intra-skeleton modeling (body structure and relations), inter-skeleton modeling (skeleton correlations and importance), and skeletal sequential modeling (pose dynamics and gait semantics). The paper discusses various technical components including data preprocessing, feature extraction techniques, and model architectures, while emphasizing the importance of multi-level skeleton sequence modeling and the potential of self-supervised learning tasks to enhance skeleton representation learning.

## Key Results
- 3D skeleton-based person re-identification offers a privacy-preserving alternative to appearance-based methods by exploiting body structure and motion patterns
- Graph learning methods provide better interpretability than sequence learning methods through explicit structural modeling
- Multi-level skeleton sequence modeling can capture richer discriminative features than single-level modeling approaches
- Self-supervised learning tasks leveraging motion continuity can enhance skeleton representation learning for SRID

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Multi-level skeleton sequence modeling captures richer discriminative features than single-level modeling
- **Mechanism**: Human body can be naturally modeled at different levels (joints, limbs, whole body). By exploiting different groups of joints to construct higher-level body representations and generalizing joint-level relation modeling to multi-level body representations, the model can mine richer structural features and motion patterns that single-level models miss
- **Core assumption**: Different levels of body representation contain complementary information that, when combined, provide more complete characterization of individual gait patterns
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "To address these challenges, more high-quality 3D skeleton data should be collected or generated. First, the number of different identities and the skeleton data size of each identity should be controlled within a reasonable range, e.g., enlarging the identity size to hundreds and keeping the total data size of each identity as similar as possible."
  - [abstract] "The survey identifies several challenges in SRID, including the scarcity and imbalance of SRID data, the need for more robust and generalizable models, and the lack of interpretability."
- **Break condition**: If multi-level modeling doesn't improve performance over single-level models on benchmark datasets, or if computational complexity becomes prohibitive without accuracy gains

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Self-supervised learning tasks enhance skeleton representation learning by exploiting motion continuity
- **Mechanism**: Motion continuity ensures skeletons in a small temporal interval will not undergo drastic changes, resulting in higher correlations among adjacent skeletons. Self-supervised tasks like skeleton sequence reconstruction, sorting, and prediction can exploit this property to learn skeleton correlations and motion consistency, helping the model focus on key motion context
- **Core assumption**: Adjacent skeletons in a sequence contain more relevant information for identity discrimination than distant skeletons
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "As one key of SRID learning is to capture motion patterns from 3D skeleton sequences, it is natural to consider their inherent property termed motion continuity [Rao et al., 2020]."
  - [section] "These tasks can help model better focus on key motion context and aggregate correlated features for SRID."
- **Break condition**: If self-supervised tasks don't improve generalization to unseen data or if they introduce noise that degrades performance

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Graph learning methods provide better interpretability than sequence learning methods through explicit structural modeling
- **Mechanism**: Graph learning methods explicitly model human body structure and relations based on constructed skeleton graphs, which can mine richer structural features and motion patterns than non-graph methods. They also offer more intuitive explanations through visualization of joint nodes and relations
- **Core assumption**: Explicit structural modeling provides clearer feature attribution than implicit learning in sequence models
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "In contrast to sequence learning methods that learn latent motion semantics, graph-based models can offer more intuitive explanations such as visualization of joint nodes and relations [Rao and Miao, 2023]."
  - [abstract] "Unlike conventional person re-ID methods that resort to appearance or facial characteristics [Ye et al., 2021], 3D Skeleton based person Re-ID (SRID) models typically exploit body-structure features and motion patterns (e.g., gait [Murray et al., 1964]) from 3D coordinates of key body joints to identify different persons."
- **Break condition**: If graph-based models show no improvement in interpretability metrics or if the added complexity outweighs interpretability benefits

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: 3D skeleton data representation and preprocessing
  - **Why needed here**: SRID models operate on 3D skeleton sequences, so understanding how skeletons are represented (joint coordinates, body topology) and preprocessed (normalization, noise filtering) is fundamental
  - **Quick check question**: How are 3D skeletons typically represented as input to SRID models, and what preprocessing steps are commonly applied?

- **Concept**: Gait analysis and human biomechanics
  - **Why needed here**: SRID relies heavily on gait patterns for person identification, so understanding basic gait attributes (stride length, gait cycle time, joint angles) and human body structure is crucial
  - **Quick check question**: What are the key gait attributes extracted from 3D skeletons that are used for person identification?

- **Concept**: Graph neural networks and attention mechanisms
  - **Why needed here**: Modern SRID methods use graph-based approaches with GAT and transformer architectures to model skeleton structure and relations
  - **Quick check question**: How do graph attention networks model the relationships between body joints in 3D skeleton data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Skeleton extraction → Preprocessing (normalization, noise filtering) → Feature extraction (hand-crafted OR learned) → Relation modeling (intra-skeleton → inter-skeleton) → Temporal modeling → Identity prediction

- **Critical path**: Skeleton preprocessing → Feature extraction → Relation modeling → Temporal modeling → Identity prediction

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Hand-crafted vs. learned features: Hand-crafted offers interpretability but may miss complex patterns; learned features capture more information but are less interpretable
  - Graph vs. sequence models: Graph models explicitly capture structure but require graph construction; sequence models are simpler but may miss structural relationships
  - Single-level vs. multi-level modeling: Multi-level captures richer features but increases complexity; single-level is simpler but may be less discriminative

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor performance on unseen datasets → indicates overfitting or lack of generalization
  - High sensitivity to initialization parameters → indicates model instability
  - Weak interpretability → indicates "black box" behavior that hinders debugging and trust

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement a baseline hand-crafted feature extractor using joint distances and angles, test on BIWI dataset with KNN classifier
  2. Implement a sequence learning model using LSTM on normalized skeleton sequences, compare performance with baseline
  3. Implement a graph-based model using GAT on skeleton graphs, evaluate improvement in feature interpretability through visualization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can SRID models be designed to capture multi-level skeleton sequence information, including both local and global features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for multi-level skeleton sequence modeling to capture valuable hierarchical skeleton information and improve SRID performance.
- Why unresolved: Most existing SRID models focus on a single level of skeleton information, and the effectiveness of multi-level modeling is still not well understood.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic evaluation of the impact of multi-level skeleton sequence modeling on SRID performance, and the development of effective multi-level modeling techniques.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can SRID models be made more interpretable and explainable, to increase their reliability and trustworthiness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies the lack of interpretability as a key challenge in SRID, and proposes solutions such as visualization and explanation mechanisms.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of these solutions in improving model interpretability is still not well understood, and there is a need for more research on human-friendly explanation techniques for SRID models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive evaluation of the impact of interpretability techniques on SRID model performance and user trust, and the development of effective explanation mechanisms for SRID models.

## Limitations

- The survey lacks implementation details for specific SRID methods, making direct replication challenging
- Evaluation protocols beyond basic Rank-1 accuracy and mAP are not clearly specified
- Limited empirical validation of proposed multi-level modeling approaches and their relative benefits

## Confidence

- **High**: The taxonomy organization and categorization of SRID methods (hand-crafted, sequence learning, graph learning) is well-supported by literature
- **Medium**: Claims about multi-level modeling benefits are theoretically sound but lack comprehensive empirical validation across diverse datasets
- **Low**: Proposed interpretability improvements through graph methods need more rigorous quantitative evaluation

## Next Checks

1. Implement and benchmark a baseline SRID system using simple hand-crafted features on BIWI dataset to establish performance floor
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing single-level vs. multi-level skeleton modeling on at least two different datasets
3. Design and execute interpretability experiments comparing visualization quality and feature attribution between graph-based and sequence-based SRID models
