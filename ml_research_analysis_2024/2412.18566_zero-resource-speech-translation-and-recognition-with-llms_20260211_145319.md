# Zero-resource Speech Translation and Recognition with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.18566
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18566
- Reference count: 32
- BLEU scores over 23 for previously unseen languages in CoVoST2

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to zero-resource speech translation and automatic speech recognition by leveraging a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM). The method adapts audio representations from a pre-trained multilingual speech encoder to the LLM's token embedding space using a lightweight CNN adapter. Experiments demonstrate promising results in both speech translation (ST) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks across languages without paired audio-text data, achieving BLEU scores over 23 for previously unseen languages and WER up to 28.2%.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a zero-resource speech translation and recognition framework that leverages a multilingual LLM by adapting audio representations from a pre-trained multilingual speech encoder. The adaptation is performed using a lightweight CNN adapter that bridges the audio and text embedding spaces. The method explores different training strategies including multi-task learning and sequential training to optimize performance in both ST and ASR tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieved BLEU scores over 23 in CoVoST2 for previously unseen languages
- Obtained word error rates (WER) up to 28.2% for ASR tasks
- Demonstrated that LLM's text generation capability significantly impacts ASR performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by effectively bridging the gap between audio and text representations through the lightweight CNN adapter. The multilingual speech encoder provides robust audio features, while the LLM offers strong language modeling capabilities. The adapter learns to map audio features into the LLM's token embedding space, enabling the model to leverage the LLM's language understanding for both translation and recognition tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multilingual speech encoder**: Pre-trained model that provides robust audio features across multiple languages - needed to handle diverse linguistic inputs
- **CNN adapter**: Lightweight module that bridges audio and text embedding spaces - needed to align different representation spaces
- **LLM token embedding space**: The target space where audio features are mapped for language understanding - needed for leveraging LLM capabilities
- **Zero-resource learning**: Training without paired audio-text data in target languages - needed for handling truly low-resource scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Multilingual Speech Encoder -> CNN Adapter -> LLM Token Embedding Space

**Critical Path**
Audio input → Multilingual speech encoder → CNN adapter → LLM token embedding space → Text generation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Lightweight adapter vs. full fine-tuning of LLM
- Multi-task vs. sequential training strategies
- Trade-off between model complexity and zero-resource capability

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor adaptation if CNN adapter cannot effectively bridge audio and text spaces
- Performance degradation if LLM lacks sufficient text generation capability in target language
- Suboptimal results if multilingual speech encoder fails to capture relevant audio features

**First Experiments**
1. Test adapter's ability to align audio and text representations
2. Evaluate LLM's text generation capability in target languages
3. Assess impact of different training strategies on performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions, particularly regarding the LLM's ability to generate text in the target language and its impact on ASR performance. The study also raises questions about the generalizability of the approach to broader language coverage and more diverse datasets.

## Limitations
- Limited scope to specific language pairs and datasets
- Impact of different training strategies not fully explored
- Reliance on LLM's text generation ability introduces uncertainty in ASR performance

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| BLEU scores over 23 for unseen languages | High |
