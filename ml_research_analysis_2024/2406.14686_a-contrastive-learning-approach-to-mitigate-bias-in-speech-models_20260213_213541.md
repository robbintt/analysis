# A Contrastive Learning Approach to Mitigate Bias in Speech Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.14686
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14686
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: CLUES reduces maximum negative subgroup performance divergence by 66.9% and improves overall F1 Macro by 6.1% on intent classification tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CLUES, a contrastive learning approach designed to mitigate bias in speech models by improving internal representations of underperforming subgroups. The method employs three-level contrastive learning - task, subgroup, and error levels - to guide models in learning better representations. Experiments on two intent classification datasets (FSC in English, ITALIC in Italian) demonstrate significant improvements in both subgroup fairness and overall model performance compared to baseline models.

## Method Summary
CLUES uses a three-level contrastive learning framework that operates on latent representations extracted from pre-trained speech models (wav2vec 2.0 or XLS-R). The method combines three contrastive loss terms: Lt groups samples by task/class, Ls groups samples by identified subgroups, and Le separates correctly from incorrectly classified samples within each subgroup. Subgroups are identified using K-Means clustering or DivExplorer, and the final loss combines classification loss with the three MS contrastive losses weighted by hyperparameters λt, λs, and λe.

## Key Results
- Reduces maximum negative subgroup performance divergence by 66.9% (15.5%) compared to baseline
- Improves overall F1 Macro score by 6.1% (4.8%) on FSC (ITALIC) datasets
- Enhances Silhouette scores for both intra-subgroup cohesion and inter-subgroup separation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CLUES improves subgroup fairness by refining latent space representations so samples from the same subgroup cluster tightly while separating from other subgroups.
- Mechanism: The Ls loss term explicitly pulls embeddings of the same subgroup closer and pushes embeddings of different subgroups apart.
- Core assumption: Subgroup-specific latent representations are key to reducing performance disparities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We employ a three-level learning technique that guides the model in focusing on different scopes for the contrastive loss, i.e., task, subgroup, and the errors within subgroups."
  - [section] "In particular, we choose as positive pairs points belonging to the same subgroup, and as negative pairs points belonging to different ones."
- Break condition: If subgroups are not well-defined, the Ls term may reinforce irrelevant or noisy clusters.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CLUES further reduces disparities by separating correctly and incorrectly classified samples within each subgroup.
- Mechanism: The Le loss term creates two partitions within each subgroup: one for correctly predicted samples and one for incorrectly predicted ones.
- Core assumption: Correctly and incorrectly classified samples have distinct latent representations that can be separated to improve overall accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A third loss term that correctly predicted operates within each subgroup, aggregating samples while setting apart incorrect ones."
  - [section] "Within each subgroup, we define as positive the pairs of samples that have obtained the same outcome, and as negative the ones with different outcomes."
- Break condition: If model confidence calibration is poor, Le might separate samples that should be close.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CLUES achieves better overall task performance by aligning task-level and subgroup-level representations.
- Mechanism: The Lt loss term groups samples by class while Ls groups them by subgroup. The combination ensures the model learns representations that are both task-relevant and subgroup-aware.
- Core assumption: Multi-task contrastive objectives (task and subgroup) reinforce each other rather than conflict.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These losses guide the model in learning representations that capture different scopes, i.e., tasks, subgroups, and errors within subgroups, resulting in more informative embeddings."
  - [section] "A first contrastive term that operates at the task level, grouping together samples sharing the same class and separating different classes."
- Break condition: If task and subgroup objectives conflict, the combined loss may lead to unstable training.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive Learning
  - Why needed here: Contrastive learning is used to pull together similar samples and push apart dissimilar ones, essential for learning meaningful subgroup-aware embeddings.
  - Quick check question: How does contrastive learning differ from supervised classification loss?

- Concept: Multi-Similarity (MS) Loss
  - Why needed here: MS loss allows selective contrast based on pair affinities, enabling fine-grained control over which samples are pulled together or pushed apart.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the parameters α, β, and λ in the MS loss?

- Concept: Subgroup Fairness
  - Why needed here: Ensuring balanced performance across subgroups is the core goal of CLUES, requiring understanding of how subgroup identification and mitigation work.
  - Quick check question: What metrics can be used to quantify subgroup performance disparity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: wav2vec 2.0/XLS-R -> Subgroup identification module -> Three contrastive loss modules -> Classification head
- Critical path: Subgroup identification → Contrastive loss computation → Backpropagation → Parameter update
- Design tradeoffs: Balance between subgroup cohesion (Ls) and error separation (Le) to avoid overfitting to subgroup noise
- Failure signatures: Overfitting to subgroup definitions, instability due to conflicting loss terms, poor generalization to unseen subgroups
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement Lt alone and measure impact on task accuracy
  2. Add Ls and measure subgroup cohesion (Silhouette score)
  3. Add Le and measure reduction in maximum subgroup divergence (∆max)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would CLUES perform on speech tasks beyond intent classification, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly mentions this as a limitation: "We presented experimental results only on intent classification. However, our methodology could be readily extended to other classification tasks. We additionally plan on extending CLUES to other supervised tasks, such as Automatic Speech Recognition."
- Why unresolved: The authors have not yet conducted experiments on ASR or other speech tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments applying CLUES to ASR and other speech tasks, then comparing results to baseline models and existing bias mitigation techniques in those domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is CLUES to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the coefficients λt, λs, and λe that regulate the relative importance of each loss term?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that "We identify the best values for these coefficients with a tuning phase using a validation set," but does not provide detailed analysis of sensitivity to these parameters.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss stability of CLUES performance across different hyperparameter settings or provide guidance on how to choose these parameters for new datasets or tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of CLUES performance to variations in λt, λs, and λe, and providing recommendations for selecting these parameters.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does CLUES compare to other bias mitigation techniques when applied to pre-trained models with different architectures or trained on different speech datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates CLUES on two specific pre-trained models and two datasets but does not compare its performance to other bias mitigation techniques across a broader range of models and datasets.
- Why unresolved: The generalizability of CLUES' effectiveness across different model architectures and speech datasets is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments applying CLUES to a variety of pre-trained speech models and diverse speech datasets, then comparing its performance to other bias mitigation techniques.

## Limitations
- Relies on heuristic subgroup identification methods without exploring sensitivity to hyperparameters
- Assumes subgroups are static and identifiable in training data, which may not hold for dynamic bias patterns
- Introduces significant computational overhead and hyperparameter tuning complexity

## Confidence
- High confidence: The theoretical foundation of contrastive learning for representation refinement is well-established in the literature
- Medium confidence: Empirical results showing 66.9% reduction in maximum subgroup divergence and 6.1% F1 Macro improvement are promising but require independent validation
- Low confidence: Claims about effectiveness for unseen subgroups during training are not directly tested

## Next Checks
1. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the number of subgroups (K in K-Means) and the minimum frequency threshold in DivExplorer to assess robustness
2. **Cross-domain generalization**: Apply CLUES to a third dataset from a different domain (e.g., medical speech or multilingual ASR) to evaluate whether performance improvements transfer
3. **Unseen subgroup performance**: Design experiments where the model encounters subgroups during testing that were not present or were poorly represented during training to assess the method's ability to generalize fairness improvements
