# Encoding Binary Events from Continuous Time Series in Rooted Trees using Contrastive Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.01242
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01242
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Proposed method infers network topology from leaf-level data with 75% top-1 accuracy using contrastive learning with parsimony scores

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of inferring network topology in Hybrid-Fiber Coaxial (HFC) broadband networks when only leaf-level continuous time series data is available. The authors propose a contrastive learning approach that encodes continuous time series into binary event sequences using a Siamese network with causal convolutional encoder. The parsimony score across multiple tree topologies serves as the contrastive loss, enabling topology inference without requiring exact network structure knowledge. Preliminary results on simulated data show promising performance, though event encoding accuracy remains a limitation.

## Method Summary
The method employs a Siamese network architecture where a causal convolutional encoder transforms continuous time series from network leaves into binary event sequences. Multiple tree topologies are generated as candidate networks, and the parsimony score is computed for each topology based on the encoded binary events. The contrastive loss minimizes the parsimony score for the true topology while maximizing differences with negative samples. This approach enables topology inference by ranking candidate trees according to their parsimony scores, with lower scores indicating better fits to the observed data patterns.

## Key Results
- True topology achieved the lowest parsimony score in 75% of cases
- Top three topologies included the true topology in 99.8% of cases
- Event detection accuracy averaged 60% with low variance
- Method shows promise for topology inference despite encoding challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages the principle that network events propagate through tree structures in predictable patterns. By encoding continuous time series into binary events and measuring parsimony across different topologies, the method identifies the most likely network structure. The contrastive learning framework effectively learns to distinguish the true topology from plausible alternatives by minimizing the parsimony score for correct structures while maximizing differences for incorrect ones.

## Foundational Learning

**Rooted Tree Networks**: Hierarchical structures with a single root node and directed edges toward leaves - needed for modeling HFC network topologies; quick check: verify tree properties (acyclic, connected, single root)

**Parsimony Score**: Measures the minimum number of evolutionary changes needed to explain observed data - used here to evaluate how well a topology explains the encoded events; quick check: confirm score decreases with better topology fit

**Contrastive Learning**: Training approach that learns by comparing similar and dissimilar examples - enables topology discrimination without labeled examples; quick check: verify loss function properly contrasts true vs. negative samples

**Siamese Networks**: Twin network architectures that share weights and learn similarity metrics - used here to encode time series consistently across different inputs; quick check: ensure weight sharing is properly implemented

**Causal Convolutional Encoder**: Neural network architecture that preserves temporal order and causality - chosen to maintain the sequential nature of time series data; quick check: verify no information leakage from future to past

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Continuous Time Series -> Causal CNN Encoder -> Binary Events -> Parsimony Score Calculator -> Contrastive Loss

Critical path: The encoder-decoder pipeline from raw time series through binary event encoding to parsimony-based topology ranking represents the core inference mechanism.

Design tradeoffs: Causal vs. non-causal encoding balances temporal integrity against lookahead capability; parsimony-based loss trades computational complexity for biological plausibility.

Failure signatures: Poor event encoding accuracy directly degrades topology inference; overly complex negative sampling may confuse the contrastive learning; insufficient training data limits topology coverage.

Three first experiments:
1. Test encoder performance on synthetic time series with known event patterns
2. Evaluate parsimony score sensitivity to different binary encoding thresholds
3. Compare contrastive learning convergence with supervised alternatives

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None specified in the provided materials.

## Limitations

- Event encoding accuracy remains limited at 60%, constraining overall performance
- Causal encoder's limited lookahead may miss important temporal dependencies
- Simulation setup with 4 internal nodes may not scale to larger, real-world networks

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The general framework of using contrastive learning with parsimony scores for topology inference is theoretically sound and aligns with established phylogenetic methods.

**Medium confidence**: The preliminary results demonstrating topology ranking performance are promising but based on limited simulation conditions that may not generalize.

**Low confidence**: The event encoding accuracy claims, given the acknowledged limitations of the causal encoder and the relatively low 60% detection rate.

## Next Checks

1. Implement and evaluate non-causal encoder architectures (e.g., bidirectional LSTMs or Transformers) to assess whether lookahead capability improves event detection accuracy and subsequently topology inference performance.

2. Test the method on real HFC network data with known topologies to validate performance in operational conditions, including various noise levels and traffic patterns.

3. Conduct scalability experiments with larger tree structures (e.g., 10+ internal nodes) and varying observation lengths to determine the method's practical limits and computational requirements.
