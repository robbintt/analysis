# Enhancing Presentation Slide Generation by LLMs with a Multi-Staged End-to-End Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.06556
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06556
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Multi-staged approach achieves 39.13% coverage vs 33.41-38.48% for baselines, with better human evaluation scores

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of automatically generating presentation slides from long documents containing multimodal elements. The proposed DocPres approach uses a multi-staged end-to-end model combining LLM and VLM to extract text and images, generate hierarchical summaries, create outlines, map slides to document sections, generate slide content, and select relevant images. Evaluated on research papers, DocPres outperforms direct LLM prompting approaches across automated metrics and human evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of breaking complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks with limited context.

## Method Summary
DocPres is a multi-staged end-to-end approach that extracts hierarchical text and images from documents, generates a bird's-eye view summary, creates presentation outlines, maps slides to specific document sections, generates slide content with context-limited prompting, and selects relevant images using CLIP embeddings. The approach decomposes the complex document-to-slides task into five hierarchical stages, each operating with limited context to avoid LLM performance degradation associated with long contexts. It combines GPT-3.5-turbo for text generation and CLIP for image selection, with evaluation using coverage, perplexity, LLM-Eval metrics, and human assessment across six criteria.

## Key Results
- DocPres achieves 39.13% coverage versus 33.41-38.48% for baseline methods
- Perplexity scores of 58.01 versus 77.38-133.51 for baselines
- Superior human evaluation scores across readability, consistency, coverage, diversity, flow, and usability criteria
- Multi-staged approach outperforms direct LLM prompting with various strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Breaking down the complex document-to-slides task into smaller sub-tasks with limited context improves LLM performance compared to direct long-context generation.
- **Mechanism**: The approach decomposes the task into five hierarchical stages: (1) extracting text and images, (2) generating a hierarchical summary (bird's-eye view), (3) creating an outline, (4) mapping slides to document sections, and (5) generating slide content. Each stage operates with limited context, avoiding the performance degradation associated with long contexts.
- **Core assumption**: LLMs perform better on smaller, focused tasks than on a single complex task with long context.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Our approach is better in terms of automated metrics and human evaluation" compared to applying LLMs directly with state-of-the-art prompting
  - [section]: "dividing a complex task into smaller sub-tasks and providing limited context for each sub-task helps to improve the overall performance of an LLM compared to solving the task directly with a very long context"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related papers mention LLM-based approaches but don't specifically compare multi-staged vs. direct approaches
- **Break condition**: If the performance gains disappear when using more capable LLMs with longer context windows, or if the overhead of managing multiple stages outweighs the benefits.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Grounding each slide to specific document sections reduces hallucinations and improves content reliability.
- **Mechanism**: Instead of generating slide content directly from the outline and entire document, the approach first maps each slide title to one or more document sections using the bird's-eye view. This grounding ensures that slide content is attributed to specific source material.
- **Core assumption**: LLMs are prone to hallucinations, especially with longer and incomplete context, and grounding reduces this tendency.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section]: "Grounding a slide to some specific parts of the document reduces hallucinations" and "Both VLMs and LLMs are prone to hallucinations and this tendency increases with the longer and incomplete context"
  - [abstract]: The approach uses a combination of LLM and VLM to address this research gap
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related papers don't explicitly discuss hallucination mitigation through grounding
- **Break condition**: If the mapping stage introduces significant errors or if the selected sections don't adequately represent the slide content, leading to incomplete or misleading presentations.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Using a hierarchical summary (bird's-eye view) as intermediate representation enables non-linear slide narratives that better match human-prepared presentations.
- **Mechanism**: The bird's-eye view summarizes the document hierarchically at section and subsection levels before generating the outline. This allows the outline generation to consider relationships between different parts of the document, enabling non-linear slide narratives.
- **Core assumption**: Good presentations often have non-linear narratives that don't strictly follow the document flow, and this requires understanding relationships between different document sections.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section]: "The flow of information in the presentation need not strictly follow the information flow in the given document. This non-linearity of the flow makes the generated presentation more similar to ones prepared by humans"
  - [abstract]: The approach addresses the limitation of existing methods that "only put a flat summary into the slides ignoring the importance of a good narrative"
  - [corpus]: Moderate evidence - related paper "Presentations are not always linear!" explicitly addresses non-linear narrative generation
- **Break condition**: If the hierarchical summarization loses critical information or if the non-linear narrative becomes confusing rather than helpful for the audience.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Context window limitations of LLMs
  - Why needed here: Understanding why long documents can't be processed directly by LLMs is fundamental to appreciating the need for the multi-staged approach
  - Quick check question: What happens to LLM performance when processing contexts longer than their specified window?

- **Concept**: Chain-of-thought prompting
  - Why needed here: The approach uses chain-of-thought prompting for outline generation and slide content creation, making it essential to understand how this technique guides LLMs through complex reasoning tasks
  - Quick check question: How does chain-of-thought prompting differ from direct prompting in terms of output quality for reasoning tasks?

- **Concept**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) and CLIP embeddings
  - Why needed here: The image selection mechanism relies on CLIP embeddings to match slide text with relevant images, requiring understanding of how VLMs encode visual and textual information in a common embedding space
  - Quick check question: What is the key advantage of using CLIP embeddings for matching text and images compared to separate text and image models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Document extraction module -> Bird's-eye view generator -> Outline generator -> Slide-to-section mapper -> Slide content generator -> Image selector -> Evaluation module

- **Critical path**: Document extraction → Bird's-eye view generation → Outline generation → Slide-to-section mapping → Slide content generation → Image selection

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - LLM choice: GPT-3.5-turbo selected for larger context length vs. potential cost/performance trade-offs with newer models
  - Image selection: CLIP-based matching vs. more sophisticated vision models that might better understand research paper figures
  - Context management: Hierarchical decomposition vs. potential information loss between stages

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor coverage scores indicate the bird's-eye view or mapping stages are missing important content
  - High perplexity suggests slide content generation quality issues
  - Low human evaluation scores across multiple criteria indicate fundamental architectural problems
  - Image selection failures manifest as irrelevant or missing images in slides

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test document extraction with various PDF formats to ensure consistent hierarchical output
  2. Validate bird's-eye view generation on documents of varying complexity and length
  3. Evaluate slide-to-section mapping accuracy using documents with clear vs. ambiguous section structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- [inferred] The paper focuses on academic documents and does not explore other types of documents.
- [inferred] The paper mentions the potential for reducing computational cost but does not provide a detailed analysis.
- [inferred] The paper states that the current method works on a single document and does not address scenarios requiring information from multiple sources.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to research papers from arXiv, raising questions about generalizability to other document types
- CLIP-based image selection may not perform well with non-photographic content common in research papers
- Comparison against direct LLM prompting baselines rather than alternative multi-staged approaches limits attribution of performance gains

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core claim that multi-staged approaches outperform direct long-context generation is supported by comprehensive automated and human evaluation metrics. The architectural design choices are well-justified and internally consistent.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim about hallucination reduction through grounding is plausible given the mechanism description, but the evidence is primarily theoretical rather than empirically demonstrated through targeted experiments.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that hierarchical summarization specifically enables better non-linear narratives is weakly supported, with only one related paper addressing non-linear presentation generation and limited empirical evidence comparing linear vs. non-linear outputs.

## Next Checks
1. Test DocPres on non-research document types (business reports, educational textbooks, news articles) to evaluate generalizability beyond arXiv papers. Measure whether coverage and quality metrics remain consistent across document domains.
2. Replace the CLIP-based image selector with alternative approaches (e.g., fine-tuned vision models, rule-based selection) and measure impact on presentation quality. This would validate whether image selection is a critical component or if simpler approaches suffice.
3. Systematically remove or modify each stage (bird's-eye view, mapping, context-limited generation) to quantify individual contributions to overall performance. This would reveal whether certain stages are essential or if performance gains come from specific architectural choices rather than the multi-staged approach overall.
