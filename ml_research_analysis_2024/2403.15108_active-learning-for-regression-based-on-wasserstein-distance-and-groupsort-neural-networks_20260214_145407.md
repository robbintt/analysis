# Active Learning for Regression based on Wasserstein distance and GroupSort Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.15108
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15108
- Authors: Benjamin Bobbia; Matthias Picard
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: WAR consistently outperforms classical and recent active learning strategies in regression tasks, achieving faster convergence and more precise estimations across five UCI datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces WAR (Wasserstein Active Regression), a novel active learning strategy for regression that combines distribution-matching using the Wasserstein distance with uncertainty-based sampling. The method leverages GroupSort Neural Networks to compute the Wasserstein distance, providing both theoretical foundations with explicit bounds for network size and depth and practical benefits for estimating 1-Lipschitz functions. WAR integrates representativity (via Wasserstein distance) and uncertainty (via disagreement sampling) to select the most informative data points for labeling. Empirical results demonstrate that WAR consistently outperforms classical and recent active learning strategies, achieving faster convergence and more precise estimations across five UCI datasets.

## Method Summary
WAR combines two complementary strategies: representativity and uncertainty. Representativity is achieved by selecting data points that minimize the Wasserstein distance between the joint distribution of labeled and unlabeled data and the marginal distribution of unlabeled data, ensuring the labeled set represents the full data distribution. Uncertainty is captured through disagreement sampling, where multiple models are trained on the labeled set and points with maximum prediction variance are selected. The Wasserstein distance computation is performed using GroupSort Neural Networks, which provide theoretical guarantees for 1-Lipschitz function estimation. The algorithm iteratively selects points that maximize both representativeness and uncertainty, updating the labeled set until convergence or a stopping criterion is met.

## Key Results
- WAR achieved the lowest RMSE in most cases across five UCI datasets compared to classical and recent active learning strategies
- The method demonstrated the best overall area under the learning curve, indicating faster convergence
- WAR's flexibility allows application with any Lipschitz continuous learner, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical benefits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of WAR stems from its dual approach to data selection. By minimizing the Wasserstein distance between distributions, it ensures that the labeled set is representative of the entire data distribution, preventing bias in the learning process. The uncertainty component, captured through disagreement sampling, focuses on points where the model is most uncertain, maximizing the information gained from each labeled point. This combination addresses both coverage of the input space and reduction of prediction uncertainty, leading to more efficient learning. The use of GroupSort Neural Networks provides theoretical foundations with explicit bounds for network size and depth, ensuring reliable estimation of 1-Lipschitz functions required for Wasserstein distance computation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Wasserstein Distance**: A metric for comparing probability distributions, used here to measure representativity between labeled and unlabeled data. Why needed: Provides a principled way to ensure the labeled set represents the full data distribution. Quick check: Verify that minimizing Wasserstein distance leads to better coverage of the input space.
- **GroupSort Neural Networks**: A type of neural network architecture that can estimate 1-Lipschitz functions with theoretical guarantees. Why needed: Enables reliable computation of Wasserstein distance with explicit bounds for network size and depth. Quick check: Confirm that the network can maintain the 1-Lipschitz property during training.
- **Disagreement Sampling**: An uncertainty sampling method where multiple models are trained and points with maximum prediction variance are selected. Why needed: Identifies regions of the input space where the model is most uncertain, maximizing information gain. Quick check: Validate that disagreement sampling consistently selects informative points across different datasets.
- **Active Learning**: A learning paradigm where the model can query for labels of the most informative data points. Why needed: Reduces the number of labeled examples required to achieve good performance. Quick check: Compare the number of labeled points needed to reach a target performance with and without active learning.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Data -> Wasserstein Distance Computation (GroupSort NN) -> Representativity Score -> Uncertainty Computation (Disagreement Sampling) -> Combined Score -> Data Point Selection -> Labeled Set Update
- **Critical Path**: The most critical component is the Wasserstein distance computation using GroupSort Neural Networks, as it directly affects the representativity of the selected data points and has theoretical implications for the method's performance.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The choice of GroupSort Neural Networks provides theoretical guarantees but may be computationally intensive compared to other architectures. The combination of representativity and uncertainty sampling balances exploration and exploitation but requires careful tuning of the weighting between the two components.
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may occur if the Wasserstein distance computation fails to accurately represent the data distribution, or if the uncertainty estimation is unreliable due to insufficient model diversity in disagreement sampling.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Validate the accuracy of Wasserstein distance computation using GroupSort networks on synthetic distributions. 2) Test the impact of different weighting schemes between representativity and uncertainty components. 3) Evaluate the method's performance on a simple regression task with known data distribution to verify theoretical guarantees.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The empirical evaluation relies on a limited set of five UCI datasets, which may not fully represent the diversity of real-world regression problems
- The reported superiority of WAR over other methods lacks statistical significance testing to quantify the robustness of these improvements
- The computational efficiency of the Wasserstein distance computation using GroupSort networks, particularly for high-dimensional data, is not thoroughly evaluated

## Confidence
- WAR consistently outperforms classical and recent active learning strategies: Medium
- The use of GroupSort Neural Networks provides both theoretical guarantees and practical benefits: Medium
- The flexibility claim of applying WAR with any Lipschitz continuous learner: Low (not empirically validated across different learner types)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance tests on the reported RMSE improvements across all datasets to quantify the robustness of WAR's superiority
2. Evaluate the method's performance on high-dimensional datasets and analyze the computational complexity scaling of the Wasserstein distance computation
3. Validate the flexibility claim by implementing WAR with multiple types of Lipschitz continuous learners beyond the ones used in the current study
