# An Empirical Categorization of Prompting Techniques for Large Language Models: A Practitioner's Guide

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2402.14837
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14837
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive framework for categorizing prompting techniques for conversational pre-trained large language models (LLMs) into seven distinct categories

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for categorizing prompting techniques for conversational pre-trained large language models (LLMs). The authors identify seven distinct categories of prompting techniques: Logical and Sequential Processing, Contextual Understanding and Memory, Specificity and Targeting, Meta-Cognition and Self-Reflection, Directional and Feedback, Multimodal and Cross-Disciplinary, and Creative and Generative. Each category includes various techniques with practical examples and references to relevant research. The framework aims to assist practitioners in understanding and selecting appropriate prompting strategies for their specific applications, facilitating a more effective utilization of LLMs across diverse domains. The authors emphasize the importance of proper prompt design in achieving successful LLM utilization and providing a structured approach to navigating the complex landscape of prompt engineering.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing literature on prompting techniques for LLMs and organizes them into a structured framework. The authors systematically reviewed various prompting strategies and grouped them into seven distinct categories based on their functional characteristics and applications. Each category is defined by its core purpose and includes specific techniques with practical examples. The framework was developed through comprehensive literature analysis rather than empirical testing, focusing on creating a taxonomy that practitioners can use to understand and select appropriate prompting strategies for their specific use cases.

## Key Results
- Seven distinct categories of prompting techniques identified: Logical and Sequential Processing, Contextual Understanding and Memory, Specificity and Targeting, Meta-Cognition and Self-Reflection, Directional and Feedback, Multimodal and Cross-Disciplinary, and Creative and Generative
- Each category contains multiple specific techniques with practical examples and research references
- Framework provides structured approach to navigating prompt engineering landscape for practitioners
- Emphasizes importance of proper prompt design for successful LLM utilization across diverse domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by organizing prompting techniques into functional categories based on their core purposes and applications. By providing a systematic taxonomy, it helps practitioners understand the relationships between different techniques and select appropriate strategies for specific tasks. The categorization is based on the fundamental ways humans interact with language models - through logical reasoning, contextual understanding, targeted instructions, self-reflection, directional guidance, multimodal inputs, and creative generation. This structured approach makes the complex landscape of prompt engineering more accessible and navigable for practitioners.

## Foundational Learning
- **Prompt engineering fundamentals**: Understanding basic prompt structure and its impact on LLM outputs (needed for effective technique selection; quick check: can you construct basic prompts with varying specificity)
- **LLM response patterns**: Knowledge of how different prompting approaches affect model behavior (needed for predicting technique effectiveness; quick check: can you explain why certain prompts yield better results)
- **Task-specific requirements**: Understanding the relationship between task goals and appropriate prompting strategies (needed for technique selection; quick check: can you match prompting categories to common LLM use cases)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Input -> Prompt Construction -> LLM Processing -> Output Generation -> Evaluation/Feedback

**Critical Path:** Prompt Design → Technique Selection → Application Context → Expected Output

**Design Tradeoffs:** Precision vs. creativity, specificity vs. flexibility, technical accuracy vs. natural language, computational efficiency vs. response quality

**Failure Signatures:** Vague or ineffective prompts, mismatched technique to task, overcomplicated instructions, lack of context or specificity

**First Experiments:**
1. Test basic prompt variations within a single category to understand technique impact
2. Compare techniques across different categories for the same task
3. Evaluate the effect of prompt specificity levels on output quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework has not been empirically validated through user studies or comparative analysis
- No testing of framework's practical utility in real-world applications
- Potential for additional categories or techniques not captured in current taxonomy

## Confidence
- Framework comprehensiveness: Medium
- Practical utility assessment: Medium
- Empirical validation: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with practitioners to evaluate the framework's usability and practical utility in real-world LLM applications
2. Perform empirical testing to validate whether the seven identified categories comprehensively cover the space of prompting techniques or if additional categories are needed
3. Design controlled experiments comparing the effectiveness of different prompting techniques within and across the identified categories for specific use cases
