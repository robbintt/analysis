# GPTSee: Enhancing Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection via Description-Based Similarity Features

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.01437
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01437
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: State-of-the-art performance on QVHighlights dataset with 62.84% R1@0.5 and 48.01% R1@0.7 for moment retrieval, 62.80% HIT@1 for highlight detection

## Executive Summary
GPTSee introduces a novel two-stage approach for video moment retrieval and highlight detection by leveraging large language models to generate detailed video descriptions and rewritten queries. The method computes semantic similarity scores and identifies span anchors as prior position information, which are then used in a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the QVHighlights dataset, significantly outperforming previous methods like Moment-DETR and UniVTG in both tasks.

## Method Summary
GPTSee operates through a two-stage process that integrates large language model-generated video descriptions with traditional transformer architectures. The first stage uses MiniGPT-4 to generate comprehensive video descriptions and rewrite input queries, creating enhanced textual representations of the visual content. These descriptions are then used to compute semantic similarity scores between video segments and queries, while also identifying span anchors that provide prior position information. The second stage employs a transformer encoder-decoder to process these enriched features for accurate moment localization and highlight detection.

## Key Results
- Achieves 62.84% R1@0.5 and 48.01% R1@0.7 for moment retrieval on QVHighlights dataset
- Achieves 62.80% HIT@1 for highlight detection on QVHighlights dataset
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods including Moment-DETR and UniVTG

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of GPTSee stems from its ability to leverage LLM-generated descriptions as rich semantic priors that capture fine-grained video content details often missed by traditional visual feature extraction methods. By computing similarity scores between these descriptions and rewritten queries, the model creates more informative representations that guide the transformer architecture toward accurate moment localization. The span anchor mechanism provides explicit temporal priors that help the model focus on relevant video segments, reducing the search space and improving precision.

## Foundational Learning

**Large Language Models for Video Understanding**
Why needed: LLMs can generate comprehensive, context-aware descriptions of video content that capture semantic relationships beyond simple visual features
Quick check: Compare LLM-generated descriptions against ground truth captions for coverage and detail

**Semantic Similarity Features**
Why needed: Traditional visual features may not capture nuanced relationships between video content and natural language queries
Quick check: Measure correlation between similarity scores and localization accuracy

**Span Anchor Mechanisms**
Why needed: Provides explicit temporal priors that reduce search space and improve localization precision
Quick check: Evaluate performance with and without anchor information

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
MiniGPT-4 -> Description Generator -> Similarity Feature Extractor -> Span Anchor Detector -> Transformer Encoder-Decoder -> Moment/Highlight Predictor

**Critical Path**
LLM-generated descriptions → Similarity features + span anchors → Transformer processing → Final prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**
The approach trades computational efficiency for accuracy by requiring LLM inference for each video, but gains significant performance improvements through richer semantic representations. The two-stage architecture allows for modular improvements but may introduce latency in real-time applications.

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor LLM descriptions leading to inaccurate similarity features
- Span anchors misaligned with actual relevant content
- Transformer failure to properly integrate multimodal features
- Performance degradation on videos with complex or ambiguous content

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Run GPTSee with only visual features (no LLM descriptions) to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate with and without span anchor features to measure their individual contribution
3. Test on longer-form videos to assess scalability and performance degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to QVHighlights dataset, which may not represent diverse real-world video retrieval scenarios or longer-form content
- Computational overhead of running LLM for each video not discussed, raising questions about practical deployment costs and latency
- No ablation studies isolating contributions of individual components, making it difficult to assess which elements drive performance gains

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| SOTA performance on QVHighlights | High |
| General effectiveness for moment retrieval and highlight detection | Medium |
| Computational efficiency and practical deployment | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate GPTSee on additional video retrieval datasets (e.g., ActivityNet Captions, DiDeMo) to assess generalization beyond QVHighlights
2. Conduct ablation studies removing LLM-generated descriptions and span anchor features to quantify their individual contributions to performance
3. Measure inference time and computational costs when running GPTSee end-to-end, comparing against baseline methods to assess practical deployment viability
