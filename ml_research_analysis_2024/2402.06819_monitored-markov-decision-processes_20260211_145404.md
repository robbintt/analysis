  a novel RL framework addressing the challenge of unobservable rewards in real-world
  scenarios. Unlike traditional MDPs, Mon-MDPs incorporate a separate monitor process
  that determines when rewards are observable, allowing agents to learn optimal policies

# Monitored Markov Decision Processes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.06819
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06819
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces Monitored Markov Decision Processes (Mon-MDPs) for handling unobservable rewards in RL

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Monitored Markov Decision Processes (Mon-MDPs), a novel RL framework addressing the challenge of unobservable rewards in real-world scenarios. Unlike traditional MDPs, Mon-MDPs incorporate a separate monitor process that determines when rewards are observable, allowing agents to learn optimal policies even when rewards are not always visible. The authors formalize Mon-MDPs theoretically, analyze their properties, and present empirical studies on toy environments demonstrating the challenges and potential solutions.

## Method Summary
The paper formalizes Mon-MDPs by introducing a monitor process that determines when rewards are observable. This framework extends traditional MDPs by separating the reward observability mechanism from the underlying environment dynamics. The authors analyze theoretical properties of Mon-MDPs, including conditions for convergence to optimal policies, and develop algorithms that can handle unobservable rewards effectively.

## Key Results
- Formalization of Mon-MDPs with separate monitor process for reward observability
- Identification of sufficient conditions for convergence to optimal policies under unobservable rewards
- Development of algorithms that effectively handle unobservable rewards in toy environments
- Demonstration of challenges and potential solutions for learning with imperfect reward observability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Mon-MDP framework works by explicitly modeling the reward observability mechanism as a separate process from the environment dynamics. This separation allows agents to reason about when they can trust observed rewards versus when they need to rely on other information. The monitor process acts as an intermediary that determines whether the agent receives reward feedback for each action, enabling learning even when rewards are not consistently observable.

## Foundational Learning
1. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) - Why needed: Provides the foundation for understanding traditional RL frameworks and how Mon-MDPs extend them
   - Quick check: Can explain state transitions, rewards, and policies in MDPs

2. Reward observability mechanisms - Why needed: Critical for understanding the core challenge Mon-MDPs address
   - Quick check: Can identify scenarios where rewards are partially or intermittently observable

3. Monitor process concept - Why needed: The key innovation that enables learning with unobservable rewards
   - Quick check: Can explain how a monitor process differs from environment dynamics

4. Convergence conditions in RL - Why needed: Understanding when and how RL algorithms can guarantee optimal behavior
   - Quick check: Can describe sufficient conditions for policy convergence

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Agent <-> Monitor Process <-> Environment

**Critical Path:**
1. Agent selects action in environment
2. Monitor process determines if reward is observable
3. Agent receives either reward feedback or null observation
4. Agent updates policy based on available information

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Complexity vs. expressiveness: More complex monitor processes can model realistic scenarios but may be harder to learn
- Observability frequency vs. learning efficiency: More frequent reward observations enable faster learning but may not reflect real-world constraints
- Monitor process knowledge: Known monitor processes simplify learning but limit applicability to scenarios with unknown observability mechanisms

**Failure Signatures:**
- Slow convergence or failure to converge when monitor process is highly stochastic
- Suboptimal policies when monitor process introduces significant bias in reward observations
- Computational inefficiency when monitor process requires complex inference

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement a simple Mon-MDP with a deterministic monitor process and compare learning performance against standard MDP approaches
2. Test Mon-MDP algorithms on environments with varying levels of reward observability to characterize the impact on learning efficiency
3. Evaluate the effect of monitor process complexity on algorithm performance and computational requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of empirical validation beyond toy environments, with no demonstration on complex, real-world tasks
- Assumption of known or learnable monitor process, without addressing scenarios with complex, dynamic, or adversarial observability mechanisms
- No discussion of computational complexity or sample efficiency of proposed algorithms for real-world deployment

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework development: High
- Convergence analysis: Medium
- Algorithm effectiveness in complex scenarios: Low
- Real-world applicability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate Mon-MDP algorithms on benchmark reinforcement learning environments (e.g., Atari, MuJoCo) with artificially introduced reward observability constraints to assess scalability and performance.

2. Develop and test algorithms for learning the monitor process itself in dynamic environments where the reward observability mechanism is unknown or changes over time.

3. Conduct a computational complexity analysis comparing Mon-MDP algorithms with standard RL approaches under various monitor process configurations to quantify the trade-offs in sample efficiency and runtime.
