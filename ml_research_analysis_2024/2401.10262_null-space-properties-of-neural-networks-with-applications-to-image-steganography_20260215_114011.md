# Null Space Properties of Neural Networks with Applications to Image Steganography

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.10262
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10262
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Neural networks have nontrivial null spaces that enable steganography where hidden images are classified while cover images remain visually dominant

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the null space properties of neural networks and demonstrates how they can be exploited for image steganography. The authors extend the concept of null space from linear to nonlinear maps and show that NNs have nontrivial null spaces determined by their architecture. They propose a method for hiding secret images within cover images such that the NN recognizes the hidden image while a human viewer sees only the cover image. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets show that stego images can be created which look like cover images to humans but are classified as hidden images by the network with high confidence (e.g., 99.9% accuracy on MNIST). The work reveals that NNs perceive images differently than humans and highlights potential reliability issues in NN-based image classification.

## Method Summary
The authors train neural networks on image datasets and compute the null space of their first layer weight matrix using SVD. They decompose cover and hidden images into orthogonal components relative to the null space, then combine the null space component of the cover image with the orthogonal complement of the hidden image to create stego images. These stego images appear visually similar to cover images to human observers but are classified as hidden images by the network. The method uses specific scaling factors to balance visual quality and classification confidence, and is demonstrated across multiple datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10.

## Key Results
- Successfully created stego images classified as hidden images (99.9% accuracy on MNIST) while appearing as cover images to humans
- Demonstrated that null space components of cover images can be combined with orthogonal complements of hidden images to achieve steganography
- Showed that neural networks perceive images differently than humans, relying on components orthogonal to the null space for classification
- Validated the method across multiple datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The null space of a neural network contains input components that do not affect its final prediction.
- Mechanism: For a nonlinear map f, the null space N(f) consists of vectors v such that f(x) = f(x + a·v) for all x and a ∈ R. In a neural network, this means certain input patterns can be modified without changing the network's output.
- Core assumption: The null space concept can be meaningfully extended from linear to nonlinear maps in a way that preserves the property of invariance under addition.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We extend the null space definition from linear to nonlinear maps and discuss the presence of a null space in neural networks."
  - [section]: "Definition 2.1 (Null space of a nonlinear map). The null space of a nonlinear map f : Rn → Rm, denoted as N(f), is the set of all vectors that by adding these vectors to any input, the image under the map, or output, will not change."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct mention of null space in related papers, though the concept appears in one paper discussing outlier detection through null space analysis.
- Break condition: If the network architecture changes in a way that eliminates the null space (e.g., through regularization or architectural constraints).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Image steganography can be achieved by combining cover and hidden images using the null space components.
- Mechanism: The method decomposes cover and hidden images into orthogonal components relative to the null space. The stego image combines the null space component of the cover image with the orthogonal complement of the hidden image, creating an image that looks like the cover but is classified as the hidden image by the network.
- Core assumption: The null space has sufficient dimensionality to capture visually significant components of the cover image while preserving the classification of the hidden image.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Through experiments on image datasets such as MNIST, we show that we can use null space components to force the neural network to choose a selected hidden image class, even though the overall image can be made to look like a completely different image."
  - [section]: "Given the cover image C and hidden image H, using the null space N(f), create a steganographic image S, which looks like the cover image C but has the same classification as the hidden image H."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence - related papers focus on different steganography methods not based on null space analysis.
- Break condition: If the null space dimension is too small to capture sufficient visual information from the cover image.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Neural networks perceive images differently than humans due to their reliance on null space components for classification.
- Mechanism: The network's decision boundary is based on components orthogonal to the null space, while human perception relies on the entire image including null space components. This creates a disconnect between what the network "sees" and what humans see.
- Core assumption: The network's classification decision is based solely on components orthogonal to the null space, while human perception integrates information from all components.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We conclude by showing comparisons between what a human viewer would see, and the part of the image that the neural network is actually using to make predictions and, hence, show that what the neural network 'sees' is completely different than what we would expect."
  - [section]: "After removing null space components, the remaining crucial parts for prediction have fewer visual patterns than their initial appearance."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence - related papers don't discuss perceptual differences between networks and humans.
- Break condition: If the network architecture or training procedure changes to make it more aligned with human perception.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Compute null space → Decompose cover and hidden images → Synthesize stego image → Verify classification

- Critical path: Compute null space → Decompose cover and hidden images → Synthesize stego image → Verify classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Null space dimension vs. steganographic quality: Larger null spaces provide better cover image preservation but may reduce security
  - Scaling factors: Balance between visual quality and classification confidence
  - Network architecture: Fully connected vs. convolutional networks have different null space properties

- Failure signatures:
  - Low confidence predictions on stego images
  - Visible artifacts in stego images
  - Classification of stego images as cover image class instead of hidden class

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compute null space of a simple fully connected network on MNIST and visualize its basis vectors
  2. Create stego images using a single pair of cover and hidden digits, varying the scaling factor
  3. Test stego images across multiple networks with different architectures to evaluate transferability

## Limitations
- The extension of null space concepts from linear to nonlinear maps lacks rigorous mathematical foundation
- The method's effectiveness may not generalize to more complex datasets or deeper network architectures
- Reliance on first-layer weight matrices may not capture the full complexity of network behavior across multiple layers

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The empirical demonstrations on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets showing successful steganography with high classification confidence (99.9% accuracy)
- **Medium confidence**: The theoretical extension of null space concepts to nonlinear maps and the claim that networks perceive images differently than humans
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of findings to more complex datasets (CIFAR-10) and deeper network architectures, as well as the robustness of the method against potential adversarial attacks

## Next Checks
1. **Null space dimension analysis**: Systematically vary network architecture parameters (width, depth) and measure how null space dimension changes, then correlate with steganographic quality metrics across multiple image datasets.

2. **Multi-layer null space computation**: Extend the null space analysis beyond first-layer weights to capture null spaces at multiple network depths, then evaluate whether this improves steganographic performance or reveals new insights about network perception.

3. **Adversarial robustness testing**: Generate stego images using the null space method and systematically apply adversarial attack techniques to determine whether the steganographic protection degrades under attack, comparing against baseline steganography methods.
