# Introducing Adaptive Continuous Adversarial Training (ACAT) to Enhance ML Robustness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.10461
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10461
- Authors: Mohamed elShehaby; Aditya Kotha; Ashraf Matrawy
- Reference count: 28
- One-line primary result: ACAT improves SPAM filter robustness against adversarial attacks, increasing accuracy from 69% to 88% after three retraining sessions while reducing prediction time by up to four times.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Adaptive Continuous Adversarial Training (ACAT), a method designed to enhance the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks, particularly in cybersecurity contexts where labeled training data is scarce. ACAT operates by continuously integrating real-world detected adversarial samples into the model during ongoing learning sessions, using elastic weight consolidation (EWC) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The approach was evaluated on a SPAM detection task, demonstrating significant improvements in both model accuracy and prediction efficiency compared to conventional methods.

## Method Summary
ACAT integrates adversarial sample detection and continuous retraining into a single pipeline. It continuously captures adversarial samples detected in real-world scenarios and incorporates them into the model's training process. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, ACAT employs EWC, which uses Fisher Information matrices to penalize changes to important model weights. The method was evaluated on the Enron SPAM Corpus, using TextFooler adversarial samples generated via the TextAttack library. The evaluation focused on improving the accuracy of an attacked SPAM filter and reducing prediction time compared to a two-model approach.

## Key Results
- Adversarial detector achieved an F1-score of 0.96 on a balanced dataset of normal and adversarial samples.
- After three retraining sessions, the accuracy of the attacked SPAM filter increased from 69% to 88%.
- ACAT was up to four times faster at decision time compared to a conventional two-model approach when handling 10,000 samples.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ACAT reduces prediction time by integrating adversarial detection and continuous retraining into a single pipeline.
- Mechanism: By capturing adversarial samples offline during continuous training, ACAT eliminates the need for separate feature-map-based adversarial detection during inference, avoiding the doubled inference time of conventional two-model approaches.
- Core assumption: Adversarial sample detection can be performed offline without affecting real-time classification latency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ACAT reduces the time required for adversarial sample detection compared to traditional processes."
  - [section] "The discrepancy arises because capturing adversarial samples in ACAT occurs offline, while the alternative approach requires the use of feature maps during online inference, effectively doubling the inference time."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: no direct citation of timing studies in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If real-time adversarial sample detection is required, offline capture is infeasible and prediction time benefit disappears.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: EWC prevents catastrophic forgetting while allowing adaptation to new adversarial examples.
- Mechanism: EWC computes Fisher Information matrices to penalize changes to important weights, balancing retention of original task knowledge with integration of new adversarial samples during retraining.
- Core assumption: The Fisher Information matrices accurately capture parameter importance for both original and new tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Our Adaptive Continuous Adversarial Training (ACAT) approach utilizes EWC [8] as a strategic method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting."
  - [section] "EWC entirely avoids catastrophic forgetting and exhibits lower performance variability across epochs compared to fine-tuning."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: neighbor papers do not cite EWC for adversarial robustness specifically.
- Break condition: If the Fisher matrices are poorly estimated, weight penalties fail and forgetting recurs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Balanced training data between normal/adversarial and spam/ham samples improves adversarial detector generalization.
- Mechanism: Oversampling the minority class ensures equal representation, reducing bias toward the majority class and improving F1-score.
- Core assumption: Equal class distribution during training leads to balanced precision and recall in detection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To ensure that we maintained the balanced distribution of SPAM and ham labels within our dataset, we employed oversampling of the minority class with replacement."
  - [section] "This model showed an accuracy of 96.44% on the 20% test split of the 1264 samples."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; neighbor papers do not discuss class balancing for adversarial detection.
- Break condition: If oversampling introduces overfitting on synthetic samples, detector performance degrades on real adversarial examples.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial training and its role in improving model robustness.
  - Why needed here: ACAT relies on augmenting training data with adversarial examples to defend against evasion attacks.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between feature-space and problem-space adversarial attacks?

- Concept: Catastrophic forgetting in neural networks and mitigation techniques.
  - Why needed here: Continuous learning without forgetting is essential for ACAT's long-term effectiveness.
  - Quick check question: How does EWC's penalty term differ from simple weight regularization?

- Concept: Fisher Information matrices and their use in parameter importance estimation.
  - Why needed here: EWC uses Fisher matrices to identify which weights to protect during retraining.
  - Quick check question: What is the computational cost of computing Fisher matrices for large models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-processing -> GloVe embeddings -> Hybrid Bi-LSTM -> Adversarial detector (feature maps) -> Continuous retraining (EWC)
- Critical path:
  1. Incoming email → pre-processing → vectorization → Bi-LSTM prediction
  2. Parallel: adversarial detector extracts feature maps → labels as normal/adversarial
  3. Offline: detected adversarial samples fed to retraining module
  4. Retraining updates model weights while preserving prior knowledge
- Design tradeoffs:
  - EWC vs fine-tuning: EWC automates forgetting mitigation but adds Fisher computation overhead; fine-tuning is simpler but risks forgetting.
  - Balanced vs imbalanced datasets: Balanced improves fairness but may require synthetic oversampling.
  - Real-time vs offline adversarial detection: Real-time reduces prediction latency but increases computational load.
- Failure signatures:
  - Degraded spam accuracy over time → catastrophic forgetting not fully mitigated
  - High false-positive rate on adversarial detection → imbalanced training data or weak feature-map extraction
  - Prediction latency spike → offline adversarial capture skipped, feature maps computed online
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Train Bi-LSTM on Enron SPAM, evaluate on unperturbed test set.
  2. Adversarial detection: Generate TextFooler samples, train detector, evaluate F1-score.
  3. ACAT integration: Run 3 retraining cycles with EWC, measure spam accuracy recovery and prediction latency vs conventional approach.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does ACAT's performance scale with increasingly complex and diverse adversarial attacks beyond the TextFooler method?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates ACAT using TextFooler adversarial samples but does not explore other attack methods or more sophisticated attack strategies.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation is limited to a single adversarial attack method, which may not represent the full spectrum of potential attacks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing ACAT against multiple adversarial attack methods (e.g., FGSM, DeepFool, GAN-based attacks) and measuring performance degradation or improvement would provide insight into its robustness against diverse attack strategies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the long-term impact of ACAT on model performance when facing continuous and evolving adversarial threats over extended periods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates short-term improvements after three retraining sessions but does not investigate the sustainability of these improvements over longer periods or with evolving attack patterns.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on immediate gains rather than the model's adaptability and performance stability over time with ongoing adversarial activity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking model performance and adaptation over months or years, with varying frequencies and intensities of adversarial attacks, would reveal the long-term effectiveness of ACAT.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does ACAT handle the trade-off between maintaining accuracy on legitimate data and improving robustness against adversarial attacks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper shows improvements in adversarial robustness, it does not explicitly address potential trade-offs or impacts on the model's performance with legitimate, non-adversarial data.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation focuses on adversarial detection and robustness without a detailed analysis of the model's performance on clean data, which is crucial for real-world applicability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of model accuracy on legitimate data before and after ACAT implementation, along with user studies to assess the practical impact on legitimate email filtering, would clarify this trade-off.

## Limitations
- Scalability to large models: The computational cost of computing Fisher Information matrices for deep networks is not quantified.
- Offline adversarial capture assumption: ACAT's prediction-time speedup relies on capturing adversarial samples offline, which may not always be feasible.
- Generalizability beyond text: All experiments focus on spam detection, and effectiveness for other cybersecurity tasks remains untested.

## Confidence
- High confidence: EWC mitigates catastrophic forgetting in continuous learning.
- Medium confidence: ACAT improves SPAM filter accuracy under attack (reproducible on Enron dataset, but results specific to this task).
- Low confidence: ACAT is up to four times faster at decision time (claim depends on ideal offline capture conditions not always met in practice).

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark Fisher matrix computation time on models of increasing depth to quantify scalability limits for ACAT.
2. Test ACAT with real-time adversarial detection enabled to measure the actual prediction-time overhead versus the claimed speedup.
3. Evaluate ACAT on a non-text cybersecurity task (e.g., image-based malware detection) to assess cross-domain robustness.
