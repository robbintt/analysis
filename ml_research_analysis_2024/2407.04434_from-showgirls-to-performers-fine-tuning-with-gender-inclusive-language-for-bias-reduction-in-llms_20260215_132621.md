- This paper addresses gender bias in LLMs, focusing on gender-exclusive affixes in English. The authors extract 692 gender-exclusive terms and their gender-neutral alternatives from a training corpus, then develop a fine-tuning dataset by replacing these terms and gendered pronouns with gender-neutral equivalents. They fine-tune three LLMs using this dataset and observe a reduction in gender stereotyping and harmful language generation.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method to reduce gender bias in large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning with gender-inclusive language, specifically targeting gender-exclusive affixes in English. The authors extract 692 gender-exclusive terms and their gender-neutral alternatives from the OpenWebText2 corpus, creating a fine-tuning dataset by replacing these terms and gendered pronouns with gender-neutral equivalents. They fine-tune three LLMs (GPT-2, RoBERTa-large, PHI-1.5) for one and three epochs, observing a reduction in gender stereotyping and harmful language generation as measured by CrowS-Pairs, RedditBias, and HONEST metrics.

## Method Summary
The authors address gender bias in LLMs by extracting gender-exclusive terms from a large English corpus and creating a fine-tuning dataset with gender-neutral alternatives. They compile a list of 692 gender-exclusive terms and their gender-neutral replacements, then replace these terms and gendered pronouns in the original corpus. Three pre-trained LLMs (GPT-2, RoBERTa-large, PHI-1.5) are fine-tuned using this gender-inclusive dataset for one and three epochs. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated using bias detection metrics including CrowS-Pairs, RedditBias, and HONEST to measure reduction in gender stereotyping and harmful language generation.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning with gender-inclusive language reduces gender stereotyping and harmful language generation in LLMs
- The approach shows promise in mitigating gender bias, though optimal results depend on model architecture and fine-tuning settings
- The authors contribute a publicly available catalogue of 692 gendered terms and their neutral replacements for future research on gender bias in NLP

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exposing language models to balanced gender representations during fine-tuning, which helps correct the bias learned from training data that often contains gender stereotypes. By systematically replacing gender-exclusive terms and pronouns with gender-neutral alternatives, the models learn to generate text without relying on gender-biased patterns. This targeted approach addresses a specific aspect of gender bias (gender-exclusive affixes) while maintaining grammatical correctness and natural language flow.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gender-exclusive affixes**: Suffixes and prefixes that indicate gender in words (-man, -woman, -boy, -girl, etc.). Understanding these is essential for identifying gender-biased language patterns in text corpora.
- **Fine-tuning procedure**: The process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task using task-specific data. Critical for understanding how the gender-inclusive dataset modifies the model's behavior.
- **Bias detection metrics**: CrowS-Pairs, RedditBias, and HONEST are datasets designed to measure different aspects of social bias in language models. Knowing how these metrics work is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of bias reduction techniques.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Corpus extraction -> Gender-neutral term compilation -> Dataset creation -> Fine-tuning -> Evaluation

**Critical Path:** The method relies on the quality of the extracted gender-exclusive terms and their neutral replacements, as errors in this initial step will propagate through the fine-tuning and evaluation phases.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach focuses specifically on gender-exclusive affixes, which may not capture all forms of gender bias but allows for targeted and measurable intervention. This narrow focus enables clear evaluation but may miss other gender bias manifestations.

**Failure Signatures:** Overfitting during fine-tuning (indicated by training loss continuing to decrease while validation metrics plateau or worsen) suggests the model is memorizing the fine-tuning data rather than generalizing gender-inclusive patterns.

**First Experiments:**
1. Fine-tune a small pre-trained model (e.g., DistilBERT) with a subset of the gender-inclusive dataset to verify the basic methodology works before scaling to larger models.
2. Compare bias reduction across different fine-tuning epochs (1 vs 3) on a single model to establish optimal training duration.
3. Test the approach on a non-English corpus to evaluate cross-linguistic applicability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study focuses narrowly on English gender-exclusive affixes without addressing broader gender bias manifestations or non-binary gender identities
- Fine-tuning procedure lacks critical implementation details including exact hyperparameters, creating uncertainty about reproducibility
- Evaluation relies solely on three bias detection datasets, which may not capture all forms of gender stereotyping that emerge in real-world applications

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core methodology of extracting gender-exclusive terms and creating a fine-tuning dataset is clearly specified and reproducible.

**Medium confidence**: The observed reduction in bias metrics across multiple evaluation datasets suggests the approach is effective, though the magnitude of improvement varies by model architecture.

**Low confidence**: Claims about optimal fine-tuning settings and the general applicability of the approach to other bias types remain speculative due to limited experimental scope.

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce the fine-tuning experiments with detailed hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, optimizer settings) to establish the sensitivity of bias reduction to these parameters.
2. Evaluate the fine-tuned models on additional bias detection benchmarks and human-annotated samples to verify that improvements generalize beyond the specific metrics used.
3. Test the approach on non-English corpora and with gender-neutral terms beyond the affix-based approach to assess broader applicability.
