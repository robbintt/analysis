core_contribution: This paper proposes CoSaRef, a MIDI-to-audio synthesis method that
  operates without MIDI-audio paired datasets. CoSaRef first generates synthetic audio
  via concatenative synthesis based on MIDI input, then refines it using a diffusion-based
  deep generative model trained on audio-only datasets.

# Annotation-Free MIDI-to-Audio Synthesis via Concatenative Synthesis and Generative Refinement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.16785
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16785
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: CoSaRef outperforms timbre-controllable MIDI-supervised methods on both objective (FAD-MERT-4: 4.35 vs 6.73) and subjective evaluations while operating without paired MIDI-audio datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CoSaRef, an innovative approach to MIDI-to-audio synthesis that eliminates the need for paired MIDI-audio training data. The method combines concatenative synthesis with diffusion-based refinement, enabling high-quality audio generation with fine-grained timbre control through sample selection. By training only on audio datasets, CoSaRef achieves superior performance compared to supervised approaches while maintaining the ability to manipulate timbre characteristics directly.

## Method Summary
CoSaRef operates in two stages: first, it generates synthetic audio using concatenative synthesis based on MIDI input by selecting and combining audio samples; second, it refines this output using a diffusion-based deep generative model trained solely on audio-only datasets. This architecture enables timbre control through strategic sample selection while the generative model enhances audio quality and expression diversity. The approach is trained without any MIDI-audio pairs, distinguishing it from conventional supervised methods.

## Key Results
- CoSaRef achieves FAD-MERT-4 score of 4.35, significantly outperforming the baseline timbre-controllable method (6.73)
- The method generates realistic tracks while preserving fine-grained timbre control via one-shot samples
- Objective and subjective evaluations confirm superiority over state-of-the-art MIDI-supervised approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CoSaRef leverages the complementary strengths of concatenative synthesis and diffusion models. Concatenative synthesis provides controllable timbre characteristics through direct sample selection, while the diffusion refinement stage enhances audio quality, adds expressive variations, and smooths transitions between concatenated segments. This two-stage approach allows the system to benefit from audio-only training data while maintaining MIDI-driven control, effectively bypassing the data scarcity problem that limits supervised approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Concatenative Synthesis**: Technique that builds audio by stitching together segments from existing recordings; needed for controllable timbre generation from limited samples; quick check: verify sample selection aligns with target MIDI notes
- **Diffusion Models**: Generative models that denoise corrupted data through iterative steps; needed to enhance audio quality and add realistic expression; quick check: monitor denoising process for artifacts
- **MIDI-to-Audio Mapping**: Process of translating musical scores to audio waveforms; needed as the core task but handled implicitly through synthesis-refinement pipeline; quick check: validate MIDI note timing accuracy in output
- **One-shot Learning**: Learning from single examples; needed for timbre control without paired datasets; quick check: test timbre consistency across different MIDI inputs
- **Timbre Control**: Ability to manipulate sound characteristics; needed for expressive musical generation; quick check: conduct ABX tests for timbre similarity

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
MIDI Input -> Concatenative Synthesis -> Diffusion Refinement -> Audio Output

Critical Path:
The most critical path is MIDI Input -> Concatenative Synthesis -> Diffusion Refinement, where the quality of initial synthesis directly impacts the refinement stage's effectiveness. Poor sample selection or concatenation can introduce artifacts that the diffusion model cannot fully correct.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Sample Quality vs. Control: Higher-quality source samples enable better synthesis but may limit timbre variety
- Refinement Strength: Stronger diffusion refinement improves audio quality but may reduce adherence to original timbre characteristics
- Computational Cost: The two-stage approach increases inference time compared to direct generation methods

Failure Signatures:
- Noticeable discontinuities between concatenated segments indicate poor sample selection or alignment
- Loss of original timbre characteristics suggests over-aggressive diffusion refinement
- Timing inaccuracies in the output signal problems in the initial synthesis stage

First Experiments:
1. Test timbre preservation by comparing source samples with final outputs using timbre similarity metrics
2. Evaluate synthesis quality by comparing concatenative-only output with refined output
3. Measure timing accuracy by comparing MIDI note onsets with corresponding audio events

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation across diverse musical styles beyond the URMP dataset, raising questions about generalization to jazz, rock, and electronic genres
- Potential dependency on high-quality source samples, with unclear impact when suitable samples are unavailable for certain timbres
- Comparison with only one other timbre-controllable method, limiting confidence in superiority claims across all contexts

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core methodology (concatenative synthesis + diffusion refinement) is technically sound and well-implemented
- Medium confidence: The objective metrics and subjective evaluations show meaningful improvements over the baseline
- Low confidence: Claims about superiority across all musical contexts and the practical usability with limited sample libraries

## Next Checks
1. Test CoSaRef on multiple datasets representing different musical genres (jazz, rock, electronic) to verify generalization claims
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the diffusion refinement stage to quantify its specific contribution to output quality
3. Evaluate performance when using lower-quality or mismatched source samples to understand practical limitations
