# MDNF: Multi-Diffusion-Nets for Neural Fields on Meshes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.03034
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03034
- Authors: Avigail Cohen Rimon; Tal Shnitzer; Mirela Ben Chen
- Reference count: 9
- Key outcome: Multi-resolution architecture achieves 1% flipped faces for UV mapping vs 12-16% for baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MDNF (Multi-Diffusion-Nets), a novel architecture for learning neural fields on triangle meshes that combines spatial decomposition through DiffusionNet with frequency decomposition via Fourier feature mappings. The key innovation is associating finer spatial resolutions with higher frequency bands, mimicking wavelet decomposition, which allows the network to learn complex signals while being robust to discontinuities and exponential scale variations. The method outperforms both single-resolution DiffusionNet and the Neural Fourier Filter Bank (NFFB) in learning synthetic RGB functions, UV texture coordinates with discontinuities and scale variations, and vertex normals across multiple mesh resolutions.

## Method Summary
The MDNF architecture uses N DiffusionNet components at different spatial resolutions, where each component processes a specific frequency band via Fourier feature mapping. Finer resolution components handle higher frequencies while coarser ones handle lower frequencies. The architecture processes Fourier-transformed features through a sine-activated MLP where each layer receives the output from the previous layer (representing lower frequencies) and adds higher-frequency components, creating a hierarchical signal composition that mirrors wavelet filter banks. A final MLP with ReLU activation aggregates the intermediate outputs.

## Key Results
- UV coordinate learning achieves flipped face percentages of 1% (N-Level model) vs 12-16% (other methods)
- Superior performance on synthetic RGB functions and vertex normal learning across multiple mesh resolutions
- Enhanced texture generation model produces meshes with finer geometric resolution and better detail preservation
- Robust to discontinuities and exponential scale variations in the target signals

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The multi-resolution architecture learns complex neural fields more effectively by associating finer spatial resolutions with higher frequency bands.
- Mechanism: The architecture uses multiple DiffusionNet components at different spatial resolutions, where each component processes a specific frequency band via Fourier feature mapping. Finer resolution components handle higher frequencies while coarser ones handle lower frequencies, mimicking wavelet decomposition.
- Core assumption: Spectral bias in MLPs can be mitigated by decomposing the signal into spatial and frequency domains simultaneously, with appropriate frequency-range assignments per resolution level.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "decomposes the spatial and frequency domains by associating finer spatial resolution levels with higher frequency bands, while coarser resolutions are mapped to lower frequencies"
  - [section]: "We associate finer spatial resolution levels with higher frequency bands, while coarser resolutions are mapped to lower frequencies"
- Break condition: If the spectral bias cannot be sufficiently mitigated through this decomposition, or if the frequency ranges assigned to each resolution level overlap significantly, the model may fail to learn high-frequency components effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The wavelet-inspired composition using sine-activated MLP enables sequential accumulation of higher-frequency signals on top of lower-frequency ones.
- Mechanism: The architecture processes Fourier-transformed features through a sine-activated MLP where each layer receives the output from the previous layer (representing lower frequencies) and adds higher-frequency components. This creates a hierarchical signal composition that mirrors wavelet filter banks.
- Core assumption: Sequential accumulation of frequency components through sine activation can effectively build complex signals by layering higher frequencies on top of lower ones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The final signal is composed in a wavelet-inspired manner using a sine-activated MLP, aggregating higher-frequency signals on top of lower-frequency ones"
  - [section]: "The core idea is to utilize multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to implement a low-pass filter by leveraging their inherent frequency bias, and to employ grid features at varying spatial resolutions alongside Fourier feature mappings at different scales to create a high-pass filter"
- Break condition: If the sine activation fails to properly capture the frequency relationships or if the sequential composition becomes unstable, the model may not effectively learn the hierarchical frequency structure.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Geometry-aware spatial decomposition through DiffusionNet components provides superior mesh signal learning compared to grid-based approaches.
- Mechanism: Instead of adapting Euclidean grid-based methods to meshes through data modification, the architecture uses DiffusionNet components that inherently respect mesh geometry through learned diffusion operations based on the heat equation and spectral methods.
- Core assumption: Mesh-specific operations that respect the manifold structure are more effective than grid-based approaches adapted to meshes, especially for capturing high-fidelity signals.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Unlike NFFB [WJY23], our architecture replaces each hash grid with a DiffusionNet component. As discussed in Section 2.1, DiffusionNet utilizes diffusion layers to facilitate spatial communication and optimizes diffusion support for each feature channel"
  - [section]: "The choice of adopting the DiffusionNet architecture is based on two main reasons. The first stems from its inherent compatibility with irregular data structures, specifically triangle meshes, as opposed to hash grid structures suited for regular formats like images"
- Break condition: If the mesh geometry does not significantly impact the signal learning task, or if the diffusion operations become computationally prohibitive for very large meshes, this advantage may diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spectral bias in neural networks
  - Why needed here: Understanding why standard MLPs struggle with high-frequency components is crucial for appreciating why the multi-resolution, multi-frequency decomposition approach is necessary
  - Quick check question: Why do standard MLPs tend to learn low-frequency functions first and struggle with high-frequency details?

- Concept: Fourier feature mapping
  - Why needed here: The Fourier feature mapping transforms input coordinates into a higher-dimensional space that makes learning high-frequency components more tractable
  - Quick check question: How does multiplying input coordinates by random Gaussian matrices help neural networks learn high-frequency functions?

- Concept: Wavelet decomposition
  - Why needed here: The architecture's approach of decomposing signals across both spatial and frequency domains follows wavelet decomposition principles, which is key to understanding its design
  - Quick check question: How does wavelet decomposition help in representing signals at multiple resolutions simultaneously?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input coordinates → DiffusionNet components → Fourier feature mapping → Sine-activated MLP (sequential composition) → Final MLP → Output
- Critical path: The sequential composition through sine-activated MLP that aggregates higher-frequency signals on top of lower-frequency ones
- Design tradeoffs: Using multiple DiffusionNet components increases model capacity and complexity but provides better mesh geometry awareness; the Fourier feature mapping adds computational overhead but enables better frequency representation; the sine activation allows higher frequency learning but may require careful initialization.
- Failure signatures: Poor high-frequency detail capture (blurry outputs), spectral artifacts in UV mapping, excessive computational cost, or instability in the sequential composition of frequency bands.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test on synthetic RGB functions with known frequency content to verify the multi-resolution decomposition works as expected
  2. Validate UV coordinate learning on meshes with known discontinuities to test robustness to non-continuous signals
  3. Evaluate vertex normal learning across multiple mesh resolutions to test generalization capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of MDNF vary with different numbers of resolution levels (N) for different types of neural fields and mesh complexities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "N determined empirically for each experiment" and mentions "all models were trained using a supervised approach" with N adjusted per experiment
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares against N=1 (One-Level) and higher N values without systematically exploring the optimal N for different scenarios or analyzing the trade-off between performance gains and computational cost
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying N across different neural field types (RGB, UV coordinates, normals) and mesh complexities, with analysis of performance gains vs. computational overhead

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can MDNF be effectively adapted for unsupervised learning scenarios beyond the supervised experiments presented?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions in Section 3 that "the experiments in Section 4 employ supervised learning" and in Section 5 adopts an unsupervised configuration from [MBOL*22] but only for the illustrative application
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on supervised learning but acknowledges unsupervised potential, yet doesn't explore this direction systematically or evaluate MDNF's performance in unsupervised settings
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying MDNF to unsupervised tasks like mesh reconstruction from images or unsupervised texture generation, with comparisons to existing unsupervised methods

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does MDNF perform on real-world scanned meshes with noise and irregularities compared to synthetic or clean meshes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates MDNF on synthetic RGB functions, UV coordinates from parameterized meshes, and vertex normals, but doesn't test on real-world scanned data which would have noise and irregularities
- Why unresolved: The evaluation focuses on controlled scenarios and clean meshes, leaving uncertainty about MDNF's robustness to real-world data imperfections that are common in practical applications
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing MDNF on scanned meshes from real-world datasets (e.g., human scans, architectural models) with noise, missing data, and irregularities, comparing performance against other methods on the same challenging data

## Limitations

- The approach requires multiple DiffusionNet components, increasing model complexity and computational cost
- The frequency band assignments follow a fixed exponential scaling strategy that may not be optimal for all signal types
- The method's performance on very large meshes or meshes with extreme aspect ratios is not thoroughly evaluated

## Confidence

- High confidence: Core architectural innovation and its effectiveness for UV coordinate learning and RGB function approximation on synthetic data
- Medium confidence: Generalization claims, particularly the vertex normal learning across multiple mesh resolutions
- Medium confidence: Practical utility claims, as the texture generation enhancement results are shown on a limited set of examples

## Next Checks

1. Test the architecture on meshes with varying topological complexity (genus > 0) to verify robustness beyond the presented examples
2. Conduct ablation studies on the frequency band assignment strategy, comparing exponential scaling against learned or adaptive frequency decompositions
3. Measure and report the computational overhead (training/inference time, memory usage) relative to single-resolution DiffusionNet baselines across different mesh sizes
