# HTN-Based Tutors: A New Intelligent Tutoring Framework Based on Hierarchical Task Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.14716
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14716
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: HTN-based tutors enable adaptive scaffolding and better capture the compositional nature of skills through hierarchical knowledge organization

## Executive Summary
HTN-based tutors introduce a novel intelligent tutoring framework that leverages Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) to create adaptive educational systems. By representing expert knowledge hierarchically, these tutors can dynamically adjust instructional granularity based on student skill levels while capturing the compositional nature of problem-solving skills. The framework demonstrates how HTN methods can encode multiple problem-solving strategies, enabling strategy recognition and targeted feedback. An example implementation for logarithmic expression reduction shows the potential for more personalized and effective tutoring compared to traditional rule-based systems.

## Method Summary
The HTN-based tutoring framework implements a cognitive model using HTN structures consisting of operators, methods, and axioms. The system traces student actions through the HTN decomposition to infer mental operations and provide feedback. Knowledge tracing estimates student proficiency in each skill component, which drives adaptive granularity decisions in the interface presentation. The framework supports multiple problem-solving strategies by encoding them as different methods within the HTN structure. The implementation involves creating an expert model of the domain, developing a model tracing engine, and integrating knowledge tracing for skill assessment.

## Key Results
- HTN-based tutors enable dynamic adjustment of instructional granularity based on student skill levels
- The compositional HTN structure aligns well with the hierarchical nature of skills in complex domains
- Strategy recognition and feedback are possible through direct encoding of problem-solving approaches in HTN methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** HTN-based tutors adapt scaffolding granularity dynamically based on student skill level, reducing cognitive load for novices and increasing challenge for advanced learners.
- **Mechanism:** The HTN model encodes knowledge hierarchically, with higher-level tasks representing less granular, more abstract steps and lower-level tasks representing finer-grained steps. The system uses knowledge tracing to estimate student skill levels and selects task decompositions accordingly, adjusting the interface granularity.
- **Core assumption:** Knowledge tracing accurately estimates student proficiency in each skill component, and the HTN structure correctly maps these skill levels to appropriate scaffolding levels.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** HTN-based tutors provide more realistic skill modeling by capturing the compositional and hierarchical nature of skills.
- **Mechanism:** Skills are organized hierarchically in the HTN structure, where higher-level skills are built from lower-level ones. This compositional representation mirrors how skills actually develop and relate to each other, unlike rule-based systems that treat skills as independent production rules.
- **Core assumption:** Skills in complex domains like mathematics are inherently compositional and hierarchical, not independent discrete units.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** HTN-based tutors enable strategy recognition and feedback by encoding problem-solving strategies directly in the method structure.
- **Mechanism:** Since different methods in the HTN can represent different problem-solving strategies for the same task, the system can identify which strategy a student is using based on their observed actions and provide targeted feedback on strategic choices.
- **Core assumption:** Students benefit from metacognitive feedback on their problem-solving strategies, and the HTN methods accurately represent the range of valid strategies for each task.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs)
  - **Why needed here:** HTNs provide the fundamental structure that enables adaptive scaffolding and compositional skill modeling in the tutoring framework.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the three main components of an HTN and how do they differ in terms of task primitiveness?

- **Concept:** Knowledge Tracing
  - **Why needed here:** Knowledge tracing estimates student proficiency levels in each skill component, which drives the adaptive granularity decisions in the HTN-based tutor.
  - **Quick check question:** How does knowledge tracing typically update its estimates of student skill mastery over time?

- **Concept:** Model Tracing
  - **Why needed here:** Model tracing maps student actions to the HTN structure to infer their mental operations and provide appropriate feedback.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens during model tracing when a student action doesn't match any expected decomposition path in the HTN?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** State (working memory) -> Model Tracing (HTN decomposition) -> Knowledge Tracing (skill estimation) -> Interface Generator (adaptive granularity) -> Student
- **Critical path:** Student action → Model tracing (decompose current task, match action to expected effects) → Update state → Re-estimate skill levels (knowledge tracing) → Generate next interface (adaptive granularity) → Present to student
- **Design tradeoffs:** The HTN approach trades implementation complexity for more expressive knowledge representation and adaptive capabilities. Compared to rule-based systems, HTNs require more sophisticated model tracing but enable strategy recognition and compositional skill modeling.
- **Failure signatures:** If model tracing gets stuck in infinite backtracking, it likely indicates a mismatch between expected and actual student actions or an incomplete HTN specification. If adaptive granularity doesn't change appropriately, the knowledge tracing estimates may be incorrect or the mapping between skill levels and granularity thresholds needs adjustment.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement a simple HTN-based tutor for a basic arithmetic problem and verify that model tracing correctly follows student actions through the task hierarchy.
  2. Add knowledge tracing and test that the interface granularity adapts based on simulated student skill levels.
  3. Encode multiple strategies for a task and verify that the system can distinguish between them based on student action patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does adaptive scaffolding through dynamic granularity adjustment improve student learning outcomes compared to static scaffolding?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors propose comparing HTN-based tutors with adaptive granularity to traditional tutors with static granularity through controlled experiments
  - **Why unresolved:** This question is planned for future research but has not been empirically tested yet
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results comparing learning gains (pre- and post-test scores) between students using adaptive granularity tutors versus static granularity tutors

- **Open Question 2:** What is the optimal strategy for adaptive granularity adjustment - U-shaped curve or sigmoid curve?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors plan to test two different granularity adjustment strategies: U-shaped (starting large, decreasing, then increasing) versus sigmoid curve (starting small and increasing)
  - **Why unresolved:** The optimal pattern for granularity adjustment has not been determined through experimentation
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results comparing learning outcomes between the two granularity adjustment strategies

- **Open Question 3:** How effectively can HTN-based tutors recognize and provide feedback on different problem-solving strategies employed by students?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that "due to strategy being encoded directly in HTN methods, our model tracing system can identify the approach taken by students and provide feedback on their strategic choices"
  - **Why unresolved:** While the capability is proposed, the effectiveness and impact of strategy-based feedback has not been evaluated
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies measuring the impact of strategy recognition and feedback on student learning outcomes and metacognitive awareness

## Limitations

- Framework effectiveness heavily depends on the quality of HTN design - poorly constructed HTNs may lead to ineffective or counterproductive scaffolding
- Knowledge tracing accuracy directly impacts adaptive granularity decisions, and current knowledge tracing methods have known limitations in estimating student skill mastery
- The framework requires significant domain expertise to construct appropriate HTNs, limiting scalability to new domains without substantial expert involvement

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The core claim that HTN-based tutors enable adaptive scaffolding through hierarchical knowledge organization is well-supported by the described mechanism and has strong theoretical grounding in both HTN theory and intelligent tutoring research.
- **Medium confidence:** The claim about HTN-based tutors providing more realistic skill modeling through compositional representation is plausible but requires empirical validation to confirm that this representation actually improves learning outcomes compared to traditional approaches.
- **Medium confidence:** The strategy recognition capability depends on the completeness of HTN method encodings and the reliability of action-to-strategy mapping, which may vary significantly across domains.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing learning outcomes between HTN-based tutors with adaptive scaffolding versus traditional tutors with static scaffolding across multiple mathematical domains.
2. Perform a systematic analysis of knowledge tracing accuracy in the HTN context, measuring how well skill estimates predict student performance on subsequent problems.
3. Implement a domain-independent HTN construction tool and evaluate its effectiveness in enabling non-experts to create functional tutoring systems for novel domains.
