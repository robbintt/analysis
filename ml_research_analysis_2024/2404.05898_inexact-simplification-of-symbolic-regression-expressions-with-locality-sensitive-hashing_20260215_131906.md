# Inexact Simplification of Symbolic Regression Expressions with Locality-sensitive Hashing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.05898
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05898
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: LSH-based simplification improves convergence, reduces model complexity by up to 111%, and achieves equal or better error minimization in symbolic regression

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to simplifying symbolic regression expressions using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). The method dynamically builds and applies simplification rules during the evolutionary process, hashing expression subtrees based on their predictions to efficiently retrieve similar structures and replace them with smaller equivalents. The approach addresses the problem of bloat and complexity in symbolic regression models, which can hinder search and reduce interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate that the LSH-based simplification method significantly improves convergence and reduces model complexity while maintaining or improving error minimization compared to methods without simplification.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to simplify symbolic regression expressions during the evolutionary process. The technique hashes expression subtrees based on their predictions, allowing for efficient retrieval of similar structures. When similar subtrees are identified, they can be replaced with smaller equivalent expressions, effectively reducing model complexity. This dynamic approach to simplification is integrated directly into the evolutionary algorithm, enabling the learning of both general and dataset-specific simplification rules. The LSH-based method targets the reduction of nonlinear function usage and overall model complexity, which are key factors in improving interpretability and computational efficiency in symbolic regression.

## Key Results
- Model complexity reduction of up to 111% in complexity metrics compared to methods without simplification
- Improved convergence of the evolutionary algorithm during symbolic regression
- Equal or better error minimization compared to baseline methods without simplification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LSH-based simplification method works by leveraging the principle of locality-sensitive hashing to group similar expression subtrees based on their predictions. This approach allows for efficient identification of equivalent or near-equivalent subtrees, which can then be replaced with simpler alternatives. By hashing subtrees based on their output values rather than their exact structure, the method can identify simplifications that might be missed by traditional symbolic simplification techniques. This inexact matching is particularly useful in symbolic regression, where small differences in expression structure can lead to similar predictions. The dynamic nature of the simplification process, integrated into the evolutionary algorithm, allows for the continuous refinement of simplification rules as the search progresses, potentially leading to more effective simplifications that are tailored to the specific problem domain.

## Foundational Learning
- **Symbolic Regression**: A machine learning technique that searches for mathematical expressions to fit data. Understanding this is crucial as the paper focuses on simplifying expressions generated by this process.
- **Locality-sensitive Hashing (LSH)**: A technique for grouping similar items together. Essential for grasping how the method efficiently identifies similar expression subtrees.
- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolution. Important for understanding the context in which the simplification technique is applied.
- **Tree-based Expression Representations**: Mathematical expressions represented as tree structures. Key for visualizing how subtrees are hashed and compared.
- **Expression Complexity Metrics**: Quantitative measures of expression complexity. Necessary for interpreting the results and improvements claimed by the method.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Symbolic Regression Expression -> LSH-based Simplification Module -> Simplified Expression
Critical path: During each evolutionary step, expressions are generated -> subtrees are hashed using LSH -> similar subtrees are identified and replaced with simpler equivalents -> simplified expressions are used for further evolution
Design tradeoffs: The method trades off exactness in simplification for efficiency and the ability to learn dataset-specific rules. This inexact approach allows for more flexible and potentially more effective simplifications.
Failure signatures: The method may fail to identify certain simplifications due to hash collisions or limitations in the LSH function. It may also introduce errors if the simplified expressions are not truly equivalent to the originals.
First experiments:
1. Implement the LSH-based simplification module and test it on a small set of known simplifications to verify basic functionality
2. Integrate the simplification module into a basic symbolic regression algorithm and compare results on a simple benchmark problem
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of different LSH parameters on simplification effectiveness and computational overhead

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The experimental validation is limited to a specific benchmark dataset, raising concerns about generalizability across different problem domains
- The computational overhead introduced by the LSH-based simplification process during the evolutionary algorithm is not quantified
