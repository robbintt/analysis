# Task and Explanation Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.01732
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01732
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: TENet achieves reasonable accuracy in both classification and explanation generation, with overall accuracy values ranging from 0.575 to 0.591.

## Executive Summary
The paper proposes a framework for explainable AI by integrating task completion with explanation generation. TENet uses a single backbone model with two heads: one for classification and another for generating explanatory words. The model is trained on COCO dataset using image captions as explanations, employing "weight overloading" where network weights are shared between task and explanation components. Experimental results demonstrate that a single integrated network can provide both task outputs and explanatory terms, showing the feasibility of coupling tasks with explanations in AI systems.

## Method Summary
TENet is a two-headed network architecture that shares a common backbone feature extractor for both task and explanation components. The model uses binary cross-entropy loss for both classification (91 object classes) and explanation (1000 most frequent caption words) heads, with total loss being the sum of both. The architecture employs "weight overloading" where the backbone parameters are shared, and only the final linear layers differ between the two heads. Training uses standard backpropagation with dual losses computed simultaneously.

## Key Results
- TENet achieves overall accuracy values ranging from 0.575 to 0.591
- Model demonstrates reasonable performance in both classification and explanation generation tasks
- Shared backbone approach (weight overloading) proves feasible for coupling task completion with explanation generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TENet uses "weight overloading" to share backbone parameters between task and explanation heads.
- Mechanism: The same backbone feature extractor computes both the classification output and the explanation word predictions. Only the final linear layers differ, allowing the network to learn joint representations.
- Core assumption: Shared feature extraction is sufficient for both object detection and caption word generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We use a common backbone model for both task and explanation... We only replace the final model layer with two heads"
  - [section] "Essentially, we are enacting what might be referred to as 'weight overloading', where the network's weights (except for the final layer) must double for both task completion and explanatory rendition."
- Break condition: If task and explanation require fundamentally different feature abstractions, the shared backbone will be suboptimal for at least one objective.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Training with dual losses encourages coherent outputs across both modalities.
- Mechanism: The total loss is the sum of binary cross-entropy losses for both heads. Backpropagation updates weights to minimize both simultaneously, creating a coupling between task and explanation.
- Core assumption: The two tasks are compatible enough that joint training improves or at least doesn't harm performance significantly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Once the model is defined as in Listing 1, standard backpropagation training is applied, with the only difference being the computation of two losses instead of one"
  - [section] "For both losses we used binary cross entropy. The sum of the two losses serves as the total loss for the backpropagation phase."
- Break condition: If the two losses are conflicting, joint training could degrade overall performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using captions as explanations provides natural mapping between visual content and explanatory text.
- Mechanism: COCO captions are processed into a vocabulary of frequent words. The explanation head predicts these words, offering a simple but interpretable form of explanation.
- Core assumption: Frequent caption words are meaningful explanations for the image content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The captions serve as our explanatory vehicle, providing insight into what the network is 'seeing'."
  - [section] "We generate a custom COCO dataset... where the ground-truth (multi-label) outputs comprise: i) 91 one-hot-encoded classes, and ii) VOCAB SIZE one-hot-encoded word labels."
- Break condition: If captions are too generic or don't align with actual visual content, the explanations will be uninformative or misleading.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-label classification accuracy metrics
  - Why needed here: The paper defines task accuracy as the fraction of correct top-K class predictions, which is critical for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: How would you compute accuracy if TOP C=5 and the ground truth contains 3 classes?

- Concept: Vocabulary filtering and frequency thresholds
  - Why needed here: The explanation pipeline filters captions to a 1000-word vocabulary based on frequency and length, directly affecting the model's explanatory capacity.
  - Quick check question: Why exclude words that appear only once or are shorter than 3 characters?

- Concept: Backbone model selection and transfer learning
  - Why needed here: TENet uses pretrained backbones (ResNet50, RegNet Y 400MF) to extract features, a common deep learning practice.
  - Quick check question: What advantage does using a pretrained backbone provide over training from scratch?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input image tensor (3x400x400) -> Backbone feature extractor (ResNet50/RegNet) -> Task head (91 class logits) and Explanation head (1000 word logits) -> Outputs: class predictions and word predictions

- Critical path:
  1. Forward pass through backbone
  2. Compute task head logits and apply sigmoid
  3. Compute explanation head logits and apply sigmoid
  4. Rank and select top-K classes and words
  5. Compute binary cross-entropy losses for both heads
  6. Backpropagate sum of losses

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Shared vs. separate backbones: Weight overloading saves parameters but may limit specialization
  - Binary vs. multi-class loss: Binary cross-entropy allows multiple labels but may be less discriminative
  - Vocabulary size: Larger vocab increases expressiveness but also noise and computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Low task accuracy but high explanation accuracy: Backbone may be biased toward textual features
  - High task accuracy but low explanation accuracy: Explanation head may not be learning effectively
  - Both accuracies low: Possible optimization issues, poor hyperparameter choices, or incompatible tasks

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train TENet with only classification loss to establish baseline
  2. Train TENet with only explanation loss to see if the backbone can learn explanatory features
  3. Train full TENet and compare joint vs. individual task performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- What is the optimal vocabulary size (VOCAB_SIZE) for the TENet model to balance between comprehensive explanations and computational efficiency?
- How does the TENet model perform on other datasets beyond COCO, and what are the implications for its generalizability?
- How does the TENet's weight overloading approach compare to other multimodal XAI frameworks in terms of performance and interpretability?

## Limitations
- Simplified explanation mechanism relying on word frequency rather than semantic coherence
- No ablation study comparing weight overloading against separate specialized networks
- Evaluation focuses on accuracy metrics rather than explanation quality measures like coherence or relevance

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in core claims due to clear methodology but limited evaluation scope

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing weight overloading against separate task and explanation networks
2. Implement human evaluation studies to assess whether generated word lists constitute meaningful explanations
3. Test the framework on additional datasets (e.g., Visual Genome, Flickr30k) to evaluate generalizability
