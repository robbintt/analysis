# Linguistically Communicating Uncertainty in Patient-Facing Risk Prediction Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.17511
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17511
- Reference count: 13
- This paper identifies challenges in communicating uncertainty to patients in risk prediction models, distinguishing between model performance, confidence, reasoning, and unknown knowns.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of communicating uncertainty in patient-facing risk prediction models, with a focus on IVF outcome prediction. The authors identify four distinct types of uncertainty - model performance, confidence, reasoning, and unknown knowns - that need to be effectively communicated to patients. They propose a design framework for improving understandability through natural language explanations that aim to balance technical accuracy with patient comprehension.

The research emphasizes the importance of addressing patient-specific concerns beyond standard model features and highlights the need for better integration of external medical knowledge to address gaps in understanding. The proposed approach aims to improve patient trust and expectation management in AI-driven healthcare applications by providing clear, linguistically accessible explanations of model predictions and their associated uncertainties.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a framework for communicating uncertainty in patient-facing risk prediction models through natural language explanations. The approach focuses on IVF outcome prediction as a case study, identifying four types of uncertainty that need to be addressed: model performance, confidence, reasoning, and unknown knowns. The design emphasizes creating linguistically accessible explanations that combine precision and confidence metrics while considering patient-specific concerns. The framework aims to balance technical accuracy with patient comprehension through carefully crafted textual explanations.

## Key Results
- Identified four distinct types of uncertainty in patient-facing risk prediction models: model performance, confidence, reasoning, and unknown knowns
- Proposed natural language explanations as a design approach for improving patient understandability of model predictions
- Highlighted the need for addressing patient-specific concerns beyond standard model features in uncertainty communication

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging natural language processing to translate complex model uncertainties into accessible explanations for patients. By distinguishing between different types of uncertainty and addressing them through targeted explanations, the framework aims to improve patient understanding and trust in AI-driven healthcare predictions. The focus on IVF outcomes provides a concrete context where uncertainty communication is particularly critical for patient decision-making.

## Foundational Learning
- Uncertainty types (model performance, confidence, reasoning, unknown knowns) - needed to identify what aspects of model uncertainty need communication; quick check: can you map each type to specific IVF prediction scenarios?
- Natural language explanations - needed to make technical model information accessible to patients; quick check: can you identify key linguistic features that improve patient comprehension?
- Patient-specific concerns - needed to ensure explanations address individual patient needs beyond standard features; quick check: can you list three patient-specific factors relevant to IVF prediction?
- External medical knowledge integration - needed to address unknown knowns and knowledge gaps; quick check: can you identify two types of external medical data that could enhance IVF predictions?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Patient Input -> Risk Prediction Model -> Uncertainty Analysis -> Natural Language Explanation Generator -> Patient Output
Critical path: Risk Prediction Model -> Uncertainty Analysis -> Natural Language Explanation Generator
Design tradeoffs: Precision vs. explainability, model complexity vs. interpretability, technical accuracy vs. patient comprehension
Failure signatures: Misinterpretation of uncertainty types, overly technical explanations, omission of patient-specific concerns
First experiments:
1. Test explanation effectiveness with IVF patients using comprehension surveys
2. Compare performance of interpretable vs. black-box models in IVF prediction
3. Evaluate integration of external medical knowledge sources

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How effective are textual explanations in improving patient understanding and trust in IVF outcome predictions?
- What is the optimal balance between model performance and explainability in patient-facing applications?
- How can unknown knowns (gaps in medical knowledge) be effectively communicated to patients through model features?

## Limitations
- Challenge of addressing unknown knowns - gaps in medical knowledge that cannot be easily communicated through model features
- Uncertainty about the effectiveness of natural language explanations for improving patient understanding
- Difficulty in balancing model performance with explainability in patient-facing applications

## Confidence
High confidence: The paper's identification of distinct types of uncertainty (model performance, confidence, reasoning, and unknown knowns) is well-founded and aligns with established concepts in uncertainty communication.

Medium confidence: The proposed design for improving understandability through natural language explanations is theoretically sound, though its practical effectiveness requires validation.

Low confidence: Claims about the effectiveness of combining precision and confidence in explanations, and addressing patient-specific concerns, need empirical validation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of textual explanations in improving patient understanding and trust in IVF outcome predictions.
2. Implement and test interpretable model architectures to compare their explainability and performance against black-box models in the IVF context.
3. Integrate external medical knowledge sources to address unknown knowns and evaluate their impact on patient understanding and model utility.
