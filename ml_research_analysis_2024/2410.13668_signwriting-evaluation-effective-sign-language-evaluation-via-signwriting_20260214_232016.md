# signwriting-evaluation: Effective Sign Language Evaluation via SignWriting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.13668
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13668
- Authors: Amit Moryossef; Rotem Zilberman; Ohad Langer
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Introduces toolkit providing specialized evaluation metrics for SignWriting, including novel Symbol Distance Metric that accounts for visual and spatial properties of signs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces signwriting-evaluation, a toolkit providing specialized evaluation metrics for SignWriting. The authors adapt standard metrics (BLEU, chrF) and CLIPScore for SignWriting images, while proposing a novel symbol distance metric that accounts for visual and spatial properties of SignWriting symbols. Qualitative evaluations using score distributions and nearest-neighbor searches on the SignBank corpus demonstrate that the symbol distance metric outperforms other metrics in capturing SignWriting's nuances and effectively retrieving visually and semantically similar signs. The work addresses the lack of automatic evaluation metrics tailored for SignWriting, offering researchers more appropriate tools for assessing sign language processing models.

## Method Summary
The signwriting-evaluation toolkit adapts traditional evaluation metrics (BLEU, chrF) for SignWriting transcription by tokenizing FSW strings and computing scores based on symbol overlap. CLIPScore is implemented using the original CLIP model to compute cosine similarity between image embeddings of SignWriting signs and text descriptions. The novel Symbol Distance Metric uses a distance function that accounts for symbol attributes (base shape, orientation, rotation, position) and applies the Hungarian algorithm to find optimal symbol-to-symbol matching, normalizing distances non-linearly. The toolkit is evaluated using the SignBank corpus through pairwise metric scores on random sign pairs and nearest-neighbor retrieval for selected query signs.

## Key Results
- The Symbol Distance Metric captures SignWriting nuances better than traditional metrics by considering visual and spatial properties of symbols
- CLIPScore applied to SignWriting images captures visual similarities that token-based metrics miss
- The toolkit effectively retrieves visually and semantically similar signs through nearest-neighbor searches on the SignBank corpus

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Symbol Distance Metric captures SignWriting nuances better than traditional metrics by considering visual and spatial properties of symbols.
- Mechanism: The metric uses a distance function that accounts for symbol attributes (base shape, orientation, rotation, position) and applies the Hungarian algorithm to find optimal symbol-to-symbol matching, normalizing distances non-linearly.
- Core assumption: Visual and spatial properties of SignWriting symbols are more important for sign meaning than exact symbol position matches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "a novel symbol distance metric that accounts for the visual and spatial properties of SignWriting symbols"
  - [section]: "Our metric assesses the similarity between two SignWriting signs by calculating distances between their constituent symbols based on attributes such as base shape, orientation, rotation, and position."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors are not directly related to the symbol distance mechanism.
- Break condition: If symbol attribute weighting is poorly calibrated or if the Hungarian algorithm fails to find meaningful matches due to sign complexity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CLIPScore applied to SignWriting images captures visual similarities that token-based metrics miss.
- Mechanism: CLIPScore uses the CLIP model to compute cosine similarity between image embeddings of SignWriting signs and text descriptions, leveraging pre-trained visual-linguistic understanding.
- Core assumption: CLIP's visual-linguistic understanding transfers to SignWriting domain despite domain mismatch.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the application of CLIPScore to SignWriting images, bridging the gap between visual representations and textual evaluation"
  - [section]: "We use the original CLIP model without additional training, relying on its ability to capture visual similarities."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors are not directly related to CLIPScore mechanism.
- Break condition: If CLIP model fails to generalize to SignWriting domain due to significant visual differences from training data.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Hungarian algorithm-based matching optimally aligns symbols between hypothesis and reference signs, improving evaluation accuracy.
- Mechanism: The algorithm finds the optimal matching that minimizes total distance between symbols from hypothesis and reference, then computes mean normalized distance and length adjustment factor.
- Core assumption: Optimal symbol-to-symbol matching exists and can be found algorithmically for meaningful evaluation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we use the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955) to find the optimal matching that minimizes the total distance between symbols from the hypothesis and reference"
  - [abstract]: "a novel symbol distance metric that accounts for the visual and spatial properties of SignWriting symbols"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors are not directly related to Hungarian algorithm mechanism.
- Break condition: If signs have too many symbols or complex variations that make optimal matching computationally infeasible or meaningless.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: SignWriting notation system
  - Why needed here: Understanding the visual-spatial nature of SignWriting is crucial for appreciating why traditional text-based metrics fail and why the symbol distance metric was developed.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of SignWriting notation that make it fundamentally different from spoken language text?

- Concept: Hungarian algorithm for optimal assignment
  - Why needed here: The Hungarian algorithm is used to find optimal symbol-to-symbol matching between hypothesis and reference signs, which is central to the symbol distance metric.
  - Quick check question: How does the Hungarian algorithm find optimal assignments in polynomial time?

- Concept: CLIP model architecture and capabilities
  - Why needed here: Understanding CLIP's visual-linguistic capabilities explains why CLIPScore might work for SignWriting despite domain mismatch.
  - Quick check question: What training data and architecture allow CLIP to capture visual similarities across different domains?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Token-based metrics (BLEU, chrF) -> Baseline implementations
  - CLIPScore component -> Image processing and embedding computation
  - Symbol Distance Metric -> Attribute extraction, distance calculation, Hungarian algorithm matching
  - Corpus handling -> SignBank corpus loading and preprocessing
  - Evaluation pipeline -> Score computation and comparison

- Critical path: Sign input → Symbol extraction → Distance calculation → Matching (Hungarian) → Score normalization → Result output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. computational efficiency in Hungarian algorithm matching
  - Domain-specific tuning vs. generalization across SignWriting variants
  - Symbol attribute weighting complexity vs. evaluation interpretability

- Failure signatures:
  - BLEU/chrF: Zero scores for visually similar but positionally different signs
  - CLIPScore: Similar high scores for all sign comparisons due to domain mismatch
  - Symbol Distance: Computational timeouts for complex signs, inconsistent scores for similar signs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare Symbol Distance scores for visually identical signs with different symbol ordering
  2. Test CLIPScore sensitivity to minor visual changes in SignWriting images
  3. Evaluate Hungarian algorithm performance on signs with varying symbol counts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the proposed evaluation metrics perform quantitatively when compared against human judgments of sign similarity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state that their current evaluation primarily emphasizes qualitative analysis and acknowledge that "a more rigorous quantitative analysis, aligned with human judgments, is necessary."
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on qualitative demonstrations through score distributions and nearest-neighbor searches, but does not provide quantitative validation against human assessments of sign similarity.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing the metrics' scores with human evaluations on a dataset of sign pairs, measuring correlation between automatic metrics and human similarity judgments.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can machine learning techniques be used to optimize the weighting of symbols in the Symbol Distance Metric to better capture the subtle complexities of SignWriting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that "Incorporating machine learning techniques could optimize the weighting of symbols and better capture the subtle complexities of SignWriting" as a potential future enhancement.
- Why unresolved: The current Symbol Distance Metric uses fixed weighting for symbol attributes, and the paper does not explore data-driven approaches to optimize these weights.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from experiments training a machine learning model to learn optimal weights for symbol attributes, demonstrating improved correlation with human judgments or downstream task performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the evaluation metrics be extended to better handle multi-sign sequences and continuous signing, beyond the current approach of treating sign sequences as sets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that "expanding these metrics to better handle multi-sign sequences remains an important area for future research" and that their current toolkit supports continuous signing by treating the sign sequence as a set.
- Why unresolved: The paper primarily focuses on evaluating single signs, and the approach for continuous signing is simplistic, not accounting for the sequential and temporal aspects of signed languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of metrics that incorporate temporal information, sign order, and sequential dependencies, validated through improved evaluation of continuous signing models.

## Limitations
- The evaluation of the Symbol Distance Metric on a relatively small sample of signs from the SignBank corpus may not fully represent the diversity of SignWriting usage across different sign languages.
- CLIPScore relies on the original CLIP model without fine-tuning, which may limit its effectiveness given the domain mismatch between SignWriting and CLIP's training data.
- The paper lacks quantitative benchmarks comparing the proposed metrics against human evaluations of sign similarity.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The toolkit implementation and adaptation of standard metrics (BLEU, chrF) for SignWriting are straightforward and well-documented.
- **Medium Confidence**: The Symbol Distance Metric's effectiveness is supported by qualitative evidence (nearest-neighbor searches) but lacks comprehensive quantitative validation across diverse sign language datasets.
- **Low Confidence**: CLIPScore's applicability to SignWriting remains uncertain due to the absence of domain-specific fine-tuning and limited validation beyond visual inspection of nearest neighbors.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies comparing Symbol Distance Metric scores with expert judgments of sign similarity across multiple sign languages.
2. Perform ablation studies on Symbol Distance Metric parameters to determine optimal weighting for different attribute types (visual vs. spatial properties).
3. Fine-tune CLIP model on SignWriting-specific data and compare performance against the original CLIPScore implementation.
