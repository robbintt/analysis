# Explainable Global Wildfire Prediction Models using Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.07152
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07152
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: GNN-based model achieves superior wildfire prediction performance (MSE: 0.000498, RRMSE: 0.288990, SSIM: 0.966979, PSNR: 33.366938) while providing explainable insights through community detection and Integrated Gradients analysis

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model for global wildfire prediction that addresses key limitations of traditional CNN-based approaches, particularly in handling missing oceanic data and capturing long-range dependencies. The model transforms global climate and wildfire data into a graph representation, combining the spatial processing power of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with the temporal modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. When benchmarked against established architectures using unseen JULES-INFERNO simulation data, the model demonstrates superior predictive accuracy while maintaining transparency through explainability techniques.

## Method Summary
The method involves constructing a land-masked graph from JULES-INFERNO simulation data using correlation coefficients between nodes to determine edges, resulting in 7,771 terrestrial nodes. A hybrid GCN-LSTM architecture processes spatial dependencies through the GCN layer at each timestep while the LSTM layer captures temporal evolution across timesteps. The model is trained for 1000 epochs using Adam optimizer (learning rate 0.001) on 4 ensemble members, validated on a portion of the fifth member, and tested on the remaining member. Performance is evaluated using MSE, RRMSE, SSIM, and PSNR metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieved MSE of 0.000498, RRMSE of 0.288990, SSIM of 0.966979, and PSNR of 33.366938 on test data
- Superior performance compared to established architectures (LSTM, ConvLSTM, CAE-LSTM) on unseen ensemble data
- Identified potential wildfire correlation clusters through community detection analysis
- Demonstrated feature importance through Integrated Gradient analysis, elucidating key drivers of wildfire occurrence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph-based representation overcomes missing oceanic data limitations inherent in CNN-based models.
- Mechanism: By excluding oceanic regions via a land mask, the graph structure avoids forcing missing data into arbitrary constant values like zero, which would bias CNN-based models. Nodes are only created for terrestrial locations, preserving the integrity of wildfire-relevant data.
- Core assumption: Wildfire occurrence is exclusively tied to land surfaces and does not occur in oceans.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To address the challenges of long-range dependencies and absent data, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to surrogate and analyse global surface data simulation pixels from the JULES-INFERNO results...In response to the limitation of absent oceanic data, we introduce a land mask to the global JULES-INFERNO simulation data, restricting all data to solely encompass the earth's land surface."
  - [section] "Wildfires are exclusive to land and do not occur in oceans."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Correlation-based graph edges enable the model to capture long-range dependencies between geographically distant regions.
- Mechanism: Edge weights are derived from wildfire occurrence correlation coefficients calculated across a timeseries of simulation data. This allows the model to represent strong relationships between distant regions (e.g., across oceans) that would be missed by local convolutional receptive fields in CNNs.
- Core assumption: Meteorological and wildfire patterns exhibit strong correlations across long distances that are meaningful for prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach uniquely transforms global climate and wildfire data into a graph representation, addressing challenges such as null oceanic data locations and long-range dependencies inherent in traditional models."
  - [section] "Utilising correlation coefficients to represent edges enables the capture of long-range dependencies across distant regions. These correlations are calculated from the wildfire burned areas across a timeseries for all training ensemble members."
  - [corpus] "Limited evidence in corpus - this appears to be a novel contribution of the paper."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Integration of GCN with LSTM combines spatial and temporal modeling strengths for improved wildfire prediction.
- Mechanism: The GCN layer processes spatial dependencies within the graph structure at each timestep, while the LSTM layer captures temporal dependencies across timesteps. This hybrid approach allows the model to learn both spatial patterns in wildfire occurrence and their temporal evolution.
- Core assumption: Spatial and temporal dependencies in wildfire data are sufficiently independent to benefit from separate processing layers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a hybrid model that combines the spatial prowess of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with the temporal depth of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks."
  - [section] "While the GCL captures spatial dependencies within the nodes, the LSTM network derives the temporal dependencies. Collectively, this GNN model is engineered to execute a multi-step spatiotemporal prediction task."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their variants (GCN, Graph Attention Networks)
  - Why needed here: GNNs provide a natural framework for representing spatially distributed environmental data as graphs, allowing for flexible handling of irregular spatial relationships and missing data regions.
  - Quick check question: How does a GCN differ from a traditional CNN in terms of how it processes spatial relationships?

- Concept: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and their variants
  - Why needed here: LSTMs are essential for capturing temporal dependencies in time series data, which is critical for predicting how wildfire conditions evolve over time.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary advantage of LSTMs over traditional RNNs for long sequence prediction tasks?

- Concept: Explainable AI techniques (Integrated Gradients, Community Detection)
  - Why needed here: Explainability is crucial for wildfire prediction models to build trust with stakeholders and provide actionable insights for fire management decisions.
  - Quick check question: How does the Integrated Gradients method attribute feature importance differently from simpler methods like gradient-based saliency?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Graph Construction → GCN Layer → LSTM Layer → Output Layer → Evaluation/Explainability
- Critical path: Graph Construction → GCN Layer → LSTM Layer → Output Layer → Evaluation/Explainability
- Design tradeoffs: Graph-based approach provides flexibility in handling irregular spatial data but requires careful graph construction; hybrid GCN-LSTM architecture combines strengths but increases complexity
- Failure signatures: Poor graph construction leading to disconnected components; vanishing gradients in LSTM; overfitting to training data; explainability methods failing to provide meaningful insights
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify graph construction correctly excludes oceanic regions and creates expected number of nodes
  2. Test GCN layer alone on single timestep to ensure spatial processing works correctly
  3. Test LSTM layer alone with pre-processed spatial features to validate temporal modeling capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the potential benefits and challenges of extending the model's capabilities to encompass full climate modeling beyond wildfire prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the possibility of extending the model to full climate modeling, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of wildfire dynamics and contribute to climate science.
- Why unresolved: The feasibility, benefits, and challenges of such an extension are not explored, and the impact on the model's performance and applicability is unknown.
