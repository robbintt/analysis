# Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning Through Adversarial Attacks and Training : A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2403.00420
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00420
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive survey of adversarial attacks and training methods for robust DRL

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic overview of adversarial attacks and training methods in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), categorizing techniques based on their objectives, mechanisms, and perturbation types. The paper covers both observation alterations and dynamics alterations, with detailed analysis of gradient attacks, derivative-free attacks, and adversarial policies. It reviews various adversarial training strategies and discusses approaches to balance stability, convergence, and robustness in DRL systems.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic categorization approach to organize adversarial techniques in DRL. It divides attacks into gradient-based, derivative-free, and adversarial policy categories, while training strategies are classified into fixed and continuous approaches. The analysis examines the trade-offs between stability, convergence, and robustness, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the landscape of adversarial methods in reinforcement learning.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive categorization of adversarial attacks based on objectives and perturbation types
- Systematic review of adversarial training strategies including fixed and continuous approaches
- Analysis of trade-offs between stability, convergence, and robustness in DRL systems
- Discussion of tools and future research directions in adversarial reinforcement learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's effectiveness stems from its systematic categorization framework that organizes diverse adversarial techniques into coherent groups based on their operational mechanisms and objectives. By distinguishing between observation alterations and dynamics alterations, it provides a clear structure for understanding how different attacks affect DRL systems. The analysis of training strategies helps identify approaches that balance robustness with performance, while the discussion of tools and future directions guides practical implementation and research efforts.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Gradient-based attacks** - Why needed: To exploit model gradients for targeted perturbations
   Quick check: Verify gradient computation accuracy and attack effectiveness
2. **Derivative-free attacks** - Why needed: To handle black-box scenarios where gradients are unavailable
   Quick check: Assess attack success rate without gradient information
3. **Adversarial policies** - Why needed: To learn optimal attack strategies through reinforcement learning
   Quick check: Evaluate policy convergence and attack consistency
4. **Adversarial training** - Why needed: To improve model robustness against adversarial examples
   Quick check: Measure robustness gains versus performance trade-offs
5. **Observation vs. dynamics alterations** - Why needed: To understand different attack vectors in RL
   Quick check: Compare impact of each alteration type on policy performance
6. **Stability vs. robustness trade-offs** - Why needed: To balance competing objectives in training
   Quick check: Analyze performance degradation under adversarial conditions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Environment -> Agent -> Attack Module -> Training Module -> Robust Agent

**Critical path:** Agent policy execution -> Attack perturbation -> Robust training -> Policy update

**Design tradeoffs:** Computational cost vs. robustness level, training stability vs. attack resistance, model complexity vs. real-time performance

**Failure signatures:** Degraded performance under adversarial conditions, unstable training dynamics, convergence issues, excessive computational overhead

**First experiments:**
1. Implement gradient-based attack on simple DRL benchmark
2. Evaluate adversarial training effectiveness on perturbed observations
3. Compare robustness gains between fixed and continuous training strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
