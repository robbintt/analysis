# Task Oriented In-Domain Data Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.16694
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16694
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes TRAIT, a task-oriented in-domain data augmentation framework that improves LLM performance by 8% and 7.5% in advertisement and math domains respectively.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses two major issues in adapting large language models to specialized domains: scarcity of in-domain data and lack of task-oriented continual pre-training data. The authors propose TRAIT, a task-oriented in-domain data augmentation framework that consists of two components: (1) a data selection strategy to identify and filter high-quality in-domain data from general corpora, and (2) a task-oriented synthetic passage generation guideline that produces passages containing both problem-specific and enlightenment paragraphs. The framework employs a two-stage training strategy: first training on selected in-domain data to learn domain knowledge, then training on synthetic passages to align with downstream tasks. Evaluated on advertisement and math domains, TRAIT improves LLM performance by 8% and 7.5% respectively compared to base models without continual pre-training, and outperforms existing baselines by 6.5% and 5.5% on average across multiple downstream tasks.

## Method Summary
TRAIT is a task-oriented in-domain data augmentation framework designed to address the scarcity of specialized data for LLM adaptation. The framework consists of two main components: a data selection strategy that identifies and filters high-quality in-domain data from general corpora, and a task-oriented synthetic passage generation guideline that produces passages containing both problem-specific and enlightenment paragraphs. The approach employs a two-stage training strategy where the model first trains on selected in-domain data to learn domain knowledge, then trains on synthetic passages to align with downstream tasks. The data selection process uses a domain-specific language model to score and filter candidate passages, while the synthetic generation component leverages task-oriented instructions to create new passages that combine problem statements with explanatory content.

## Key Results
- TRAIT improves LLM performance by 8% in advertisement domain compared to base models without continual pre-training
- TRAIT achieves 7.5% improvement in math domain compared to base models without continual pre-training
- TRAIT outperforms existing baselines by 6.5% and 5.5% on average across multiple downstream tasks in advertisement and math domains respectively

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its two-stage approach that first grounds the model in authentic domain knowledge through selected in-domain data, then enhances task-specific capabilities through synthetic passages. The data selection strategy ensures the model learns from high-quality, relevant examples, while the synthetic passage generation creates task-oriented content that bridges the gap between general knowledge and specific application requirements. By combining both authentic and synthetic data, TRAIT addresses the dual challenges of data scarcity and task alignment simultaneously.

## Foundational Learning
- Domain-specific language modeling: Understanding specialized vocabulary and context patterns in target domains is crucial for effective adaptation
- Data selection and filtering: Identifying high-quality in-domain data from general corpora requires sophisticated scoring mechanisms
- Synthetic data generation: Creating task-oriented passages that maintain both domain relevance and instructional value
- Two-stage training strategies: Sequentially learning domain knowledge followed by task-specific alignment improves model performance
- Passage structure design: Combining problem-specific and enlightenment paragraphs creates more effective training examples

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Data Selection -> Domain Filtering -> Synthetic Generation -> Two-Stage Training -> Downstream Evaluation

Critical Path:
The most critical components are the data selection strategy and the two-stage training approach. The data selection ensures the model learns from relevant domain-specific content, while the two-stage training allows for progressive learning from authentic data to synthetic task-oriented passages.

Design Tradeoffs:
The framework trades computational overhead for improved performance by employing both data selection and synthetic generation processes. The two-stage training approach requires additional training time but provides better domain and task alignment compared to single-stage methods.

Failure Signatures:
Potential failure modes include poor data selection leading to irrelevant training examples, synthetic passages that don't adequately capture task requirements, or imbalance between the two training stages. The framework may also struggle with domains where authentic data is extremely scarce or where task-specific requirements are highly complex.

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate data selection quality by comparing selected passages against human-annotated domain relevance scores
2. Test synthetic passage generation quality using human evaluation of problem-enlightenment coherence
3. Compare single-stage vs two-stage training performance to validate the sequential learning approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The generalizability of the data selection strategy across different domains remains uncertain
- The quality and diversity of synthetic passages generated by the task-oriented guidelines may vary
- The scalability of the two-stage training approach to larger model sizes or more diverse domains is not fully explored

## Confidence
- Data selection effectiveness: Medium
- Synthetic generation quality: Medium
- Overall performance claims: Medium
- Generalizability across domains: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate TRAIT's performance across a broader range of domains beyond advertisement and math to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the data selection and synthetic generation components
3. Perform long-term stability analysis to measure performance retention over extended periods and under varying data distributions
