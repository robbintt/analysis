# Continual Learning of Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.16789
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16789
- Reference count: 40
- This survey comprehensively reviews the rapidly evolving field of continual learning for large language models (LLMs), identifying two key dimensions of continuity: vertical (pre-training to fine-tuning) and horizontal (across time/domains).

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of continual learning for large language models, identifying two key dimensions of continuity: vertical (from pre-training to fine-tuning) and horizontal (across time and domains). The paper examines three main stages of LLM learning under modern continual learning paradigms: Continual Pre-Training, Domain-Adaptive Pre-training, and Continual Fine-Tuning. It highlights critical challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, task heterogeneity, and inaccessible upstream data, while emphasizing the need for practical evaluation benchmarks and methodologies tailored to new LLM learning paradigms.

The survey identifies a significant gap in the diversity of continual learning techniques currently applied to LLMs and emphasizes the growing importance of task- and domain-incremental learning over traditional class-incremental approaches. The authors call for increased community attention to develop efficient replay mechanisms, controllable memory systems, and customized preferences for LLM adaptation, positioning continual learning as a crucial frontier for advancing LLM capabilities.

## Method Summary
As a comprehensive survey paper, the authors systematically reviewed existing literature on continual learning for large language models. They analyzed research papers, methodologies, and applications across different stages of LLM development, focusing on how models adapt to new data and tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge. The survey methodology involved categorizing research into three main learning stages and identifying key challenges and opportunities in each domain.

## Key Results
- Identified two key dimensions of continuity in LLM learning: vertical (pre-training to fine-tuning) and horizontal (across time/domains)
- Highlighted the limited diversity of continual learning techniques currently used in LLM research
- Emphasized the growing importance of task- and domain-incremental learning over class-incremental learning in LLM contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Continual learning for LLMs works by enabling models to adapt to new information while preserving previously acquired knowledge. The mechanism relies on incremental updates that prevent catastrophic forgetting through various techniques such as rehearsal methods, regularization approaches, and architectural modifications. This allows LLMs to evolve their capabilities over time without requiring complete retraining, making them more practical and cost-effective for real-world deployment.

## Foundational Learning

1. Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention
   - Why needed: Models tend to overwrite previous knowledge when learning new tasks
   - Quick check: Monitor performance degradation on previous tasks after training on new data

2. Task-Incremental Learning
   - Why needed: Models need to distinguish between different task types and adapt accordingly
   - Quick check: Verify model can maintain separate knowledge for different task categories

3. Domain-Adaptive Learning
   - Why needed: Different domains require specialized knowledge while maintaining general capabilities
   - Quick check: Test model performance across multiple domains without cross-contamination

4. Memory Management
   - Why needed: Efficient storage and retrieval of past experiences for continual learning
   - Quick check: Monitor memory usage and retrieval efficiency during incremental learning

5. Evaluation Frameworks
   - Why needed: Standardized methods to assess continual learning performance
   - Quick check: Validate benchmark consistency across different continual learning scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Data -> Memory Buffer -> Model Architecture -> Learning Algorithm -> Evaluation Metrics

Critical Path: The critical path involves the interaction between memory management systems and the learning algorithm, where the memory buffer stores representative samples from previous tasks, and the learning algorithm uses these samples to prevent catastrophic forgetting while adapting to new tasks.

Design Tradeoffs: Key tradeoffs include memory efficiency versus learning performance, computational cost versus adaptation speed, and model complexity versus generalization capability. The balance between storing representative samples versus using regularization techniques represents a fundamental architectural decision.

Failure Signatures: Common failure modes include rapid performance degradation on previous tasks, inability to distinguish between task types, memory overflow issues, and inconsistent evaluation results across different benchmarks.

First Experiments:
1. Test catastrophic forgetting prevention on a simple sequential task learning scenario
2. Evaluate memory buffer efficiency with varying sample storage strategies
3. Compare performance across different evaluation metrics in multi-domain settings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The survey highlights several open questions in the field, including the need for more diverse continual learning techniques beyond the current limited approaches, the development of efficient replay mechanisms for large-scale models, the creation of standardized evaluation benchmarks, and the investigation of controllable memory systems that can effectively balance new learning with knowledge preservation.

## Limitations

- The survey is limited by the relatively small number of studies (40 references) in the current literature on continual learning for LLMs
- There may be selection bias in choosing which papers to include in the survey
- The field is rapidly evolving, potentially making some observations outdated as new techniques emerge

## Confidence

- High confidence in the general overview of continual learning for LLMs
- Medium confidence in the identified challenges and research directions
- Low confidence in specific claims about technique diversity and evaluation benchmarks without access to the full survey methodology

## Next Checks

1. Examine the survey methodology and inclusion criteria for selected papers to assess potential biases
2. Review specific case studies or examples of continual learning implementations mentioned in the survey
3. Investigate current state-of-the-art benchmarks and evaluation frameworks for continual learning in LLMs to verify claims about limited diversity and evaluation challenges
