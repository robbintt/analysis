# Modeling Temporal Positive and Negative Excitation for Sequential Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.22013
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22013
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: SDIL achieves 1.36-3.26% improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on HR@5, NDCG@5, and MRR metrics across three Amazon datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Static-Dynamic Interest Learning (SDIL) framework for sequential recommendation, addressing limitations in modeling both stable user preferences and dynamic interests. The core innovation is the Temporal Positive and Negative Excitation Modeling (TPNE) module, which uses temporal point processes to capture how historical interactions positively or negatively influence future choices. SDIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on three real-world datasets (Beauty, Cellphones, Toys) by combining static interest modeling through feature-based self-attention with dynamic interest modeling through temporal excitation learning.

## Method Summary
SDIL consists of three components: (1) Static Interest Modeling (SIM) module that uses feature-based self-attention on item attributes (category, brand, price) to capture stable user preferences, (2) Dynamic Interest Modeling (DIM) module with TPNE that models temporal positive and negative excitation signals from historical interactions using temporal point processes, and (3) a gating fusion mechanism that combines static and dynamic embeddings for next-item prediction. The model is trained using pairwise ranking loss with negative sampling and achieves superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics on three Amazon datasets.

## Key Results
- SDIL achieves 1.36-3.26% improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on HR@5, NDCG@5, and MRR metrics
- Ablation study confirms the effectiveness of modeling both static interest and negative excitation
- TPNE module shows particular importance for capturing temporal dynamics in user behavior
- Consistent performance improvements across three real-world datasets (Beauty, Cellphones, Toys)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Modeling both positive and negative excitation provides a more complete picture of user dynamic interest.
- Mechanism: The TPNE module uses temporal point processes to capture how historical interactions positively or negatively influence future choices, with time intervals determining excitation strength.
- Core assumption: Historical interactions can have either positive or negative effects on future choices, and the strength of this effect varies with time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TPNE is specially designed for comprehensively modeling dynamic interest based on temporal positive and negative excitation learning."
  - [section 4.2] "We propose modeling both positive and negative excitation for SRS task, which is composed of two parts Positive Excitation Learning and Negative Excitation Learning."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus neighbors about negative excitation modeling specifically.
- Break condition: If excitation strength does not vary with time intervals or if the distinction between positive and negative excitation is not meaningful for the domain.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Static interest modeling captures relatively stable user preferences that dynamic interest alone cannot represent.
- Mechanism: The SIM module uses feature-based self-attention on item attributes (category, brand, price) to model stable user preferences independent of interaction timestamps.
- Core assumption: Users have relatively stable preferences at the attribute level that remain consistent across time and interactions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SDIL consists of (1) a Static Interest Modeling (SIM) module, (2) a Dynamic Interest Modeling (DIM) module, and (3) a next-item prediction module."
  - [section 4.3] "To represent the users' relatively stable interest in their interaction history, we adopt the feature-based self-attention module to model the user's static interest."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors discuss interest modeling but not specifically static vs dynamic interest distinction.
- Break condition: If user preferences at attribute level are as volatile as item-level preferences, or if attribute information is not predictive of future choices.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The gating mechanism effectively fuses static and dynamic interest representations.
- Mechanism: A learnable gate combines the static interest embedding and dynamic interest embedding, allowing the model to adaptively weight each type of interest based on context.
- Core assumption: The optimal balance between static and dynamic interest varies by user and context, requiring adaptive fusion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4] "Since both dynamic user interest and static user interest are vital in SRS task, it is crucial to combine them and as the input of the downstream prediction module for next-item prediction. Hence, inspired by previous works [18, 36], we leverage the gate fusion module to fuse the dynamic embedding 𝑒ℎ and static interest embedding 𝑒𝑠 so as to better next-item prediction."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in corpus about gating mechanisms for interest fusion.
- Break condition: If one type of interest consistently dominates the other across all contexts, or if the gating mechanism adds unnecessary complexity without performance gains.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal point processes
  - Why needed here: To model how historical interactions influence future choices with time-varying strength.
  - Quick check question: What mathematical framework describes the probability of events occurring at specific times given past events?

- Concept: Self-attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: To capture relationships between items in sequences and between item attributes.
  - Quick check question: How does self-attention compute the relevance between different elements in a sequence?

- Concept: Gating mechanisms in neural networks
  - Why needed here: To adaptively combine static and dynamic interest representations based on context.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of a gating mechanism in neural networks, and how does it differ from simple concatenation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  User interaction history → Item attribute embeddings → SIM module → Static interest embedding
  User interaction history → Item ID embeddings → DIM module (TPNE) → Dynamic interest embedding
  Static embedding + Dynamic embedding → Gating fusion → Prediction layer

- Critical path:
  User interaction history → Item attribute embeddings → SIM module → Static interest embedding
  User interaction history → Item ID embeddings → DIM module (TPNE) → Dynamic interest embedding
  Static embedding + Dynamic embedding → Gating fusion → Prediction layer

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Static vs Dynamic interest: Balancing stable preferences with recent interests
  - Positive vs Negative excitation: Capturing both attraction and repulsion effects
  - Temporal resolution: How granular should time intervals be for excitation modeling

- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting: Poor generalization to unseen sequences or time periods
  - Mode collapse: Model consistently favors either static or dynamic interest regardless of context
  - Temporal misalignment: Excitation strength not properly calibrated to actual time intervals

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Remove SIM module to test importance of static interest modeling
  2. Excitation polarity: Compare with variant that only models positive excitation
  3. Temporal sensitivity: Test performance with different time interval resolutions in TPNE

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the TPNE module handle cases where the same item appears multiple times in a user's interaction history, and does the model account for the possibility that repeated interactions with the same item might indicate a different type of user interest compared to interactions with diverse items?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the importance of modeling both positive and negative excitation signals from historical interactions, but it doesn't explicitly address how the model handles repeated interactions with the same item.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on modeling the relationships between different items in a user's history but doesn't delve into the specific treatment of repeated interactions with the same item, which could provide valuable insights into user preferences and behavior.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing the performance of the model with and without a mechanism to handle repeated interactions with the same item, or a detailed explanation of how the model differentiates between repeated and diverse interactions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of incorporating additional static attributes beyond category, brand, and price on the recommendation performance, and how does the model scale with an increasing number of attributes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the use of category, brand, and price as static attributes, but it doesn't explore the potential benefits of incorporating other attributes or discuss the scalability of the model with a larger number of attributes.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide insights into the optimal set of static attributes or discuss the computational complexity of the model as the number of attributes increases, which are important considerations for practical implementation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of the model with different sets of static attributes, or a complexity analysis of the model as the number of attributes increases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model handle cold-start scenarios where a user or item has very few interactions, and what strategies are employed to mitigate the potential negative impact on recommendation performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper doesn't explicitly address the cold-start problem, which is a common challenge in recommendation systems, especially for new users or items with limited interaction data.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on modeling the behavior of users and items with sufficient interaction history, but it doesn't provide insights into how the model handles cases where there is limited data available, which is crucial for real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the performance of the model in cold-start scenarios, or a discussion of strategies employed to handle such cases, such as leveraging content-based features or incorporating side information.

## Limitations
- The paper's core claims about negative excitation modeling and temporal point processes lack direct empirical validation in the corpus
- The assumption that historical interactions can have negative effects on future choices is stated but not empirically validated through user behavior analysis
- The temporal kernel functions use normal distributions with learnable parameters, but sensitivity to these parameters is not thoroughly examined

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The general framework combining static and dynamic interest modeling is well-supported by the experimental results showing consistent improvements across all metrics (HR@5: 1.36-3.26% improvement).
- **Medium confidence**: The TPNE module's effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics is supported by ablation results, but the specific contribution of negative excitation modeling needs more direct validation.
- **Low confidence**: The assumption that historical interactions can have negative effects on future choices is stated but not empirically validated through user behavior analysis or qualitative studies.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing SDIL with a variant that models only positive excitation to isolate the specific contribution of negative excitation modeling.
2. Perform sensitivity analysis on the temporal kernel parameters (μ and σ) to understand their impact on model performance and convergence behavior.
3. Analyze the learned negative excitation patterns to validate whether they correspond to meaningful user behavior phenomena like item fatigue or preference shifts.
