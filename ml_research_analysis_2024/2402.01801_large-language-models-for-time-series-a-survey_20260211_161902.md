# Large Language Models for Time Series: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.01801
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01801
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey of LLM approaches for time series analysis across five methodological categories

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines how large language models can be applied to time series analysis, addressing the fundamental challenge that LLMs are trained on text rather than numerical sequences. The authors organize the landscape into five methodological approaches: direct prompting, time series quantization, aligning techniques, vision modality as a bridge, and tool integration. The survey provides detailed mathematical formulations and implementations for representative works in each category while compiling extensive multimodal datasets spanning healthcare, IoT, finance, and audio domains. The work identifies key research directions including theoretical understanding, efficient algorithms, and privacy considerations.

## Method Summary
The survey categorizes LLM approaches for time series into five methodological groups. Direct prompting treats time series as text through formatting transformations. Time series quantization converts numerical sequences into discrete tokens using clustering or discretization techniques. Aligning techniques train or fine-tune LLMs to establish connections between text and time series representations. Vision modality approaches leverage image-based representations of time series as intermediaries. Tool integration incorporates external time series processing tools that LLMs can invoke through APIs. Each category includes mathematical formulations of how the transformation or alignment occurs, along with analysis of computational requirements and performance characteristics.

## Key Results
- Five distinct methodological categories for applying LLMs to time series: direct prompting, quantization, alignment, vision modality, and tool integration
- Comprehensive compilation of multimodal datasets combining time series with text across multiple domains including healthcare, IoT, and finance
- Identification of critical research directions including theoretical foundations, efficient algorithms, domain knowledge integration, and privacy-preserving customization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey reveals that LLM effectiveness for time series depends on bridging the fundamental representation gap between discrete text tokens and continuous numerical sequences. Different bridging strategies work through distinct mechanisms: quantization creates shared discrete vocabularies, alignment learns transformation functions, vision approaches exploit visual pattern recognition capabilities, and tool integration leverages specialized numerical processing. The survey demonstrates that no single approach dominates across all use cases, with effectiveness varying based on time series characteristics, task requirements, and available computational resources.

## Foundational Learning
- Time series quantization: Discretizing numerical values into discrete tokens to match LLM vocabulary - needed because LLMs cannot process continuous numerical values directly; quick check: verify quantization preserves temporal patterns
- Multimodal dataset construction: Creating paired text-time series samples for training - needed to enable supervised learning across modalities; quick check: ensure temporal alignment between modalities
- Vision modality bridging: Converting time series to images for LLM processing - needed because LLMs excel at visual pattern recognition; quick check: validate image representations retain time series characteristics
- Prompt engineering for time series: Formatting numerical data for LLM consumption - needed to maximize information retention in text format; quick check: measure information loss in formatting transformations
- Tool integration frameworks: Connecting LLMs to external numerical processing libraries - needed to leverage specialized time series algorithms; quick check: verify tool invocation latency and accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Raw Time Series -> Preprocessing -> Bridging Method -> LLM Core -> Output Layer -> Task-specific Postprocessing

**Critical Path:**
Preprocessing -> Bridging Method -> LLM Core (bottleneck: computational cost)

**Design Tradeoffs:**
Discrete vs. continuous representations (accuracy vs. LLM compatibility), computation vs. accuracy (complex bridging vs. simple prompting), training vs. inference costs (fine-tuning vs. prompting), domain specificity vs. generalization (custom models vs. general-purpose)

**Failure Signatures:**
Loss of temporal resolution in quantization, semantic drift in text representations, visual artifacts in image conversion, latency bottlenecks in tool integration, hallucination of patterns in direct prompting

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Benchmark quantization approaches on univariate time series forecasting tasks
2. Compare vision modality approaches on anomaly detection in multivariate series
3. Evaluate tool integration latency vs. accuracy tradeoffs on real-time prediction tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Categorization framework may oversimplify complex methodological overlaps where approaches span multiple categories
- Limited empirical benchmarking across methodologies rather than focusing on descriptive surveys
- Claims about LLM inability to process numerical data may not apply to newer multimodal architectures explicitly trained on numerical inputs

## Confidence
High confidence: The categorization of five methodological approaches is well-supported by the literature surveyed
Medium confidence: The identified future research directions reflect current trends but may evolve rapidly
Medium confidence: The dataset compilation is comprehensive but may miss emerging benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical benchmarking across the surveyed methodologies using standardized time series datasets to verify relative performance claims
2. Analyze computational overhead and inference latency for each approach to assess practical deployment viability
3. Survey practitioners to identify which methodological categories show most promise in real-world applications versus academic settings
