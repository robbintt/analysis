core_contribution: This study presents a framework called BiasGPT that creates multiple
  fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo models with distinct demographic biases (gender, age, race)
  to generate more diverse and representative responses. Through user testing with
  156 participants, the research found that the Australoid Model exhibited the highest
  perceived bias (average rating 6.07 out of 10), while the Asian Model showed the
  lowest bias (5.14).

- Creates fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo models with distinct demographic biases to generate diverse responses

## Executive Summary
This study introduces BiasGPT, a framework that creates multiple fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo models with distinct demographic biases (gender, age, race) to generate more diverse and representative responses. Through user testing with 156 participants, the research found significant variations in perceived bias levels across different models, with the Australoid Model showing the highest bias (6.07/10) and the Asian Model the lowest (5.14/10). The findings demonstrate that fine-tuning can effectively embed different biases in LLMs, with users perceiving varying levels of bias across models, highlighting the complexity of bias mitigation in AI systems and the need for continuous evaluation and refinement.

## Method Summary
The study created eight biased datasets representing different demographic characteristics (Young/Old, Male/Female, Asian/White/Black/Australoid) and converted them into conversation format. GPT-3.5-turbo was fine-tuned using OpenAI's API with these datasets. User testing was conducted through a web interface where participants rated responses on a 1-10 bias scale. The framework also describes combining responses from multiple biased models to create more diverse outputs, though this aspect was not empirically validated in the current study.

## Key Results
- Australoid Model exhibited highest perceived bias (6.07/10)
- Asian Model showed lowest bias (5.14/10)
- Young Model received most user ratings (50) but had moderate bias perception (5.26)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Fine-tuning GPT-3.5-turbo with demographically biased datasets creates models with distinct and measurable bias profiles.
- The fine-tuning process adjusts the model's weights based on specific patterns and language found in the bias datasets, embedding these biases into the model's responses.
- Core assumption: The fine-tuning data is sufficiently representative of the intended bias to influence the model's behavior.

### Mechanism 2
- User ratings of model responses provide quantifiable data on perceived bias levels.
- By collecting ratings on a 1-10 scale, the study captures how users perceive the bias in each model's responses, allowing for comparison across different bias profiles.
- Core assumption: Users can accurately perceive and rate bias in AI-generated responses.

### Mechanism 3
- Combining responses from multiple biased models can create a more diverse and representative overall response.
- By selecting and merging outputs from different biased models based on the prompt content, the system can capture a broader range of perspectives and experiences.
- Core assumption: The biases in different models are complementary and can be effectively combined to reduce overall bias.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Fine-tuning process in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how fine-tuning works is crucial for implementing the BiasGPT framework and interpreting its results.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between fine-tuning and prompt engineering in LLMs?

- **Concept: Bias detection and measurement techniques**
  - Why needed here: To evaluate the effectiveness of the BiasGPT framework, one needs to understand how biases are detected and quantified in AI models.
  - Quick check question: What are some common methods used to measure bias in language models?

- **Concept: Collaborative AI systems**
  - Why needed here: The final goal of BiasGPT is to combine multiple biased models into a single, more representative response, requiring knowledge of multi-agent systems.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in creating collaborative AI systems that combine multiple models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Frontend (ReactJS with Shadcdn and Tailwind CSS) -> Backend (Python with OpenAI API) -> Database (Firebase Firestore) -> Fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo models (8 variants) -> User interface for prompt input and rating submission

- **Critical path**: 1. User submits prompt through frontend, 2. Backend processes input and selects appropriate models, 3. Selected models generate biased responses, 4. Frontend displays responses and collects user ratings, 5. Ratings are stored in Firebase for analysis

- **Design tradeoffs**: Using fine-tuning instead of prompt engineering allows for more deeply embedded biases but requires more computational resources; collecting user ratings provides valuable data but may introduce subjectivity; combining multiple biased models can increase diversity but may also increase complexity and potential for inconsistent outputs

- **Failure signatures**: Models not generating biased responses as expected (check fine-tuning process and data); User ratings not correlating with intended bias levels (check rating system clarity and user understanding); Combined responses becoming incoherent (check model selection and merging logic)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Test each fine-tuned model individually with bias-eliciting prompts to verify intended biases, 2. Conduct user testing with small group to validate rating system, 3. Implement basic model combination system and test with various prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- How can the framework be extended to handle multi-dimensional bias scenarios where gender, age, and race biases interact simultaneously?
- Basis: The paper mentions collaboration but doesn't describe handling overlapping or interacting biases.
- Why unresolved: Current framework treats each bias dimension separately.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing user perceptions of integrated responses when multiple biases are combined.

### Open Question 2
- What is the optimal balance between maintaining bias diversity and ensuring factual accuracy in the combined responses?
- Basis: The paper discusses capturing diverse perspectives but doesn't address conflicts between bias representation and factual correctness.
- Why unresolved: Study focuses on bias perception but not on accuracy or reliability.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies comparing accuracy ratings of responses from biased models versus original unbiased model.

### Open Question 3
- How do different demographic groups perceive bias in the model responses, and does this vary by their own demographic characteristics?
- Basis: Study recruited diverse participants but didn't analyze demographic-specific patterns in bias perception.
- Why unresolved: Analysis presents aggregate bias ratings without examining demographic variations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Statistical analysis showing correlations between participant demographics and their bias ratings.

## Limitations

- Lack of transparency regarding dataset composition - specific content, size, and creation methodology for the eight bias datasets are not detailed
- User testing methodology relies on subjective ratings without clear validation of inter-rater reliability or participant demographic diversity
- Claims about creating "more inclusive AI technologies" extend beyond what current evidence supports

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Technical implementation of fine-tuning GPT-3.5-turbo using OpenAI's API is well-established; observed differences in perceived bias across models are statistically interpretable.

**Medium Confidence**: Claim that combining biased models creates more diverse responses is theoretically sound but lacks empirical validation in current study.

**Low Confidence**: Assertion that this approach leads to "more inclusive AI technologies" extends beyond what current evidence supports.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Transparency Audit**: Request and analyze complete bias dataset composition to verify proportional representation and genuine reflection of intended biases.

2. **Inter-rater Reliability Analysis**: Conduct formal assessment of rating consistency among 156 participants, including Cronbach's alpha calculation and analysis of demographic-specific rating patterns.

3. **Combined Output Evaluation**: Implement model combination system and conduct controlled experiments comparing response diversity, coherence, and bias levels of combined outputs versus individual model outputs using standardized metrics.
