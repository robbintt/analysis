# An Empirical Evaluation of Neural and Neuro-symbolic Approaches to Real-time Multimodal Complex Event Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11403
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11403
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Neuro-symbolic approaches outperform neural-only models by 41% average F1 score in real-time multimodal complex event detection

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates neural and neuro-symbolic approaches for complex event detection (CED) from multimodal sensor data, specifically IMU and audio streams. The study compares end-to-end neural architectures (LSTM, TCN, Transformer), two-stage concept-based neural models, and a neuro-symbolic approach using finite-state machines. Experiments on a synthesized multimodal dataset show that neuro-symbolic methods consistently outperform purely neural architectures, particularly for long-duration events with complex temporal patterns. The results demonstrate the advantage of combining neural models for atomic event detection with symbolic rules for complex event recognition.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-module system for real-time multimodal CED. First, a multimodal fusion module combines IMU and audio embeddings using pre-trained BEATs and LIMU-Bert encoders, followed by GRU layers and a fusion layer producing 128-dimensional outputs. Second, a CE detector with three alternatives: end-to-end neural models (LSTM, TCN, Transformer), two-stage concept-based neural models mapping sensor embeddings to atomic events before CE detection, and a neuro-symbolic model using FSMs on AEs. The system is trained with SGD (100 epochs for fusion, 2000 for detectors) using focal loss to address class imbalance.

## Key Results
- Neuro-symbolic approach achieves 41% higher average F1 score compared to neural-only models
- Neural architectures struggle with long-duration CEs due to limited context sizes and inability to capture complex temporal relationships
- AE classifier accuracy is crucial for downstream CE detection performance in two-stage neural models
- FSM-based symbolic rules outperform learned patterns even with large training datasets and sufficient temporal context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Neuro-symbolic methods outperform neural-only models by leveraging human-defined symbolic rules that capture long-duration temporal patterns. The approach combines neural models for atomic event detection with symbolic FSMs for CE recognition, where the FSM encodes temporal logic directly without requiring pattern learning from data. This assumes human-defined rules accurately capture temporal patterns more efficiently than learning from large datasets.

### Mechanism 2
Neural models struggle with long-duration CEs due to fixed receptive fields limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies. The neuro-symbolic approach uses symbolic FSMs that can represent arbitrary temporal patterns regardless of duration, overcoming the fundamental constraint that neural architectures cannot overcome through increased model size or training data.

### Mechanism 3
The two-stage concept-based neural architecture shows AE classification accuracy is crucial for downstream CE detection. By first classifying atomic events with a separate neural classifier, the system reduces complexity for the CE detector, which only needs to recognize patterns in the simpler AE sequence rather than raw sensor data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Finite State Machines (FSMs)
  - Why needed here: FSMs implement symbolic rules for CE detection from AE sequences in the neuro-symbolic approach
  - Quick check question: What are the four components of a finite state machine, and how do they relate to pattern matching in sequences?

- Concept: Temporal Reasoning
  - Why needed here: CED requires understanding how events unfold over time and recognizing patterns that span multiple time steps
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between instantaneous event detection and temporal reasoning, and why is the latter more challenging?

- Concept: Multimodal Fusion
  - Why needed here: The system processes both IMU and audio data streams, requiring techniques to combine information from different modalities effectively
  - Quick check question: What are the main approaches to multimodal fusion (early, late, hybrid), and what are the tradeoffs between them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw sensor data → Sliding window segmentation → Multimodal fusion → AE classification (for two-stage models) → CE detection → Output label
- Critical path: Raw sensor data → Sliding window segmentation → Multimodal fusion → AE classification (for two-stage models) → CE detection → Output label
- Design tradeoffs: Receptive field vs computational efficiency; early fusion vs late fusion; neural vs symbolic approaches
- Failure signatures: High false positives; low recall; class imbalance issues
- First 3 experiments: 1) Test AE classifier accuracy on multimodal AE dataset; 2) Evaluate CE detector performance with varying training dataset sizes; 3) Compare receptive field requirements by testing models with context windows smaller than longest CE pattern duration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of neuro-symbolic approaches scale with increasing complexity of complex event patterns (e.g., more intricate temporal relationships or longer event durations)? The paper tests on a synthesized dataset with specific patterns but doesn't explore scalability to more complex patterns or longer durations.

### Open Question 2
Can neuro-symbolic approaches effectively handle real-time complex event detection in noisy, real-world environments with varying sensor quality and data corruption? The evaluation uses a synthesized dataset that may not fully capture real-world challenges.

### Open Question 3
How do neuro-symbolic approaches compare to neural-only approaches in terms of computational efficiency and resource requirements for real-time complex event detection? The paper focuses on performance metrics but doesn't discuss computational efficiency or resource utilization.

## Limitations
- FSM architecture details are underspecified, including state definitions and transition rules
- Exact hyperparameters for neural components (GRU dimensions, learning rates) are not provided
- Synthesized dataset generation process lacks detail on how CE patterns were constructed from AEs
- No ablation studies isolating contributions of neural vs symbolic components

## Confidence
- Neuro-symbolic superiority claim (41% F1 improvement): High confidence
- Receptive field limitation explanation: Medium confidence
- AE classification importance: High confidence

## Next Checks
1. Implement the neuro-symbolic FSM with minimal viable state definitions and verify it achieves comparable F1 scores on the described dataset
2. Conduct controlled experiments varying receptive field sizes to quantify the impact of temporal context limitations
3. Perform ablation studies comparing AE classifier only, FSM only, and neural-only approaches to isolate performance contributions
