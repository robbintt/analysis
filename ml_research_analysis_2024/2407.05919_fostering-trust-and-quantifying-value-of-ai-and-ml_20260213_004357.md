- The paper proposes a quantitative framework for measuring trust in AI/ML systems using weighted metric aggregation and eigenvector analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the gap between high-level discussions of trust in AI/ML systems and practical implementation by proposing a quantitative framework to measure trustworthiness. The framework defines trust as willingness to interact with AI/ML while acknowledging fallibility, then quantifies it through metrics across seven categories. A trust score is computed via dot product of metric vectors and importance weights, and a "fair trading region" is defined using eigenvectors to maintain balanced value exchange between providers and users. The approach provides actionable metrics for both AI/ML system providers and users to build and maintain trust.

## Method Summary
The framework quantifies trust in AI/ML systems by computing a trust score through dot product of metric vectors and importance weights, with metrics spanning seven categories: reliability/validity, safety, security/resilience, accountability/transparency, explainability/interpretability, privacy, and bias management. The method involves defining numerical metrics for each category, assigning importance weights (with negative weights for undesirable factors), calculating the trust score using W = M·Sᵀ, and determining a fair trading region using eigenvector analysis of value exchange matrices. The framework also models temporal trust dynamics through bounded oscillations around equilibrium values.

## Key Results
- Trust score computation through weighted metric aggregation captures both positive and negative trust factors
- Fair trading region ensures sustainable value exchange between provider and user via eigenvector analysis
- Temporal trust dynamics follow predictable oscillation patterns that can be modeled and monitored

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Trust score computation through weighted metric aggregation captures both positive and negative trust factors.
- Mechanism: The trust score W is computed as a dot product between metric vector M and importance weight vector S, where S contains negative weights for undesirable metrics like crashes and false positives.
- Core assumption: Individual metrics can be meaningfully normalized to a common scale and their relative importance can be captured through fixed weights.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A trust score is computed via dot product of metric vectors and importance weights"
  - [section] "The dot product between M and S produces the Trust Score W"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence found for this specific dot product approach
- Break condition: If metrics cannot be normalized consistently across different AI systems or if weight importance varies significantly by context.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The fair trading region ensures sustainable value exchange between provider and user.
- Mechanism: Eigenvector analysis of the value exchange matrix identifies the equilibrium line where both parties perceive fair trade, scaling proportionally with service changes.
- Core assumption: Linear transformations of value exchange maintain fairness when projected onto the principal eigenvector.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "the eigenvector associated with the largest, positive eigenvalue... can be interpreted as the region where both parties should consider transactions between them as fair trade"
  - [section] "any point on it carries the maximum accumulated value A and net gains N, for the trustor and trustee, respectively"
  - [corpus] Missing - no corpus evidence found for eigenvector-based fair trading regions
- Break condition: If the linear transformation assumption fails (non-linear value perception) or if eigenvectors don't capture the fairness relationship.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temporal trust dynamics follow predictable oscillation patterns that can be modeled.
- Mechanism: Trust score W fluctuates over time with gentle variations around equilibrium, avoiding extreme roller-coaster behavior that would lead to user disengagement.
- Core assumption: Trust behavior exhibits bounded fluctuations rather than chaotic or extreme swings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The framework also defines a 'fair trading region' using eigenvectors to maintain balanced value exchange between providers and users"
  - [section] "The trust score W is expected to display fluctuations over time... those fluctuations are presumed to be narrow and gentle, rather than wide and abrupt"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence found for specific trust oscillation patterns
- Break condition: If real-world trust data shows highly variable or chaotic patterns that don't match the gentle fluctuation assumption.

## Foundational Learning

- Linear Algebra (Dot Products and Eigenvectors)
  - Why needed here: Trust score computation uses dot products, and fair trading region uses eigenvector analysis
  - Quick check question: How do you compute the dot product of two vectors and what does it represent geometrically?

- Game Theory and Trust Games
  - Why needed here: The framework models trust as an extensive form game between trustor and trustee with repeated interactions
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes an extensive form game from a normal form game in game theory?

- Machine Learning Evaluation Metrics
  - Why needed here: The framework uses specific ML metrics (precision, recall, F1, etc.) as components of the trust score
  - Quick check question: How do true positive rate and false positive rate differ, and why are both important for trust measurement?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Metric Collection Service -> Weight Management System -> Trust Score Calculator -> Fair Trading Analyzer -> Time Series Tracker

- Critical path:
  Metric Collection → Trust Score Calculation → Fair Trading Analysis → Trust Score Monitoring

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed vs. dynamic weights: Fixed weights provide consistency but may not adapt to context; dynamic weights adapt but require sophisticated learning
  - Granularity of metrics: More granular metrics provide better insight but increase complexity and data collection burden
  - Real-time vs. batch processing: Real-time enables immediate feedback but requires more resources; batch processing is efficient but has latency

- Failure signatures:
  - Trust score instability: Sudden large fluctuations suggest metric collection problems or inappropriate weight assignments
  - Fair trading region breakdown: Eigenvalue computation failure or non-independent eigenvectors indicate model assumption violations
  - Weight dominance: One or two metrics dominate the trust score, suggesting poor weight distribution

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic trust score calculation with mock metrics and fixed weights; verify dot product computation and score range constraints
  2. Test fair trading region computation with synthetic value exchange data; validate eigenvector identification and fair trade line calculation
  3. Create time series simulation of trust score fluctuations; implement smoothing algorithm and verify bounded oscillation behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal threshold value T that balances trust-building and operational efficiency across different AI/ML domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions a minimum threshold T where trustor trustworthiness increases when pV ≥ T and K ≥ 1, but doesn't specify what constitutes an optimal T value
- Why unresolved: The paper treats T as a variable without empirical determination of what constitutes meaningful thresholds across different AI/ML applications
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies across multiple AI/ML domains measuring user trust responses at different T values, correlating threshold levels with actual adoption rates and user satisfaction metrics

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the temporal oscillation of trust scores differ between high-stakes and low-stakes AI applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses temporal nature of trust and expects "gentle fluctuations" but doesn't differentiate between application contexts or provide data on fluctuation patterns
- Why unresolved: The paper assumes similar temporal behavior across all AI systems without considering domain-specific trust dynamics and risk tolerances
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking trust score fluctuations in both high-stakes (medical diagnosis) and low-stakes (movie recommendations) applications, analyzing variance patterns and user tolerance thresholds

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between specific trust score components and actual user adoption/retention rates?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes a trust score framework with 7 categories and numerous metrics but doesn't empirically validate which components most strongly predict user behavior
- Why unresolved: The paper presents a theoretical framework without empirical testing to determine which metrics are most predictive of real-world trust and adoption outcomes
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation studies between trust score components and actual user adoption, retention, and churn data across multiple AI/ML systems, identifying which metrics have the strongest predictive power for business outcomes

## Limitations
- Lack of empirical validation: The framework presents theoretical foundations without testing correlation between computed trust scores and actual user trust behavior
- Fixed-weight assumption: The approach assumes static metric importance across different contexts, which may not reflect real-world variations in trust perception
- Linear transformation oversimplification: Eigenvector-based fair trading region relies on linear value transformations that may oversimplify complex human value judgments

## Confidence
- Mathematical framework: High
- Practical applicability: Medium
- Empirical validation: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct correlation studies comparing computed trust scores with actual user trust metrics (e.g., continued usage, feedback ratings) across different AI systems and use cases.
2. Test the framework's sensitivity to dynamic weight adjustments by implementing an A/B testing scenario where weights adapt based on user feedback and measuring impact on trust score accuracy.
3. Validate the fair trading region assumption by surveying both AI providers and users to compare their perceived fairness of value exchange against the framework's eigenvector predictions.
