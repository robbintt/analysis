## Executive Summary
This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework for train timetable rescheduling (TTR) in high-speed railways. The approach addresses the challenge of restoring normal train operations after unexpected delays or disruptions. The key innovation is a graph representation of the TTR problem, where a directed graph encodes train operation constraints, and a graph neural network extracts informative states automatically. The method achieves better performance than handcrafted rules and state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining low computational costs suitable for real-time applications.

## Method Summary
The proposed method represents the TTR problem as a directed graph, where nodes represent train operations and edges encode constraints. A graph neural network is employed to automatically extract informative states from this representation. The reinforcement learning framework incorporates a tree search procedure to generate feasible solutions while decoupling the decision model from problem size. To handle varying delay scenarios, a learning curriculum with unbalanced instance sampling and knowledge distillation is proposed. Additionally, a local search method is introduced to improve solution quality with minimal computational overhead.

## Key Results
- Graph representation and GNN extraction outperform handcrafted rules and state-of-the-art solvers
- The method maintains computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications
- Scalable performance across different problem sizes and delay levels
- Better solution quality compared to traditional approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages graph representation learning to capture complex interdependencies between trains in railway networks. The GNN automatically learns relevant features from the graph structure, enabling the RL agent to make informed rescheduling decisions. The tree search procedure ensures solution feasibility while the curriculum learning strategy improves generalization across different disruption scenarios. The local search component refines solutions without significant computational overhead.
