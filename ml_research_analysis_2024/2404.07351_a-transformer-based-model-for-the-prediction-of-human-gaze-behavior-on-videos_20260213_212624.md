# A Transformer-Based Model for the Prediction of Human Gaze Behavior on Videos

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.07351
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07351
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Transformer-based RL model achieves significant improvements in gaze prediction accuracy on VirtualHome dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a transformer-based reinforcement learning approach for predicting human gaze behavior in third-person videos. The authors formulate gaze prediction as a sequential decision-making problem, training an agent to replicate human gaze patterns through a Decision Transformer architecture. The model processes video frames using a ResNet-50 visual encoder and predicts gaze coordinates across the entire video sequence. Experimental results on the VirtualHome dataset demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, with the model also showing effectiveness in downstream tasks like action recognition and activity prediction.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning approach for gaze prediction. The method uses a Decision Transformer agent that conditions on expected rewards, prior states, and actions to generate future gaze predictions. The visual encoder (ResNet-50) processes video frames to obtain state embeddings, while the transformer architecture captures long-range dependencies in gaze behavior. The model is trained to maximize cumulative rewards based on the difference between predicted and actual gaze locations, using a negative distance metric as the reward signal.

## Key Results
- The transformer-based RL model achieves significantly lower mean distance error compared to baseline methods (Random and Behavior Cloning) on the VirtualHome dataset
- The model demonstrates effective generalization to unseen videos by learning task-relevant gaze patterns
- Integration with action recognition models shows competitive performance compared to methods using real human gaze data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The transformer-based RL agent learns to predict human gaze sequences by maximizing cumulative rewards based on the difference between predicted and actual gaze locations. The model processes video frames using a visual encoder (ResNet-50) to obtain state embeddings, then conditions a Decision Transformer on expected rewards, prior states, and actions to generate future gaze predictions. The reward signal is the negative distance between predicted and ground truth gaze coordinates.

### Mechanism 2
The model effectively captures long-range dependencies in gaze behavior through the transformer architecture's attention mechanisms. By leveraging the transformer's self-attention layers, the model can consider the entire history of gaze positions and video context when predicting future gaze locations, rather than being limited to local temporal patterns.

### Mechanism 3
The model generalizes well to unseen videos by learning to identify task-relevant regions through reinforcement learning. During training, the agent learns to focus on regions that are most informative for understanding the video content, which corresponds to areas where humans typically look. This learned policy generalizes to new videos with similar content or tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning fundamentals (states, actions, rewards, policy)
  - Why needed here: The entire gaze prediction approach is formulated as an RL problem where the agent learns a policy to predict gaze locations
  - Quick check question: What are the three components that the Decision Transformer conditions on to generate future actions?

- Concept: Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: The model uses a transformer-based architecture to process video sequences and predict gaze behavior
  - Quick check question: How does the self-attention mechanism in transformers differ from traditional recurrent neural networks in handling sequential data?

- Concept: Computer vision feature extraction (CNNs, ResNet)
  - Why needed here: The model uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 as a visual encoder to extract features from video frames before processing them with the transformer
  - Quick check question: What is the primary advantage of using a pre-trained ResNet model as a visual encoder in this gaze prediction framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video frames -> ResNet-50 visual encoder -> State embedding -> Decision Transformer -> Predicted gaze coordinates

- Critical path:
  1. Video frame → ResNet-50 → State embedding
  2. State embedding + previous actions + return-to-go → Decision Transformer
  3. Decision Transformer → Predicted gaze coordinates
  4. Compute reward (negative distance to ground truth)
  5. Update model weights via MSE loss

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using ResNet-50 provides strong visual features but adds computational overhead
  - The Decision Transformer approach handles long sequences well but may be less sample-efficient than traditional RL methods
  - Predicting continuous gaze coordinates allows fine-grained predictions but requires careful reward shaping

- Failure signatures:
  - High MSE loss during training indicates poor gaze prediction accuracy
  - Predicted gaze trajectories that don't follow human-like patterns (e.g., jumping erratically)
  - Poor performance on downstream tasks (action recognition) despite good gaze prediction metrics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train the model on a small subset of the dataset and visualize predicted vs. ground truth gaze trajectories to check for basic functionality
  2. Compare MSE loss and distance error metrics against the Random and BC baselines to verify improvements
  3. Integrate the gaze predictor with a simple action recognition model and measure performance improvement over using no gaze information

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the main text.

## Limitations
- The VirtualHome simulator dataset represents synthetic environments that may not fully capture the complexity of real-world gaze behavior
- The study only reports performance on a single dataset without external validation on real-world eye-tracking data
- The transformer-based RL approach adds significant computational overhead compared to simpler baseline methods

## Confidence

- High confidence: The transformer-based architecture and RL formulation are technically sound
- Medium confidence: The reported improvements over baseline methods are significant, but the synthetic nature of the dataset limits generalizability
- Medium confidence: The downstream task improvements (action recognition) are promising but require further validation on real-world datasets

## Next Checks

1. Validate the model on real-world eye-tracking datasets (e.g., Hollywood-2 or DIEM) to assess generalization beyond synthetic data
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of the transformer architecture versus simpler temporal models
3. Perform qualitative analysis of failure cases to understand when and why the model fails to predict human-like gaze behavior
