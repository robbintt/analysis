# FaithFill: Faithful Inpainting for Object Completion Using a Single Reference Image

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.07865
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07865
- Authors: Rupayan Mallick; Amr Abdalla; Sarah Adel Bargal
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: FaithFill achieves state-of-the-art performance on faithful inpainting using a single reference image, outperforming existing methods on most image similarity metrics and human judgment studies.

## Executive Summary
FaithFill addresses the challenge of faithfully inpainting missing object parts using only a single reference image, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require multiple images or lack faithfulness in preserving object attributes. The method generates multiple views of the object from the reference image using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), then finetunes a diffusion model on these views to achieve faithful inpainting. FaithFill demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques on the DreamBooth and FaithFill datasets, achieving best results on most image similarity metrics (SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, DreamSIM, DINO, CLIP) and human judgment studies. The method successfully preserves object shape, texture, and color while maintaining background integrity during inpainting.

## Method Summary
FaithFill is a novel approach for object completion that leverages a single reference image to faithfully inpaint missing parts of objects. The method works by first generating multiple views of the object from the reference image using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which allows for comprehensive coverage of the object from different angles. These generated views are then used to finetune a diffusion model, specifically designed to learn the faithful representation of the object's attributes. The finetuned diffusion model is then applied to inpaint the missing parts of the object in the target image, ensuring that the inpainted regions closely match the object's original shape, texture, and color. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing methods that either require multiple reference images or fail to preserve object attributes accurately during inpainting.

## Key Results
- FaithFill achieves best results on most image similarity metrics (SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, DreamSIM, DINO, CLIP) compared to state-of-the-art techniques
- Human judgment studies confirm FaithFill's superiority in faithful inpainting performance
- The method successfully preserves object shape, texture, and color while maintaining background integrity during inpainting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FaithFill works by leveraging the power of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate multiple views of an object from a single reference image. This multi-view generation is crucial because it provides the diffusion model with comprehensive information about the object's appearance from different angles, which is essential for faithful inpainting. By finetuning the diffusion model on these generated views, FaithFill ensures that the model learns a robust representation of the object's attributes, including its shape, texture, and color. This learned representation enables the model to accurately inpaint missing parts while maintaining the object's original characteristics, even when only a single reference image is available.

## Foundational Learning

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)
- Why needed: Generate multiple views of an object from a single reference image to provide comprehensive coverage for training
- Quick check: Verify that generated views capture object from multiple angles with consistent attributes

Diffusion Models
- Why needed: Learn faithful representation of object attributes for accurate inpainting
- Quick check: Confirm model can generate realistic inpainting results on seen data

Object Attribute Preservation
- Why needed: Ensure inpainted regions match original object characteristics
- Quick check: Measure similarity between inpainted and original object attributes using multiple metrics

Single Reference Image Constraint
- Why needed: Address practical limitation where multiple reference images may not be available
- Quick check: Test performance degradation when reference image quality decreases

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Reference Image -> NeRF View Generation -> View Augmentation -> Diffusion Model Finetuning -> Inpainting Application

Critical Path:
The critical path flows from reference image through NeRF view generation to diffusion model finetuning, as these components directly enable the faithful inpainting capability. View augmentation and inpainting application are important but secondary to the core learning pipeline.

Design Tradeoffs:
FaithFill trades computational complexity (NeRF generation and diffusion finetuning) for the ability to work with single reference images and achieve higher faithfulness. This approach requires more processing time but enables applications where multiple reference images are unavailable.

Failure Signatures:
Poor reference image quality leads to degraded view generation, resulting in artifacts in inpainted regions. Complex object geometries may cause NeRFs to generate inaccurate views, propagating errors to the final inpainting. The method also fails on articulated objects due to the rigid object assumption.

First Experiments:
1. Test NeRF view generation quality on reference images with varying resolutions and lighting conditions
2. Measure diffusion model learning efficiency across different numbers of generated views
3. Evaluate inpainting accuracy on objects with simple versus complex geometries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- FaithFill is currently limited to rigid objects and cannot handle articulated objects or deformable structures
- The method relies heavily on NeRF-based view generation, which may introduce artifacts when reference image quality is low or object geometries are complex
- Dependence on reference images raises questions about scalability and applicability when reference images may not be available or may not match the target object well

## Confidence

Object attribute preservation: Medium
Background preservation: High
State-of-the-art performance claims: Low-Medium

## Next Checks

1. Test FaithFill on articulated objects and deformable structures to quantify the exact performance drop and identify specific failure modes when handling non-rigid objects.

2. Conduct ablation studies systematically removing the NeRF component to determine the specific contribution of view generation to overall performance improvements.

3. Evaluate FaithFill on out-of-distribution reference images where the reference object differs significantly from the target object to assess robustness to domain shift.
