# Mission: Impossible Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.06416
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06416
- Reference count: 40
- This paper challenges the claim that large language models (LLMs) can learn impossible human languages as easily as natural ones.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models can learn "impossible" languages - linguistic systems that violate fundamental universals of human language. The authors systematically modify English data to create synthetic impossible languages with unnatural word orders and grammar rules, ranging from random word shuffles to count-based verb marking. They train GPT-2 small models on these languages and evaluate their learning efficiency using perplexity and targeted surprisal tests. The primary finding is that GPT-2 models struggle to learn impossible languages compared to English, particularly those involving count-based grammatical rules. This work provides experimental evidence against claims that LLMs are equally capable of learning possible and impossible languages, suggesting that these models do have preferences for natural language structures.

## Method Summary
The authors created synthetic impossible languages by systematically altering English data with unnatural word orders and grammar rules. They used three main transformations: random word shuffles, mirror word order inversions, and count-based verb marking (adding verb suffixes based on token frequency). GPT-2 small models were trained on these modified datasets and evaluated using perplexity scores and targeted surprisal tests that measured the models' ability to predict correct word forms. The researchers also conducted causal abstraction analysis to understand how models develop solutions to unnatural patterns, examining whether the models created modular representations for different grammatical features.

## Key Results
- GPT-2 models show significantly higher perplexity on impossible languages compared to natural English
- Models achieve lower accuracy on count-based grammatical rules in impossible languages
- Causal abstraction analysis reveals models develop modular solutions to unnatural patterns but with reduced effectiveness
- None of the impossible languages were successfully learned by the model compared to English

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying this work involves how language models learn statistical patterns from training data. Natural languages follow certain universal constraints that emerge from human cognition and communication needs. When training data violates these constraints through impossible language constructions, the models must learn to predict sequences that lack the statistical regularities present in natural language. The models attempt to find patterns in the impossible languages, but without the typical correlations between grammatical features that exist in natural languages, they cannot form efficient representations. This results in higher perplexity scores and reduced accuracy on grammatical tasks.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Universal Grammar** - The theoretical framework suggesting all human languages share certain fundamental properties
   *Why needed:* Provides the basis for distinguishing between possible and impossible languages
   *Quick check:* Can you identify which linguistic universals are being violated in each impossible language variant?

2. **Perplexity** - A measurement of how well a probability model predicts a sample
   *Why needed:* Serves as the primary metric for evaluating language model learning efficiency
   *Quick check:* Lower perplexity indicates better model performance on language prediction tasks

3. **Causal Abstraction Analysis** - A technique for understanding how neural networks represent and process information
   *Why needed:* Reveals how models develop modular solutions to different grammatical features
   *Quick check:* Does the model create separate representations for different grammatical components?

4. **Surprisal Theory** - The concept that language processing difficulty relates to prediction uncertainty
   *Why needed:* Provides theoretical foundation for understanding model behavior on grammatical tasks
   *Quick check:* Higher surprisal indicates greater difficulty in predicting upcoming words

5. **Language Universals** - Properties that occur in all natural human languages
   *Why needed:* Defines the boundary between possible and impossible languages
   *Quick check:* Which universals are violated in each impossible language construction?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Text -> Tokenization -> Transformer Layers -> Attention Mechanisms -> Output Predictions

**Critical Path:** The model processes input text through multiple transformer layers where self-attention mechanisms learn contextual relationships between tokens. The attention heads identify patterns in word co-occurrence and grammatical dependencies.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The GPT-2 architecture prioritizes next-token prediction accuracy over explicit grammatical representation. This design choice means the model learns statistical patterns rather than formal grammatical rules, making it vulnerable when those patterns violate natural language constraints.

**Failure Signatures:** High perplexity scores, incorrect grammatical predictions, and fragmented attention patterns indicate the model's struggle with impossible language constructions. The model shows systematic errors on count-based grammatical rules and unnatural word orders.

**First Experiments:** 
1. Train GPT-2 small on random word order impossible language and measure perplexity
2. Test model accuracy on count-based verb marking task in impossible language
3. Compare attention pattern visualizations between natural and impossible language training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study is based on a single model architecture (GPT-2 small) and may not generalize to larger models or different architectures
- The evaluation metrics (perplexity and targeted surprisal tests) may not fully capture the complexity of language learning
- The paper does not specify what threshold of perplexity or accuracy would constitute successful learning of impossible languages
- The study focuses on a narrow range of impossible language features, potentially missing other types of linguistic violations

## Confidence
- High confidence: The observation that GPT-2 models show lower learning efficiency for impossible languages compared to natural English is supported by the experimental results across multiple impossible language variants and evaluation metrics.
- Medium confidence: The claim that models develop modular solutions to unnatural patterns is based on causal abstraction analysis, which provides insights but may not capture all aspects of model behavior or learning mechanisms.
- Low confidence: The broader claim that LLMs have inherent preferences for natural language structures cannot be definitively established from this study alone, given the limited scope of models and impossible language constructions tested.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the experiments with larger language models (GPT-2 medium/large, GPT-3 variants) to assess whether model size affects the ability to learn impossible languages.
2. Conduct human benchmark studies where native English speakers attempt to learn the same impossible languages to establish baseline performance and compare human versus model learning patterns.
3. Test additional impossible language constructions that violate different linguistic universals (e.g., structure-dependent rules, long-distance dependencies) to determine whether certain types of impossible languages are more learnable than others.
