core_contribution: This paper identifies and maps eight fairness desiderata along
  the AI lifecycle, addressing the gap between current technical fairness work and
  broader conceptualizations of fairness. The authors propose that explainable AI
  (XAI) can contribute to fairness understanding, data fairness, formal fairness,
  perceived fairness, fairness with human oversight, empowering fairness, long-term
  fairness, and informational fairness at different stages of the AI lifecycle.

# Mapping the Potential of Explainable AI for Fairness Along the AI Lifecycle

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2404.18736
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18736
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Identifies eight fairness desiderata across AI lifecycle and maps XAI's potential contributions to each

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the disconnect between technical fairness work and broader conceptualizations of fairness by mapping eight distinct fairness desiderata across the AI lifecycle. The authors propose that explainable AI (XAI) can contribute to fairness understanding, data fairness, formal fairness, perceived fairness, fairness with human oversight, empowering fairness, long-term fairness, and informational fairness at different stages of AI development and deployment. Through a case study of the COMPAS recidivism prediction software, they demonstrate how XAI approaches could have addressed various fairness concerns throughout its lifecycle, providing a comprehensive framework for considering fairness in AI systems.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic literature review of both technical AI fairness literature and broader social science and philosophy of technology work on fairness concepts. They identified eight distinct fairness desiderata that span the AI lifecycle and developed a conceptual mapping of how XAI techniques could contribute to each desideratum at different stages. The COMPAS case study served as an illustrative example to demonstrate the practical application of this mapping framework, showing how different XAI approaches could have addressed fairness concerns during data collection, model development, testing, and deployment phases.

## Key Results
- Identified eight fairness desiderata spanning AI lifecycle: fairness understanding, data fairness, formal fairness, perceived fairness, fairness with human oversight, empowering fairness, long-term fairness, and informational fairness
- Demonstrated through COMPAS case study how XAI could address multiple fairness objectives at different lifecycle stages
- Highlighted the importance of integrating fairness considerations throughout AI development rather than treating it as a post-hoc concern

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Foundational Learning
1. **Fairness as multidimensional concept** - Fairness encompasses technical, social, and ethical dimensions that evolve throughout AI system lifecycle
   - Why needed: Prevents narrow technical focus that misses broader fairness implications
   - Quick check: Can you identify at least three different types of fairness in a given AI system?

2. **Lifecycle approach to AI fairness** - Fairness considerations should be integrated at all stages from conception through deployment and monitoring
   - Why needed: Ensures fairness isn't an afterthought but embedded in system design
   - Quick check: Does your fairness framework address pre-development, development, and post-deployment phases?

3. **Explainability as fairness enabler** - XAI techniques can reveal biases, support stakeholder understanding, and enable meaningful oversight
   - Why needed: Transparency is prerequisite for detecting and addressing fairness issues
   - Quick check: Can stakeholders use your explanations to identify potential fairness problems?

### Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Data collection -> Model development -> Testing/validation -> Deployment -> Monitoring -> Feedback loops

**Critical path**: Fairness understanding → Data fairness → Formal fairness → Perceived fairness → Empowering fairness

**Design tradeoffs**: Balancing technical fairness metrics against stakeholder perceptions and long-term impacts requires careful consideration of which explanations to prioritize

**Failure signatures**: 
- Explanations that obscure rather than reveal fairness issues
- Technical fairness improvements that reduce perceived fairness
- Short-term fairness gains that create long-term harms

**First 3 experiments**:
1. Test whether different XAI techniques reveal different types of fairness issues in training data
2. Evaluate stakeholder understanding of fairness explanations across different user groups
3. Measure the impact of XAI-enabled fairness interventions on system outcomes over time

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions regarding the practical implementation and effectiveness of XAI for fairness, particularly around the empirical validation of proposed mappings, the trade-offs between different fairness objectives, and the actual impact on end-user understanding and trust. The authors call for more user studies and field experiments to test these concepts in real-world settings.

## Limitations
- The mapping between XAI capabilities and fairness desiderata remains largely theoretical without empirical validation
- The COMPAS case study provides illustrative examples but doesn't demonstrate actual implementation of proposed XAI approaches
- Practical utility and implementation challenges of using XAI for long-term fairness and informational fairness remain largely unexplored

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Identification and categorization of eight distinct fairness desiderata along AI lifecycle
- **Medium confidence**: Proposed mapping between XAI capabilities and fairness desiderata is logically coherent but lacks empirical validation
- **Low confidence**: Practical utility and implementation challenges of XAI for long-term fairness and informational fairness

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies to test the effectiveness of specific XAI techniques for each identified fairness desiderata in real-world AI systems
2. Evaluate the trade-offs and potential conflicts between different fairness objectives when implementing XAI solutions across the lifecycle
3. Investigate the actual impact of XAI-enabled fairness interventions on end-user understanding and trust in AI systems through user studies and field experiments
