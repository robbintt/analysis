# Structural Causality-based Generalizable Concept Discovery Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.15491
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15491
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: Novel framework for discovering interpretable task-specific concepts in deep neural networks using disentangled generative factors and structural causal models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of discovering interpretable task-specific concepts in deep neural networks. The authors propose a novel framework that learns disentangled generative factors using a variational autoencoder (VAE) and maps them to task-specific concepts through a structural causal model (SCM). The key innovation lies in assuming a bipartite graph structure between generative factors and concepts, with directed causal edges from factors to concepts. Experiments on D-Sprites and Shapes3D datasets with known generative factors demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines a variational autoencoder for learning disentangled generative factors with a structural causal model for mapping these factors to task-specific concepts. The VAE learns mutually independent generative factors Z from the data, which are then transformed into task-specific concepts C via a learned causal matrix A. The downstream task label y is predicted as a weighted sum of these concepts. The method is trained jointly on reconstruction, disentanglement, and task performance objectives.

## Key Results
- Successfully learns task-specific concepts that are well-explained by causal edges from generative factors
- Achieves high accuracy on binary downstream tasks (2-GF and 3-GF classification)
- Demonstrates generalizable approach that works for arbitrary numbers of concepts and downstream tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Task-specific concepts are derived by mapping generative factors through a learned causal matrix. A VAE learns disentangled generative factors Z, which are then transformed into task-specific concepts C via a structural causal model with a learned causal matrix A. The concepts C are conditioned on the task, not the generative factors. The core assumption is a bipartite graph structure with directed edges from factors to concepts. Evidence comes from the abstract statement about bipartite graphs and structural causal models, though corpus evidence is weak for this specific bipartite graph assumption.

### Mechanism 2
The VAE learns mutually independent generative factors by minimizing KL divergence between the learned distribution and a standard Gaussian prior. The VAE encoder learns a posterior distribution qϕ(z|x) for latent representations z, and the decoder learns pθ(x|z) for data distribution. The ELBO criterion with KL divergence term encourages learned factors to be independent. This is well-supported by corpus evidence for VAE-based disentanglement in related works.

### Mechanism 3
Task performance is improved by learning a weight matrix W that assigns appropriate weights to task-specific concepts. The downstream task label y is predicted as a weighted sum of concepts with bias. The weight matrix W is learned during training to optimize task performance. This assumes the task can be accurately predicted using a linear combination of task-specific concepts, though corpus evidence for this specific weighting mechanism is weak.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
  - Why needed here: VAEs are used to learn the disentangled generative factors Z from the data
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the KL divergence term in the VAE's ELBO criterion?

- Concept: Structural Causal Models (SCMs)
  - Why needed here: SCMs are used to model the causal relationships between generative factors Z and task-specific concepts C
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a causal and a correlational relationship in the context of concepts and generative factors?

- Concept: Disentanglement
  - Why needed here: Disentanglement ensures that learned generative factors Z are independent and capture distinct aspects of the data
  - Quick check question: Why is disentanglement important for interpretability in deep learning models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: VAE Encoder -> VAE Decoder -> Causal Matrix A -> Weight Matrix W -> Task Predictor
- Critical path: 1) Train VAE to learn disentangled generative factors Z, 2) Learn causal matrix A to map Z to task-specific concepts C, 3) Learn weight matrix W to optimize task performance
- Design tradeoffs: Reconstruction quality vs. disentanglement (higher KL divergence weights may lead to better disentanglement but worse reconstructions), Concept diversity vs. task accuracy (higher classification loss weights may improve accuracy but reduce concept diversity)
- Failure signatures: Poor reconstruction quality (VAE not learning generative factors effectively), Inaccurate task predictions (causal matrix A or weight matrix W not capturing correct relationships), Concept entanglement (learned concepts not truly independent or task-specific)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Train VAE on simple dataset (D-Sprites) and visualize learned generative factors, 2) Learn causal matrix A and visualize relationships between generative factors and concepts for specific task, 3) Evaluate task performance on held-out test set and compare with baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the proposed method perform on datasets with a larger number of generative factors or more complex data distributions? The paper focuses on datasets with known generative factors and relatively small number of factors (6), mentioning generalizability but not providing empirical evidence for more complex scenarios.

### Open Question 2
How sensitive is the proposed method to choice of hyperparameters, particularly weights controlling KL divergence (β1, β2) and classification loss (δ)? The paper mentions sensitivity to hyperparameters and provides some guidance on selection, but does not conduct thorough sensitivity analysis.

### Open Question 3
How does the proposed method compare to other existing approaches for concept discovery and disentanglement, particularly those that do not assume known generative factors? The paper mentions related work on concept-based explanations and disentanglement, but does not provide direct comparison to these methods.

## Limitations
- Key assumption of bipartite graph structure between generative factors and concepts remains unverified on real-world datasets where ground-truth factors are unknown
- Performance on complex, high-dimensional data and scalability to tasks requiring more than binary classification are unclear
- Reliance on known generative factors for concept validation limits generalizability of the approach

## Confidence
- High: VAE-based disentanglement of generative factors (well-established method with strong corpus support)
- Medium: Structural causal model mapping to task-specific concepts (novel combination but based on established principles)
- Low: Generalization to arbitrary downstream tasks without known generative factors (currently only validated on controlled datasets)

## Next Checks
1. Apply the method to a real-world dataset (e.g., CelebA) where generative factors are not known, and evaluate interpretability of discovered concepts using human studies or alternative metrics
2. Test the method on multi-class classification tasks or regression problems to assess flexibility and scalability beyond binary classification
3. Investigate impact of varying number of concepts and complexity of downstream task on method's performance and quality of learned concepts
