# forester: A Tree-Based AutoML Tool in R

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.04789
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04789
- Reference count: 6
- Forester is an AutoML package in R that automates tree-based model training for tabular data

## Executive Summary
Forester is an open-source AutoML package implemented in R designed for training high-quality tree-based models on tabular data. The package addresses the need for accessible AutoML solutions in R, where options are limited compared to Python ecosystems. Forester automates the entire machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing through model training and evaluation, supporting binary and multiclass classification, regression, and survival analysis tasks.

The tool offers ease of use with custom preprocessing options, extensive model evaluation metrics, and automated reporting capabilities. It has gained popularity with over 100 GitHub stars and is actively used in research studies, filling a significant gap in the R ecosystem for comprehensive automated solutions for building tree-based models on tabular data.

## Method Summary
Forester implements an automated machine learning pipeline that handles tabular data through five main pillars: data checking, custom preprocessing, data preparation, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. The package supports tree-based models including decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and random survival forests. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using random search and Bayesian optimization methods. The package provides comprehensive evaluation metrics tailored to different task types and generates automated reports summarizing results.

## Key Results
- Automates the entire ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation
- Supports binary/multiclass classification, regression, and survival analysis tasks
- Offers custom preprocessing options including missing data imputation and feature selection
- Provides extensive evaluation metrics and automated reporting capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Forester automates the entire ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation, reducing the need for manual intervention.
- Mechanism: By integrating data checking, custom preprocessing, model training, and evaluation into a single pipeline, Forester minimizes repetitive tasks and allows users to focus on result analysis.
- Core assumption: The automation of these steps does not compromise the quality of the models compared to manual approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The forester is an open-source AutoML package implemented in R designed for training high-quality tree-based models on tabular data."
  - [section] "The forester is an AutoML package automating the machine learning pipeline, starting from the data preparation, through model training, to the interpretation of the results."
- Break condition: If the automated preprocessing steps introduce biases or errors that significantly degrade model performance, the core assumption is violated.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Forester provides extensive model evaluation metrics tailored to different task types, enabling comprehensive performance assessment.
- Mechanism: The package calculates a wide range of metrics for binary and multiclass classification, regression, and survival analysis tasks, allowing users to evaluate models from multiple perspectives.
- Core assumption: The selected metrics are appropriate and sufficient for assessing model performance across various tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The package assesses performance using a comprehensive set of metrics tailored to different task types."
  - [section] "Accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC), F1 score, recall, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy are used for the evaluation of the binary classification tasks."
- Break condition: If the provided metrics fail to capture important aspects of model performance for specific tasks or datasets, the evaluation may be incomplete.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Forester offers custom preprocessing options that allow users to address specific data quality issues.
- Mechanism: The custom preprocessing module provides options for removing corrupted features, imputing missing data, and selecting relevant features, enabling users to tailor the preprocessing pipeline to their dataset's needs.
- Core assumption: The custom preprocessing options are effective in improving data quality and model performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It fully supports binary and multiclass classification, regression, and partially survival analysis tasks."
  - [section] "The module covers three major parts of data quality enhancements: the removal of corrupted features, the imputation of missing data, and feature selection."
- Break condition: If the custom preprocessing options are not effective in handling specific data quality issues, or if they introduce new problems, the core assumption is violated.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tree-based models
  - Why needed here: Forester focuses on tree-based models, so understanding their strengths and limitations is crucial for effective use.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages of using tree-based models for tabular data compared to other model types?

- Concept: Hyperparameter tuning
  - Why needed here: Forester offers hyperparameter tuning through random search and Bayesian optimization, so understanding these techniques is important for optimizing model performance.
  - Quick check question: How do random search and Bayesian optimization differ in their approach to exploring the hyperparameter space?

- Concept: Model interpretability
  - Why needed here: Forester supports model explanations through integration with DALEX, so understanding interpretable machine learning is valuable for analyzing model behavior.
  - Quick check question: What are the benefits of using interpretable machine learning techniques, and how can they help in detecting model misbehavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data check -> Custom preprocessing -> Data preparation -> Model training and tuning -> Model evaluation
- Critical path: The critical path for using Forester is: load data → check data quality → optionally customize preprocessing → train models → evaluate results → generate report.
- Design tradeoffs: Forester focuses exclusively on tree-based models, which may limit its applicability to certain tasks but ensures high-quality performance on tabular data. The package prioritizes ease of use and automation, which may sacrifice some flexibility for advanced users.
- Failure signatures: Potential failure modes include poor data quality leading to suboptimal models, inappropriate preprocessing choices, or model evaluation metrics not capturing relevant performance aspects.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run Forester on a simple, clean dataset with default settings to verify basic functionality.
  2. Test the custom preprocessing module on a dataset with missing values or irrelevant features to assess its effectiveness.
  3. Compare Forester's performance with manual model building on a benchmark dataset to evaluate the impact of automation.

## Limitations

- No comparative performance analysis against other AutoML tools or manual modeling approaches
- Limited discussion of computational efficiency and resource requirements
- Missing real-world case studies or application examples

## Confidence

- **Medium** for automation effectiveness claims: While the pipeline architecture is well-defined, performance benefits are asserted without empirical evidence
- **High** for package functionality claims: The described features align with standard AutoML practices and are technically feasible
- **Medium** for usability claims: The package design principles are sound, but user experience validation is absent

## Next Checks

1. Benchmark forester against established AutoML tools (Auto-Sklearn, H2O, AutoGluon) on standardized datasets to quantify performance differences
2. Conduct user studies with data scientists of varying experience levels to evaluate the claimed ease-of-use benefits
3. Analyze computational overhead by measuring training times across different dataset sizes and model complexities compared to manual approaches
