# Guylingo: The Republic of Guyana Creole Corpora

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.03832
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03832
- Authors: Christopher Clarke; Roland Daynauth; Charlene Wilkinson; Hubert Devonish; Jason Mars
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: GPT-4 achieved a BLEU score of 30.24 for English-to-Creole translation, outperforming fine-tuned models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GuyLingo, the first comprehensive corpus for Guyanese Creole, a low-resource language. The authors developed a translation tool using GPT-4 to generate English-Creole translation pairs and evaluated machine translation models including BART-Large, T5, and Pegasus. The best model, BART-Large, achieved a BLEU score of 12.11 for Creole-to-English translation, while GPT-4 in few-shot prompting setting achieved a BLEU score of 30.24 for English-to-Creole translation. The work demonstrates the potential of NLP advancements for the formal adoption of Creole languages in the Caribbean and highlights the importance of creating linguistic resources for low-resource languages.

## Method Summary
The authors developed GuyLingo, a comprehensive corpus containing 2,373 Guyanese Creole sentences with a vocabulary of 4,177 unique words. They created a translation tool using GPT-4 to generate English-Creole translation pairs, which were then manually reviewed and edited by experts. The corpus includes diverse linguistic data such as conversational dialogues, idiomatic expressions, proverbs, and regional variations. The authors trained and evaluated machine translation models including BART-Large, T5, and Pegasus using the GuyLingo corpus, with BART-Large achieving the best performance among fine-tuned models for Creole-to-English translation. GPT-4 was used in few-shot prompting for English-to-Creole translation and outperformed the fine-tuned models.

## Key Results
- BART-Large achieved a BLEU score of 12.11 for Creole-to-English translation
- GPT-4 in few-shot prompting achieved a BLEU score of 30.24 for English-to-Creole translation
- The GuyLingo corpus contains 2,373 Guyanese Creole sentences with 4,177 unique words

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-4 outperforms fine-tuned models in English-to-Creole translation due to its extensive pre-training on diverse text data and few-shot learning capability.
- Mechanism: GPT-4 leverages its large-scale pre-training to quickly adapt to new language pairs with minimal examples, capturing nuanced translations better than smaller, task-specific models.
- Core assumption: The few-shot examples provided to GPT-4 are representative and sufficient for guiding accurate translations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GPT-4 in few-shot prompting setting achieved a BLEU score of 30.24 for English-to-Creole translation"
  - [section 3.2]: "GPT-4 using a subset of GuyLingo training set as in-context learning examples delivers the best performance"
- Break condition: If the few-shot examples are not representative or if the language pair has very different structures that require more extensive fine-tuning.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: BART-Large achieves the best performance in Creole-to-English translation among fine-tuned models due to its denoising autoencoder architecture.
- Mechanism: BART-Large's architecture, which involves corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function and learning to reconstruct the original text, is effective for translation tasks as it learns robust representations.
- Core assumption: The noising and reconstruction process in BART-Large is beneficial for handling the complexities of Creole-to-English translation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The best model, BART-Large, achieved a BLEU score of 12.11 for Creole-to-English translation"
  - [section 3.2]: "BART-Large model achieves the best performance amongst all models"
- Break condition: If the Creole language has unique features that are not well-handled by the standard noising functions used in BART's pre-training.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The GuyLingo corpus is effective for training translation models due to its diverse and comprehensive collection of linguistic data.
- Mechanism: By including conversational dialogues, idiomatic expressions, proverbs, and regional variations, the corpus provides rich context that helps models learn the nuances of Guyanese Creole.
- Core assumption: The diversity and size of the corpus are sufficient to cover the linguistic variability needed for effective model training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2]: "GuyLingo encapsulates a diverse array of linguistic data, including but not limited to: conversational dialogues, idiomatic expressions and phrases, proverbs and folklore, regional variations and dialectical nuances"
  - [section 2.1.1]: "a collection of original Guyanese Creole sources was curated, digitized, and manually transcribed by a team of researchers"
- Break condition: If the corpus lacks sufficient examples of certain dialects or if it does not evolve with the language, leading to outdated models.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation
  - Why needed here: Understanding the basics of NLP and machine translation is essential to grasp how models like GPT-4 and BART-Large are applied to translate between English and Guyanese Creole.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between statistical machine translation and neural machine translation?

- Concept: Corpus Development and Linguistic Diversity
  - Why needed here: Knowledge of how linguistic corpora are developed and the importance of linguistic diversity is crucial for understanding the creation and utilization of the GuyLingo corpus.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important to include idiomatic expressions and regional variations in a language corpus?

- Concept: Evaluation Metrics in NLP
  - Why needed here: Familiarity with evaluation metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR is necessary to interpret the performance results of the translation models.
  - Quick check question: What does a BLEU score measure, and why is it commonly used in machine translation evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data Collection -> Corpus Building -> Translation Tool Development -> Model Training -> Evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Collect and digitize linguistic resources
  2. Build and expand the GuyLingo corpus
  3. Develop the Guyanese Creole Translation Tool
  4. Train and evaluate machine translation models
  5. Analyze results and iterate on the process

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using GPT-4 vs. fine-tuned models: GPT-4 offers better performance with few-shot learning but may be more resource-intensive and less customizable.
  - Corpus size vs. diversity: A larger corpus may improve model performance but requires more resources to curate and maintain.
  - Manual vs. automated data collection: Manual collection ensures quality but is time-consuming, while automated methods are faster but may introduce noise.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low BLEU scores indicating poor translation quality
  - Inconsistent translations across similar inputs
  - Model overfitting to the training data, resulting in poor generalization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a baseline model (e.g., T5) on the GuyLingo corpus and evaluate its performance.
  2. Implement the Guyanese Creole Translation Tool with GPT-4 and compare its translations to the baseline model.
  3. Fine-tune BART-Large on the corpus and assess improvements over the baseline model.

## Limitations

- The corpus size of 2,373 sentences may limit model generalization and scalability to other low-resource languages.
- The evaluation focuses primarily on automated metrics without extensive human evaluation to assess translation quality in real-world contexts.
- The comparison between GPT-4 and fine-tuned models is limited, as GPT-4 was used with few-shot prompting rather than being fine-tuned on the corpus.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The corpus development methodology and general framework for addressing low-resource language translation
- Medium confidence: The reported BLEU scores and relative performance rankings between models
- Low confidence: The practical utility of the translations in real-world applications without human evaluation data

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human evaluation studies with native Guyanese Creole speakers to validate the automated metric results and assess translation quality beyond BLEU scores.
2. Test model performance on out-of-domain Creole text to evaluate generalization beyond the curated corpus.
3. Perform ablation studies on corpus size to determine the minimum dataset requirements for acceptable translation quality, helping to assess the scalability of this approach to other low-resource languages.
