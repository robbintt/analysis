core_contribution: The paper introduces a training rate and survival heuristic for
  inference and robustness evaluation (TRASHFIRE) to address the problem of evaluating
  the robustness of machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, against
  adversarial attacks. The method uses survival analysis to model the time until a
  successful adversarial attack, allowing for a more accurate prediction of model
  failure compared to traditional accuracy metrics.

# A Training Rate and Survival Heuristic for Inference and Robustness Evaluation (TRASHFIRE)
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.13751
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13751
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces TRASHFIRE, using survival analysis to model time until adversarial attack success for more accurate model robustness evaluation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents TRASHFIRE, a novel approach for evaluating machine learning model robustness against adversarial attacks using survival analysis. The method addresses limitations of traditional accuracy metrics by modeling the time until successful adversarial attacks occur. Through experiments across various model architectures, defenses, and attacks, the authors demonstrate that larger neural networks do not significantly improve robustness. The TRASH score, measuring the ratio of training time to attack time, provides a practical metric for determining model security. Results show that most tested configurations are insecure, with adversarial accuracy often below 40%.

## Method Summary
TRASHFIRE employs survival analysis to model the time until successful adversarial attacks on machine learning models. The approach treats attack success as an event and models the survival function over time. The TRASH score is calculated as the ratio of training time to attack time, providing a single metric to assess model security. The method is evaluated across multiple model architectures and attack strategies, comparing traditional accuracy metrics with survival analysis results to demonstrate improved robustness evaluation.

## Key Results
- Larger neural networks do not significantly improve robustness against adversarial attacks
- Most tested model configurations are insecure with adversarial accuracy below 40%
- Survival analysis provides more accurate prediction of model failure compared to traditional accuracy metrics
- TRASH score effectively determines whether models are secure against adversarial attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by treating adversarial attacks as time-to-event problems and applying survival analysis techniques. By modeling the survival function, TRASHFIRE captures the temporal aspect of attack success, providing a more nuanced understanding of model robustness. The TRASH score directly relates training effort to attack vulnerability, offering a practical metric for security assessment. This approach overcomes limitations of point-in-time accuracy measurements by considering the duration and likelihood of successful attacks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Survival Analysis**: Statistical methods for analyzing time-to-event data; needed for modeling attack success timing; quick check: Kaplan-Meier estimator implementation
- **Adversarial Machine Learning**: Study of attacks on ML models; needed for understanding threat landscape; quick check: PGD attack implementation
- **Robustness Evaluation Metrics**: Methods for assessing model security; needed for comparison with traditional approaches; quick check: adversarial accuracy calculation
- **Neural Network Architectures**: Various model designs; needed for testing across architectures; quick check: simple CNN implementation
- **Statistical Power Analysis**: Determining sufficient sample sizes; needed for reliable survival curve estimation; quick check: power calculation for survival analysis
- **Threat Modeling**: Understanding attack scenarios; needed for comprehensive evaluation; quick check: attack surface identification

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Data -> Model Training -> Attack Generation -> Survival Analysis -> TRASH Score
- **Critical Path**: The survival analysis pipeline from attack generation to TRASH score calculation is most critical for final evaluation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balance between attack strength (for realistic security assessment) and computational feasibility; larger sample sizes improve statistical power but increase computation time
- **Failure Signatures**: High TRASH scores with low survival times indicate insecure models; convergence issues in survival curves suggest insufficient attack samples
- **First Experiments**: 1) Implement basic survival analysis on synthetic data, 2) Test PGD attacks on simple MNIST models, 3) Calculate TRASH score for baseline CNN

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited dataset size (100 samples per experiment) may not provide sufficient statistical power
- Experimental scope constrained to MNIST with limited architectural diversity
- Reliance on PGD attacks with specific parameters may not capture full spectrum of adversarial threats

## Confidence
- TRASH score as a robust metric (Confidence: Medium)
- Neural network size does not correlate with robustness (Confidence: Medium)
- Survival analysis improves robustness evaluation (Confidence: High)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet to assess dataset dependency of findings
2. Test TRASHFIRE against a broader range of attack methods (Carlini-Wagner, FGSM, transfer-based attacks)
3. Evaluate the statistical significance of survival curve differences using larger sample sizes (1000+ examples per model)
