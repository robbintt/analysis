# More Agents Is All You Need

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.05120
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05120
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Agent Forest method achieves 4-24% accuracy gains through ensemble sampling and voting

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Agent Forest, a simple yet effective method for improving large language model performance by leveraging multiple agents through a sampling-and-voting approach. The method demonstrates that increasing the number of agents can significantly boost performance, particularly for difficult tasks and weaker models. The approach is shown to be orthogonal to existing techniques and can be combined with other optimization strategies.

## Method Summary
Agent Forest employs a straightforward sampling-and-voting methodology where multiple agents independently tackle the same task, and their outputs are aggregated through a voting mechanism. The method is designed to be orthogonal to existing techniques, meaning it can be combined with other prompt engineering and multi-agent collaboration approaches. The authors also propose optimization strategies based on task difficulty analysis to further enhance performance.

## Key Results
- Performance gains of 4-24% accuracy across arithmetic reasoning, general reasoning, and code generation tasks
- Smaller models can outperform larger ones when ensemble size is increased
- Effectiveness is enhanced by optimization strategies based on task difficulty analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper does not provide a detailed mechanism explanation for why the method works.

## Foundational Learning
The paper does not explicitly outline foundational concepts that need to be learned.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Agent Forest -> Sampling Mechanism -> Multiple Agents -> Voting Aggregation -> Final Output

**Critical path:**
The critical path involves generating multiple agent responses through sampling, then aggregating these responses through voting to produce the final output.

**Design tradeoffs:**
The primary tradeoff is between computational cost (running multiple agents) and performance gains. The method must balance the number of agents with resource constraints.

**Failure signatures:**
Performance degradation may occur when:
- Task difficulty exceeds the collective capability of the agent ensemble
- Voting aggregation produces ambiguous results
- Computational overhead outweighs performance benefits

**Three first experiments:**
1. Baseline comparison of single-agent vs. multi-agent performance on arithmetic reasoning tasks
2. Scaling analysis of agent count versus performance gains across different model sizes
3. Integration testing with existing prompt engineering techniques to verify orthogonality claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results primarily based on controlled benchmarking environments, not real-world deployment
- Performance gains may be influenced by dataset-specific characteristics
- Computational overhead of running multiple agents may offset gains in resource-constrained environments

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Basic sampling-and-voting methodology is technically sound and reproducible
- Observed performance improvements on tested benchmarks are consistent and measurable

**Medium confidence:**
- Orthogonality claim to existing techniques needs more rigorous ablation studies
- Effectiveness gains for weaker models need validation across broader model families
- Optimization strategies based on task difficulty analysis require more extensive validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive ablation study testing Agent Forest's performance with and without other concurrent optimization techniques to verify orthogonality claims
2. Perform cross-domain validation testing on at least 5 additional task categories beyond current three, including non-English language tasks
3. Measure and report wall-clock time and computational cost scaling as agent numbers increase, comparing against single-agent performance per unit of compute
