# On the Computability of Robust PAC Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10161
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10161
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces robust CPAC learning framework and shows computable robust shattering dimension is necessary but not sufficient for robust CPAC learnability

## Executive Summary
This paper explores the computability requirements in adversarially robust PAC learning by introducing the framework of robust computable PAC (robust CPAC) learning. The authors provide sufficient conditions for learnability and demonstrate that robust CPAC learnability is not implied by the combination of CPAC and robust PAC learnability, even when perturbation types are decidable. A key finding is that robust loss computability is not required for robust CPAC learnability. The paper introduces a novel dimension, the computable robust shattering dimension, and proves that while its finiteness is necessary, it is not sufficient for robust CPAC learnability.

## Method Summary
The paper establishes a theoretical framework connecting computability theory with adversarial robust learning. It introduces robust CPAC learning as a computability-based variant of robust PAC learning, then analyzes when computable learners can achieve robust generalization. The authors develop new technical machinery including the computable robust shattering dimension and prove several separation results showing that standard robustness conditions do not imply computable robustness. The analysis employs techniques from both learning theory and computable analysis to establish the theoretical boundaries of what can be learned under adversarial robustness constraints when computational resources are limited.

## Key Results
- Introduces robust CPAC learning framework as a computability-based variant of robust PAC learning
- Proves that robust CPAC learnability is not implied by the combination of CPAC and robust PAC learnability
- Shows that computable robust shattering dimension finiteness is necessary but not sufficient for robust CPAC learnability
- Demonstrates that robust loss computability is not required for robust CPAC learnability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's framework works by establishing computability requirements for adversarial robustness that go beyond standard PAC learning conditions. The key insight is that while finite VC dimension suffices for PAC learnability, and various notions of robustness exist for robust PAC learning, the combination of computability constraints and adversarial robustness requires fundamentally new theoretical machinery. The computable robust shattering dimension captures this interaction, though its limitations reveal that computability and robustness create a more complex landscape than either alone would suggest.

## Foundational Learning
The theoretical foundation relies on classical PAC learning theory, computable analysis, and adversarial machine learning. The paper builds on Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory while extending it with computability constraints. It draws from computable analysis to formalize what it means for learning algorithms and loss functions to be computable, and incorporates adversarial robustness concepts from the robust statistics literature.

## Architecture Onboarding
N/A

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions: (1) whether there exist natural sufficient conditions beyond the computable robust shattering dimension for robust CPAC learnability, (2) how to characterize the exact boundary between learnable and unlearnable problems under the robust CPAC framework, and (3) whether different notions of computability (e.g., oracle-based approaches) would yield different characterizations of learnability.

## Limitations
- The paper focuses on theoretical computability aspects without providing concrete algorithms or empirical validation
- Practical applicability and computational complexity of the computable robust shattering dimension remain unexplored
- Lack of concrete examples or applications to demonstrate significance of theoretical findings
- Does not address connections to existing work on robust optimization or adversarial training in machine learning
