# A Unified Multi-Task Learning Architecture for Hate Detection Leveraging User-Based Information

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.06855
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06855
- Reference count: 12
- This work proposes a unified multi-task learning architecture that combines deep neural models with user metadata and historical behavior to improve hate speech detection.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses hate speech detection by proposing a unified multi-task learning architecture that leverages both textual and user-based features. The approach combines deep neural models (CNN, GRU, BERT, ALBERT) with intra-user historical tweets, inter-user similarity, and tweet-based features. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that incorporating user features significantly improves detection performance, with the best results achieved by fusing all feature types in a multi-task learning framework.

## Method Summary
The method employs a multi-task learning architecture that processes tweet text through deep neural networks (CNN, GRU, BERT, ALBERT) while simultaneously incorporating user-based features. Intra-user features capture historical posting behavior from the same user, inter-user features capture similarity-based content from other users, and tweet-based features include metadata and linguistic patterns. The model concatenates these features before classification, with shared lower layers learning common representations across tasks and task-specific upper layers for specialized classification. The approach is evaluated on three benchmark Twitter datasets using 5-fold cross-validation.

## Key Results
- BERT-based multi-task learning outperforms single-task learning by reducing false positives
- Combining intra-user, inter-user, and tweet-based features yields the highest macro-F1 and weighted-F1 scores
- The MTL-BERT+Intra+Inter+TB model achieves the best performance across all three datasets
- User-based features consistently improve detection accuracy over text-only models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining intra-user and inter-user features with textual features improves hate speech detection by providing user-specific behavioral and similarity context.
- Mechanism: The model enriches each tweet's representation with historical posting behavior from the same user (intra-user) and similarity-based tweets from other users (inter-user). These features are extracted using BERT embeddings and concatenated with the target tweet's representation before classification.
- Core assumption: A user's past behavior and their similarity to other users in terms of content patterns are predictive of whether a new tweet contains hate speech.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The experiment is conducted over single-task learning (STL) and multi-task learning (MTL) paradigms that use deep neural networks... We use three benchmark datasets and conclude that combining certain user features with textual features gives significant improvements in macro-F1 and weighted-F1."
  - [section]: "The inclusion of intra-user and inter-user features helped in improving the overall performance for all the three datasets."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct corpus support found for intra/inter-user feature effectiveness.
- Break condition: If users have very limited historical posts (e.g., new accounts) or if similarity metrics don't capture relevant behavioral patterns, the added features may not improve performance and could even degrade it.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-task learning (MTL) with shared lower layers and task-specific upper layers reduces false positives compared to single-task learning.
- Mechanism: The MTL framework trains on multiple related hate speech detection tasks (e.g., different datasets or labels) simultaneously. Lower layers learn shared representations while upper layers specialize, improving generalization and reducing overfitting to any single dataset.
- Core assumption: Tasks related to hate speech detection share underlying linguistic and contextual features that can be jointly learned.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The BERT-based multi-task learning outperforms the single task learning by reducing false positives."
  - [section]: "The MTL model is evaluated on three different datasets related to hate speech classification, sexism detection, and offensive language detection."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for MTL's false positive reduction.
- Break condition: If the tasks are not sufficiently related or if one dataset dominates the training, MTL may not provide benefits and could even hurt performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Historical post classification provides a user-level profile that enhances prediction accuracy.
- Mechanism: The model pre-classifies 50 historical posts per user using a fine-tuned BERT model trained on 230K existing hate speech posts. The average number of hateful posts per user category (e.g., 7 for hateful users) is used as a feature.
- Core assumption: Users who frequently post hateful content in their history are more likely to post hateful content in new tweets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The average hateful posts with respect to each class is shown in Table 1. It can be seen that the hateful, offensive, and sexism users had 7, 4.5, and 7.8 number of hateful posts out of 50."
  - [abstract]: "The model significantly improves upon adding all the features."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence found for the effectiveness of historical post classification as a user profile feature.
- Break condition: If users change behavior over time or if the historical classification is noisy, the user profile feature may mislead the model.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Deep learning architectures (CNN, GRU, BERT, ALBERT)
  - Why needed here: Different architectures capture different aspects of textual data - CNNs for local patterns, GRUs for sequential dependencies, BERT/ALBERT for contextual understanding.
  - Quick check question: Which architecture would you choose if the task required understanding long-range dependencies in text?
- Concept: Multi-task learning (MTL)
  - Why needed here: MTL leverages shared knowledge across related tasks (different hate speech datasets) to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between shared and task-specific layers in MTL?
- Concept: Feature engineering and concatenation
  - Why needed here: User-based features (intra-user, inter-user, tweet-based) provide contextual information that pure text models miss.
  - Quick check question: How would you handle missing user history when concatenating features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Tweet text + user metadata -> Word embeddings (Word2Vec+FastText for CNN/GRU, BERT/ALBERT for transformer) -> Shared transformer encoder -> Feature extractors (separate BERT for intra-user and inter-user tweets) -> Feature concatenation (target tweet + user-based features) -> Task-specific classification heads -> Softmax prediction

- Critical path:
  Target tweet → BERT/ALBERT embedding → Shared encoder → Feature concatenation (with intra-user, inter-user, tweet-based features) → Classification head → Prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single-task vs multi-task learning: MTL improves generalization but increases complexity
  - Feature inclusion: Adding user features improves accuracy but requires more data and preprocessing
  - Model selection: BERT/ALBERT provide better contextual understanding but are more computationally expensive than CNN/GRU

- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting to a single dataset (high training accuracy, low test accuracy)
  - Poor performance on users with limited historical data
  - Sensitivity to noisy or missing user features
  - Degradation when combining too many heterogeneous features

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train CNN and GRU models with only textual features on Dataset D1 to establish baseline performance
  2. Add intra-user features to the best-performing textual model and measure improvement
  3. Implement the full MTL-BERT+Intra+Inter+TB model and compare against single-task baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of user-based features may degrade when applied to users with limited posting history or when user behavior patterns shift over time
- The multi-task learning framework evaluation is limited to three specific datasets, raising questions about generalizability to different hate speech detection tasks
- The paper doesn't adequately address how to handle missing or noisy user features, which could affect real-world deployment

## Confidence

**High confidence**: BERT/ALBERT models outperform CNN/GRU baselines on textual features alone

**Medium confidence**: Combining intra-user, inter-user, and tweet-based features provides consistent improvements across all three datasets

**Low confidence**: The specific mechanism by which user similarity metrics contribute to detection accuracy is well-understood and generalizable

## Next Checks

1. Test model performance on users with minimal historical data (e.g., <10 previous tweets) to verify the robustness of user-based features

2. Conduct ablation studies removing individual user feature types to quantify their relative contributions

3. Evaluate the model on out-of-domain datasets with different hate speech definitions to assess generalizability of the MTL approach
