# Measuring Diversity in Co-creative Image Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.13826
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13826
- Reference count: 28
- This paper introduces entropy-based measures for assessing diversity in co-creative image generation systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents two entropy-based diversity measures for co-creative image generation systems: Truncated Inception Entropy (TIE) and Truncated CLIP Entropy (TCE). These methods compute diversity directly from neural network encodings without requiring ground-truth datasets. TIE leverages InceptionV3's latent space while TCE uses CLIP's shared text-image embedding space. Experiments with synthetically generated image sets demonstrate that both measures align with expected diversity patterns, with TIE emphasizing visual diversity and TCE capturing semantic diversity more effectively.

## Method Summary
The authors propose two entropy-based diversity measures that compute diversity using neural network encodings without requiring ground-truth datasets. TIE uses the InceptionV3 network's latent space, while TCE leverages CLIP's shared text-image embedding space. The methods involve truncating the network at intermediate layers, computing probability distributions over classes or concepts, and measuring entropy as a diversity metric. Experiments were conducted using synthetically generated image sets varying in noise levels, semantic content, and visual styles to validate the measures' effectiveness.

## Key Results
- Both TIE and TCE align with expected diversity patterns in synthetic image sets
- TIE emphasizes visual diversity while TCE captures semantic diversity more effectively
- The methods offer practical, scalable alternatives to existing diversity metrics for interactive generative AI applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The entropy-based measures work by capturing the spread of neural network activations across classes or concepts in latent space. When an image generation system produces diverse outputs, the activations should be distributed across multiple categories rather than concentrated on a few. TIE measures this spread in the visual feature space of InceptionV3, while TCE measures it in CLIP's semantic space that connects visual and textual representations. Higher entropy indicates more uniform distribution across categories, corresponding to greater diversity.

## Foundational Learning
- Neural network latent spaces - why needed: Provide compressed representations where diversity can be quantified; quick check: Verify intermediate layer activations capture meaningful features
- Entropy as diversity metric - why needed: Provides quantitative measure of distribution spread; quick check: Confirm entropy increases with more uniform distributions
- CLIP model architecture - why needed: Enables semantic diversity measurement by connecting visual and textual spaces; quick check: Validate text-image alignment in embedding space
- InceptionV3 architecture - why needed: Provides robust visual feature extraction for TIE; quick check: Ensure feature maps capture diverse visual patterns
- Synthetic data generation - why needed: Allows controlled testing of diversity measures; quick check: Verify synthetic sets cover expected diversity ranges

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input images -> Neural network (InceptionV3/CLIP) -> Intermediate layer truncation -> Softmax probability distribution -> Entropy calculation
Critical path: Image encoding through truncated network → probability distribution → entropy computation
Design tradeoffs: TIE vs TCE represents the tradeoff between visual (TIE) and semantic (TCE) diversity measurement
Failure signatures: Low entropy in diverse datasets suggests poor feature extraction or inappropriate truncation layer
First experiments: 1) Test entropy on uniform vs. concentrated synthetic distributions, 2) Compare TIE and TCE on datasets with known visual-semantic diversity gaps, 3) Validate sensitivity to varying levels of controlled noise

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on pretrained models may introduce biases or miss domain-specific nuances
- Assumes entropy in latent space correlates directly with perceived diversity
- Synthetic experiments don't fully represent real-world co-creative interaction complexity

## Confidence
- Computational feasibility: High
- Scalability: High
- Robustness across real-world scenarios: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test TIE and TCE on real-world co-creative datasets with human evaluations to assess alignment between computed diversity and perceived diversity
2. Investigate the impact of pretrained model biases on the measures by comparing results across multiple models or fine-tuned versions
3. Evaluate the measures' sensitivity to iterative co-creative processes, where diversity may fluctuate based on user feedback and system adjustments
