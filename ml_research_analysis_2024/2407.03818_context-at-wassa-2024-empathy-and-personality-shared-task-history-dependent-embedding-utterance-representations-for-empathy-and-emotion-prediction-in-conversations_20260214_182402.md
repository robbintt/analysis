# ConText at WASSA 2024 Empathy and Personality Shared Task: History-Dependent Embedding Utterance Representations for Empathy and Emotion Prediction in Conversations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.03818
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03818
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: First place in CONV-turn track and second place in CONV-dialog track of WASSA 2024

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach for modeling empathy, emotion polarity, and emotion intensity in conversational contexts by leveraging history-dependent embedding representations. The method processes utterances together with their conversational context through a pre-trained language model, followed by a regression head for prediction. The system achieved top performance in the WASSA 2024 Empathy and Personality Shared Task, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating conversational context into empathy and emotion prediction tasks.

## Method Summary
The approach involves feeding utterances along with their conversational context to a pre-trained language model, specifically utilizing the Transformer architecture's ability to preserve history information. Rather than jointly modeling utterance embeddings, the system processes the full conversational context to generate rich, history-dependent representations. A regression head then transforms these contextualized embeddings into predictions for empathy scores and emotion intensity. This design choice capitalizes on the pre-trained model's understanding of conversational dynamics and contextual dependencies.

## Key Results
- Achieved first place in the CONV-turn track with an average Pearson correlation score of 0.626
- Secured second place in the CONV-dialog track
- Demonstrated the importance of conversational context in empathy and emotion prediction
- Validated the efficacy of history-dependent embedding representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting the Transformer's inherent ability to capture long-range dependencies and maintain contextual information across conversational turns. By providing the full conversational context as input rather than isolated utterances, the model can leverage pre-learned representations of discourse patterns, speaker relationships, and emotional trajectories. The regression head then maps these rich, contextualized representations to the target empathy and emotion intensity scores, benefiting from the pre-trained model's understanding of nuanced conversational dynamics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conversational context modeling**: Why needed - captures the evolution of empathy and emotion across dialogue turns; Quick check - examine attention weights to verify context integration
- **Pre-trained language models**: Why needed - provides robust semantic and contextual understanding; Quick check - compare performance against non-pretrained baselines
- **Regression prediction heads**: Why needed - transforms contextualized embeddings into continuous empathy and emotion intensity scores; Quick check - analyze prediction distributions
- **Pearson correlation evaluation**: Why needed - standard metric for continuous prediction tasks in shared tasks; Quick check - verify correlation calculations with baseline implementations
- **History-dependent representations**: Why needed - maintains speaker and context information across conversational turns; Quick check - ablation studies with and without context
- **Transformer architecture**: Why needed - enables parallel processing while maintaining sequence information; Quick check - confirm positional encoding implementation

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input context -> Pre-trained Transformer -> Context-aware embeddings -> Regression head -> Empathy/Emotion predictions

Critical path: The conversation context flows through the pre-trained Transformer, which generates contextualized embeddings that capture both semantic meaning and conversational history. These embeddings are then passed to the regression head, which produces the final empathy and emotion intensity predictions. The critical path depends on the Transformer's ability to maintain contextual relationships across turns.

Design tradeoffs: The primary tradeoff involves computational cost versus contextual richness. Using full conversational context provides more information but increases computational requirements and may introduce noise from irrelevant historical turns. The system prioritizes contextual richness over computational efficiency, justified by the competitive results achieved.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation is likely when: (1) conversational context is limited or noisy, (2) domain shifts significantly from training data, or (3) conversational structures differ substantially from the WASSA 2024 dataset. The model may also struggle with very long conversations due to attention mechanism limitations.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate performance with varying amounts of conversational context to determine optimal context window size
2. Test the system on out-of-domain conversational datasets to assess generalizability
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the pre-trained Transformer to measure its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability across different conversational domains and languages
- High computational requirements for real-time deployment
- Performance uncertainty on datasets with limited conversational history

## Confidence
- Top performance in WASSA 2024 task provides strong evidence within specific context
- Limited evaluation scope reduces confidence in generalizability claims
- Absence of ablation studies creates uncertainty about individual component contributions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain validation by testing the system on different conversational datasets to assess generalizability beyond the WASSA 2024 data.
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the history-dependent embedding approach compared to other components of the system.
3. Evaluate the computational efficiency and resource requirements across different hardware configurations to establish practical deployment constraints.
