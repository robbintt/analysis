# Towards a Foundation Model for Partial Differential Equations: Multi-Operator Learning and Extrapolation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.12355
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12355
- Authors: Jingmin Sun; Yuxuan Liu; Zecheng Zhang; Hayden Schaeffer
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: PROSE-PDE achieves prediction errors below 3.1% and R2 scores above 0.995 across 20 PDE types while successfully extrapolating to unseen parameters and transferring physical features without fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PROSE-PDE, a foundation model that jointly predicts future states of spatiotemporal systems and learns the underlying governing partial differential equations. The model employs a multi-modal approach, using both data and symbolic representations of PDEs as input modalities, and is trained on 20 different PDE types. Through systematic numerical experiments, the model demonstrates exceptional performance with prediction errors below 3.1% and R2 scores above 0.995, while showing strong extrapolation capabilities to unseen parameters, longer time horizons, and transfer learning of physical features like shocks and rarefactions between different equations without requiring fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
PROSE-PDE is a multi-modal foundation model that learns to predict solutions to time-dependent partial differential equations while simultaneously learning the governing equations themselves. The model takes as input both data representations (solution snapshots) and symbolic representations (governing equations) of PDEs, processing them through separate encoders before fusing them in a decoder network. The architecture employs convolutional layers for data encoding, graph neural networks for symbolic encoding, and transformer-based layers for fusion and prediction. The model is trained jointly on 20 different PDE types, learning a shared representation space that enables cross-PDE knowledge transfer. The symbolic modality helps resolve well-posedness issues in multi-operator learning and improves prediction accuracy compared to data-only approaches.

## Key Results
- Prediction errors below 3.1% and R2 scores above 0.995 across 20 different PDE types
- Successful extrapolation to unseen parameter values and longer time horizons
- Transfer learning of physical features (shocks and rarefactions) between different equations without fine-tuning
- Ablation studies show symbolic modality improves prediction accuracy and resolves well-posedness issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-modal approach works because it combines the strengths of data-driven and physics-informed learning. By incorporating symbolic representations of governing equations, the model gains access to underlying physical laws that constrain the solution space, reducing the ambiguity that typically arises in purely data-driven approaches. This symbolic knowledge acts as a regularization mechanism, helping the model learn more generalizable features that transfer across different PDE types. The joint prediction of future states and governing equations creates a self-consistent learning framework where the model can validate its predictions against physical laws, leading to more accurate and physically meaningful solutions.

- **Symbolic Representation**: Why needed - Provides physical constraints for learning; Quick check - Improves prediction accuracy compared to data-only approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Encoder -> Symbolic Encoder -> Fusion Layers -> Decoder -> Prediction Output

**Critical Path**: The critical path for prediction involves the data encoder processing spatiotemporal input, the symbolic encoder processing governing equation information, fusion layers combining both modalities, and the decoder generating future state predictions. The symbolic modality provides crucial regularization that enables successful multi-operator learning across different PDE types.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model trades computational complexity for improved generalization and physical consistency. Using both data and symbolic modalities increases model size and training time but enables better extrapolation and transfer learning capabilities. The choice of separate encoders for different modalities allows specialized processing but requires careful fusion layer design to effectively combine information.

**Failure Signatures**: Without symbolic modality, the model may suffer from well-posedness issues in multi-operator learning, leading to unstable or physically inconsistent predictions. Over-reliance on symbolic information without sufficient data may result in poor generalization to complex, real-world scenarios where governing equations are only approximate. The model may struggle with PDEs that have strong nonlinear coupling or chaotic behavior.

**First 3 Experiments to Run**:
1. Test PROSE-PDE on synthetic data from a new PDE type not in the training set to evaluate true generalization capabilities
2. Conduct ablation study removing symbolic modality to quantify its contribution to prediction accuracy
3. Evaluate model performance on noisy or incomplete spatiotemporal data to assess robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Model was evaluated exclusively on synthetic data from known analytical PDE solutions, not tested on real-world datasets
- Reliance on symbolic representations may limit applicability when governing equations are completely unknown
- Only tested on relatively standard textbook PDE examples rather than complex, real-world systems

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Experimental results showing prediction errors below 3.1% and R2 scores above 0.995 are well-documented and reproducible. Ablation studies demonstrating effectiveness of symbolic modality are methodologically sound.

**Medium Confidence**: Extrapolation capabilities to unseen parameters and longer time horizons demonstrated but limited to controlled synthetic scenarios. Real-world applications may present more challenging conditions.

**Medium Confidence**: Transfer learning results for physical features like shocks and rarefactions are promising but scope of transferable features is not fully characterized.

## Next Checks

1. Test PROSE-PDE on real-world spatiotemporal datasets where governing equations are partially or completely unknown, such as fluid dynamics data from experiments or climate modeling data, to evaluate practical applicability beyond synthetic examples.

2. Conduct stress tests with noisy, incomplete, or irregularly sampled data to assess model's robustness in realistic conditions where perfect spatiotemporal grids are unavailable.

3. Evaluate model performance when symbolic information is partially missing or incorrect to understand robustness to imperfect governing equation knowledge.
