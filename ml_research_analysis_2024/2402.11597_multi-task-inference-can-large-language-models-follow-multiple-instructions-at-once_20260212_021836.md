# Multi-Task Inference: Can Large Language Models Follow Multiple Instructions at Once?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11597
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11597
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: MTI improves LLM performance by up to 12.4% while reducing inference time by 1.46× compared to sequential processing

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Multi-Task Inference (MTI), a novel method enabling large language models to process multiple instructions within a single inference call. The authors construct the MTI Bench, a comprehensive benchmark of 5,000 instances across 25 tasks with 2-3 sub-tasks each. Testing state-of-the-art models like Llama-2-Chat-70B and GPT-4, MTI demonstrates significant improvements over traditional sequential processing, achieving both better accuracy and faster inference times. The approach addresses the practical challenge of efficiently handling complex, multi-faceted instructions in real-world applications.

## Method Summary
MTI enables LLMs to process multiple instructions simultaneously by constructing a unified prompt that incorporates all sub-tasks within a single inference call. The method uses specialized prompt engineering techniques to maintain clarity and task separation while allowing the model to reason across related instructions. The MTI Bench benchmark was constructed to evaluate this capability, featuring diverse NLP tasks with varying complexity levels. Performance was compared against two baselines: Single-Task Inference (processing sub-tasks sequentially) and Batch Prompting (grouping same-task instances). The unified approach aims to leverage cross-task reasoning while minimizing redundant computation.

## Key Results
- MTI improved performance over Single-Task Inference by 7.3% for Llama-2-Chat-70B and 12.4% for GPT-4
- MTI reduced average inference time by 1.46× compared to sequential processing
- Performance gains were consistent across the diverse 25-task MTI Bench benchmark

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MTI leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of large language models by presenting related tasks in a unified context rather than isolating them. This allows the model to identify and utilize cross-task relationships, transfer knowledge between related sub-tasks, and maintain contextual consistency throughout processing. By eliminating redundant context loading and inference passes, MTI also achieves computational efficiency gains. The prompt engineering approach ensures task boundaries remain clear while enabling the model to develop integrated solutions across multiple instructions.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-task learning concepts: Understanding how models handle multiple objectives simultaneously is crucial for designing effective MTI approaches
- Prompt engineering principles: Critical for constructing prompts that maintain task separation while enabling cross-task reasoning
- Inference optimization techniques: Necessary to understand the computational efficiency gains from unified processing
- Benchmark construction methodology: Important for evaluating multi-task capabilities in a controlled, comparable manner

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: User instructions → MTI prompt construction → Single LLM inference → Multi-task output parsing
- Critical path: Prompt construction and unified inference are the core components; output parsing is secondary
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing task separation clarity with cross-task reasoning opportunity; optimizing for both accuracy and speed
- Failure signatures: Performance degradation when instructions are conflicting or when sub-task complexity exceeds model capacity
- First experiments: 1) Test MTI with 2 sub-tasks of similar complexity, 2) Evaluate performance with increasingly diverse task combinations, 3) Measure inference time scaling with additional sub-tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark may not fully represent real-world multi-task scenarios with interdependent or ambiguous instructions
- Performance improvements measured on curated dataset may not generalize to more complex or heterogeneous instruction sets
- Inference time reduction may not scale linearly with task complexity or model size

## Confidence
- MTI's performance superiority over STI: High
- MTI's inference time efficiency: Medium
- Generalizability of MTI to real-world multi-task scenarios: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test MTI on real-world datasets with naturally occurring multi-task instructions to assess practical applicability beyond the curated benchmark
2. Evaluate performance degradation when scaling MTI to handle 4+ sub-tasks per instruction to understand its limits
3. Compare MTI against emerging multi-task prompting strategies that incorporate instruction hierarchy or conflict resolution mechanisms
