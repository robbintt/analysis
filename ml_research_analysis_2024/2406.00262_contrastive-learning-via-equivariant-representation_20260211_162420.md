## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CLeVER, a novel contrastive learning framework that incorporates equivariant representations to improve training efficiency and robustness. Unlike existing invariant contrastive learning methods that discard augmentation-related information, CLeVER explicitly splits representations into invariant and equivariant factors, leveraging both for downstream tasks. A key contribution is the introduction of a regularization loss to stabilize the training process and prevent trivial solutions in equivariant representation learning.

Experiments show that CLeVER significantly enhances the performance of various backbone models (ResNet, ViT, VMamba) on ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K, particularly benefiting smaller-scale models. It achieves state-of-the-art results, improving top-1 accuracy by up to 3.9% and demonstrating superior robustness to perturbations like rotation and elastic transformations. CLeVER also improves performance in downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation, validating its generalizability and practicality.

## Method Summary
CLeVER introduces a novel contrastive learning framework that incorporates equivariant representations alongside invariant ones. The method splits representations into two factors: invariant representations that capture common information across augmentations, and equivariant representations that encode transformation-specific information. A key innovation is the regularization loss designed to stabilize training and prevent trivial solutions in learning equivariant representations. The framework leverages both representation types for downstream tasks, contrasting with traditional approaches that only use invariant representations.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.9% top-1 accuracy improvements
- Demonstrates superior robustness to perturbations including rotation and elastic transformations
- Improves performance across multiple backbone architectures (ResNet, ViT, VMamba) on ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K
- Particularly benefits smaller-scale models
- Shows generalizability to downstream tasks like classification and segmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CLeVER works by explicitly incorporating equivariant representations that capture transformation-specific information, rather than discarding this information as in traditional invariant contrastive learning methods. By splitting representations into invariant and equivariant factors, the framework can leverage both types of information for downstream tasks. The regularization loss plays a crucial role in stabilizing the training process and preventing trivial solutions when learning equivariant representations. This dual representation approach allows the model to maintain useful information about data transformations while still learning robust invariant features.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning**: A self-supervised learning approach that learns representations by contrasting positive pairs against negative pairs. Why needed: Forms the foundation for CLeVER's learning framework.
- **Equivariant Representations**: Representations that explicitly encode transformation-specific information. Why needed: Allows CLeVER to capture and utilize augmentation-related information.
- **Invariant Representations**: Representations that remain unchanged under transformations. Why needed: Traditional contrastive learning focuses on these, but CLeVER enhances them with equivariant information.
- **Regularization Loss**: A loss function designed to stabilize training and prevent trivial solutions. Why needed: Critical for preventing collapse in equivariant representation learning.
- **Augmentation**: Data transformations applied during training. Why needed: Provides the basis for learning both invariant and equivariant representations.
- **Downstream Tasks**: Tasks like classification and segmentation that use learned representations. Why needed: Validates the practical utility of CLeVER's learned representations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Encoder Backbone -> Representation Splitter -> Invariant Representation Branch -> Contrastive Loss
Encoder Backbone -> Representation Splitter -> Equivariant Representation Branch -> Regularization Loss

**Critical Path**
Data Augmentation -> Encoder Backbone -> Representation Splitter -> Invariant Representation -> Contrastive Loss
Data Augmentation -> Encoder Backbone -> Representation Splitter -> Equivariant Representation -> Regularization Loss

**Design Tradeoffs**
CLeVER trades increased model complexity (due to representation splitting and additional loss terms) for improved representation quality and robustness. The framework requires careful balancing between invariant and equivariant representation learning, with the regularization loss playing a key role in preventing training instability.

**Failure Signatures**
Potential failure modes include: (1) collapse of equivariant representations due to insufficient regularization, (2) dominance of either invariant or equivariant representations leading to imbalanced learning, (3) increased computational overhead affecting training efficiency.

**3 First Experiments**
1. Compare CLeVER's performance with standard contrastive learning methods on ImageNet-100 using ResNet-18
2. Evaluate the impact of the regularization loss on training stability and final performance
3. Test CLeVER's robustness to rotation and elastic transformation perturbations
