# Towards Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech for Arabic Dialects

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Fine-tuning XTTS on Arabic data with dialect labels improves speaker similarity but increases WER

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the lack of zero-shot multi-speaker TTS systems for Arabic dialects by fine-tuning the XTTS model on a large Arabic speech dataset (QASR). The authors incorporate dialect labels to improve dialect-specific speech generation and evaluate their models using speaker similarity, word error rate, and human evaluation. Their approach shows improved speaker similarity compared to the baseline while maintaining naturalness, though at the cost of higher word error rates. The study demonstrates the potential for improving Arabic TTS in multi-dialect settings using pseudo-dialect labels.

## Method Summary
The authors fine-tune the XTTS model on the QASR dataset (2000 hours of Arabic speech) with dialect conditioning. They preprocess the data by removing background noise, aligning text-audio pairs using Whisper, and filtering low-quality samples based on WER. Pseudo-dialect labels are generated using eight Arabic dialect identification models, with the most confident label selected for each sample. Two models are developed: one with dialect tokens and one without. The models are trained for 300,000 steps with specified batch sizes and gradient accumulation.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned models show improved speaker similarity (SECS) compared to baseline XTTS
- Word error rates increase after fine-tuning, indicating trade-offs between speaker preservation and text-to-speech accuracy
- Human evaluation shows the fine-tuned models produce natural-sounding speech comparable to baseline
- Dialect conditioning improves performance across multiple Arabic dialects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adding explicit dialect tokens improves dialect-specific speech generation by conditioning the model on dialect labels.
- Mechanism: The dialect token is inserted after the language token in the input sequence, allowing the model to condition the generation process on dialectal features.
- Core assumption: Dialect labels, even if pseudo-labeled, carry enough linguistic signal to guide synthesis quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we employ a set of Arabic dialect identification models to explore the impact of pre-defined dialect labels on improving the ZS-TTS model in a multi-dialect setting."
  - [section 4.2]: "we add a list of 22 dialect tokens... To provide the model with the dialect information, we insert the dialect token after the [lang] token"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning XTTS on a large Arabic speech corpus adapted for TTS improves speaker similarity compared to the baseline.
- Mechanism: XTTS is originally trained on multi-lingual data. Fine-tuning on Arabic-specific data with aligned transcripts and noise-cleaned audio enables the model to adapt to Arabic phonology and speaker characteristics.
- Core assumption: Arabic speech characteristics differ enough from other languages that task-specific fine-tuning is beneficial.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our automated and human evaluation results show convincing performance while capable of generating dialectal speech."
  - [section 4.2]: "we develop two models by fine-tuning XTTS on the curated QASR dataset"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pseudo-dialect labels enable multi-dialect synthesis without manual annotation overhead.
- Mechanism: The authors use multiple dialect identification models to label each sample, then use the most confident label. This allows multi-dialect training without human-labeled dialect tags.
- Core assumption: Aggregated pseudo-labels from multiple models are sufficiently accurate to guide dialect-conditioned training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1]: "we employ eight dialect identification models to predict the dialect from the text then we take the label with the highest cumulative confidence"
  - [section 5]: "we only use the pseudo dialect label, the dialect information does help to improve the quality of generated speech"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Text preprocessing and tokenization
  - Why needed here: XTTS uses BPE tokenization for text input; understanding how Arabic text is tokenized is critical for correct model input formatting.
  - Quick check question: How does BPE tokenization handle Arabic diacritics and dialectal vocabulary?

- Concept: Speaker embedding and similarity metrics
  - Why needed here: The evaluation uses cosine similarity between speaker embeddings; understanding how speaker embeddings are extracted is key to interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What is the dimensionality of Resemblyzer speaker embeddings used in SECS?

- Concept: Word Error Rate (WER) calculation
  - Why needed here: WER is used to evaluate text-to-speech consistency; understanding its calculation is essential for interpreting model performance.
  - Quick check question: How does Jiwer compute WER when comparing ground-truth transcript to Whisper-generated transcript?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text encoder (BPE tokens + [bots], [lang], [dialect], [eots]) -> VQ-VAE (audio discretization) -> GPT2 decoder (autoregressive prediction) -> HifiGAN (waveform generation) -> Perceiver (speaker embedding extraction)

- Critical path: Input text → BPE tokenization → [bots], [lang], [dialect], tokens, [eots] → Mel-spectrogram → Perceiver → speaker latent → Concatenate speaker latent + text tokens + audio tokens → GPT2 → audio tokens → HifiGAN → waveform

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using dialect tokens increases vocabulary size slightly but provides explicit conditioning
  - Fine-tuning on Arabic data improves dialect performance but may reduce cross-lingual generalization
  - Pseudo-labels avoid annotation cost but introduce noise

- Failure signatures:
  - High WER with low SECS: Model preserves speaker identity but struggles with text-to-speech mapping
  - Low WER with low SECS: Model maps text well but loses speaker characteristics
  - Both metrics low: Fundamental model or data quality issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare baseline XTTS vs fine-tuned model on held-out speakers using SECS and WER
  2. Evaluate impact of adding dialect token by training with and without it
  3. Test model generalization on in-house dialect dataset not seen during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- The pseudo-dialect labeling pipeline's accuracy is not quantified - it's unclear how often the eight dialect identification models agree or what the confidence distribution looks like.
- The in-house dialect dataset used for human evaluation lacks detailed specification regarding its size, provenance, and dialect coverage.
- The evaluation covers only a subset of Arabic dialects, limiting claims about true zero-shot generalization across the Arabic dialect continuum.

## Confidence

- High confidence: Speaker similarity improvements (SECS scores) - These are directly measurable and show consistent improvement across both held-out and in-house evaluation sets.
- Medium confidence: Word Error Rate results - While WER increased, the paper provides reasonable explanation about trade-offs with speaker preservation, but the absolute WER values and their practical impact on intelligibility are not fully characterized.
- Low confidence: Generalization across all Arabic dialects - The evaluation covers only a subset of dialects, and the pseudo-labeling approach may not capture the full complexity of Arabic dialect continuum.

## Next Checks

1. **Label quality assessment**: Analyze the agreement rate and confidence distribution among the eight dialect identification models on the validation set to quantify pseudo-label reliability.

2. **Cross-dialect generalization test**: Evaluate the fine-tuned model on speakers from dialects that were underrepresented or absent in the QASR training data to test true zero-shot generalization.

3. **Ablation on pseudo-labeling**: Train a baseline model without dialect tokens but with the same fine-tuning procedure to isolate the impact of dialect conditioning versus general Arabic adaptation.
