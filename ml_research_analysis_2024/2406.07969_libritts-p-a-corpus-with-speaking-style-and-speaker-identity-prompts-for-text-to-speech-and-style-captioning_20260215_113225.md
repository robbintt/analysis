core_contribution: LibriTTS-P is a new English corpus derived from LibriTTS-R that
  includes utterance-level style prompts and speaker-level identity prompts for text-to-speech
  and style captioning. The corpus is built using a hybrid approach combining manual
  annotations for speaker characteristics and synthetic annotations for speaking style,
  resulting in more diverse and comprehensive prompt annotations than existing datasets.

# LibriTTS-P: A Corpus with Speaking Style and Speaker Identity Prompts for Text-to-Speech and Style Captioning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.07969
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07969
- Reference count: 0
- Creates a large-scale corpus with style and speaker prompts for TTS and style captioning

## Executive Summary
LibriTTS-P is a new English corpus derived from LibriTTS-R that includes utterance-level style prompts and speaker-level identity prompts for text-to-speech and style captioning applications. The corpus is built using a hybrid approach combining manual annotations for speaker characteristics and synthetic annotations for speaking style, resulting in more diverse and comprehensive prompt annotations than existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that TTS models trained with LibriTTS-P achieve higher naturalness than those trained with conventional datasets, while style captioning models generate significantly more accurate words when using this corpus.

## Method Summary
LibriTTS-P is constructed using a hybrid annotation approach that combines manual annotations for speaker identity with synthetic annotations for speaking style. The corpus covers 2,443 speakers with over 373,000 prompts, making it substantially larger and more diverse than existing prompt-based TTS datasets. Style prompts capture attributes like gender, speaking speed, pitch, and loudness, while speaker prompts use perceptual and impression words to capture human perceptions of speaker identity. The synthetic annotation approach for style prompts is designed to provide broader coverage than manual annotation alone.

## Key Results
- TTS models trained with LibriTTS-P achieve higher naturalness ratings than those trained with conventional datasets
- Style captioning models using LibriTTS-P generate 2.5 times more accurate words than models using conventional datasets
- The corpus contains over 373,000 prompts covering 2,443 speakers, making it significantly larger than existing prompt-based TTS datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid annotation approach combines the precision of manual annotations for speaker identity with the scalability and diversity of synthetic annotations for speaking style. This allows the corpus to capture both the nuanced human perceptions of speaker identity and the broader range of speaking styles needed for realistic TTS synthesis. The large scale (373,000+ prompts) provides sufficient data diversity for training robust models that can generalize across different speaking styles and speaker characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

**Text-to-Speech Systems** - Need to understand how TTS models convert text to speech using prompts for style and speaker attributes; quick check: verify TTS models can condition on both text and style/speaker prompts.

**Style Captioning** - Requires understanding of how models can automatically label speech with style attributes; quick check: confirm models can accurately predict style attributes from audio.

**Speaker Identity Representation** - Important for capturing how humans perceive and describe speaker characteristics; quick check: validate that perceptual words align with actual speaker acoustic features.

**Synthetic Annotation Generation** - Key for scaling style prompt coverage beyond manual annotation limits; quick check: verify synthetic prompts reflect actual acoustic diversity in the data.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text input -> TTS Model -> Speech Output, with Style Prompt conditioning and Speaker Prompt conditioning as parallel inputs

**Critical Path**: Text and prompt processing -> TTS synthesis network -> Waveform generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Manual vs synthetic annotation balance (accuracy vs coverage), fixed vocabulary size for speaker prompts (comprehensiveness vs manageability)

**Failure Signatures**: Poor naturalness when style prompts don't match actual speech characteristics, speaker identity mismatch when vocabulary insufficient

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline TTS training without prompts vs with LibriTTS-P style prompts
2. Style captioning accuracy comparison across different training datasets
3. Speaker identity prompt prediction accuracy validation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on human ratings and style accuracy without detailed acoustic validation of synthetic prompts
- Fixed 52-word vocabulary for speaker identity may not capture full range of human perceptions
- Performance improvements measured only against LibriTTS-R baseline without comparison to other contemporary datasets

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Corpus construction methodology and dataset statistics appear technically sound and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence**: Claims about improved naturalness and style captioning accuracy are supported but limited by evaluation metrics and baselines.

**Low Confidence**: Assertion that synthetic prompts provide more comprehensive coverage lacks empirical validation, and long-term utility of fixed vocabulary remains uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct acoustic analysis comparing synthetic style prompts to actual measured acoustic features to verify prompt accuracy.
2. Evaluate the 52-word speaker identity vocabulary through additional human perception studies to assess coverage completeness.
3. Compare LibriTTS-P performance against multiple contemporary prompt-based TTS datasets using standardized evaluation protocols.
