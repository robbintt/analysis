# On the Comparison between Multi-modal and Single-modal Contrastive Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.02837
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02837
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-modal contrastive learning outperforms single-modal learning through cooperation between modalities, achieving better feature learning and downstream generalization.

## Executive Summary
This work establishes a unified framework to compare single-modal and multi-modal contrastive learning through feature learning theory analysis. The authors study ReLU networks trained with the InfoMax objective on signal-noise data models, characterizing how signal-to-noise ratio affects generalization in downstream tasks. The analysis reveals that multi-modal contrastive learning achieves superior feature learning and downstream generalization through cooperation between modalities, while single-modal learning suffers from noise memorization. The theory is validated through synthetic and real-world experiments, including ColoredMNIST, demonstrating multi-modal approaches outperform single-modal ones in out-of-distribution settings.

## Method Summary
The authors compare single-modal and multi-modal contrastive learning by analyzing ReLU networks trained on signal-noise data models with the InfoMax objective. They track how signal and noise components evolve during gradient descent training, characterizing the growth rates of signal learning coefficients and noise memorization coefficients. The analysis reveals that multi-modal learning achieves better downstream generalization through cooperation between modalities, while single-modal learning concentrates on noise memorization. Experiments are conducted on synthetic data with controlled SNR and ColoredMNIST dataset with spurious correlations, evaluating both training loss convergence and out-of-distribution test accuracy.

## Key Results
- Multi-modal contrastive learning achieves better downstream generalization by leveraging cooperation between modalities to learn signal features while suppressing noise memorization
- Single-modal contrastive learning suffers from noise memorization that prevents linear separability in downstream tasks
- The analysis characterizes how signal-to-noise ratio affects the scale difference between signal learning and noise memorization at convergence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-modal contrastive learning achieves better downstream generalization by leveraging cooperation between modalities to learn signal features while suppressing noise memorization
- Mechanism: The second modality acts as a quality signal filter. When one modality has higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), it helps the other modality focus on signal learning during gradient descent, reducing noise memorization that harms downstream tasks
- Core assumption: The two modalities share the same signal (label) but have different noise distributions, and at least one modality has sufficiently high SNR
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Through the cooperation between the two modalities, multi-modal contrastive learning can achieve better feature learning, leading to improvements in performance in downstream tasks compared to single-modal learning."
  - [section] "The results show that, through the cooperation between modalities, multi-modal contrastive learning can achieve better generalization in the downstream task."
  - [corpus] Weak - neighboring papers focus on applications rather than theoretical mechanisms
- Break condition: If both modalities have low SNR or the modalities are uncorrelated, cooperation cannot improve feature learning

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Single-modal contrastive learning suffers from noise memorization that prevents linear separability in downstream tasks
- Mechanism: Without a second modality to provide quality filtering, the network memorizes noise patterns during training, leading to embeddings that are not linearly separable for downstream classification
- Core assumption: Data augmentation alone doesn't improve SNR, so single-modal learning focuses on noise memorization rather than signal extraction
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "single-modal learning concentrates on noise memorization" and "generalizes poorly on the downstream tasks."
  - [section] "single-modal contrastive learning concentrates on learning noise from the data, and thus generalizes poorly on the downstream tasks."
  - [corpus] Weak - neighboring papers don't discuss single-modal limitations in detail
- Break condition: If the single modality has very high SNR or if strong data augmentation effectively improves SNR

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-modal learning synchronizes signal learning between modalities through gradient descent optimization
- Mechanism: During training, neurons that initially respond to signal in one modality become aligned with signal-responsive neurons in the other modality, creating synchronized signal learning patterns across both encoders
- Core assumption: The signal is shared between modalities and the initialization conditions allow for synchronization to occur
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The pre-synchronization phase reduces the speed of learning and thus we can only focus on neurons with the same sign for the initialization in order to decide the lower and upper bound."
  - [section] "Thanks to the correlation between the two modality during gradient descent training, the two neural network converge at the same time"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in neighboring papers about synchronization mechanisms
- Break condition: If the modalities are poorly aligned or the signal is not sufficiently correlated between modalities

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in feature learning
  - Why needed here: SNR determines whether the network learns signal features (good generalization) or memorizes noise (poor generalization)
  - Quick check question: Given signal vector µ with ∥µ∥² = 100 and noise variance σ²ξ = 1 in d=1000 dimensions, what is the SNR?

- Concept: Gradient descent dynamics in non-convex optimization
  - Why needed here: The analysis tracks how weight vectors evolve over iterations, showing exponential growth in signal learning and noise memorization
  - Quick check question: In ReLU networks, why does the sign of the inner product with signal vectors determine the growth pattern?

- Concept: Feature learning theory and generalization bounds
  - Why needed here: The work characterizes how training dynamics affect downstream test error through the scale difference between signal learning and noise memorization
  - Quick check question: How does the ratio of signal coefficient to noise coefficient at convergence affect linear separability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data generation → Encoder training (gradient descent) → Signal/noise coefficient tracking → Downstream evaluation
- Critical path: Data generation → Encoder training (gradient descent) → Signal/noise coefficient tracking → Downstream evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Hard negative sampling vs random negatives: Hard negatives enable convergence but may slow initial learning
  - Stop-gradient operation: Stabilizes training but may limit information flow
  - Modality dimension matching: Simplified analysis assumes d = ed, but mismatched dimensions are possible
- Failure signatures:
  - Training loss converges but test accuracy remains near random (single-modal case)
  - Slow convergence due to pre-synchronization phase in multi-modal learning
  - Scale difference between signal and noise coefficients not maintained in second stage
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement synthetic data generation with controlled SNR and verify training loss convergence for both single and multi-modal cases
  2. Track signal learning (γ coefficients) and noise memorization (ρ coefficients) during training to confirm scale differences
  3. Test downstream classification accuracy on out-of-distribution data to compare generalization performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the findings generalize to cases where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is different across modalities, rather than being equal?
- Basis in paper: The paper assumes d = ed and σξ = σ̃ξ for simplicity, but acknowledges that extensions to unmatched dimensions and noise levels are possible. The theoretical results rely on the assumption that the two modalities have the same SNR.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the implications of having different SNRs in the two modalities, which could affect the cooperation between modalities and the resulting feature learning and generalization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing multi-modal contrastive learning with different SNRs across modalities, and theoretical analysis extending the current framework to handle mismatched SNRs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of data augmentation strategy impact the performance of single-modal contrastive learning compared to multi-modal contrastive learning?
- Basis in paper: The paper uses a specific data augmentation strategy where the signal stays invariant while the noise vector is corrupted with added independent noise. It argues that single-modal learning does not benefit from this augmentation as much as multi-modal learning because the SNR remains the same.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore other data augmentation strategies or their impact on the relative performance of single-modal and multi-modal contrastive learning. Different augmentation strategies might change the effective SNR or introduce other factors that could influence the learning process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing different data augmentation strategies and their effects on the performance of single-modal and multi-modal contrastive learning, along with theoretical analysis of how augmentation affects the SNR and feature learning in each case.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the theoretical findings extend to more complex data models beyond the simple signal-noise model used in the paper?
- Basis in paper: The paper uses a data model consisting of signal and noise, where the signal is correlated across modalities and the noise is independent. This is a simplified model that may not capture the complexity of real-world data.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges that the data model is simplified and that extensions to more complex models are possible, but does not explore these extensions or their implications for the theoretical results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis extending the current framework to handle more complex data models, such as those with multiple signal components, hierarchical structure, or non-linear relationships between modalities. Experimental results validating the theoretical predictions on datasets with more complex data structures.

## Limitations
- The analysis relies on specific signal-noise data models with controlled SNR conditions that may not generalize to real-world data distributions
- The theoretical framework assumes Gaussian noise and linear signal structures that may not hold in practice
- The synchronization mechanism between modalities depends on specific initialization conditions and correlation structures that are not fully characterized

| Gradient synchronization | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Test the synchronization mechanism empirically by tracking neuron activation patterns across modalities during training on synthetic data with varying correlation strengths
2. Evaluate the framework on more realistic multi-modal datasets (e.g., vision-language pairs) to assess generalization beyond controlled signal-noise models
3. Investigate the impact of different initialization strategies on the pre-synchronization phase and downstream performance in multi-modal contrastive learning
