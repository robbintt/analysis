## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.04472
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04472
- Reference count: 11

## Executive Summary
This paper surveys efficient federated learning methods for training foundation models, addressing the challenges of computational and communication efficiency. The authors introduce a novel taxonomy focused on these two key aspects and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of various parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. They also examine the readiness of current federated learning frameworks to work with foundation models and highlight future research opportunities.

## Method Summary
The paper provides a comprehensive survey of existing computational and communication efficiency methods for federated learning with foundation models. It reviews parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, adapters, prompt tuning), communication compression methods (quantization, sparsification, low-rank compression), and model pruning approaches. The authors analyze the effectiveness and limitations of these methods in federated settings, considering factors like data heterogeneity and hardware constraints.

## Key Results
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning can reduce communication by up to 99.8% by training only a small fraction of model parameters
- Communication-efficient compression techniques enable training of large foundation models within bandwidth constraints
- Current federated learning frameworks require significant adaptation to effectively work with foundation models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) reduces communication load by training only a small fraction of model parameters
- Mechanism: PEFT techniques like LoRA and adapters add small trainable modules to a frozen foundation model, allowing fine-tuning without updating all billions of parameters. This means only the adapter parameters (e.g., 1-2% of total) need to be communicated between clients and server
- Core assumption: The frozen foundation model retains sufficient upstream knowledge for downstream tasks, and the added small modules can capture task-specific adjustments
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "PEFT often reduces the number of trainable parameters below 1% of all model parameters."
  - [section] "Sun et al. [2023] propose FedPEFT... reducing communication by 99.8%."
- Break condition: If the downstream task requires significant adaptation of the base model or the data distribution shifts drastically, PEFT may underperform compared to full fine-tuning

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Communication-efficient compression techniques (quantization, sparsification, low-rank compression) enable training of large foundation models within bandwidth constraints
- Mechanism: These techniques reduce the size of model updates sent between clients and server. Quantization reduces numeric precision, sparsification zeroes out less important parameters, and low-rank compression transforms high-dimensional updates into lower-dimensional representations. Combined with PEFT, they further reduce communication
- Core assumption: The compressed representation retains enough information for accurate model aggregation and convergence
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We discuss communication efficiency methods along two major categories... quantization... sparsification... low-rank compression."
  - [section] "FedPAQ... achieves significant communication efficiencies... by combining FedAvg with strong quantization guarantees."
- Break condition: Excessive compression may remove critical information, leading to poor model quality or failure to converge, especially with non-IID data

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Model pruning in federated settings allows clients to communicate only the most important parameters for their local task
- Mechanism: PruneFL and similar methods identify important parameters via a global pruning mask, and clients only update and send these. This reduces both communication and potentially computation if supported by hardware
- Core assumption: There exists a common set of important parameters across clients that can be identified and maintained globally, even with non-IID data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Jiang et al. [2022] introduce PruneFL... The first stage is carried out on a powerful client to find a common initialization for the model and generate the importance-based pruning mask."
- Break condition: If the data heterogeneity is too high, a single global pruning mask may be ineffective, leading to poor model performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Federated Learning basics (global objective minimization, local training, parameter aggregation)
  - Why needed here: The survey builds on standard FL concepts but applies them to foundation models, so understanding the FL framework is essential
  - Quick check question: In federated learning, what is the role of the central server during the training process?

- Concept: Foundation Models and their characteristics (large scale, pre-trained on diverse data, fine-tunable)
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on how to adapt FMs in federated settings, so knowing what FMs are and why they require special handling is crucial
  - Quick check question: Why are foundation models particularly challenging to fine-tune in federated learning compared to smaller models?

- Concept: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA, adapters, prompt tuning)
  - Why needed here: These are the main computational efficiency techniques discussed for FM training, so understanding how they work is key to grasping the survey's taxonomy
  - Quick check question: How does LoRA achieve parameter efficiency compared to full fine-tuning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Distributed clients (with local data and compute) -> Central server (for aggregation) -> Foundation models (large pre-trained models) -> PEFT modules (adapter layers, LoRA matrices) -> Communication channels (with compression applied)
- Critical path: Client trains PEFT parameters locally → compresses updates → sends to server → server aggregates → sends updated global PEFT parameters back to clients
- Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency (via PEFT) vs. model quality; communication efficiency (via compression) vs. convergence speed and model accuracy; hardware support for sparse operations vs. theoretical benefits of pruning
- Failure signatures: Slow or failed convergence, large accuracy gaps vs. centralized baselines, high communication costs despite PEFT, or clients dropping due to long warm-up times
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement FedAvg with a small model (e.g., BERT-base) on a standard FL benchmark (e.g., EMNIST) to verify the FL framework works
  2. Add LoRA adapters to the same model and dataset, measure communication savings and accuracy impact
  3. Introduce quantization or low-rank compression on the LoRA updates, evaluate the trade-off between communication reduction and model quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are good and realistic evaluation strategies for generative downstream tasks in FL settings where we do not have control of data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly mention this as a future research direction: "What are good and realistic evaluation strategies for generative downstream tasks in FL settings where we do not have control of data?"
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation methods focus on classification tasks, and there's a lack of standardized benchmarks for generative tasks in federated settings. The authors note that "we require benchmarking tools that allow us to holistically validate the quality and efficiency of FL methods for FMs."
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarks specifically designed for generative tasks in federated learning scenarios, including methods to define and measure data heterogeneity in generative contexts

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does hyperparameter optimization work for FMs in continuously evolving FL systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "How does hyperparameter optimization work for FMs in continuously evolving FL systems?"
- Why unresolved: The authors explain that "PEFT has been shown to be particularly sensitive to non-IID data, which further increases the complexity of hyperparameter optimization." They also mention that current methods like SLoRA require long warm-up times, indicating the difficulty of optimizing hyperparameters in dynamic federated environments
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of efficient hyperparameter optimization techniques that can adapt to changing data distributions and system dynamics in federated learning, potentially through online learning methods or meta-learning approaches

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do PEFT and privacy in FL work together?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly pose this question: "How do PEFT and privacy in FL work together?"
- Why unresolved: The authors note that "Communication-efficient FL techniques, such as FedPM have been studied for their effect on privacy, but this is still an open topic for PEFT, PT, and IT." They highlight that PEFT is more sensitive to data heterogeneity and that the effects of perturbation through differential privacy are still unclear
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of differential privacy mechanisms when applied to PEFT techniques in FL, including analysis of the trade-offs between privacy guarantees and model performance

## Limitations

- The survey relies on reported results without independent verification, particularly for specific efficiency claims like 99.8% communication reduction
- The effectiveness of communication efficiency methods depends heavily on implementation details and hyperparameter choices that vary across studies
- The claim about current FL frameworks being insufficient for FM training lacks quantitative benchmarks comparing FM-specific vs. traditional FL frameworks

## Confidence

- Confidence in computational efficiency claims (Medium): While parameter-efficient fine-tuning mechanisms like LoRA are well-established, the specific 99.8% communication reduction claimed by FedPEFT requires empirical validation under realistic FL conditions with heterogeneous clients and non-IID data
- Confidence in communication efficiency methods (Medium): The survey accurately categorizes existing compression techniques, but their effectiveness depends heavily on implementation details and hyperparameter choices that vary across studies
- Confidence in foundation model readiness assessment (Low-Medium): The claim that current FL frameworks are insufficient for FM training is reasonable but lacks quantitative benchmarks comparing FM-specific vs. traditional FL frameworks

## Next Checks

1. Implement LoRA-based FedAvg with varying sparsity levels on EMNIST dataset, measuring convergence vs. communication reduction trade-off
2. Compare standard FedAvg, FedAvg with LoRA, and FedAvg with LoRA+quantization on the same task, documenting accuracy gaps and communication costs
3. Test FedPEFT or similar PEFT methods with heterogeneous client compute capabilities, measuring the impact of LoRA rank selection on both performance and efficiency
