# Risk-averse Total-reward MDPs with ERM and EVaR

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.17286
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17286
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing risk-averse objectives in Markov decision processes (MDPs) using the total reward criterion (TRC) with Entropic Risk Measure (ERM) and Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR) risk measures.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for optimizing risk-averse objectives in Markov decision processes (MDPs) using the total reward criterion (TRC) with Entropic Risk Measure (ERM) and Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR) risk measures. The authors establish theoretical foundations showing that risk-averse TRC with ERM and EVaR admits optimal stationary policies in transient MDPs, making them simple to analyze, interpret, and deploy. The work relaxes constraints from prior research by allowing both positive and negative rewards in the MDP framework, significantly expanding the applicability of risk-averse reinforcement learning approaches.

## Method Summary
The authors propose algorithms including exponential value iteration, policy iteration, and linear programming to compute optimal policies for risk-averse total-reward MDPs. These algorithms leverage the theoretical properties of ERM and EVaR to provide δ-optimal EVaR policies. The approach demonstrates that the total reward criterion may be preferable to the discounted criterion in risk-averse reinforcement learning domains. The methods are designed to handle both positive and negative rewards, relaxing constraints from prior research and expanding the applicability of risk-averse MDP formulations.

## Key Results
- Risk-averse TRC with ERM and EVaR admits optimal stationary policies in transient MDPs
- Proposed algorithms can compute δ-optimal EVaR policies
- Total reward criterion may be preferable to discounted criterion in risk-averse reinforcement learning domains
- Methods handle both positive and negative rewards in MDP framework

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by leveraging the mathematical properties of ERM and EVaR risk measures within the total reward criterion framework. These risk measures provide a way to quantify and optimize for risk-averse objectives while maintaining desirable theoretical properties such as the existence of optimal stationary policies. The exponential value iteration and policy iteration algorithms exploit these properties to efficiently compute optimal policies that balance expected rewards with risk considerations.

## Foundational Learning

**Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: Why needed - MDPs provide the fundamental framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty; Quick check - Verify understanding of states, actions, transitions, and rewards structure.

**Risk Measures**: Why needed - Essential for quantifying and optimizing risk-averse objectives; Quick check - Understand the mathematical definitions and properties of ERM and EVaR.

**Total Reward Criterion vs Discounted Criterion**: Why needed - Determines how rewards are aggregated over time; Quick check - Compare the long-term behavior and optimization properties of both criteria.

**Stationary Policies**: Why needed - Simplifies policy representation and optimization; Quick check - Verify that optimal policies do not depend on time steps in transient MDPs.

**Value Iteration and Policy Iteration**: Why needed - Core algorithms for computing optimal policies in MDPs; Quick check - Understand convergence properties and computational complexity.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: MDP environment -> Risk measure (ERM/EVaR) -> Total reward calculation -> Policy optimization algorithm (Exponential VI/Policy Iteration/LP) -> Optimal stationary policy

**Critical Path**: Define MDP -> Select risk measure -> Apply total reward criterion -> Run optimization algorithm -> Obtain δ-optimal policy

**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice between exponential value iteration, policy iteration, and linear programming involves tradeoffs between computational efficiency, convergence guarantees, and ease of implementation. Exponential VI offers simpler implementation but may converge slower, while LP provides strong optimality guarantees but at higher computational cost.

**Failure Signatures**: Non-convergence of value iteration, inability to find stationary optimal policies, or computational intractability for large state spaces may indicate issues with algorithm selection or parameter tuning.

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify convergence of exponential value iteration on small test MDPs; 2) Compare risk-averse policies against risk-neutral baselines; 3) Test scalability on larger MDP instances.

## Next Checks

1. Implement the proposed algorithms and benchmark their performance on standard MDP testbeds with known optimal solutions to verify computational correctness and efficiency
2. Conduct empirical studies comparing the proposed risk-averse total-reward approach against existing discounted criterion methods in terms of both risk sensitivity and computational tractability
3. Extend the theoretical analysis to characterize the convergence rates and computational complexity bounds of the exponential value iteration and policy iteration algorithms under various MDP parameter regimes
