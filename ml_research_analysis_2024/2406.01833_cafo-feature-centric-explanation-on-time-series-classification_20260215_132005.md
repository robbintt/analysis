- CAFO introduces a feature-centric explanation framework for multivariate time series classification

## Executive Summary
CAFO presents a novel framework for explaining multivariate time series classification by shifting from traditional time-centric to feature-centric explainability. The approach combines a depth-wise separable channel attention module (DepCA) with a QR-orthogonalization loss to generate stable, interpretable attention scores for individual features. This enables evaluation of both global and class-specific feature importance through novel metrics validated on benchmark and custom datasets, demonstrating superior performance in feature ranking accuracy and consistency compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
CAFO addresses the limitations of traditional time-centric explainability methods by introducing a feature-centric approach for multivariate time series classification. The framework employs a depth-wise separable channel attention module (DepCA) that applies 1D depth-wise convolution followed by 1D point-wise convolution to each feature channel independently. A key innovation is the QR-orthogonalization loss, which regularizes attention scores to produce stable and consistent explanations across model runs. The framework provides two novel metrics - Global Importance (GI) for overall feature importance and Class-wise Relative Importance (CWRI) for class-specific feature importance. These metrics enable comprehensive evaluation of feature contributions in time series classification tasks.

## Key Results
- CAFO demonstrates superior feature ranking accuracy with 10/12 metric improvements on Gilon and 9/12 on MS Activity datasets
- The framework achieves 94% accuracy on Gilon using only 3 key sensors compared to 71% with the 3 least important ones
- Integrating QR-Ortho loss significantly improves explainability performance and consistency across model runs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CAFO works by decomposing the attention mechanism at the feature level rather than the time-step level. The depth-wise separable channel attention allows each feature to be processed independently while maintaining computational efficiency. The QR-orthogonalization loss enforces orthogonality constraints on the attention scores, preventing them from becoming redundant or unstable. This combination ensures that the resulting attention weights accurately reflect the true importance of each feature in the classification decision, rather than being influenced by temporal correlations or model artifacts.

## Foundational Learning
- Depth-wise separable convolutions: Needed for efficient feature-wise processing without excessive parameters; Quick check: Verify reduced parameter count compared to standard convolutions
- QR decomposition: Needed to enforce orthogonality constraints on attention weights; Quick check: Confirm orthogonality of weight matrices using dot product
- Channel attention mechanisms: Needed to assign importance weights to individual features; Quick check: Validate attention scores sum to meaningful total
- Orthogonal regularization: Needed to prevent attention score redundancy; Quick check: Measure correlation between attention scores before and after regularization
- Feature-centric vs time-centric explainability: Needed to shift from temporal to feature-level interpretation; Quick check: Compare feature rankings from both approaches
- Attention stability metrics: Needed to evaluate consistency across model runs; Quick check: Calculate variance of attention scores across multiple training instances

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Time Series -> DepCA Module -> QR-Orthogonalization Loss -> Attention Scores -> Feature Importance Metrics

Critical path: The sequence from input data through DepCA to QR-Ortho loss represents the core pipeline where attention scores are generated and stabilized. The feature importance metrics (GI, CWRI) depend entirely on the quality of these attention scores.

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational complexity for interpretability by using depth-wise separable convolutions, which are more efficient than standard convolutions but may capture less complex feature interactions. The QR-orthogonalization loss adds regularization overhead but significantly improves attention score stability.

Failure signatures: Poor feature rankings may indicate insufficient model capacity, improper QR-orthogonalization loss weighting, or inadequate training data diversity. Unstable attention scores suggest the regularization strength is too weak or the model hasn't converged properly.

First experiments: 1) Test DepCA module alone on a simple binary classification task to verify basic functionality, 2) Evaluate QR-orthogonalization loss impact by comparing attention score stability with and without regularization, 3) Validate feature ranking accuracy using a dataset with known ground truth feature importance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance validation primarily on benchmark and custom datasets, with limited real-world noisy data testing
- Lack of comparison with emerging feature attribution methods like integrated gradients or attention rollout
- Sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, particularly for QR-orthogonalization loss weighting, remains unexplored
- Clinical or practical interpretability of generated explanations not extensively addressed

## Confidence
High: Superior feature ranking accuracy and consistency on benchmark datasets
Medium: Claims about robustness to irrelevant signals and computational efficiency
Medium: Generalizability to diverse real-world scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test CAFO's performance on additional real-world datasets with known ground truth feature importance
2. Evaluate the framework's sensitivity to hyperparameter variations and noise levels in input data
3. Conduct a comparative study with state-of-the-art feature attribution methods to assess relative performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency
