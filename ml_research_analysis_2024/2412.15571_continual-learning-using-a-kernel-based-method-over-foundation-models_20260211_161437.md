# Continual Learning Using a Kernel-Based Method Over Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.15571
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15571
- Authors: Saleh Momeni; Sahisnu Mazumder; Bing Liu
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: KLDA achieves accuracy on par with joint training across multiple datasets, without requiring replay data or model updates

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses catastrophic forgetting and inter-task class separation in class-incremental learning (CIL) by proposing Kernel Linear Discriminant Analysis (KLDA). The method leverages foundation model features enhanced with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels approximated via Random Fourier Features. KLDA incrementally computes class means and a shared covariance matrix to define Gaussian distributions for each class, enabling classification via Linear Discriminant Analysis. The approach significantly outperforms fine-tuning, regularization, and replay-based baselines while achieving accuracy comparable to joint training without requiring replay data or model updates.

## Method Summary
KLDA is a kernel-based continual learning method that operates on frozen foundation model features. It approximates RBF kernels using Random Fourier Features (RFF) to project features into a higher-dimensional space, then applies Incremental Linear Discriminant Analysis (ILDA) with shared covariance estimation. The method computes class means and shared covariance incrementally, treating each class as a Gaussian distribution for classification. This approach enables efficient online learning without requiring replay buffers or model updates, while maintaining performance through kernel enhancement of foundation model representations.

## Key Results
- KLDA significantly outperforms fine-tuning, regularization, and replay-based baselines on both text and image datasets
- Achieves accuracy comparable to joint training across multiple datasets
- Eliminates need for replay data or model updates while maintaining strong performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
KLDA works by combining kernel enhancement with incremental learning statistics. The RBF kernel approximation via RFF projects foundation model features into a space where classes become more separable. By incrementally computing class means and maintaining a shared covariance matrix, KLDA can define accurate Gaussian distributions for each class without storing individual samples. This allows effective classification while avoiding catastrophic forgetting through the statistical representation rather than parameter updates.

## Foundational Learning
- **Random Fourier Features**: Approximate shift-invariant kernels using Monte Carlo sampling of Fourier transform; needed to make kernel methods computationally feasible for large-scale data; quick check: verify approximation quality with varying number of RFF samples
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis**: Finds linear combinations of features that best separate classes; needed for efficient classification in transformed feature space; quick check: ensure class separability in transformed space
- **Incremental Statistics**: Online computation of means and covariances; needed to avoid storing entire dataset; quick check: verify numerical stability of incremental updates
- **Gaussian Discriminant Analysis**: Models each class as a Gaussian distribution; needed for probabilistic classification framework; quick check: test Gaussian assumptions with Q-Q plots
- **Foundation Model Features**: Pre-trained representations that capture general patterns; needed as stable base for incremental learning; quick check: validate feature quality on downstream tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Foundation Model -> RFF Kernel Approximation -> Incremental Class Statistics -> Gaussian Classification

**Critical Path**: Input features → RFF transformation → Class mean/covariance updates → Discriminant scoring → Prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses kernel approximation for computational efficiency vs. exact kernel methods; incremental statistics vs. batch processing; frozen foundation models vs. fine-tuning

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation when classes overlap significantly in transformed space; numerical instability in covariance updates with very small or large feature values; breakdown when foundation model features are poor quality

**First Experiments**:
1. Test KLDA on a simple 2D synthetic dataset with known Gaussian distributions
2. Compare KLDA performance with varying numbers of RFF samples on a small benchmark
3. Evaluate memory usage and computation time versus baseline methods on a medium-sized dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does KLDA's performance scale with the number of classes and tasks in extremely large-scale continual learning scenarios?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions KLDA's memory efficiency but doesn't explore scalability to thousands of classes/tasks.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only tested up to moderate-sized datasets (10-200 classes). No analysis of performance degradation or memory constraints in extreme-scale settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Large-scale experiments testing KLDA with 1000+ classes/tasks, measuring both accuracy and memory requirements.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical limit of kernel approximation quality using Random Fourier Features for continual learning, and how does it affect classification performance?
- Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges that RFF approximates the kernel but doesn't analyze the approximation error bounds or their impact on performance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper uses RFF for computational feasibility, it doesn't establish theoretical guarantees about the approximation quality or its relationship to classification accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis of RFF approximation error bounds in the context of LDA, plus empirical studies showing the relationship between RFF parameters and classification performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does KLDA handle concept drift or non-stationary data distributions across tasks?
- Basis in paper: The paper assumes data distributions remain stable but doesn't address scenarios where task distributions shift over time.
- Why unresolved: The current framework assumes stationary distributions and doesn't incorporate mechanisms for detecting or adapting to distribution shifts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments introducing gradual or sudden distribution shifts across tasks, measuring KLDA's adaptation capabilities and potential need for distribution monitoring.

## Limitations
- Limited theoretical analysis with no formal proofs of optimality or convergence guarantees
- Experimental scope confined to relatively small-scale datasets and two modalities (text and images)
- Claims of matching joint training performance based on accuracy alone without deeper analysis of representation quality, calibration, or efficiency

## Confidence

**Theoretical claims**: Medium confidence due to limited formal analysis and lack of theoretical guarantees
**Empirical claims**: High confidence given detailed method description and strong baseline comparisons
**Generalization claims**: Low confidence for larger, more complex, or real-world scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Test KLDA on larger, more complex datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K) to assess scalability and robustness
2. Evaluate on non-vision, non-text modalities (e.g., audio, tabular data) to confirm broad applicability
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of kernel enhancement and covariance sharing, and analyze memory and computational efficiency relative to baselines
