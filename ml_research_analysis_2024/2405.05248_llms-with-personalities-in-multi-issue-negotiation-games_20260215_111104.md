# LLMs with Personalities in Multi-issue Negotiation Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.05248
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05248
- Authors: Sean Noh; Ho-Chun Herbert Chang

- Primary result: Personality traits significantly influence LLM negotiation behavior, with low agreeableness yielding higher payoffs but more exploitation, while multi-issue games increase agreement rates but reduce aggressive negotiation gains.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how personality traits affect negotiation outcomes using large language models in game-theoretical settings. Through 1,500 simulated negotiations, researchers compared single-issue and multi-issue games to assess how traits like agreeableness and openness influence payoffs and fairness. The findings reveal that personality initialization directly shapes negotiation behavior, with low agreeableness leading to higher individual payoffs but increased exploitation, while high agreeableness fosters fairer and more efficient outcomes. Domain complexity (multi-issue games) improves agreement rates but diminishes the benefits of aggressive negotiation strategies. The research demonstrates LLMs' potential for both fair and exploitative negotiation tactics based on personality-driven behavior.

## Method Summary
The study simulated 1,500 negotiations using GPT-4 Turbo via ChatGPT API, with agents initialized using system prompts defining ten personality types based on the Big Five traits. Single-issue games involved splitting $100, while multi-issue games featured 10 apples, 10 bananas, and 10 crepes with asymmetric valuations. Negotiations proceeded for up to 6 rounds with agents taking turns making offers and responses. Linguistic features were extracted using zero-shot classification, and gradient-boosted regression with SHAP explainers analyzed feature importance. The research compared personality-driven outcomes across both game types to identify behavioral patterns and payoff correlations.

## Key Results
- Low agreeableness agents achieved higher payoffs but exploited agreeable opponents more frequently
- Multi-issue negotiations increased agreement rates but reduced aggressive negotiation gains through complementarity effects
- High openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism correlated with fairer tendencies, while low agreeableness and low openness aligned with rational, payoff-maximizing strategies
- Low conscientiousness agents exhibited higher toxicity scores in their negotiation communications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Personality trait initialization directly modulates negotiation behavior and payoffs. The LLM's system prompt encodes personality traits (e.g., "high agreeableness", "low conscientiousness") that shape the agent's language style, strategic choices, and acceptance thresholds during negotiation rounds, leading to measurable differences in outcomes. This mechanism breaks if the system prompt fails to meaningfully alter the agent's negotiation behavior or if traits do not map cleanly to negotiation strategies.

### Mechanism 2
Domain complexity (single vs. multi-issue) changes negotiation dynamics and fairness-efficiency tradeoffs. Multi-issue negotiations with asymmetric valuations allow agents to find synergistic trades, increasing agreement rates and average payoffs. However, this also reduces the benefit of aggressive, exploitative strategies, as efficiency gains from complementarity matter more than pure payoff maximization. This mechanism breaks if agents fail to recognize or act on complementarity or if payoffs do not improve in multi-issue games.

### Mechanism 3
Linguistic features (rationality, assertiveness, competitiveness, toxicity) can be extracted from LLM outputs and used to predict negotiation outcomes. Zero-shot classification labels agent text with pairs like (fair, rational), (assertive, submissive), etc. These scores are used as features in a gradient-boosting regression model to predict payoffs, with SHAP values revealing feature importance. This mechanism breaks if classification is unreliable or the model fails to predict payoffs accurately.

## Foundational Learning

- **Game theory basics (Nash equilibrium, Pareto frontier, bargaining games)**: Essential for interpreting negotiation outcomes, identifying rational vs. irrational behavior, and explaining why certain strategies dominate in single vs. multi-issue settings. Quick check: In a six-round game where P2 makes the final offer, what is the Nash equilibrium payoff split for P1 and P2 in the single-issue case?

- **Personality psychology (Big Five/OCEAN traits)**: Critical for understanding how personality facets are mapped to agent behavior and to interpret trait-payoff correlations. Quick check: Which OCEAN trait is most associated with exploitation of agreeable opponents in this study?

- **Machine learning interpretability (SHAP values, feature importance)**: Necessary to explain how personality and linguistic features drive negotiation outcomes and to validate the regression model's predictions. Quick check: In the SHAP analysis, which personality trait was most strongly associated with higher payoffs in multi-issue games ending in agreement?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Agent initialization (system prompts, personality facets) -> Game engine (round-based negotiation, offer/response logic) -> Output extraction (A/B/C parts, payoff recording) -> Zero-shot classification (linguistic feature extraction) -> Regression & SHAP analysis (predictive modeling, interpretability)

- **Critical path**: 1. Initialize two agents with specified personalities 2. Run negotiation rounds until agreement or default 3. Extract linguistic features from agent outputs 4. Train regression model on features + payoffs 5. Generate SHAP explanations for feature importance

- **Design tradeoffs**: Single vs. multi-issue (more complex negotiations increase agreement but reduce exploitation gains), Zero-shot vs. fine-tuned classification (faster to implement but potentially less reliable), Rational vs. fair framing (may influence agreement rates vs. payoff size)

- **Failure signatures**: Low agreement rates or random payoffs suggest issues with agent initialization or game logic, Poor regression fit or meaningless SHAP values indicate problems with feature extraction or model design

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Compare single-issue payoffs for high vs. low agreeableness agents 2. Measure toxicity scores for low conscientiousness agents vs. others 3. Test regression model accuracy on a held-out validation set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does domain complexity (single vs. multi-issue negotiations) influence payoff dynamics for different personality types? While the paper identifies that multi-issue negotiations generally lead to higher payoffs, it does not fully explore the underlying mechanisms driving this difference, particularly regarding preference complementarity and Pareto efficiency.

### Open Question 2
What are the linguistic and rhetorical strategies most effective for maximizing payoffs across different personality types? The paper identifies correlations between personality traits and linguistic features but lacks a comprehensive analysis of which specific rhetorical strategies are most effective for each personality type.

### Open Question 3
How does the interaction between personality traits and negotiation strategies influence the risk of exploitation in multi-issue negotiations? While the paper suggests that multi-issue negotiations reduce exploitation, it does not fully explore how personality traits and negotiation strategies interact to influence this dynamic.

## Limitations

- The study relies on zero-shot classification for linguistic feature extraction, introducing uncertainty about the reliability of extracted personality-behavior correlations.
- The simulation framework uses a fixed 6-round negotiation structure with predetermined turn order, which may not generalize to open-ended or human-negotiated scenarios.
- The analysis focuses on aggregate behavior across personality types but does not account for potential interactions between specific personality pairings or the stability of outcomes across different random seeds.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Domain complexity effects (single vs. multi-issue games improve agreement but reduce exploitation gains) - supported by direct simulation results and consistent with game-theoretic expectations.
- **Medium confidence**: Personality trait effects on payoffs and fairness - results align with theoretical predictions, but zero-shot classification introduces measurement uncertainty.
- **Low confidence**: Linguistic feature extraction validity - zero-shot classification methodology lacks external validation, making behavioral interpretations tentative.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate key results using human-annotated linguistic features instead of zero-shot classification to verify the robustness of personality-behavior correlations.
2. Test negotiation outcomes across multiple random seeds to assess the stability of personality-driven effects and ensure results aren't artifacts of specific LLM generations.
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the personality system prompts to measure the actual impact of personality initialization on negotiation behavior versus baseline LLM performance.
