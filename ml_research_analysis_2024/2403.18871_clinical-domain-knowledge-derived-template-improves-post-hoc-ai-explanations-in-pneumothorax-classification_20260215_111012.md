core_contribution: This study introduces a template-guided approach to improve explainable
  AI (XAI) methods for pneumothorax diagnosis on chest radiographs. By incorporating
  clinical knowledge about the typical location of pneumothorax (the pleural space),
  the approach generates a template from a single radiologist-annotated lesion and
  uses it to constrain and refine model explanations.

- Introduces template-guided approach to improve explainable AI for pneumothorax diagnosis on chest radiographs

## Executive Summary
This study presents a template-guided approach to enhance explainable AI (XAI) methods for pneumothorax diagnosis in chest radiographs. The method incorporates clinical knowledge about pneumothorax typically occurring in the pleural space by creating a template from a single radiologist-annotated lesion. This template is used to constrain and refine model explanations by superimposing it on saliency maps, Grad-CAM, and Integrated Gradients outputs to filter out explanations outside the clinically relevant region. The approach was evaluated across two datasets and two deep learning models, demonstrating significant improvements in explanation quality metrics.

## Method Summary
The template-guided approach begins by generating a binary mask from a single radiologist-annotated pneumothorax lesion, representing the typical anatomical location of pneumothorax in the pleural space. This template is then superimposed on various post hoc explanation methods including saliency maps, Grad-CAM, and Integrated Gradients to filter out explanations that fall outside the clinically relevant region. The method was evaluated on two datasets using two different deep learning models, measuring improvements in explanation quality through Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) metrics compared to baseline XAI methods.

## Key Results
- Template guidance improved IoU by up to 97.8% compared to baseline methods
- DSC improvements reached up to 94.1% with template guidance
- The approach consistently enhanced explanation quality across different XAI methods and datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The template-guided approach works by incorporating clinical domain knowledge about the typical anatomical location of pneumothorax into the explanation generation process. By constraining explanations to the pleural space region where pneumothorax is expected to occur, the method filters out spurious or anatomically implausible explanations that would otherwise reduce explanation quality. This clinical knowledge integration helps align AI explanations more closely with ground-truth lesion areas, improving the relevance and interpretability of the model's decision-making process.

## Foundational Learning
- Template creation from clinical annotations - needed to represent domain knowledge about disease location; quick check: verify template accurately captures typical pneumothorax anatomy
- Post hoc explanation methods (Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients) - needed as baseline explanation approaches; quick check: ensure baseline methods produce reasonable explanations before template application
- IoU and DSC metrics - needed to quantitatively evaluate explanation quality; quick check: validate metric calculations against ground truth masks

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Raw chest X-ray -> Deep learning model -> Baseline XAI method -> Template constraint -> Refined explanation

Critical path: Template creation → Explanation method application → Template-guided filtering → Quality evaluation

Design tradeoffs: Single annotation vs. multiple annotations for template creation; computational overhead of template application vs. explanation quality gains

Failure signatures: Template too restrictive (filtering valid explanations); template misalignment with actual lesion location; baseline explanation methods already accurate (limited improvement)

First experiments:
1. Apply template guidance to Grad-CAM explanations on validation set
2. Compare IoU improvements across different template creation methods
3. Test template performance on pneumothorax cases with atypical locations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Template relies on single radiologist annotation, potentially missing inter-observer variability
- Evaluation focused on binary classification rather than pneumothorax severity spectrum
- Generalizability to other thoracic pathologies not empirically validated
- Clinical utility translation from improved metrics to real-world decision support not addressed

## Confidence
- High confidence: Template-guided approach improves quantitative explanation quality metrics (IoU, DSC) for pneumothorax localization
- Medium confidence: Clinical domain knowledge integration is the primary driver of explanation improvements
- Medium confidence: Approach is generalizable to other chest X-ray pathologies, though not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate template performance across multiple radiologist annotations to assess robustness to inter-observer variability in pneumothorax localization
2. Test the template-guided approach on chest X-ray pathologies with different anatomical distributions (e.g., pulmonary nodules, consolidations) to validate generalizability
3. Conduct user studies with radiologists to determine if improved explanation quality metrics translate to better clinical utility and trust in AI-assisted diagnosis
