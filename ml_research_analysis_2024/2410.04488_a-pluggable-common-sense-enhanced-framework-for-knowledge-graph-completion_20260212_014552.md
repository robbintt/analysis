# A Pluggable Common Sense-Enhanced Framework for Knowledge Graph Completion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.04488
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04488
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Improves knowledge graph completion by 12.5% in Hits@1 on FB15K using common sense reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a pluggable framework for knowledge graph completion (KGC) that incorporates common sense reasoning into existing embedding-based approaches. The key innovation is automatically generating explicit or implicit common sense triples from factual triples and using these to improve both training and inference in knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. The framework introduces two models: ECSE for KGs with rich entity concepts and ICSE for those without, along with common sense-guided negative sampling and a coarse-to-fine inference mechanism. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

## Method Summary
The framework addresses KGC by generating common sense triples from factual data and integrating them into the training and inference processes. For KGs with rich entity concepts, the ECSE model generates explicit common sense triples by replacing entities with their concepts. For KGs without concepts, the ICSE model creates implicit common sense through relation-aware concept embeddings. The framework employs common sense-guided negative sampling to improve training quality and uses a coarse-to-fine inference approach that first filters candidates using common sense constraints before ranking them with learned embeddings. The models are trained jointly using multi-task learning with fact-specific and common sense-specific losses.

## Key Results
- Achieves 12.5% improvement in Hits@1 on FB15K compared to best baseline
- Outperforms state-of-the-art KGE models including TransE, RotatE, and HAKE
- Demonstrates effectiveness across multiple datasets (FB15K, FB15K237, NELL-995, DBpedia-242, WN18, YAGO3-10)
- Shows capability to represent various relational patterns and complex properties of relations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The framework improves KGC by generating explicit or implicit common sense triples from factual triples. For KGs with rich entity concepts, explicit common sense is generated by replacing entities in factual triples with their corresponding concepts. For KGs without concepts, implicit common sense is created by mapping entities to concept representations via a relation-aware embedding mechanism. Core assumption: The generated common sense triples are semantically meaningful and can improve model training and inference. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The key idea is to automatically generate explicit or implicit common sense triples from factual triples, and use these to improve both training and inference in KGE models." Break condition: If the generated common sense triples are semantically invalid or noisy, the framework's performance would degrade.

### Mechanism 2
Common sense-guided negative sampling improves the quality of negative triples used in training. The framework uses common sense to evaluate the quality of negative triple candidates. For N-1 relations, it prioritizes replacing the unique entity in a positive triple, while for non-unique entities, it assigns weights based on semantic similarity to positive triples. Core assumption: Negative triples with higher semantic similarity to positive triples are more effective for training. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Furthermore, we introduce common sense-guided negative sampling and a coarse-to-fine inference approach for KGs with rich entity concepts." Break condition: If the common sense-guided negative sampling strategy fails to generate high-quality negative triples, the model's training would be ineffective.

### Mechanism 3
Coarse-to-fine inference mechanism ensures predicted triples conform to common sense. During inference, the framework first filters candidate entities based on common sense constraints, then ranks the remaining candidates using the learned embeddings. This two-step process improves the accuracy of predictions. Core assumption: Common sense constraints effectively filter out incorrect candidate entities. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Furthermore, we introduce common sense-guided negative sampling and a coarse-to-fine inference approach for KGs with rich entity concepts." Break condition: If the common sense constraints are too restrictive or not relevant, the framework might miss correct candidate entities.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE)
  - Why needed here: KGE is the foundational technique used in the framework to learn entity and relation embeddings for KGC tasks.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between TransE and RotatE in representing relations?

- Concept: Negative Sampling in KGE
  - Why needed here: The framework uses a common sense-guided negative sampling strategy to improve the quality of negative triples used in training KGE models.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important to avoid false-negative triples in negative sampling?

- Concept: Common Sense Knowledge Graphs
  - Why needed here: The framework leverages common sense knowledge, represented as concepts and relations, to improve KGC performance.
  - Quick check question: How does ConceptNet represent common sense knowledge?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Explicit Common Sense-Enhanced (ECSE) Model -> Automatic Common Sense Generation -> Common Sense-Guided Negative Sampling -> Coarse-to-Fine Inference
- Critical path: The critical path for the framework is generating common sense triples (explicit or implicit), using them to improve negative sampling, and then applying coarse-to-fine inference to make predictions.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Explicit vs. Implicit Common Sense: ECSE uses explicit concepts, which are more accurate but require rich entity concepts in the KG. ICSE uses implicit concepts, which are more general but may be less accurate.
  - Common Sense-Guided Negative Sampling: This approach improves negative sampling quality but adds computational overhead.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on datasets with limited entity concepts: This could indicate that the framework is not effectively handling implicit common sense.
  - Overfitting to training data: This could indicate that the common sense constraints are too restrictive or not general enough.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the framework on a KG with rich entity concepts (e.g., FB15K) and compare its performance to baseline KGE models.
  2. Evaluate the framework on a KG without rich entity concepts (e.g., WN18) and compare its performance to baseline KGE models.
  3. Analyze the impact of common sense-guided negative sampling on the framework's performance by comparing it to traditional negative sampling methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the ICSE model compare to ECSE on KGs that have some entity concepts but not enough to fully utilize ECSE's explicit common sense generation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states ECSE performs better than ICSE on datasets with rich entity concepts, but doesn't directly compare their performance on KGs with limited concepts.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the models on datasets that are clearly rich in concepts or completely lack concepts, not on intermediate cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing ECSE and ICSE on datasets with varying levels of concept richness would clarify this.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the framework be extended to incorporate external knowledge sources beyond the KG itself, such as textual descriptions or images, to further improve KGC performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that multi-modal information like text descriptions and images are often unavailable for KGs, suggesting potential for integration.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on utilizing only the information within the KG itself, leaving open the question of how external knowledge sources could be incorporated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing the performance impact of integrating external knowledge sources into the framework would answer this.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the framework perform on KGs with very large numbers of entities and relations, and what are the scalability limitations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates good scalability on the tested datasets, but doesn't explore the limits of the framework's scalability.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't test the framework on extremely large KGs, leaving open questions about its performance in such scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the framework's performance on very large KGs with millions of entities and relations would provide insights into its scalability limitations.

## Limitations

- The framework's performance depends heavily on the quality of generated common sense triples, which may introduce noise if the common sense generation is inaccurate
- The distinction between ECSE and ICSE creates a dependency on the presence of rich entity concepts, potentially limiting generalizability
- The theoretical guarantees of the common sense generation process and its semantic validity are not rigorously established

## Confidence

- High confidence: The overall framework architecture and its core components (common sense generation, negative sampling, inference mechanism) are clearly described and follow established KGE principles
- Medium confidence: The empirical improvements reported on benchmark datasets are significant but the analysis of failure cases and limitations is minimal
- Low confidence: The theoretical guarantees of the common sense generation process and its semantic validity are not rigorously established

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contribution of each component (common sense generation, negative sampling, inference) to overall performance
2. Test the framework on KGs with varying levels of entity concept richness to validate the ECSE/ICSE distinction
3. Analyze the semantic validity of generated common sense triples through human evaluation or automated consistency checks
