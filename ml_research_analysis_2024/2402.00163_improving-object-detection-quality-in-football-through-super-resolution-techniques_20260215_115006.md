# Improving Object Detection Quality in Football Through Super-Resolution Techniques

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.00163
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00163
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Super-resolution preprocessing yields a 12% increase in mAP for object detection in low-resolution football videos

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the potential of super-resolution techniques to enhance object detection accuracy in football videos, where precise tracking of small objects like the ball and distant players is critical. Using the SoccerNet dataset and Faster R-CNN with RLFN-based super-resolution, the authors demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy, particularly for low-resolution inputs. The results suggest that super-resolution preprocessing can substantially benefit sports analytics and broadcasting by improving the reliability of object tracking.

## Method Summary
The study employs the SoccerNet dataset (12 football games, 100 clips at 1080p) and applies RLFN-based super-resolution to upscale low-resolution frames (320×240, 640×480, 1280×720) by factors of 2, 3, 4, and 6. The upscaled frames are then processed by Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 backbone for object detection. Performance is evaluated using mAP at IoU range 0.50:0.95 and PSNR for super-resolution quality. The RLFN models were trained on both SoccerNet and UHDSR8K datasets, with training parameters including 15,000 epochs and Adam optimizer.

## Key Results
- 12% increase in mAP@0.50:0.95 for 320×240 images when using RLFN x4 super-resolution
- Consistent detection quality improvement across all tested resolutions, with diminishing gains at higher base resolutions
- RLFN models trained on SoccerNet showed superior PSNR values on test data compared to generic training datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Super-resolution preprocessing improves detection accuracy by restoring high-frequency details lost in low-resolution inputs, making small objects (e.g., football) more discernible.
- Mechanism: RLFN-based super-resolution upscales degraded video frames, increasing spatial resolution while preserving local features and global pixel relationships. This makes the ball and players easier to detect via Faster R-CNN.
- Core assumption: The upscaled image contains sufficient detail to enable the detector to identify objects that were previously indistinguishable in the low-res version.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "with a notable 12% increase in mean Average Precision (mAP) at an IoU (Intersection over Union) range of 0.50:0.95 for 320x240 size images when increasing the resolution fourfold using RLFN."
  - [section] "The RLFN architecture stands out with its structure combining convolutional layers with attention mechanisms, allowing effective extraction of local image features and maintaining global pixel relations."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors discuss general AI tracking but not super-resolution specifics.
- Break condition: If the super-resolution introduces artifacts or distortions that mislead the detector, accuracy may decrease instead of improving.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Training super-resolution models on domain-specific datasets (SoccerNet) yields better reconstruction quality than generic datasets.
- Mechanism: Domain-specific training aligns the super-resolution network with the visual characteristics of football footage, leading to better PSNR and MSE scores on test data.
- Core assumption: The visual patterns in football footage are sufficiently distinct that a specialized model will generalize better than a generic one.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "the RLFN x2 and x3 models trained on SoccerNet, along with the RLFN x2 trained on UHDSR8K, can be considered as methods of good quality."
  - [abstract] "the RLFN was trained on the SoccerNet training dataset, it showed a higher PSNR value on the test set of SoccerNet."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence from corpus about domain-specific training benefits.
- Break condition: If the dataset lacks sufficient variability (lighting, camera angles), the model may overfit and underperform on unseen footage.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The magnitude of detection improvement decreases as the base resolution increases, but consistent gains are still observed.
- Mechanism: Low-resolution inputs benefit most from super-resolution because the relative increase in visible detail is greatest; higher-res inputs see smaller relative gains but still improved detection precision.
- Core assumption: Object detection accuracy scales non-linearly with resolution, with diminishing returns at higher base resolutions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "As the dimensions increase, the magnitude of improvement becomes more subdued; however, a discernible improvement in the quality of detection is consistently evident."
  - [section] "Notably, although Table II suggests that super-resolution models trained on the SoccerNet training dataset have superior quality, the relation to their detection efficacy remains ambiguous."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus support for diminishing returns at higher resolutions.
- Break condition: If the detector is already optimized for the given resolution, further upscaling may not yield additional accuracy gains.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Image super-resolution (SR) techniques
  - Why needed here: SR is the core preprocessing step that restores spatial detail to low-quality inputs, enabling better detection performance.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between interpolation-based and learning-based super-resolution methods?

- Concept: Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU)
  - Why needed here: These metrics are used to quantify detection accuracy before and after SR enhancement.
  - Quick check question: How does mAP@IoU=0.50:0.95 differ from mAP@IoU=0.50?

- Concept: Object detection pipeline (e.g., Faster R-CNN)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the detector's role and limitations is key to interpreting SR's impact.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main stages in Faster R-CNN, and how do they contribute to detection accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: Low-res football footage (320×240 to 1920×1080) -> SR model: RLFN (Residual Local Feature Network) for upscaling -> Detector: Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 backbone -> Output: Bounding boxes with confidence scores for ball and players

- Critical path:
  1. Load and preprocess video frames
  2. Apply RLFN to upscale frames
  3. Run Faster R-CNN on upscaled frames
  4. Evaluate detection metrics (mAP, IoU)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Upscaling factor: Higher factors increase detail but may introduce noise
  - Training data: SoccerNet vs UHDSR8K affects reconstruction quality
  - Model complexity: RLFN balances efficiency and quality

- Failure signatures:
  - Low PSNR after SR → poor reconstruction quality
  - mAP drops post-SR → artifacts misleading detector
  - GPU memory overflow → reduce batch size or model complexity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test Faster R-CNN on original 320×240 frames; record mAP@0.50:0.95
  2. Apply RLFN x4 to 320×240 frames; run detector; compare mAP
  3. Repeat with 640×480 and 1280×720; plot improvement vs. base resolution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different super-resolution techniques compare in their effectiveness for improving object detection accuracy in football videos?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on one super-resolution technique (RLFN) and its impact on object detection accuracy. However, it mentions that various super-resolution techniques exist and could potentially yield different results.
- Why unresolved: The study only investigates the RLFN technique, leaving the comparative effectiveness of other super-resolution methods unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comprehensive study comparing multiple super-resolution techniques (e.g., ESRGAN, SRGAN, EDSR) on the same football video dataset and measuring their impact on object detection accuracy using metrics like mAP and IoU.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can real-time super-resolution and object detection algorithms be developed for live football broadcasts without significant latency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the potential benefits of super-resolution for real-time sports analytics and broadcasting but does not address the challenges of implementing these techniques in a live environment.
- Why unresolved: Real-time processing requires significant computational resources and efficient algorithms, which are not explored in the current study.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing a real-time super-resolution and object detection system on live football broadcasts, measuring latency and accuracy, and comparing it to existing methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of super-resolution-enhanced object detection vary across different weather conditions and lighting environments in football matches?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that future work could explore domain-specific super-resolution techniques optimized for varying weather conditions and lighting environments, but does not investigate this aspect.
- Why unresolved: The study uses a dataset captured under controlled conditions, limiting the generalizability of the findings to real-world scenarios with varying weather and lighting.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using football videos captured in diverse weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow, fog) and lighting environments (e.g., day, night, artificial lighting) to evaluate the robustness of super-resolution-enhanced object detection algorithms.

## Limitations

- Limited external validation on datasets beyond SoccerNet reduces generalizability
- Computational overhead of super-resolution not quantified for real-time applications
- No exploration of potential adversarial effects where SR artifacts could mislead the detector

## Confidence

- 12% mAP improvement claim: Medium confidence (specific dataset and pipeline, no external validation)
- Domain-specific training improves reconstruction quality: Low confidence (weak supporting evidence from paper and corpus)
- Diminishing returns at higher resolutions: Medium confidence (plausible but lacks robust statistical validation)

## Next Checks

1. Test the RLFN + Faster R-CNN pipeline on an independent football dataset (e.g., Sports Video Dataset) to verify external validity.
2. Measure end-to-end inference latency with SR preprocessing to assess real-time feasibility.
3. Conduct ablation studies removing SR artifacts to quantify their impact on detection accuracy.
