# Method and Software Tool for Generating Artificial Databases of Biomedical Images Based on Deep Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.16119
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16119
- Reference count: 0
- Generates 2000 artificial biomedical images per class at 64x64 resolution from 185 original images

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method for generating artificial biomedical images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address the challenge of limited datasets in medical imaging. The approach employs a custom GAN architecture based on ResNet blocks with self-attention mechanisms, trained on a small dataset of histopathological images. The system is implemented as a Python-based pipeline integrated with Google Cloud Platform services, generating synthetic images that can augment training datasets for deep learning models in oncology diagnosis.

## Method Summary
The method uses GANs with a custom architecture combining ResNet blocks and self-attention mechanisms to synthesize histopathological images. A small dataset of 185 original 64x64 images is augmented through affine transformations (random scaling, rotation, and translation) to create approximately 700 training images. The GAN is trained for 100,000 epochs using Adam optimizer with specific learning rates for generator and discriminator. The system generates 2000 artificial images per class, which are evaluated using Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distance metrics. The implementation leverages PyTorch and Google Cloud Platform services including Vertex AI, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL for deployment and storage.

## Key Results
- Generated 2000 artificial images per class at 64x64 resolution
- Achieved Inception Score (IS) of 3.025 and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 68
- Successfully deployed as a cloud-based service with database integration for tracking generated images
- Demonstrated feasibility of generating realistic biomedical images for data augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
GAN-based image synthesis effectively addresses limited biomedical image datasets by generating diverse, high-quality synthetic images. The generator network learns to produce realistic images that fool the discriminator, while the discriminator learns to distinguish real from fake images. This adversarial process leads to increasingly realistic synthetic images that can augment the training dataset.

Core assumption: Synthetic images are sufficiently similar to real images to improve model training without introducing harmful artifacts.
Evidence anchors:
- Generated images achieved IS of 3.025 and FID of 68, demonstrating reasonable diversity and quality
- Images are described as "suitable for augmenting training datasets"

Break condition: If FID or IS metrics degrade significantly during training, or if synthetic images show obvious artifacts that would harm model performance.

### Mechanism 2
Data augmentation through affine transformations significantly improves GAN training performance when starting with limited datasets. By applying random scaling, rotation, and translation to the original 185 images, the effective training dataset size increases from 185 to approximately 700 images, providing more diverse training examples for the GAN.

Core assumption: Affine transformations preserve essential features while creating meaningful variations that help the GAN learn robust representations.
Evidence anchors:
- Dataset expanded to approximately 700 images through affine transformations
- Transformations include random rotation, translation, and scaling applied with 50% probability

Break condition: If augmented images introduce unrealistic distortions that confuse the GAN or if augmentation parameters need excessive tuning.

### Mechanism 3
The ResNet-based architecture with self-attention mechanisms enables effective generation of high-quality 64x64 biomedical images. ResNet blocks provide stable training through residual connections, while self-attention mechanisms allow the network to capture long-range dependencies in the image data, crucial for maintaining realistic tissue structures in histopathological images.

Core assumption: Architectural choices (ResNet + self-attention) are appropriate for the specific characteristics of biomedical images, particularly histopathological tissue patterns.
Evidence anchors:
- Architecture based on ResNet Block with self-attention mechanism in both generator and discriminator
- Trained for 100,000 iterations with FID and IS metrics used for quality assessment

Break condition: If the network fails to generate realistic tissue structures or if training becomes unstable despite architectural choices designed for stability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their training dynamics
  - Why needed here: Understanding the adversarial training process between generator and discriminator is crucial for debugging training issues and improving image quality
  - Quick check question: What happens to the generator's loss when the discriminator becomes too strong during training?

- Concept: Image quality evaluation metrics (FID and IS)
  - Why needed here: These metrics provide quantitative measures of synthetic image quality and diversity, essential for assessing whether generated images are useful for training
  - Quick check question: Why would a low FID score be desirable but a high IS score also be desirable?

- Concept: Data augmentation techniques and their impact on model generalization
  - Why needed here: Understanding how affine transformations affect the learning process helps in selecting appropriate augmentation strategies for limited datasets
  - Quick check question: How might excessive rotation augmentation negatively impact the quality of generated histopathological images?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data pipeline (Original images → Augmentation → GAN training → Image generation) → Cloud infrastructure (GCP services with PyTorch training) → Evaluation (FID and IS metrics with Inception v3) → Storage (PostgreSQL database for tracking)
- Critical path: Training pipeline (data loading → augmentation → GAN training → evaluation) → Deployment (model export → Vertex AI deployment → URL endpoint)
- Design tradeoffs: Image resolution (64x64) vs. computational cost and training stability; augmentation strength vs. preservation of realistic tissue features; cloud-based infrastructure vs. local development flexibility
- Failure signatures: Mode collapse (limited image variety); discriminator overfitting (near-perfect real/fake distinction); training instability (oscillating losses or exploding gradients)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train the GAN on augmented data for 1000 iterations and monitor FID/IS trends
  2. Generate 100 test images and visually inspect for realistic tissue structures
  3. Test the deployed model endpoint by generating images with different parameters and verifying database records are created correctly

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the optimal GAN architecture and hyperparameters for generating high-resolution biomedical images (above 64x64 pixels) while maintaining quality and diversity? The paper mentions limitations with current GAN architectures for high-resolution synthesis and evaluates a 64x64 resolution model, explicitly identifying high-resolution synthesis as a challenge.

### Open Question 2
How does the quality and clinical utility of GAN-generated synthetic biomedical images compare to real images when used for training diagnostic models? While the paper generates synthetic images and evaluates them using IS and FID metrics, it does not assess whether models trained on synthetic data perform comparably to those trained on real data for actual diagnostic tasks.

### Open Question 3
What is the long-term impact of using synthetic biomedical images on model generalization and potential bias in medical AI systems? The paper discusses the potential of GANs for biomedical image synthesis but does not explore how synthetic data might affect model generalization to unseen cases or introduce biases that could impact clinical decision-making.

## Limitations
- Limited to 64x64 resolution, which is insufficient for clinical diagnostic applications
- No comparison with established GAN architectures or baseline methods to validate improvements
- Small dataset size (185 original images) raises concerns about overfitting and generalizability

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical implementation details of GAN architecture and training procedure are clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Reported quantitative results (IS and FID scores) are likely accurate but their interpretation remains uncertain without proper benchmarks
- **Low confidence**: Claim that generated images are "suitable for augmenting training datasets" lacks empirical validation through downstream task performance

## Next Checks
1. Implement baseline GAN architectures (DCGAN, StyleGAN) using the same dataset and training protocol to establish whether the proposed ResNet + self-attention architecture provides meaningful improvements
2. Train a classifier on the original dataset, then retrain with augmented datasets (original + generated images) and measure actual improvement in classification accuracy to verify utility for data augmentation
3. Test the method at higher resolutions (128x128 or 256x256) to determine whether architectural choices scale effectively for clinical diagnostic applications
