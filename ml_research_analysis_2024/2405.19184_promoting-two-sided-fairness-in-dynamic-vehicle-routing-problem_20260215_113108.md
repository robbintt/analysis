# Promoting Two-sided Fairness in Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.19184
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19184
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: 2FairGA achieves lower fairness variance while maintaining higher utility and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP) by proposing a novel Two-sided Fairness-aware Genetic Algorithm (2FairGA) framework that simultaneously considers service provider fairness, customer fairness, and utility optimization. The core method integrates constrained K-means clustering for initial service provider placement and modifies genetic algorithm fitness functions to incorporate both fairness objectives alongside utility optimization. Experiments on real-world datasets (Melbourne parking violations and NYC taxi requests) demonstrate that 2FairGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving lower fairness metrics (variance) while maintaining higher utility (capture rate/benefit) and efficiency (shorter total distance).

## Method Summary
The paper proposes 2FairGA, which combines constrained K-means clustering for initial service provider placement with a modified genetic algorithm. The clustering algorithm groups customer requests to determine optimal initial locations for service providers, while the genetic algorithm uses Leader-based Random Keys Encoding (LERK) and a multi-objective fitness function that balances service provider fairness (variance in accumulated utility), customer fairness (variance in capture rate/mean waiting time), and total utility. The algorithm iteratively evolves solutions through selection, crossover, mutation, and local optimization procedures.

## Key Results
- 2FairGA achieves lower fairness variance metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- The method maintains higher utility (capture rate/benefit) while achieving better fairness
- Total routing distance is shorter with 2FairGA compared to competing approaches
- Ablation study confirms the importance of incorporating both service provider and customer fairness considerations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
2FairGA works by explicitly optimizing for both service provider and customer fairness objectives simultaneously through its multi-objective fitness function. The constrained K-means clustering ensures initial service provider placement is geographically fair to customer distribution, while the genetic algorithm evolves solutions that balance the competing objectives of fairness and utility. The Leader-based Random Keys Encoding allows the algorithm to explore the solution space effectively while maintaining solution feasibility.

## Foundational Learning
- **Constrained K-means clustering**: Groups customer requests while respecting geographic constraints to determine optimal initial service provider locations
  - Why needed: Ensures fair initial distribution of service providers across the service area
  - Quick check: Visualize initial service provider locations against customer request density

- **Multi-objective optimization**: Balances service provider fairness, customer fairness, and utility in the fitness function
  - Why needed: Prevents optimization of one objective from degrading others
  - Quick check: Monitor fairness and utility metrics across generations

- **Leader-based Random Keys Encoding (LERK)**: Encoding scheme for genetic algorithm that maintains solution feasibility
  - Why needed: Enables effective exploration of solution space while ensuring valid service provider assignments
  - Quick check: Verify that evolved solutions satisfy problem constraints

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Constrained K-means clustering -> Initial service provider placement -> 2FairGA optimization -> Final routing solution

### Critical Path
1. Data preprocessing and clustering initialization
2. Genetic algorithm evolution with multi-objective fitness
3. Solution evaluation and selection

### Design Tradeoffs
- Fairness vs. utility optimization balance in fitness function
- Exploration vs. exploitation in genetic algorithm parameters
- Initial placement accuracy vs. computational cost

### Failure Signatures
- Poor clustering initialization leading to unfair service provider assignments
- Genetic algorithm convergence to local optima
- Imbalance between fairness and utility objectives

### 3 First Experiments
1. Test constrained K-means clustering on synthetic customer distribution data
2. Validate 2FairGA on small-scale problem with known optimal solutions
3. Compare fairness and utility metrics on Melbourne parking dataset with baseline methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of 2FairGA scale with problem size in terms of both fairness metrics and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates performance on datasets with different numbers of service providers (20, 30, 50) but does not explicitly analyze scaling trends.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides results for three specific problem sizes but doesn't systematically study how performance metrics change as problem size increases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing 2FairGA on a wider range of problem sizes (e.g., 10, 100, 200 service providers) with plots showing trends in fairness metrics, utility, and runtime.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How robust is 2FairGA to variations in fairness definitions and utility formulations across different application domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that different case studies have different formulas for calculating utility and fairness, but doesn't systematically test alternative formulations.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates effectiveness on ridesharing and parking violations, it doesn't explore how sensitive the algorithm is to different fairness definitions or utility formulations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing 2FairGA with alternative fairness metrics (e.g., different variance formulations, envy-freeness measures) and utility functions across multiple application domains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of initial service provider placement on long-term fairness and utility in highly dynamic environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the importance of initial sampling using constrained K-means clustering but doesn't analyze how initial placement affects performance over time.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that initial sampling improves fairness and utility, but doesn't investigate whether initial placement continues to matter as the system evolves with new requests.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking fairness and utility metrics over extended time periods under different initial placement strategies in highly dynamic environments.

## Limitations
- Unknown implementation details of the local optimization procedure
- Unspecified threshold values (τ) in constrained K-means clustering
- Limited analysis of scaling behavior with problem size
- No systematic exploration of alternative fairness or utility formulations

## Confidence
Based on the provided information, I have Medium confidence in the claims made in this paper. The methodology appears sound and the experimental setup is detailed enough for reproduction, though some implementation specifics are unclear.

## Next Checks
1. Implement the constrained K-means clustering algorithm and verify that it produces reasonable initial service provider placements given customer request distributions.
2. Develop the 2FairGA algorithm with Leader-based Random Keys Encoding and test its ability to optimize the multi-objective fitness function incorporating both service provider and customer fairness.
3. Run experiments on the Melbourne parking violations dataset and compare the results with the reported performance metrics for 2FairGA and baseline methods.
