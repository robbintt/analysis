# Bayesian Optimization through Gaussian Cox Process Models for Spatio-temporal Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.14544
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14544
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents a novel Bayesian optimization (BO) framework for spatio-temporal data using Gaussian Cox processes, addressing the challenge of doubly-stochastic point processes with a maximum a posteriori inference method leveraging Laplace approximation and kernel transformation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel Bayesian optimization framework for spatio-temporal data using Gaussian Cox processes, which are doubly-stochastic point processes where observations are modulated by a latent intensity function modeled as a Gaussian process. The key innovation is a maximum a posteriori inference method that leverages Laplace approximation and a change of kernel technique to transform the problem into a tractable form in a new reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This enables the estimation of both the functional posterior of the latent intensity function and its covariance, which is crucial for BO. The framework is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art inference solutions and effective BO with novel acquisition functions.

## Method Summary
The proposed method addresses Bayesian optimization for spatio-temporal data where observations are point events modulated by a latent intensity function modeled as a Gaussian Process (GP). It introduces a maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference for Gaussian Cox processes using Laplace approximation and a change of kernel technique. This transforms the problem into a tractable form in a new reproducing kernel Hilbert space, enabling estimation of both the functional posterior of the latent intensity function and its covariance. The framework uses Nyström approximation for scalable computation and designs acquisition functions (UCB, PI, EI, aidle, acum, aCPD) based on the Gaussian Cox process model to iteratively sample new regions.

## Key Results
- Significant improvements over state-of-the-art inference solutions for Gaussian Cox processes on synthetic and real-world datasets.
- Effective Bayesian optimization with a wide range of acquisition functions designed through the underlying Gaussian Cox process model.
- Successful application to detecting peak intensity, idle time, change point, and cumulative arrivals in spatio-temporal data.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Laplace approximation transforms the intractable posterior integral into a tractable Gaussian distribution centered at the MAP estimate, enabling efficient computation of both posterior mean and covariance. The Laplace approximation approximates the posterior p(g|{ti}) by a Gaussian N(g|ĝ, A⁻¹), where ĝ is the MAP estimate obtained by maximizing log f(g) and A is the Hessian matrix. This transforms the doubly intractable integral into a closed-form Gaussian distribution.

### Mechanism 2
Change of kernel technique transforms the original RKHS into a new RKHS where the representer theorem can be applied, making the optimization tractable. By defining h(t) = κ^(1/2)(g(t)), the integral term can be merged with the squared norm term in the new RKHS using Mercer's theorem. This transforms the objective function into a form where the representer theorem applies, yielding a solution in the form of a linear combination of kernel functions.

### Mechanism 3
Nyström approximation enables scalable computation by approximating the kernel matrix using a subset of the data, leveraging incremental updates from previous BO steps. The Nyström approximation uses a discretized grid to approximate the kernel matrix via a Gram matrix. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Gram matrix are used to estimate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Mercer's expansion, enabling efficient computation of the new kernel function.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Laplace approximation module -> Kernel transformation module -> Representer theorem module -> Nyström approximation module -> Bayesian optimization module

- Critical path:
  1. Input: Observed point events {ti}n i=1 in the spatio-temporal domain S
  2. Compute MAP estimate ĝ and Hessian matrix A using Laplace approximation
  3. Transform the problem into a new RKHS using the change of kernel technique
  4. Apply the representer theorem to obtain the solution in the new RKHS
  5. Approximate the kernel matrix using Nyström approximation for scalable computation
  6. Use the estimated posterior mean and covariance to design acquisition functions
  7. Select the next sampling region based on the acquisition function
  8. Update the observations and repeat steps 2-7 until convergence or budget exhaustion

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. computational efficiency: The Laplace approximation and Nyström approximation trade off accuracy for computational efficiency, enabling scalable Bayesian optimization for large spatio-temporal datasets.
  - Exploitation vs. exploration: The acquisition functions balance exploitation (selecting regions with high predicted intensity) and exploration (selecting regions with high uncertainty) to efficiently explore the search space.
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability: The Gaussian Cox process model is flexible enough to capture complex spatio-temporal patterns but may be less interpretable than simpler models.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor approximation quality: If the Laplace approximation or Nyström approximation fails to accurately approximate the posterior distribution or kernel matrix, respectively, the Bayesian optimization may converge to suboptimal solutions.
  - Numerical instability: If the Hessian matrix A is ill-conditioned or the kernel matrix Kxx is not positive definite, the computation of the posterior covariance or the Nyström approximation may fail.
  - Overfitting or underfitting: If the Gaussian Cox process model is too complex or too simple for the given dataset, it may overfit or underfit the data, respectively, leading to poor generalization performance.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the Laplace approximation module and verify its correctness on a simple synthetic dataset with known posterior distribution.
  2. Implement the kernel transformation module and the representer theorem module, and verify their correctness on a synthetic dataset with a known link function.
  3. Implement the Nyström approximation module and compare its accuracy and computational efficiency with exact kernel matrix computation on a synthetic dataset with varying numbers of observations.
