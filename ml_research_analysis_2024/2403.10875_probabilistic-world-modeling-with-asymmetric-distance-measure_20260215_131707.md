core_contribution: The paper tackles representation learning for planning and reasoning
  in stochastic environments, where a good distance measure between states is essential
  for optimization. Unlike previous approaches that focus on mutual similarity, the
  authors propose learning an asymmetric distance function that reflects state reachability
  in a directed transition graph.

# Probabilistic World Modeling with Asymmetric Distance Measure

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.10875
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10875
- Reference count: 6
- One-line primary result: Asymmetric distance measure learned via contrastive learning enables better reachability modeling and subgoal discovery in stochastic environments

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to representation learning for stochastic environments by proposing an asymmetric distance measure that captures state reachability. Unlike traditional symmetric distance metrics, this method recognizes that reachability in directed transition graphs is inherently asymmetric. The approach uses dual encoders within a contrastive learning framework to model both outgoing and incoming reachability roles of states, enabling the discovery of geometrically salient states that can serve as subgoals for long-horizon planning tasks.

## Method Summary
The method employs contrastive learning with two separate encoders to learn embeddings that capture asymmetric transition probabilities between states. By treating states as both outgoing and incoming vertices in a directed graph, the dual-encoder architecture models the dual roles of states in reachability. The learned embeddings, when conditioned on a common reference state, naturally identify subgoals as low-density regions in the embedding space. This approach is validated on gridworld environments where it demonstrates effective learning of reachability structures and identification of useful subgoals for planning.

## Key Results
- Asymmetric distance measure successfully captures directed reachability in stochastic environments
- Dual-encoder architecture enables learning of both outgoing and incoming state reachability
- Subgoals identified as low-density regions in embedding space effectively decompose long-horizon planning tasks
- Demonstrated effectiveness in gridworld environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The asymmetric distance measure works by recognizing that in directed transition graphs, the probability of reaching state B from state A is not necessarily the same as reaching A from B. By using separate encoders for source and target states, the model can learn distinct embeddings that capture these directional relationships. The contrastive learning framework ensures that states that are easily reachable from each other have small asymmetric distances, while unreachable or difficult-to-reach state pairs have larger distances.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning**: Needed to learn meaningful representations by pulling similar state pairs together while pushing dissimilar pairs apart. Quick check: Verify that positive pairs have smaller distances than negative pairs in the learned embedding space.
- **Asymmetric Distance Measures**: Essential for modeling directed reachability in stochastic environments where transition probabilities are not symmetric. Quick check: Confirm that d(A→B) ≠ d(B→A) for non-symmetric transitions.
- **Dual-Encoder Architecture**: Required to capture both outgoing and incoming reachability roles of states. Quick check: Validate that each encoder specializes in its respective role through ablation studies.
- **Low-Density Subgoal Discovery**: Based on the assumption that important intermediate states appear as sparse regions in the embedding space. Quick check: Verify that identified subgoals correspond to meaningful intermediate states in planning tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: State pairs -> Dual encoders (source/target) -> Asymmetric distance computation -> Contrastive loss -> Embedding space
- **Critical Path**: State representation → Dual encoding → Asymmetric distance calculation → Contrastive optimization → Subgoal identification
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Separate encoders provide role specialization but increase parameter count; low-density heuristic is simple but may not generalize to all environments
- **Failure Signatures**: If embeddings fail to capture directionality, distance asymmetries will be minimal; if subgoal discovery fails, low-density regions may not correspond to meaningful intermediate states
- **First 3 Experiments**: 1) Verify asymmetric distances on known transition structures, 2) Test subgoal discovery in simple maze environments, 3) Compare planning efficiency with and without subgoal decomposition

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- May not generalize to environments with complex, non-monotonic transition dynamics
- Dual-encoder architecture increases complexity and may not scale well to high-dimensional state spaces
- Low-density subgoal heuristic may fail when important states naturally occur in dense regions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mathematical formulation of asymmetric distances based on reachability probabilities is sound and well-grounded in information theory
- **Medium Confidence**: Empirical results on gridworld environments demonstrate effectiveness, but simplicity of domains limits generalizability to more complex tasks
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim that dual-encoder architecture captures both outgoing and incoming reachability roles is theoretically motivated but requires validation on diverse transition structures

## Next Checks
1. Test the asymmetric distance measure on continuous control tasks (e.g., MuJoCo environments) to evaluate scalability and robustness to high-dimensional state spaces
2. Validate subgoal discovery in environments where salient states are not low-density regions, such as cluttered navigation tasks or environments with natural clusters of important states
3. Compare the learned representations against alternative reachability metrics (e.g., value iteration or graph neural networks) in terms of planning efficiency and sample complexity
