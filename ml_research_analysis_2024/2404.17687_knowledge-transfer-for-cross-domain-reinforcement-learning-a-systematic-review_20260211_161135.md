  how to reuse knowledge when source and target tasks have different state and/or

# Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Domain Reinforcement Learning: A Systematic Review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.17687
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17687
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Sergio A. Serrano; Jose Martinez-Carranza; L. Enrique Sucar
- Primary result: Comprehensive review of 53 cross-domain RL transfer methods categorizing approaches by knowledge source, type, and transfer mechanism

## Executive Summary
This systematic review analyzes knowledge transfer methods for cross-domain reinforcement learning where source and target tasks have different state and/or action space representations. The authors categorize 53 works based on knowledge origins (expert demonstrations or learned knowledge), source knowledge types (single vs multiple sources), and transfer approaches (demonstrations, policies, parameters, reward shaping, etc.). The review reveals a trend toward more autonomous transfer approaches requiring less human supervision for inter-domain mapping, while identifying key challenges including negative transfer avoidance, similarity assumption formalization, and practical deployment in data-scarce real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The review systematically examines cross-domain reinforcement learning transfer methods through a comprehensive literature search, identifying 53 relevant works that address knowledge transfer across different state and action space representations. The authors develop a categorization framework based on three main dimensions: where knowledge comes from (expert demonstrations or learned knowledge), type of source knowledge (single versus multiple sources), and transfer approach (various mechanisms including demonstrations, policies, parameters, and reward shaping). This framework enables systematic comparison of methods and identification of trends across the literature.

## Key Results
- Recent methods increasingly adopt autonomous approaches requiring less human supervision for inter-domain mapping
- Cross-domain transfer remains challenging due to negative transfer risks and difficulty formalizing similarity assumptions
- Practical deployment in real-world applications is limited by data scarcity and the need for robust transfer mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of cross-domain transfer methods relies on finding appropriate mappings between different state and action space representations while preserving task-relevant information. Success depends on identifying invariant features or relationships that exist across domains, allowing knowledge from the source domain to generalize to the target domain despite representational differences. The review shows that methods incorporating more autonomous mapping mechanisms tend to perform better as they can adapt to domain-specific characteristics without extensive human intervention.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Transfer Learning**: The ability to apply knowledge from one task/domain to another; needed for cross-domain RL to reuse learned policies and representations; quick check: does the method improve learning speed or performance in the target domain compared to learning from scratch?

2. **Domain Adaptation**: Techniques for adapting models trained on one domain to work on another; needed to handle differences in state/action space representations; quick check: what assumptions does the method make about domain similarity?

3. **Reward Shaping**: Modifying or transferring reward functions across domains; needed when reward structures differ between source and target; quick check: how does the method ensure transferred rewards maintain task objectives?

4. **Policy Transfer**: Methods for transferring learned policies across domains; needed when source and target have similar but not identical dynamics; quick check: what policy representation is used and how is it adapted?

5. **Representation Learning**: Learning domain-invariant features; needed to find common ground between different state/action spaces; quick check: how does the method identify and preserve relevant features across domains?

6. **Negative Transfer**: When transfer from source domain harms performance in target domain; needed to understand limitations and failure modes; quick check: what mechanisms prevent or detect negative transfer?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Knowledge Source -> Mapping Function -> Transfer Mechanism -> Target Domain Policy

**Critical Path**: Knowledge acquisition (demonstrations or learned policies) → Domain mapping identification → Transfer mechanism application → Target domain policy refinement

**Design Tradeoffs**: Autonomy vs performance (more autonomous methods may sacrifice some performance), human supervision requirements vs transfer success, single vs multiple source knowledge benefits and limitations

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation compared to learning from scratch, inability to find appropriate domain mappings, negative transfer where source knowledge actively harms target learning, high computational overhead for mapping identification

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test transfer between two similar but differently represented domains (e.g., different robot morphologies with similar tasks) to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate transfer with increasing domain dissimilarity to identify breaking points and limitations
3. Compare autonomous mapping approaches against supervised mapping methods to quantify performance vs human effort tradeoffs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Publication bias likely favors successful methods over failed transfer attempts
- Review scope may miss emerging approaches using transformer-based architectures or foundation models
- Categorization framework may not capture all distinctions, particularly for hybrid methods combining multiple transfer strategies

## Confidence
- High confidence in the categorization framework and methodological taxonomy (52 papers reviewed with clear criteria)
- Medium confidence in the assessment of practical challenges and limitations (based on expert interpretation across multiple works)
- Low confidence in predicting future trends toward autonomous approaches (extrapolation from current literature)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the categorization with a broader search including preprints and conference proceedings to assess coverage completeness
2. Contact authors of the 53 reviewed papers to validate the classification accuracy and identify any misrepresentations
3. Test the proposed framework on a new set of cross-domain RL papers published after 2023 to evaluate its applicability to emerging approaches
