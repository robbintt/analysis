# Mitigating Boundary Ambiguity and Inherent Bias for Text Classification in the Era of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07001

- Large language models struggle with text classification when faced with numerous options due to ambiguous decision boundaries and inherent bias toward specific tokens or positions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of text classification for large language models (LLMs) when dealing with numerous options (up to 150 classes). The authors propose a two-stage framework that first reduces the option set through clustering-based window reduction (CBWR) or iterative top reduction (ITR), then applies pairwise contrastive chain-of-thought (PC-CoT) reasoning to distinguish confusable options. The approach significantly improves classification accuracy over full-option zero-shot prompting—up to 54.1% relative gain for GPT-3.5-turbo and 36.88% reduction in token bias for LLaMA2-70B-Chat—across four datasets. The method is effective for various LLMs and provides more stable, debiased classification performance.

## Method Summary
The proposed two-stage framework addresses LLM classification challenges through: (1) a reduction stage using either ITR (Iterative Top Reduction) that iteratively isolates the most probable option, or CBWR (Cluster-Based Window Reduction) that uses clustering to group similar options into windows; and (2) a comparison stage using PC-CoT (Pairwise Contrastive Chain-of-Thought) with three sub-steps: similarity analysis, difference analysis, and final decision. This approach reduces the decision space and computational load while forcing LLMs to explicitly compare and contrast options rather than relying on token/position shortcuts, thereby mitigating both boundary ambiguity and inherent bias.

## Key Results
- Up to 54.1% relative gain in classification accuracy for GPT-3.5-turbo compared to full-option zero-shot prompting
- 36.88% reduction in token bias for LLaMA2-70B-Chat through pairwise comparison approach
- Consistent improvements across four datasets (Banking77, HWU64, LIU54, Clinc150) with up to 150 classes
- Effective for various LLMs including GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA2-70B-Chat, and Qwen-72B-Chat

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Pairwise contrastive reasoning reduces boundary ambiguity by forcing LLMs to explicitly compare and contrast options rather than relying on token/position shortcuts. The PC-CoT process forces LLMs to first identify shared aspects between two options, then analyze contrasting points, and finally make a decision. This structured comparison prevents shortcut decisions based on token position bias. Core assumption: LLMs possess sufficient reasoning capability to perform meaningful contrastive analysis when properly prompted.

### Mechanism 2
Reduction strategies (ITR and CBWR) mitigate performance degradation by limiting the option space before pairwise comparison. ITR iteratively isolates the most probable option through repeated selection, while CBWR uses clustering to create distinct option "windows" that avoid similarity confusion. Both reduce the decision space and computational load. Core assumption: Reducing options before pairwise comparison maintains or improves accuracy while being more efficient than comparing all options.

### Mechanism 3
Position and token bias in LLMs can be reduced by pairwise comparison and reduction strategies that minimize position-based and token-based shortcuts. By comparing only two options at a time and reducing the overall option set, the framework limits the number of positions and tokens the LLM needs to consider, thereby reducing bias effects. Core assumption: LLMs exhibit position and token bias that can be mitigated through structural changes to the classification process.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Chain-of-thought reasoning
  - Why needed here: The framework builds on CoT methodology but adapts it specifically for pairwise classification tasks where the reasoning process needs to compare and contrast options rather than solve mathematical problems.
  - Quick check question: How does chain-of-thought prompting differ from standard prompting in terms of the reasoning process it elicits from LLMs?

- **Concept**: Clustering algorithms for text
  - Why needed here: CBWR uses clustering to group similar options into windows, preventing similarity confusion during the reduction phase. Understanding text clustering is essential for grasping how CBWR creates diverse option sets.
  - Quick check question: What clustering algorithm would be most appropriate for grouping text options based on semantic similarity?

- **Concept**: Silhouette score for cluster evaluation
  - Why needed here: The paper mentions silhouette scores as a measure of cluster quality and decision boundary clarity. This metric helps evaluate whether the reduction strategies are effectively separating confusable options.
  - Quick check question: How does the silhouette score mathematically quantify the quality of clustering for text classification tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input text → Reduction stage (ITR/CBWR) → Reduced option set → Pairwise comparison stage (PC-CoT) → Final classification
- **Critical path**: The reduction stage is critical because errors here propagate to the comparison stage. The pairwise comparison must be robust to handle the reduced but still potentially ambiguous option set.
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Reduction vs. accuracy: More aggressive reduction improves efficiency but risks eliminating correct options
  - Pairwise vs. full comparison: Pairwise reduces bias but requires more LLM calls than single full-option classification
  - Clustering vs. iterative selection: CBWR handles similarity better but requires clustering overhead; ITR is simpler but may be less effective with highly similar options
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Reduction stage: Incorrect options retained, correct options eliminated, disproportionate elimination of certain categories
  - Comparison stage: Inconsistent pairwise decisions, failure to distinguish truly similar options, over-reliance on position/token cues
  - Overall: Performance degrades with increasing option similarity, certain tokens/positions show persistent bias
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement ITR reduction alone on a small dataset (5-10 options) and measure accuracy vs. full-option baseline
  2. Add PC-CoT pairwise comparison to the ITR-reduced set and measure improvement over ITR alone
  3. Replace ITR with CBWR on a dataset with high option similarity and compare performance degradation with ITR results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the framework's performance scale with increasing number of options beyond 150 classes?
- Basis in paper: The paper tests up to 150 classes but doesn't explore scalability beyond this limit, despite mentioning this as a potential limitation.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only cover datasets up to 150 classes, leaving uncertainty about effectiveness for larger-scale classification problems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the framework on datasets with 200+ classes and comparing performance metrics against baseline methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relationship between reduction stage accuracy and final classification performance?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions "minimizing error propagation to the next stage" but doesn't quantify how reduction accuracy impacts final results.
- Why unresolved: The paper reports HIT@5 for reduction but doesn't analyze how different reduction accuracies affect the final classification accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying reduction stage accuracy while measuring downstream classification performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the ITR and CBWR reduction strategies compare in terms of computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: The paper introduces both strategies but only compares their accuracy, not their computational costs.
- Why unresolved: While both methods achieve similar accuracy, their computational requirements and scalability might differ significantly.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking both methods with timing measurements across datasets of varying sizes and measuring memory/compute requirements.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks detailed implementation specifications for critical components, particularly the clustering algorithm parameters and prompt templates
- Limited evaluation of the framework's scalability to datasets with more than 150 classes
- The debiasing claims could benefit from more rigorous statistical testing to confirm observed improvements are not due to chance
- The paper does not address computational overhead in terms of API costs or latency for the two-stage framework

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core finding that pairwise comparison improves accuracy over full-option classification (54.1% relative gain for GPT-3.5-turbo) is well-supported by experimental results across multiple datasets and model types

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that the framework reduces token/position bias by 36.88% for LLaMA2-70B-Chat is supported but could be strengthened with more granular analysis of which specific biases are mitigated

**Low Confidence**: The generalization of results to datasets with significantly different characteristics (e.g., very short sentences, highly imbalanced classes) is not well-established

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies on the reduction stage parameters (number of clusters, window size) to identify optimal configurations and understand the sensitivity of performance to these hyperparameters
2. Test the framework on a dataset with 500+ classes to evaluate scalability limits and identify at what point the two-stage approach becomes less efficient than alternative methods
3. Implement and measure the computational overhead (API calls, latency, cost) of the two-stage framework compared to direct full-option classification to assess practical deployment considerations
