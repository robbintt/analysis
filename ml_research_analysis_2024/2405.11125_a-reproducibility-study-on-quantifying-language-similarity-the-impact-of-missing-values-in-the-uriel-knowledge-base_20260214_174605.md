# A Reproducibility Study on Quantifying Language Similarity: The Impact of Missing Values in the URIEL Knowledge Base

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2405.11125
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11125
- **Reference count:** 7
- **Primary result:** URIEL's pre-computed language distances are largely reproducible using regularized angular distance with union vectors, but 31.24% of languages have empty feature vectors, undermining database reliability

## Executive Summary
This study critically examines URIEL, a widely used typological knowledge base for quantifying language similarity in multilingual NLP. The analysis reveals significant ambiguities in URIEL's distance calculations and the treatment of missing data, particularly affecting low-resource languages. Despite providing language distance values for 4,005 languages, a substantial portion of these languages have empty feature vectors, which undermines the reliability of the database. The research highlights the need for clearer methodologies, better handling of missing values, and improved coverage, especially for underrepresented languages, to enhance URIEL's utility in multilingual NLP research.

## Method Summary
The study conducted a comprehensive reproducibility analysis of URIEL's pre-computed distance matrices by reconstructing distance calculations using various methods including cosine similarity, angular distance, regularized angular distance, and Euclidean distance. The researchers tested multiple feature vector combinations (union and intersection) across all feature types in URIEL. They systematically compared their computed distances against URIEL's published values to identify the methodology used and pinpoint irreproducible cases. The analysis also quantified missing value patterns across languages and evaluated how different distance calculation approaches handle these gaps.

## Key Results
- Regularized angular distance with union vectors is the most likely method used for URIEL's pre-computed distances, though some values remain irreproducible
- 31.24% of languages in URIEL have empty feature vectors, making their pairwise distances uninterpretable
- Missing values are unevenly distributed, with low-resource languages disproportionately affected, creating potential bias in multilingual NLP applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's approach works by systematically testing the mathematical properties of distance calculations against observed outcomes. By varying the distance metric and feature vector construction method, the researchers could reverse-engineer the likely methodology through process of elimination. The key insight is that regularized angular distance inherently handles missing values through its normalization, which explains why URIEL's distances remain defined even when languages have sparse features. This mathematical analysis reveals how missing data propagates through similarity calculations, exposing vulnerabilities in typological databases that affect downstream NLP systems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Typological feature vectors**: Why needed - Represent languages as points in high-dimensional space based on linguistic properties; Quick check - Verify that each dimension corresponds to a specific typological feature like word order or morphological complexity
- **Regularized angular distance**: Why needed - Handles sparse vectors by normalizing dot products; Quick check - Confirm that distance values are bounded between 0 and 1 for any vector pair
- **Union vs. intersection feature vectors**: Why needed - Determines how missing values are handled during distance computation; Quick check - Union includes all features present in either language, intersection only shared features
- **Reproducibility in computational linguistics**: Why needed - Ensures research results can be verified and built upon; Quick check - All parameters and preprocessing steps must be explicitly documented
- **Low-resource language representation**: Why needed - Addresses bias in typological databases toward well-documented languages; Quick check - Count languages with fewer than 10 features populated
- **Distance matrix interpretation**: Why needed - Distances should reflect meaningful linguistic similarity for NLP applications; Quick check - Verify that related languages have smaller distances than unrelated ones

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
- Feature extraction -> Distance computation -> Pre-computed matrix storage
- Language inventory -> Feature availability mapping -> Missing value analysis
- Distance verification pipeline -> Reproducibility testing -> Methodology identification

**Critical Path**
Feature extraction → Feature vector construction (union/intersection) → Distance metric application (cosine/regularized angular/Euclidean) → Distance matrix comparison with URIEL values → Methodology validation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Union vectors maximize coverage but introduce sparsity vs. intersection vectors provide density but lose information
- Regularized angular distance handles missing values well but may mask data quality issues vs. Euclidean distance is intuitive but undefined for sparse vectors
- Pre-computed distances enable fast lookups but obscure methodology vs. on-demand computation allows transparency but requires computational resources

**Failure Signatures**
- Unusually high distances between related languages indicating feature gaps
- Inconsistent distances when swapping language pairs suggesting numerical instability
- Missing value patterns correlating with language family indicating systematic data collection bias

**First Experiments**
1. Compute distances between three closely related languages using both union and intersection vectors to observe missing value impact
2. Compare regularized angular distance with cosine similarity on vectors with 50% missing values
3. Create synthetic feature vectors with controlled missingness patterns to test distance calculation stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the optimal handling of missing values in typological databases, the trade-offs between different distance metrics for multilingual NLP applications, and the need for standardized documentation of methodology in pre-computed distance matrices.

## Limitations
- Unable to fully reproduce some URIEL distance values, suggesting undocumented methodology or numerical instabilities
- Analysis limited to URIEL's existing feature set without exploring alternative typological databases
- Study focuses on distance calculation methodology rather than downstream impact on NLP task performance

## Confidence
- **Medium**: Core finding that regularized angular distance with union vectors explains most URIEL distances is well-supported, but persistent irreproducibility of certain values and inability to fully characterize missing value impact introduces uncertainty

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study using URIEL+ to assess whether the expanded feature coverage and improved documentation resolve the reproducibility issues identified here
2. Conduct a controlled experiment varying the imputation strategy for missing values to quantify their impact on downstream NLP tasks
3. Perform a sensitivity analysis comparing distances computed with different subsets of features to determine which feature types contribute most to the irreproducibility problem
