# Recent Advances of Foundation Language Models-based Continual Learning: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2405.18653
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18653
- **Reference Count:** 40
- **Primary Result:** Comprehensive survey of continual learning approaches for foundation language models, categorizing methods into offline and online learning and discussing challenges and future directions.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides an extensive overview of continual learning methods for foundation language models, including pre-trained language models (PLMs), large language models (LLMs), and vision-language models (VLMs). The authors categorize approaches into offline and online continual learning, addressing the critical issue of catastrophic forgetting. Offline methods are further subdivided into domain-incremental, task-incremental, and class-incremental learning, while online methods are distinguished by hard and blurry task boundaries. The survey reviews various techniques such as traditional methods, parameter-efficient tuning, instruction tuning, and continual pre-training, and outlines key datasets and metrics used to evaluate model performance in terms of forgetting and knowledge transfer.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes information from recent literature on continual learning for foundation language models, organizing the content into clear categories based on the type of learning (offline vs online) and the nature of task boundaries (hard vs blurry). It reviews a range of techniques, including traditional methods, parameter-efficient tuning, instruction tuning, and continual pre-training. The survey also discusses the evaluation of these methods using specific datasets and metrics that measure forgetting and knowledge transfer.

## Key Results
- Categorization of continual learning methods for foundation language models into offline and online approaches.
- Discussion of techniques such as parameter-efficient tuning and instruction tuning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
- Identification of challenges and future research directions, including autonomous continual learning and privacy protection.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by systematically categorizing and reviewing the latest advances in continual learning for foundation language models. It addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting by organizing methods into offline and online learning, and further subdividing them based on task boundaries. This structured approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the field and highlights the most effective techniques and areas for future research.

## Foundational Learning
- **Catastrophic Forgetting:** Occurs when a model forgets previously learned information upon learning new tasks. *Why needed:* To understand the primary challenge in continual learning. *Quick check:* Review literature on catastrophic forgetting in neural networks.
- **Offline vs Online Learning:** Offline learning involves training on a fixed dataset, while online learning involves continuous learning from streaming data. *Why needed:* To distinguish between different learning paradigms. *Quick check:* Compare definitions and examples of offline and online learning.
- **Parameter-Efficient Tuning:** Techniques that update only a subset of model parameters to reduce computational cost. *Why needed:* To address the scalability issues of fine-tuning large models. *Quick check:* Examine recent papers on parameter-efficient methods.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Foundation Language Models (PLMs, LLMs, VLMs) -> Continual Learning Methods (Offline: Domain, Task, Class; Online: Hard, Blurry) -> Evaluation (Datasets, Metrics)
- **Critical Path:** Foundation Models -> Selection of Continual Learning Method -> Application of Techniques (e.g., Parameter-Efficient Tuning) -> Evaluation
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Balancing between model performance and computational efficiency, choosing between offline and online methods based on task requirements.
- **Failure Signatures:** Catastrophic forgetting, poor generalization to new tasks, high computational cost.
- **First Experiments:** 1) Compare traditional fine-tuning vs parameter-efficient tuning on a benchmark dataset. 2) Evaluate the impact of task boundaries (hard vs blurry) on model performance. 3) Assess the effectiveness of instruction tuning in mitigating forgetting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Autonomous continual learning: How can models autonomously decide when to learn and what to learn?
- Bridging cognitive science and machine learning: How can insights from human learning improve machine learning models?
- Privacy protection: How can continual learning be performed while preserving data privacy?

## Limitations
- The survey does not provide quantitative analysis or benchmarking of the surveyed methods.
- The rapid pace of development in continual learning may mean some recent methods are not included.
- The confidence in the coverage of specific techniques like parameter-efficient tuning is medium due to the fast-evolving nature of the field.

## Confidence
- **Categorization of Methods (Offline vs Online):** High
- **Coverage of Specific Techniques (Parameter-Efficient Tuning, Instruction Tuning):** Medium
- **Discussion of Future Research Directions:** Medium
- **Quantitative Analysis/Benchmarking:** Low

## Next Checks
1. Verify the completeness of the method categorization by cross-referencing with recent conference proceedings and preprints.
2. Conduct a literature search to identify any significant developments in continual learning techniques that may have emerged after the survey's publication.
3. Review the datasets and metrics section to ensure that all relevant benchmarks and evaluation protocols are included and up-to-date.
