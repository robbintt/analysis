# Global-Local Convolution with Spiking Neural Networks for Energy-efficient Keyword Spotting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.13179
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13179
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Introduces an energy-efficient KWS model based on SNNs with GLSC and Bottleneck-PLIF modules achieving 70.1K parameters and 10× energy savings

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an energy-efficient keyword spotting (KWS) model using spiking neural networks (SNNs) that processes raw speech waveforms directly without computationally expensive feature extraction methods like FFT or MFCC. The model introduces two key innovations: the Global-Local Spiking Convolution (GLSC) module that combines Conv1d and dilated Conv1d operations to extract both local and global features while maintaining sparsity, and the Bottleneck-PLIF module that integrates lightweight bottleneck architecture with parametric leaky integrate-and-fire neurons for improved classification with fewer parameters. Experimental results on Google Speech Commands Dataset show competitive accuracy with significantly smaller model sizes and more than 10× energy savings compared to equivalent ANN models.

## Method Summary
The proposed SNN-KWS model consists of an end-to-end architecture that processes raw speech waveforms through four Global-Local Spiking Convolution (GLSC) blocks followed by two Bottleneck-PLIF blocks. The GLSC module applies parallel standard Conv1d and dilated Conv1d operations to capture local and global features respectively, which are then summed and passed through spiking neurons to maintain sparsity. The Bottleneck-PLIF module uses a lightweight bottleneck architecture with learnable membrane decay parameters in PLIF neurons to reduce parameter count while maintaining classification accuracy. The model is trained using the spatio-temporal backpropagation (STBP) method with a simulation time window of 8 steps, achieving competitive accuracy on both 12-class and 35-class keyword spotting tasks from Google Speech Commands Dataset (V1 and V2).

## Key Results
- Achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art SNN-based models while using only 70.1K parameters
- Demonstrates more than 10× energy savings compared to equivalent ANN models through sparse spiking activity
- Maintains an average spike firing rate of 8.3%, contributing to energy efficiency
- Processes raw speech waveforms directly without FFT/MFCC preprocessing, eliminating computational overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GLSC combines Conv1d and dilated Conv1d operations to balance local and global feature extraction in speech sequences while maintaining sparsity.
- Mechanism: The GLSC module applies two parallel convolutions—standard Conv1d for local features and dilated Conv1d for global features—then sums their outputs before passing through spiking neurons. The spiking neuron firing threshold ensures only significant feature combinations propagate, reducing redundancy.
- Core assumption: Spiking neurons can effectively filter redundant feature combinations through their binary firing mechanism.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GLSC module achieves speech feature extraction that is sparser, more energy-efficient, and yields better performance"
  - [section] "The GLSC module can effectively balance local and global features in long speech sequences" and "the output of spiking neurons at t depends not only on the summation but also considers the residual membrane potential from t − 1"
- Break condition: If spiking neurons fire too frequently (high firing rate), the sparsity advantage diminishes and energy efficiency degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bottleneck-PLIF module reduces parameter count while maintaining classification accuracy through channel fusion and adaptive membrane dynamics.
- Mechanism: The Bottleneck structure compresses feature dimensionality through 1×1 convolutions before and after a 3×3 convolution, while PLIF neurons replace LIF neurons with learnable decay parameters (k(a)) instead of fixed τ. This combination allows efficient processing with fewer parameters.
- Core assumption: Learnable membrane decay parameters can adapt better to speech patterns than fixed decay rates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Bottleneck-PLIF module further processes the signals from GLSC with the aim to achieve higher accuracy with fewer parameters"
  - [section] "learnable k(a) replaces the constant decay hyperparameters τ in Eq.2, which can be optimized during training" and "neurons exhibit a greater diversity of outputs when subjected to different τ under the same input conditions"
- Break condition: If learnable parameters overfit to training data, generalization performance on unseen speech commands may suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: End-to-end processing without FFT/MFCC preprocessing reduces computational overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy.
- Mechanism: The model processes raw speech waveforms directly through GLSC and Bottleneck-PLIF layers, eliminating the need for separate feature extraction steps that typically require FFT or MFCC computation.
- Core assumption: Convolutional layers can learn effective speech features directly from raw waveforms without hand-crafted preprocessing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The model consists of two innovative modules: 1) Global-Local Spiking Convolution (GLSC) module and 2) Bottleneck-PLIF module" and "Compared to the hand-crafted feature extraction methods, the GLSC module achieves speech feature extraction that is sparser, more energy-efficient, and yields better performance"
  - [section] "the most popular approach is to use direct convolution methods for end-to-end feature extraction"
- Break condition: If the model cannot learn discriminative features from raw waveforms, accuracy may drop below acceptable thresholds for keyword spotting.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and event-driven computation
  - Why needed here: SNNs provide the energy efficiency foundation by computing only when neuron membrane potentials exceed thresholds, reducing unnecessary calculations
  - Quick check question: How does the spike-based computation in SNNs differ from continuous activation in traditional ANNs?

- Concept: Dilated convolutions and receptive field management
  - Why needed here: Dilated convolutions allow GLSC to capture long-range dependencies without exponentially increasing parameter count
  - Quick check question: What problem does dilated convolution solve compared to standard convolution in processing long speech sequences?

- Concept: Bottleneck architectures in deep networks
  - Why needed here: Bottleneck layers reduce computational complexity by compressing feature dimensionality before expensive operations
  - Quick check question: How do bottleneck layers achieve parameter efficiency while maintaining representational power?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Raw waveform → GLSC1 → GLSC2 → GLSC3 → GLSC4 → Bottleneck-PLIF1 → Bottleneck-PLIF2 → Output

- Critical path: Raw waveform → GLSC1 → GLSC2 → GLSC3 → GLSC4 → Bottleneck-PLIF1 → Bottleneck-PLIF2 → Output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - GLSC vs separate local/global branches: GLSC reduces parameter count but may limit independent optimization of local/global features
  - PLIF vs LIF neurons: PLIF offers adaptive decay but adds learnable parameters that could overfit
  - End-to-end vs preprocessing: Eliminates preprocessing overhead but requires network to learn all feature extraction

- Failure signatures:
  - High average spike firing rate (>20%): Indicates loss of sparsity, reduced energy efficiency
  - Poor convergence during training: May indicate inappropriate learning rate or insufficient model capacity
  - Accuracy drops significantly on V2 dataset: Suggests overfitting to V1 domain or insufficient generalization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline test: Train with GLSC modules but replace PLIF with LIF neurons to quantify the benefit of adaptive decay
  2. Ablation test: Remove either Conv1d or D-Conv1d from GLSC to verify the importance of global-local balance
  3. Energy analysis: Measure spike firing rates with different time step configurations to find optimal energy-accuracy tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the GLSC module perform when processing longer speech sequences (e.g., several minutes) compared to shorter commands (a few seconds)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions GLSC "can compress the length of long speech sequences layer by layer" but only evaluates on Google Speech Commands Dataset which contains short utterances (typically 1 second).
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests on short speech commands (1-second utterances) and doesn't evaluate the GLSC module's performance on longer speech sequences where feature redundancy and compression become more critical.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing GLSC performance on datasets with varying utterance lengths (short commands vs. longer speech segments) while maintaining energy efficiency metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of layers for the GLSC module to balance accuracy and energy efficiency across different KWS applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions "NConv = 4 GLSC blocks" as the chosen architecture but doesn't explore how varying this number affects the trade-off between performance and energy consumption.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a fixed number of GLSC layers (4) without exploring how this hyperparameter affects the accuracy-energy efficiency trade-off, which is critical for edge deployment scenarios with different constraints.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies varying the number of GLSC layers (2, 4, 6, 8) while measuring accuracy, model size, and energy consumption to identify optimal configurations for different deployment scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the GLSC module's energy efficiency scale when deployed on actual neuromorphic hardware compared to theoretical calculations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides theoretical energy savings calculations ("more than 10× energy saving over the ANNs") but doesn't report measurements from actual neuromorphic hardware deployment.
- Why unresolved: The paper calculates theoretical energy savings based on spiking neuron models and spike rates but doesn't validate these calculations through actual hardware measurements on neuromorphic chips.
- What evidence would resolve it: Energy measurements from deploying the GLSC module on actual neuromorphic hardware platforms (e.g., Loihi, SpiNNaker) compared to equivalent ANN implementations, including real-world operating conditions and latencies.

## Limitations

- Architectural specifics of GLSC and Bottleneck-PLIF modules are underspecified, making exact reproduction difficult
- No reported baseline comparisons against non-SNN KWS models, limiting claims about relative performance
- Energy efficiency claims based on spike rate rather than actual hardware measurements

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the core mechanism: Combining local and global features through GLSC + Bottleneck-PLIF architecture for efficient feature extraction
- **Medium confidence** in energy efficiency claims: Spike rate of 8.3% supports efficiency, but actual hardware measurements are missing
- **Low confidence** in comparative performance: No direct comparisons with non-SNN state-of-the-art models

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture validation**: Implement and compare ablated versions (LIF vs PLIF, with/without dilated convolution) to verify each component's contribution
2. **Energy measurement**: Deploy the model on actual neuromorphic hardware to measure real power consumption, not just spike rates
3. **Generalization test**: Evaluate model performance on cross-dataset scenarios (e.g., train on V1, test on V2 with domain adaptation)
