# To Diverge or Not to Diverge: A Morphosyntactic Perspective on Machine Translation vs Human Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.01419
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01419
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: MT exhibits significantly less morphosyntactic divergence than HT across three language pairs

## Executive Summary
This study compares morphosyntactic divergence patterns between machine translations (MT) and human translations (HT) using Universal Dependencies annotations and word alignments. The authors analyze word-based and arc-based divergences across English→French, English→German, and English→Chinese language pairs. Their findings reveal that MT consistently shows less morphosyntactic diversity (5.9%-22.2% reduction), more convergent patterns (5.4%-18.1% increase), and more one-to-one alignments compared to HT. The authors attribute these differences primarily to beam search bias in MT decoding, which is most pronounced when convergent patterns appear around 50% of the time in training data. Additionally, they find that divergent patterns in HT correlate with decreased MT performance for most frequent divergent constructions.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct a large-scale comparative analysis using Universal Dependencies annotations to identify morphosyntactic divergences between source and target sentences. They employ word alignment techniques to track how linguistic elements map between languages. Two types of divergence are analyzed: word-based divergence (differences in lexical choices) and arc-based divergence (differences in syntactic dependencies). The study examines three translation directions from English to French, German, and Chinese, comparing MT outputs from transformer models against human reference translations. Statistical analysis quantifies the frequency and types of divergences, examining their relationship to translation quality metrics like BLEU and BLEURT scores.

## Key Results
- MT exhibits 5.9%-22.2% less morphosyntactic diversity compared to HT across all language pairs
- MT shows 5.4%-18.1% more convergent patterns than HT, indicating more conservative translations
- MT produces more one-to-one alignments, reflecting less structural variation
- Divergent patterns in HT correlate with decreased MT performance for the majority of frequent divergent constructions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The observed differences between MT and HT divergence patterns stem from the beam search decoding mechanism used in transformer-based MT systems. Beam search tends to favor conservative, high-probability translations that appear frequently in training data, creating a bias toward convergent patterns. This bias is most pronounced when training data shows balanced frequencies of divergent versus convergent patterns (around 50% each). The transformer architecture itself may also contribute to this conservatism by preferring stable, predictable output sequences over more varied or creative translations that human translators naturally produce.

## Foundational Learning
- **Universal Dependencies (UD)**: A framework for consistent syntactic annotation across languages; needed for standardized morphosyntactic analysis, quick check: verify UD treebanks exist for all target languages
- **Word alignment**: Mapping of words/phrases between source and target sentences; essential for tracking divergence patterns, quick check: alignment error rate should be below 5%
- **Beam search decoding**: A search strategy that maintains multiple translation hypotheses; central to understanding MT conservatism, quick check: compare with diverse beam search outputs
- **BLEU/BLEURT metrics**: Automatic evaluation metrics for translation quality; needed to correlate divergence with performance, quick check: ensure scores are comparable across systems
- **Morphosyntactic divergence**: Structural differences in how grammatical elements map between languages; the core phenomenon being studied, quick check: validate divergence types against linguistic literature

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Transformer encoder -> Attention mechanism -> Beam search decoder -> Alignment module -> Divergence analyzer

Critical path: Source text → Encoder embeddings → Cross-attention → Decoder predictions → Beam search → Output alignment → Divergence detection

Design tradeoffs: Beam search provides stable, high-probability outputs but sacrifices diversity; alternative decoding strategies like nucleus sampling or diverse beam search could increase divergence but may reduce overall quality. The choice of alignment algorithm affects divergence detection accuracy, while the granularity of morphosyntactic features impacts analysis depth.

Failure signatures: Beam search bias manifests as over-representation of frequent patterns, alignment errors create false divergence signals, and annotation inconsistencies across languages can skew comparative analysis. Performance degradation correlates with increased divergence complexity rather than divergence type alone.

First experiments: 1) Compare MT outputs using standard beam search versus diverse beam search to isolate beam search effects; 2) Analyze divergence patterns in translationese (MT-style) versus natural text; 3) Test whether divergence-based quality metrics improve over traditional BLEU/BLEURT scores.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings based on transformer architecture with beam search may not generalize to newer decoding strategies or model architectures
- Analysis focuses on surface morphosyntactic divergences without examining deeper semantic or pragmatic effects
- Correlation between divergences and MT quality does not establish causation - divergent patterns might simply be inherently more challenging

## Confidence
High: The core finding that MT exhibits more conservative morphosyntactic patterns than HT appears robust across three language pairs and multiple metrics. The quantitative differences (5.9%-22.2% reduction in divergence types, 5.4%-18.1% increase in convergence) are substantial and consistently observed.

Medium: The attribution of these differences primarily to beam search bias is plausible but not definitively proven. Alternative explanations, such as training data artifacts or architectural constraints, remain possible.

Low: The causal relationship between divergence patterns and MT quality degradation requires further investigation. The correlation observed does not distinguish whether divergences harm translation quality or simply co-occur with difficult translation phenomena.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the analysis using diverse decoding strategies (nucleus sampling, diverse beam search) to isolate beam search effects from architecture-level conservatism
2. Extend the divergence analysis to additional language pairs, particularly those with greater morphological complexity or syntactic divergence from English
3. Conduct human evaluation studies to determine whether morphosyntactic divergences identified by the authors actually impact readability, fluency, or meaning preservation in practical contexts
