# GenSERP: Large Language Models for Whole Page Presentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.14301
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14301
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LLM-based framework that organizes heterogeneous search results into coherent SERP layouts, achieving competitive performance to production systems in entertainment and health verticals

## Executive Summary
GenSERP is a framework that uses large language models with vision capabilities to automatically organize heterogeneous search results into a coherent search engine result page (SERP) layout. The approach decomposes the complex task into three stages: information gathering where the LLM orchestrates API tools to retrieve content and propose layouts, candidate presentation generation where the LLM populates and optimizes the layouts with retrieved content, and scoring where the best SERP is selected based on predicted user satisfaction. Offline experiments show GenSERP achieves competitive performance compared to production SERPs, particularly in entertainment and health verticals, while demonstrating layout biases and permutation-invariance characteristics in the LLM's decision-making process.

## Method Summary
GenSERP leverages LLMs with vision capabilities to address the challenge of organizing heterogeneous search results into coherent SERP layouts. The framework operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Information Gathering, where the LLM uses API tools to retrieve relevant content and proposes initial layout configurations; (2) Candidate Presentation Generation, where the LLM populates and optimizes these layouts with the retrieved content; and (3) Scoring, where the best SERP is selected based on predicted user satisfaction metrics. The system uses tools like ARES for vertical selection and information retrieval, and incorporates both deterministic and LLM-based approaches for layout optimization and selection.

## Key Results
- GenSERP achieves competitive performance compared to production SERPs, particularly excelling in entertainment and health verticals
- The framework demonstrates layout biases, showing LLM preference for specific SERP configurations regardless of query context
- Permutation-invariance findings reveal the LLM's decision-making is more sensitive to presentation order than content relevance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages LLMs' reasoning and generation capabilities to handle the complexity of heterogeneous search results that traditional rule-based systems struggle with. By using LLMs as orchestrators, GenSERP can dynamically adapt to different query contexts and vertical requirements. The vision capabilities allow the system to reason about visual layouts and their potential impact on user experience, while the tool-use functionality enables integration with existing search infrastructure and APIs for content retrieval.

## Foundational Learning
- SERP Layout Generation: Why needed - Traditional rule-based systems cannot handle the diversity of modern search queries; Quick check - Can the system generate layouts for multi-vertical queries like "best restaurants near me with reviews"?
- LLM Tool Use: Why needed - LLMs must interact with external APIs and services to retrieve content; Quick check - Does the system correctly call ARES API with appropriate parameters?
- Candidate Generation: Why needed - Multiple layout options are needed to find optimal presentation; Quick check - Are at least 5-10 candidate layouts generated per query?
- Scoring Functions: Why needed - Objective metrics are needed to select best SERP; Quick check - Does Page-Recall and SERF scoring align with user satisfaction?
- Vertical Understanding: Why needed - Different verticals require different presentation strategies; Quick check - Can the system distinguish between health and entertainment query needs?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Information Gathering -> Candidate Generation -> Scoring -> Final SERP

Critical Path:
Query → LLM Orchestrator → ARES API → Layout Generation → Content Population → Scoring → SERP Output

Design Tradeoffs:
- LLM-based vs rule-based layout selection: Flexibility vs consistency
- Deterministic vs probabilistic scoring: Predictability vs adaptability
- Single vs multiple candidate generation: Speed vs optimization quality

Failure Signatures:
- Layout bias: Consistent preference for certain SERP configurations regardless of query context
- Permutation-invariance issues: LLM decisions affected more by presentation order than content relevance
- Tool call failures: Missing or incorrect API parameters leading to incomplete content retrieval

First Experiments:
1. Run GenSERP on 100 diverse queries and compare Page-Recall scores against production SERPs
2. Test the system's ability to handle multi-vertical queries by analyzing layout diversity and content coverage
3. Evaluate the scoring function's effectiveness by comparing LLM-selected SERPs against human judgments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Layout bias observed where LLMs show preference for specific SERP configurations regardless of query context
- Permutation-invariance characteristics suggest LLM decision-making may be more sensitive to presentation order than content relevance
- Evaluation relies on comparing against production SERPs without accounting for personalization or temporal factors

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Core framework design | High |
| Empirical claims | Medium |
| Layout bias findings | High |
| Permutation-invariance observations | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct A/B testing against production SERPs with real user engagement metrics (click-through rate, dwell time, satisfaction scores) across multiple verticals and query types
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the impact of individual components (e.g., comparing LLM-based vs heuristic layout selection, testing different scoring functions)
3. Test the framework's robustness to adversarial or edge-case queries, including ambiguous queries, rare verticals, and queries requiring complex reasoning beyond straightforward information retrieval
