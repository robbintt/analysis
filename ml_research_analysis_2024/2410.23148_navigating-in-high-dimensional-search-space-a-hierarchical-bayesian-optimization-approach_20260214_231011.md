# Navigating in High-Dimensional Search Space: A Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Approach

## Quick Facts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HiBO, a hierarchical Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to address the challenges of high-dimensional black-box optimization. HiBO combines a global-level navigator that adaptively partitions the search space with a local optimizer guided by the partitioning information. The algorithm employs a search-tree-based partitioning strategy with dynamic depth control to balance exploration and exploitation while reducing computational cost. Evaluated on synthetic benchmarks and a real-world database management system configuration tuning task, HiBO demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly on sparse benchmarks and high-dimensional problems.

## Method Summary
HiBO addresses high-dimensional black-box optimization through a hierarchical approach that combines global search space partitioning with local Bayesian optimization. The global navigator uses K-Means clustering and SVM classification to recursively partition the search space into regions with different sampling potential, represented as a search tree with UCT-based scoring. The local optimizer, based on TuRBO, uses a partition-score-weighted acquisition function to bias sampling toward promising regions while maintaining local optimization benefits. Dynamic tree depth control adjusts the partitioning granularity based on consecutive successes or failures, balancing exploration and exploitation while reducing computational overhead.

## Key Results
- On synthetic benchmarks, HiBO consistently achieved better results than competing approaches, with the largest performance gap observed on sparse benchmarks
- In the DBMS tuning task, HiBO achieved over 120% performance improvement over LA-MCTS and TuRBO
- HiBO maintained better safety-weighted performance improvement-time ratios (S-PITR) compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
HiBO uses hierarchical partitioning to reduce effective dimensionality in high-dimensional BO. The global-level navigator recursively partitions the search space using clustering and classification, creating a search tree where each leaf node represents a region with distinct sampling potential. The local optimizer then biases sampling toward high-potential regions using partition-score-weighted acquisition functions. The core assumption is that the objective function exhibits structural properties that can be exploited through space partitioning, and the partitioning process effectively identifies regions with different sampling potential.

### Mechanism 2
Dynamic tree depth control balances exploration and exploitation while reducing computational cost. The algorithm adjusts maximum tree depth based on consecutive successes or failures. After successes, depth decreases to promote exploration; after failures, depth increases for exploitation. Tree construction stops when maximum depth is reached. The core assumption is that performance improvements correlate with effective partitioning, and computational savings from shallower trees outweigh potential information loss.

### Mechanism 3
Partition-score-weighted acquisition functions guide sampling toward promising regions while maintaining local optimization benefits. The local optimizer multiplies the base acquisition function by partition scores derived from UCT values, creating a weighted acquisition that favors points from high-potential partitions while still considering local surrogate model predictions. The core assumption is that the partition scores accurately reflect sampling potential, and the weighting scheme effectively balances global guidance with local optimization.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bayesian Optimization fundamentals (surrogate modeling, acquisition functions, exploration-exploitation trade-off)**
  - Why needed here: HiBO builds upon standard BO framework, adding hierarchical partitioning on top of local BO optimization
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of the acquisition function in Bayesian Optimization?

- **Concept: Search tree data structures and traversal algorithms**
  - Why needed here: HiBO uses a search tree for space partitioning, requiring understanding of tree construction, node splitting, and traversal
  - Quick check question: How does breadth-first search differ from depth-first search in tree construction?

- **Concept: Clustering and classification machine learning techniques**
  - Why needed here: The global navigator uses K-means clustering and classification models to partition the search space
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Global navigator (search tree construction, UCT scoring) -> Local optimizer (TuRBO with weighted acquisition) -> Interface layer (history management) -> Configuration module (hyperparameters)

- **Critical path:** Initial sampling → Global navigator builds search tree → Local optimizer trains surrogate model → Weighted acquisition calculation → Sample selection → Objective evaluation → Update history dataset → Repeat

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Tree depth vs. computational cost: Deeper trees provide more refined partitioning but increase computational overhead
  - Partition granularity vs. exploration: Finer partitions may over-exploit while coarser partitions may under-explore
  - Temperature parameter vs. exploration bias: Lower temperature creates sharper partition score distributions, increasing bias toward high-potential regions

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor performance despite high computational cost: May indicate ineffective partitioning or incorrect tree depth control
  - Random sampling behavior: May indicate partition scores are not differentiating regions effectively
  - Slow convergence: May indicate insufficient exploration or overly conservative tree depth settings

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Test HiBO on simple synthetic benchmark (e.g., Ackley function) with 2-3 dimensions to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare performance with fixed tree depth vs. adaptive tree depth on moderate-dimensional problems (10-20 dimensions)
  3. Evaluate computational overhead of tree construction vs. performance gains on high-dimensional problems (50+ dimensions)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the main text, but several questions arise from the limitations and scope of the work, including scalability to even higher dimensions, performance on different types of objective functions, and the impact of various hyperparameter settings.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability due to evaluation on only synthetic benchmarks and a single real-world DBMS configuration task
- Computational overhead of search tree construction is not fully characterized across different dimensionalities
- Performance may not generalize well to problems with different success-failure patterns than those tested

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The hierarchical partitioning framework is well-defined and the core algorithm components are clearly specified
- **Medium Confidence**: The performance claims on synthetic benchmarks, as the improvements are consistent but the magnitude varies significantly across different test functions
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of HiBO to other high-dimensional optimization domains beyond DBMS tuning, given the limited number of real-world applications tested

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain validation**: Test HiBO on at least 3 additional high-dimensional optimization problems from different domains (e.g., robotics control, hyperparameter tuning for deep learning, chemical compound design) to assess generalizability
2. **Computational overhead analysis**: Measure and compare the total computational cost (including tree construction time) of HiBO against competing methods across varying dimensionalities (10D to 200D) to quantify the trade-off between performance and efficiency
3. **Hyperparameter sensitivity study**: Conduct a systematic sensitivity analysis of the temperature parameter τ and tree depth control thresholds to understand their impact on performance across different problem types
