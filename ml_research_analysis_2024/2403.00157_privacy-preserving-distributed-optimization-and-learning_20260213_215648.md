# Privacy-Preserving Distributed Optimization and Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.00157
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00157
- Authors: Ziqin Chen; Yongqiang Wang
- Reference count: 12
- This paper surveys privacy-preserving methods for distributed optimization and learning.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of privacy-preserving methods for distributed optimization and learning. It focuses on differential privacy (DP) due to its low computational and communication complexities compared to cryptographic methods like homomorphic encryption. The paper introduces several DP algorithms that can simultaneously ensure privacy and optimization accuracy, including DP-oriented static-consensus and gradient-tracking algorithms for offline optimization, and locally differentially private (LDP) algorithms for online learning. These methods are demonstrated through applications in machine learning problems like logistic regression and convolutional neural network training.

## Method Summary
The paper surveys privacy-preserving methods for distributed optimization and learning, with a focus on differential privacy. It introduces DP-oriented algorithms that incorporate noise injection with decaying weakening factors to preserve privacy while maintaining convergence. For offline optimization, static-consensus and gradient-tracking algorithms are presented for both undirected and directed communication graphs. For online learning, LDP algorithms are proposed to handle streaming data. The methods are validated on machine learning tasks including logistic regression on the "Mushrooms" dataset and CNN training on the "CIFAR-10" dataset.

## Key Results
- DP-based algorithms can simultaneously ensure privacy and optimization accuracy through careful noise injection and attenuation schedules
- LDP provides stronger privacy guarantees than centralized DP in distributed optimization by protecting against both external adversaries and curious neighboring agents
- Gradient tracking methods can be modified to preserve privacy while maintaining convergence to the global optimal solution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DP-based algorithms can simultaneously ensure privacy and optimization accuracy by carefully designing noise injection and attenuation schedules.
- Mechanism: Persistent DP-noise is injected into shared messages, but its impact is mitigated by using a decaying weakening factor sequence that reduces the coupling strength among agents over time. This preserves the algorithm's convergence properties while ensuring DP.
- Core assumption: The optimization problem has either convex or strongly convex objective functions with Lipschitz gradients.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We then introduce several differential-privacy algorithms that can simultaneously ensure privacy and optimization accuracy."
  - [section]: "By judiciously designing the attenuation sequence γt, the stepsize λt, and the DP-noise variance sequence σi,t, Chen and Wang (2023a) proved that Algorithm 5 achieves mean square convergence to the optimal solution x∗t to problem (5) and preserves ϵi-LDP with a finite cumulative privacy budget even when T → ∞."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; neighboring papers focus on privacy preservation but do not directly address the accuracy-privacy trade-off.
- Break condition: If the objective function is nonconvex or nonsmooth, the convergence guarantees may fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) provides stronger privacy guarantees than centralized DP in distributed optimization/learning by protecting against both external adversaries and curious neighboring agents.
- Mechanism: Each agent perturbs its local data before sharing, ensuring that the output of the algorithm is insensitive to changes in the local dataset of any agent, rather than to changes in a single data point within a "centralized" dataset.
- Core assumption: Agents can independently choose their privacy budgets based on their practical needs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "To ensure differential privacy at the agent-level, Local differential privacy (LDP) provides a more user-friendly and stronger privacy protection for distributed optimization and learning."
  - [section]: "This characteristic of the LDP framework removes the need for mutual trust among agents and allows individual agents to choose heterogeneous privacy budgets ϵi in a fully distributed manner."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; neighboring papers focus on privacy preservation but do not directly address the strength of LDP compared to centralized DP.
- Break condition: If agents collude or if the communication graph is highly connected, privacy guarantees may be compromised.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Gradient tracking methods can be modified to preserve privacy while maintaining convergence to the global optimal solution.
- Mechanism: Persistent DP-noise is injected into the gradient estimates, but the accumulation of noise in the global gradient estimation is prevented by incorporating the difference between consecutive gradient estimates into the decision variable update.
- Core assumption: The communication graph is strongly connected and the stepsizes and weakening factors are chosen appropriately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Incorporating the difference yi,t+1 − yi,t rather yi,t (which is typically used in conventional gradient-tracking-based algorithm (Pu et al., 2020)) into the decision variable update in Line 7 is to resolve the issue of DP-noises accumulation in global gradient estimation."
  - [section]: "Algorithm 6 removes the need for a weakening factor in inter-agent iterations, which is crucial in Algorithms 1-5 to simultaneously ensure optimization accuracy and ϵ-DP."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; neighboring papers focus on privacy preservation but do not directly address the use of gradient tracking for privacy preservation.
- Break condition: If the communication graph is not strongly connected or if the stepsizes and weakening factors are not chosen appropriately, the algorithm may not converge.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Differential Privacy (DP)
  - Why needed here: DP is the core privacy-preserving technique used in the paper, and understanding its definition and properties is crucial for understanding the algorithms presented.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between ϵ-DP and (ϵ, δ)-DP?
- Concept: Local Differential Privacy (LDP)
  - Why needed here: LDP is introduced as a stronger privacy framework than centralized DP, and understanding its definition and properties is crucial for understanding the algorithms presented.
  - Quick check question: How does LDP differ from centralized DP in terms of the adjacency relationship and the adversary model?
- Concept: Gradient Tracking
  - Why needed here: Gradient tracking is used in some of the algorithms presented to ensure convergence to the global optimal solution, and understanding its basic principles is crucial for understanding the privacy-preserving modifications.
  - Quick check question: What is the main idea behind gradient tracking, and how does it differ from consensus-based methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Multiple agents -> Communication graph -> Shared messages with DP-noise injection -> Convergence to optimal solution
- Critical path: Agents exchange messages -> Update states based on received messages and local information -> Inject DP-noise -> Achieve convergence
- Design tradeoffs: The main design tradeoff is between privacy and optimization accuracy. Stronger privacy guarantees require more noise injection, which can degrade the optimization accuracy.
- Failure signatures: The system may fail to converge to the optimal solution, or the privacy guarantees may be compromised if the assumptions are not met or if the parameters are not chosen appropriately.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement Algorithm 1 on a small-scale convex optimization problem and verify its convergence and privacy guarantees.
  2. Implement Algorithm 5 on a logistic regression problem with LDP constraints and evaluate its classification accuracy.
  3. Implement Algorithm 6 on a deep learning problem with LDP constraints and compare its performance with other DP algorithms.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can privacy-preserving distributed optimization algorithms be designed for nonsmooth objective functions while maintaining both privacy and optimization accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the focus on smooth objective functions in most existing privacy-preserving works and mentions that some works have incorporated the DP framework into distributed nonsmooth optimization/learning, but the accuracy-privacy dilemma still remains unresolved.
- Why unresolved: The paper states that although some works have attempted to address nonsmooth objective functions, the accuracy-privacy dilemma persists, indicating that a solution that maintains both privacy and optimization accuracy for nonsmooth functions is still lacking.
- What evidence would resolve it: A privacy-preserving distributed optimization algorithm that successfully handles nonsmooth objective functions while demonstrating both privacy preservation and optimization accuracy in empirical evaluations would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the computational and communication costs of encryption-based privacy-preserving methods be reduced to make them more suitable for large-scale distributed learning applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that encryption methods like homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation incur significant computational and communication costs, which limit their applications in large-scale machine learning.
- Why unresolved: Despite the potential of encryption-based methods for privacy preservation, their high computational and communication overheads make them impractical for large-scale applications, as stated in the paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and demonstration of encryption-based privacy-preserving methods with significantly reduced computational and communication costs, validated through experiments on large-scale distributed learning tasks, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can privacy-preserving distributed bilevel optimization algorithms be developed for machine learning tasks such as meta-learning and reinforcement learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the increasing attention on bilevel optimization in machine learning tasks and notes that while some works have studied privacy-preserving methods for centralized bilevel optimization, there is a significant gap in research regarding privacy-preserving distributed bilevel optimization and learning.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the lack of research on privacy-preserving distributed bilevel optimization, despite its importance in various machine learning applications, indicating that this area remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A privacy-preserving distributed bilevel optimization algorithm that effectively addresses tasks like meta-learning or reinforcement learning, with demonstrated privacy preservation and optimization accuracy, would resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The paper's theoretical claims rely on strong assumptions about convex/strongly convex objective functions and strongly connected communication graphs.
- Practical implementation details for weakening factors, weight matrices, and exact noise parameters are not fully specified, requiring significant assumptions for reproduction.
- The paper focuses primarily on small-scale machine learning tasks and does not extensively validate performance on large-scale, real-world distributed optimization problems.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanisms of DP-based noise injection and gradient tracking modifications are well-established in the privacy literature and logically sound.
- **Medium confidence**: The convergence proofs for the proposed algorithms, while mathematically rigorous, depend on specific parameter choices that may be challenging to tune in practice.
- **Low confidence**: The practical effectiveness of LDP in distributed optimization against real-world adversarial scenarios is not thoroughly validated, as most experiments focus on benign settings.

## Next Checks

1. **Convergence and Privacy Trade-off Analysis**: Implement Algorithm 1 on a small-scale convex optimization problem and systematically vary the weakening factors and noise parameters to quantify the privacy-accuracy trade-off curve.
2. **Robustness to Graph Topologies**: Test Algorithm 5 on logistic regression with different communication graph structures (e.g., varying connectivity, presence of cut-nodes) to assess how privacy guarantees hold under realistic network conditions.
3. **Large-Scale Performance Evaluation**: Implement Algorithm 6 on a deep learning task with the CIFAR-10 dataset, comparing its performance and privacy guarantees against other state-of-the-art DP algorithms in a large-scale distributed setting.
