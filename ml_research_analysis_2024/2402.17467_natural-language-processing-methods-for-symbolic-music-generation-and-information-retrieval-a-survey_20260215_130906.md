# Natural Language Processing Methods for Symbolic Music Generation and Information Retrieval: a Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.17467
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17467
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Reviews NLP methods adapted for symbolic music generation and retrieval, organizing approaches into tokenization strategies, embeddings, and model architectures while highlighting fundamental differences between text and music

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively examines how Natural Language Processing techniques are adapted for symbolic music generation and information retrieval tasks. The authors organize the field into two main technical axes: representations of symbolic music adapted from NLP sequential models, and various model architectures trained on different tasks. The survey presents detailed taxonomies of tokenization strategies, including time-slice-based and event-based approaches, and discusses how these representations are converted into vector embeddings for processing by attention-based and recurrent models.

The paper goes beyond technical survey to identify fundamental differences between text and music that challenge direct application of NLP methods. These include music's time dimension, simultaneity of multiple voices, multimodality, and the absence of universal grammar or semantics. The survey concludes by outlining future research directions including developing lighter models, improving explainability, establishing better benchmarking practices, and exploring additional model architectures.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing literature on applying NLP methods to symbolic music generation and information retrieval by organizing approaches into two primary technical axes. First, it examines representations of symbolic music adapted from NLP sequential models, presenting detailed taxonomies of tokenization strategies including time-slice-based methods that divide music into fixed time intervals and event-based methods that represent discrete musical events. Second, it reviews various model architectures trained on different tasks, focusing on attention-based and recurrent models while highlighting music-specialized mechanisms.

The survey systematically categorizes how symbolic music is converted into vector embeddings suitable for NLP models, analyzing the tradeoffs between different tokenization approaches. It also identifies technical limitations of applying NLP methods to symbolic music data and discusses fundamental differences between text and music processing, including the time dimension, simultaneity of multiple voices, multimodality, and the lack of universal grammar or semantics in music.

## Key Results
- Organizes NLP approaches for symbolic music into tokenization strategies and model architectures
- Presents taxonomies of time-slice-based and event-based tokenization methods
- Identifies fundamental differences between text and music including simultaneity and lack of universal grammar
- Outlines future research directions including lighter models and explainability methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by systematically categorizing and analyzing how NLP methods can be adapted for symbolic music tasks. It identifies that music, like text, can be represented as sequential data but requires specialized tokenization strategies to capture its unique characteristics. The mechanism involves converting symbolic music into token sequences using either time-slice-based approaches that divide music into fixed intervals or event-based approaches that represent discrete musical events. These tokens are then converted into vector embeddings that can be processed by attention-based and recurrent models.

The survey's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive taxonomy of existing approaches and its identification of fundamental differences between text and music that inform future research directions. By highlighting limitations of direct NLP application to music data and discussing the absence of universal grammar or semantics in music, the survey provides a framework for understanding where current methods succeed and where new approaches are needed.

## Foundational Learning
**Tokenization Strategies** - why needed: Converts symbolic music into sequences that NLP models can process; quick check: Verify that tokenization preserves musical structure and timing information
**Vector Embeddings** - why needed: Transforms discrete musical tokens into continuous representations suitable for neural networks; quick check: Ensure embeddings capture semantic relationships between musical elements
**Attention Mechanisms** - why needed: Enables models to focus on relevant musical features across sequences; quick check: Validate that attention weights correspond to musically meaningful relationships
**Recurrent Neural Networks** - why needed: Processes sequential music data while maintaining temporal context; quick check: Confirm that hidden states capture long-term musical dependencies
**Music Grammar** - why needed: Understanding why traditional NLP approaches may not fully capture musical structure; quick check: Identify which musical aspects lack clear grammatical rules
**Multimodality in Music** - why needed: Addresses the simultaneous nature of multiple musical voices and instruments; quick check: Verify that representations can handle concurrent musical events

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Symbolic Music -> Tokenization -> Vector Embeddings -> Attention/Recurrent Models -> Music Generation/Retrieval

Critical path: The most critical path involves tokenization followed by vector embedding generation, as errors at these stages propagate through the entire model pipeline and significantly impact downstream generation or retrieval quality.

Design tradeoffs:
- Time-slice-based vs event-based tokenization: Time-slice offers simplicity but may lose fine-grained timing; event-based preserves detail but increases complexity
- Fixed vs variable sequence lengths: Fixed lengths simplify batching but may truncate long musical phrases; variable lengths preserve full compositions but complicate training
- Attention vs recurrent architectures: Attention excels at capturing global dependencies but requires more computation; recurrent models handle sequences naturally but struggle with very long-range dependencies

Failure signatures:
- Poor tokenization leading to loss of musical structure or timing information
- Vector embeddings that fail to capture semantic relationships between musical elements
- Attention mechanisms that focus on irrelevant musical features or miss important patterns
- Models that generate repetitive or musically incoherent sequences
- Retrieval systems that cannot handle the simultaneous nature of multiple musical voices

First experiments:
1. Implement and compare time-slice-based and event-based tokenization strategies on a standardized symbolic music dataset
2. Train attention-based and recurrent models using different embedding techniques to identify optimal representations
3. Evaluate model performance on both music generation and retrieval tasks to identify architecture strengths and weaknesses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions in applying NLP methods to symbolic music. Key questions include: How can we develop lighter models that maintain performance while reducing computational requirements? What methods can improve explainability in music generation models? How can we establish better benchmarking practices for comparing different approaches? How can we address the fundamental challenges of simultaneity and multimodality in music? What additional model architectures beyond current attention and recurrent approaches might better capture musical structure? How can we develop representations that better capture the lack of universal grammar or semantics in music?

## Limitations
- Limited empirical comparisons between different tokenization strategies and model architectures
- Focus on technical frameworks rather than practical performance in real-world applications
- Some recent approaches may not be fully captured due to rapid field evolution
- Theoretical positions on fundamental differences between text and music may evolve with new research

## Confidence
High: Survey's comprehensive coverage of tokenization methods and model adaptations
Medium: Claims about fundamental differences between text and music (e.g., lack of universal grammar)
Low: Quantification of practical performance impacts and real-world application effectiveness

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical benchmarking of the surveyed tokenization strategies and model architectures on standardized symbolic music datasets to quantify performance differences
2. Design controlled experiments to test the survey's claims about fundamental differences between text and music processing, particularly around simultaneity and multimodality
3. Implement and evaluate the proposed future directions (lighter models, explainability methods) to assess their practical viability and impact on music generation quality
