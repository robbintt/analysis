- Primary result: Novel framework for explaining probabilistic logic programming inferences through choice expressions and labeled proofs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive approach to explaining explanations in probabilistic logic programming through a query-driven inference mechanism. The framework centers on choice expressions—compact representations of sets of choices—that are attached to proofs to generate comprehensible justifications for queries. The key innovation lies in creating explanations with a causal structure that can be understood by both experts and non-experts. The approach combines an algebra of choice expressions with SL PDNF-resolution, an extension of SLDNF-resolution for probabilistic logic programs, enabling the computation of explanations as choice expressions while maintaining soundness and completeness for covering explanations.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a novel algebra for manipulating choice expressions using standard logical rules, combined with SL PDNF-resolution that extends traditional SLDNF-resolution to probabilistic settings. Proofs are represented as AND-trees where each node is labeled with an intuitive choice expression. This labeling mechanism allows the system to track the probabilistic choices made during inference, creating explanations that reveal the causal structure behind query results. The framework computes covering explanations—those that account for all possible ways a query can be derived—by systematically exploring the choice space while maintaining computational efficiency through the compact choice expression representation.

## Key Results
- Developed an algebra of choice expressions that can be manipulated using standard logical rules
- Introduced SL PDNF-resolution, extending SLDNF-resolution for probabilistic logic programs to compute explanations as choice expressions
- Established soundness and completeness proofs for computing covering explanations
- Demonstrated promising experimental results with a prototype implementation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by labeling proofs with choice expressions that compactly represent sets of choices made during inference. This labeling creates a causal structure that traces back from query results to the underlying probabilistic choices. The algebra of choice expressions provides the mathematical foundation for manipulating these representations using standard logical operations, while SL PDNF-resolution extends traditional inference mechanisms to handle the probabilistic nature of the programs. The AND-tree representation with labeled nodes preserves the hierarchical structure of proofs while making the probabilistic dependencies explicit and interpretable.

## Foundational Learning

**Choice Expressions** - Compact representations of sets of choices made during probabilistic inference; needed to efficiently track multiple possible derivation paths without explicit enumeration; quick check: can the expression represent all possible choice combinations for a given query.

**SL PDNF-resolution** - Extension of SLDNF-resolution adapted for probabilistic logic programs; needed to handle negation and probabilistic uncertainty during inference; quick check: does it correctly compute the probability distribution over all possible explanations.

**Covering Explanations** - Explanations that account for all possible ways a query can be derived; needed to provide complete understanding of query results; quick check: does the explanation cover all derivation paths that lead to the query being true.

**AND-tree Representation** - Hierarchical proof structure where nodes are labeled with choice expressions; needed to preserve proof structure while making probabilistic choices explicit; quick check: can the tree be traversed to reconstruct the full derivation history.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Query -> SL PDNF-Resolution Engine -> Choice Expression Algebra -> AND-tree Construction -> Labeled Explanations

**Critical Path**: The core inference loop where SL PDNF-resolution explores the proof space while simultaneously building choice expressions and constructing the AND-tree representation. This path must maintain consistency between the probabilistic inference state and the choice expression labels.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Compact choice expressions versus explicit enumeration of all choices (space efficiency vs. interpretability); AND-tree depth versus explanation readability; completeness of covering explanations versus computational tractability.

**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent choice expression labels indicating broken causal chains; incomplete AND-trees suggesting failed coverage of derivation paths; resolution failures pointing to undecidable queries or infinite loops in the proof search.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify basic SL PDNF-resolution produces correct probability distributions on simple deterministic programs
2. Test choice expression algebra operations on known equivalence classes of choices
3. Validate AND-tree construction on programs with multiple derivation paths to ensure all paths are captured

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for large programs with thousands of rules and complex choice structures
- Limited empirical validation with only prototype implementation results and no comparison to alternative explanation methods
- Unclear degree to which explanations capture true causal relationships versus mere probabilistic dependencies
- No evaluation of human interpretability or comprehensibility for non-expert users

## Confidence

**Theoretical Framework** (High): Soundness and completeness proofs for choice expression algebra and SL PDNF-resolution are mathematically rigorous and well-established.

**Practical Applicability** (Medium): Prototype implementation shows promise, but limited experimental scope prevents strong claims about real-world effectiveness.

**Causal Interpretation** (Low): Claims about causal structure are not empirically validated; distinction between causal relationships and probabilistic dependencies remains unclear.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct user studies comparing choice expression-based explanations to baseline methods to evaluate explanation quality and interpretability

2. Test scalability on larger probabilistic logic programs with thousands of rules to assess performance limits and identify bottlenecks

3. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of choice expressions versus other explanation components and determine their relative importance
