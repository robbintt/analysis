# Final-Model-Only Data Attribution with a Unifying View of Gradient-Based Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.03906
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03906
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposes further training as a gold standard for training data attribution in the FiMO setting, showing existing gradient-based methods are approximations to this approach

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of training data attribution (TDA) in the final-model-only (FiMO) setting, where only the final trained model is available without access to training details. The authors propose further training as a gold standard method for measuring how sensitive the model is to individual training instances. They provide a unifying framework showing that existing gradient-based TDA methods can be viewed as approximations to further training. Through extensive experiments across tabular, image, and text datasets, they demonstrate that while first-order methods like Grad-Dot provide good initial approximations, they decay during further training, whereas influence function methods remain more stable but surprisingly show lower overall quality.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a unified view of gradient-based training data attribution methods by framing them as approximations to further training. The authors establish further training as a gold standard for measuring instance importance by observing how the model's loss changes when training instances are removed and the model is fine-tuned. They then analyze existing methods including influence functions, Grad-Dot, and other first-order approximations, showing mathematically how each relates to the further training approach. The framework allows for systematic comparison of these methods across different domains and provides insights into their relative strengths and limitations in the FiMO setting.

## Key Results
- First-order methods like Grad-Dot provide good initial approximations to further training but decay significantly during additional training
- Influence function methods show greater stability during further training but surprisingly exhibit lower overall quality than simpler first-order methods
- The unified framework demonstrates that all gradient-based TDA methods can be viewed as approximations to the further training gold standard
- Extensive experiments across tabular, image, and text datasets validate the theoretical framework and provide practical guidance on method selection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works because it establishes a principled way to measure the true importance of training instances through controlled perturbation (further training), then shows how existing methods approximate this ground truth. The mechanism leverages the fact that if a training instance is truly important, removing it and fine-tuning the model should cause a significant increase in loss. This provides a consistent benchmark against which to evaluate and compare different approximation methods, revealing their relative strengths and weaknesses in capturing true instance importance.

## Foundational Learning

### Further Training as Gold Standard
- **Why needed**: Provides ground truth for measuring instance importance by observing loss changes when removing instances
- **Quick check**: Verify that removing truly mislabeled instances causes larger loss increases than removing correct instances

### Influence Functions
- **Why needed**: Offers an efficient approximation to leave-one-out retraining by leveraging the inverse Hessian of the loss
- **Quick check**: Confirm that influence scores correlate with observed loss changes from actual retraining

### First-Order Gradient Methods
- **Why needed**: Provide computationally efficient approximations to instance importance without requiring second-order information
- **Quick check**: Validate that simpler gradient-based scores capture major patterns in instance importance

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Training Data Attribution Methods -> Further Training Gold Standard -> Approximation Methods (Influence Functions, Grad-Dot, First-Order Methods)

### Critical Path
1. Compute instance importance scores using approximation method
2. Remove instances and perform further training
3. Measure loss change to establish ground truth
4. Compare approximation quality against ground truth

### Design Tradeoffs
- Computational efficiency vs. approximation accuracy
- Stability during further training vs. initial quality
- Applicability across different model architectures and data types

### Failure Signatures
- Methods showing high initial quality but rapid decay during further training
- Methods that are stable but consistently underestimate true importance
- Methods that fail to generalize across different data modalities

### First Experiments
1. Compare Grad-Dot and influence function scores on a small tabular dataset with known mislabeled instances
2. Measure decay rates of different methods during 5-10 epochs of further training
3. Validate the unified framework by testing across at least two different data modalities (e.g., tabular and image)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Extensive experiments rely on synthetic mislabeled data rather than real-world annotation errors
- Computational cost of full retraining limits the scale of validation possible
- Results may not generalize to all model architectures or data distributions beyond those tested

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Theoretical unification of gradient-based methods as approximations to further training | High |
| Empirical ranking of approximation methods on synthetic mislabeled data | Medium |
| Stability analysis of different methods during further training | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test approximation quality and stability claims on real-world data errors (actual mislabeled instances from human annotation) rather than synthetic noise
2. Evaluate methods on larger-scale models and datasets to verify scalability of proposed approximations
3. Assess methods' performance when final model is subject to domain shift or distribution drift from original training data
