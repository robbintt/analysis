# Continual Learning for Autonomous Robots: A Prototype-based Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.00418
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00418
- Authors: Elvin Hajizada; Balachandran Swaminathan; Yulia Sandamirskaya

- Primary result: CLP achieves 99% base-class accuracy and 65%/76% novel-class accuracy (5-shot/10-shot) in semi-supervised few-shot continual learning on OpenLORIS

## Executive Summary
Continually Learning Prototypes (CLP) is a prototype-based approach designed for online few-shot continual learning in autonomous robotic vision systems. By combining dynamic metaplasticity, per-prototype learning rates, and on-demand prototype allocation, CLP mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables flexible, multi-modal class representations. It supports novelty detection and semi-supervised adaptation, making it suitable for open-world environments. Evaluated on OpenLORIS with an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, CLP outperforms prior methods in both fully supervised and semi-supervised continual learning settings.

## Method Summary
CLP uses a prototype-based architecture where each class is represented by one or more prototypes updated via normalized dot-product similarity. Dynamic metaplasticity adjusts individual prototype learning rates based on prediction performance, enabling selective adaptation and reduced forgetting. When similarity to existing prototypes falls below a threshold, new prototypes are allocated to represent novel instances. The system supports both fully supervised online continual learning and semi-supervised few-shot adaptation, leveraging pseudo-labels from similarity thresholding. CLP was evaluated using an EfficientNet-B0 backbone on the OpenLORIS dataset, demonstrating high accuracy and effective novelty detection.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99% accuracy on base classes in online continual learning.
- Reaches 65% (5-shot) and 76% (10-shot) accuracy on novel classes in semi-supervised few-shot continual learning.
- Outperforms prior methods in both fully supervised and semi-supervised settings.
- Demonstrates superior novelty detection with high AUROC/AUPRC across varying thresholds.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CLP's effectiveness stems from dynamic metaplasticity, which adjusts each prototype's learning rate based on prediction performance, enabling selective adaptation and reducing catastrophic forgetting. The use of normalized dot-product similarity for prototype updates ensures stable, bounded updates even with limited data. On-demand prototype allocation allows the model to flexibly represent novel instances, supporting open-world learning. The semi-supervised setting leverages reliable pseudo-labels from similarity thresholds, enabling efficient few-shot adaptation without extensive labeled data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Catastrophic forgetting**: Occurs when neural networks overwrite old knowledge during new task learning. Critical for continual learning in robotics to maintain performance across changing environments.
- **Prototype-based learning**: Represents classes as sets of prototypes, enabling flexible and interpretable class boundaries. Needed for open-world scenarios where new classes may emerge.
- **Dynamic metaplasticity**: Adjusts learning rates per prototype based on prediction accuracy, allowing selective adaptation and resilience to forgetting.
- **Similarity thresholding**: Determines when to allocate new prototypes for novel instances, enabling novelty detection and class expansion.
- **Normalized dot-product similarity**: Provides stable, bounded updates for prototype learning, especially useful in few-shot settings.
- **Semi-supervised adaptation**: Uses pseudo-labels from similarity thresholds to update prototypes with minimal labeled data, crucial for efficient online learning.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Input image -> EfficientNet-B0 backbone -> Prototype layer (with dynamic learning rates) -> Similarity computation -> Prototype update / novelty detection

**Critical path:**
Image feature extraction → Similarity computation with prototypes → Prediction → Prototype update (if correct) or new prototype allocation (if novel)

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Per-prototype learning rates enable fine-grained adaptation but increase memory overhead.
- On-demand prototype allocation supports novelty detection but may increase model size over time.
- Semi-supervised adaptation reduces labeling burden but depends on reliable pseudo-labeling.

**Failure signatures:**
- High false-positive novelty detection due to noisy or ambiguous features.
- Slow adaptation if learning rates are set too low or prototypes are too stable.
- Increased memory usage and slower inference with many prototypes.

**First experiments:**
1. Evaluate base-class accuracy on OpenLORIS to confirm 99% performance.
2. Test novelty detection AUROC/AUPRC at multiple similarity thresholds.
3. Compare 5-shot and 10-shot novel-class accuracy in semi-supervised setting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance relies heavily on the OpenLORIS dataset and EfficientNet-B0 backbone; generalization to other datasets or architectures is unverified.
- Hyperparameters (similarity thresholds, learning rates) may require careful tuning per task, with no sensitivity analysis provided.
- Long-term continual learning with many tasks and scalability to real-time, on-device deployment are not evaluated.

## Confidence
- **High**: Base-class accuracy (99%) and overall continual learning performance, as measured on a standard benchmark with direct comparisons.
- **Medium**: Novelty detection and semi-supervised few-shot adaptation, due to limited robustness analysis in noisy or ambiguous environments.
- **Low**: Scalability and computational efficiency for real-time, on-device robotic deployment, as these aspects are not explicitly evaluated.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate CLP on additional robotic vision datasets (e.g., CORe50, Continual Object Recognition in Context) to assess generalization beyond OpenLORIS.
2. Perform an ablation study on the impact of similarity threshold and learning rate hyperparameters on both accuracy and novelty detection performance.
3. Quantify the memory and inference-time computational overhead of CLP, especially under continuous prototype allocation, and test on embedded or neuromorphic hardware to validate real-time capability claims.
