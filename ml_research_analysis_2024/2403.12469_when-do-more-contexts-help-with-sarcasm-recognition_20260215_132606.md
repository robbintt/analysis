# When Do "More Contexts" Help with Sarcasm Recognition?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.12469
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12469
- Authors: Ojas Nimase; Sanghyun Hong
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: A framework combining word-level, sentence-level, and contrastive-learned embeddings achieves state-of-the-art performance in sarcasm recognition

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether incorporating more contextual information improves sarcasm recognition by developing a framework that integrates four approaches: word-level contexts, sentence-level contexts, improved sentence-level embeddings via contrastive learning, and a combination of all embeddings. The authors evaluate these approaches on three benchmarks and find that combining all embeddings achieves state-of-the-art performance. Sentence-level embeddings are shown to be more effective than word-level embeddings, and pre-training on sarcastic-rich corpora further improves results. Manual analysis reveals that the model sometimes relies on societal biases to correctly classify sarcastic samples, suggesting that further performance gains may require encoding such biases.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a framework that integrates four approaches for sarcasm recognition: word-level embeddings using Word2Vec, sentence-level embeddings using pre-trained transformers (RoBERTa and BERTweet), contrastive-learned sentence embeddings, and a combination of all embeddings. The framework uses a 2-layer feedforward neural network trained for 5 epochs with cross-entropy loss and AdamW optimizer. The model is evaluated on three sarcasm recognition benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance through the combination of multiple context types.

## Key Results
- Combining word-level, sentence-level, and contrastive-learned embeddings achieves state-of-the-art performance on sarcasm recognition benchmarks
- Sentence-level embeddings outperform word-level embeddings for sarcasm detection
- Pre-training on sarcastic-rich corpora (like BERTweet on English Tweets) improves performance
- Manual analysis reveals the model sometimes relies on societal biases to correctly classify sarcastic samples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining multiple context types improves sarcasm recognition performance.
- Mechanism: The framework integrates word-level embeddings (capturing local sentiment contrasts), sentence-level embeddings (capturing long-range dependencies), and contrastive-learned embeddings (capturing sentence-level semantic differences between sarcastic and non-sarcastic texts). Combining these provides richer contextual information than any single approach.
- Core assumption: Different context types capture complementary information about sarcasm that is not redundant.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We achieve existing state-of-the-art performances and also demonstrate the benefits of sequentially adding more contexts."
  - [section 3.2] "From the first row (A1), we see that word-level embeddings that encode the contexts from nearby words are not sufficient to perform well in sarcasm recognition. Sentence-level embeddings (A2) that capture contexts from long-range dependency significantly improve performance."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers; average neighbor FMR=0.345 suggests moderate relevance in broader literature.
- Break condition: If the different context types capture highly redundant information, combining them would provide minimal additional benefit.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sentence-level embeddings are more effective than word-level embeddings for sarcasm recognition.
- Mechanism: Sentence-level embeddings capture long-range dependencies and broader context that word-level embeddings miss. Sarcasm often relies on contextual relationships between distant words or phrases.
- Core assumption: Sarcasm detection requires understanding relationships between words/phrases that may be separated by other content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "From the first row (A1), we see that word-level embeddings that encode the contexts from nearby words are not sufficient to perform well in sarcasm recognition. Sentence-level embeddings (A2) that capture contexts from long-range dependency significantly improve performance."
  - [section 3.3] Manual analysis shows examples where A2 correctly classifies texts that A1 misclassifies due to long-range dependency understanding.
- Break condition: If sarcasm patterns were primarily local (within a few words), word-level embeddings would be sufficient.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pre-training on corpora containing more sarcastic texts improves performance.
- Mechanism: Models pre-trained on sarcastic-rich corpora (like BERTweet on English Tweets) learn embeddings that better capture the linguistic patterns and contexts associated with sarcasm.
- Core assumption: Exposure to more sarcastic examples during pre-training allows models to learn domain-specific patterns relevant to sarcasm detection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "The performance further increases when models are pre-trained on a corpus (A3), potentially including more sarcastic texts, such as English Tweets."
  - [section 3.3] "If sentence embeddings learn from texts potentially containing sarcasm (A2: BERTweet), the embeddings of 'And everything you say is a fact?' are not similar to those of genuine questions. They are closer to accusatory questions."
- Break condition: If sarcasm patterns are sufficiently general across domains, domain-specific pre-training would provide minimal benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Word embeddings and their limitations for capturing context
  - Why needed here: Understanding why word-level embeddings (A1) perform poorly compared to sentence-level approaches
  - Quick check question: What is the key limitation of using simple word embeddings for sarcasm detection?

- Concept: Sentence embeddings and transformer architectures
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on pre-trained transformer models (RoBERTa, BERTweet) to generate sentence-level embeddings
  - Quick check question: How do transformer-based models differ from traditional word embeddings in capturing contextual information?

- Concept: Contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: Method A3 uses contrastive learning to improve sentence embeddings by maximizing agreement between similar texts and disagreement between contrasting texts
  - Quick check question: What is the core objective of contrastive learning in the context of this sarcasm detection framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Text data
  - A1: Word2Vec word embeddings → Feed-forward neural network
  - A2: Pre-trained RoBERTa/BERTweet sentence embeddings → Fine-tuning
  - A3: Contrastive learning fine-tuning of BERTweet
  - A4: Concatenation of all embeddings → Dimensionality reduction → Classification
  - Output: Sarcasm/non-sarcasm prediction

- Critical path: Text → Embeddings (A1, A2, A3) → Concatenation (A4) → Classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. performance: A4 achieves SOTA by simple concatenation rather than complex architectural innovations
  - Computational cost vs. accuracy: Using all embeddings increases dimensionality (39936) requiring dimensionality reduction
  - Generalizability vs. specificity: Pre-training on sarcastic-rich corpora improves performance but may introduce domain bias

- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision but high recall: Model predicts sarcasm too liberally
  - Low recall but high precision: Model misses sarcastic instances
  - Performance plateau: Additional contexts don't improve accuracy
  - Bias indicators: Systematic misclassification of certain groups/topics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate each approach (A1, A2, A3) individually on a small dataset to understand baseline performance
  2. Implement A4 by concatenating A1, A2, and A3 embeddings, testing dimensionality reduction strategies
  3. Conduct manual analysis on misclassified samples to identify patterns and potential biases in the model's decision-making

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent do societal biases influence sarcasm detection performance, and can we quantify this influence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that models may need to learn societal biases to correctly classify certain sarcastic samples.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides qualitative examples but does not systematically quantify the extent of bias influence on model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies measuring the correlation between model bias scores and sarcasm detection accuracy, or ablation studies removing biased features to observe performance drops.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does increasing model size effectively mitigate bias issues in sarcasm detection?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that future research should assess whether larger language models can address the identified bias issues.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not empirically test the impact of model size on bias mitigation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of sarcasm detection performance and bias levels across models of varying sizes, controlling for other factors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Which specific training instances most significantly impact the accurate identification of certain sarcastic expressions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the need for methods to determine which training instances significantly impact the accurate identification of specific sarcastic expressions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide methods to identify these critical training instances.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis techniques such as influence functions or gradient-based attribution methods to identify influential training examples for specific sarcasm detection cases.

## Limitations

- The framework's reliance on societal biases for improved performance suggests it may be learning spurious correlations rather than genuine sarcasm patterns
- The paper does not provide quantitative measures of bias or mitigation strategies
- Performance gains from combining multiple context types may be dataset-specific rather than generalizable across different sarcasm detection benchmarks

## Confidence

- High confidence in the finding that combining multiple context types (word-level, sentence-level, and contrastive-learned embeddings) improves sarcasm recognition performance
- Medium confidence in the claim that sentence-level embeddings are more effective than word-level embeddings, as this is well-supported but could vary by dataset
- Medium confidence in the effectiveness of pre-training on sarcastic-rich corpora, as the evidence is based on comparison with RoBERTa rather than systematic ablation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct bias audits on the model predictions to quantify how often societal biases influence classification decisions, particularly for samples involving sensitive topics
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each embedding type and verify that the improvements from combination are not due to redundancy
3. Test the framework on additional sarcasm detection benchmarks, particularly those with different demographic distributions and topics, to assess generalizability beyond the three evaluated datasets
