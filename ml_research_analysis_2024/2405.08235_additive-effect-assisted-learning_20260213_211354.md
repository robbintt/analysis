core_contribution: This paper tackles the challenge of training joint models when
  two agents possess distinct but aligned datasets, without sharing raw data due to
  privacy concerns or communication costs. The proposed two-stage "Additive-Effect
  Assisted Learning" (AE-AL) approach uses a privacy-aware hypothesis test to screen
  if the other agent's data is useful, requiring only a small sketch of data transmission,
  and then iteratively trains a joint model by exchanging summary statistics, achieving
  performance comparable to centralized training.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Additive-Effect Assisted Learning (AE-AL), a method for training joint models when two agents have distinct but aligned datasets while preserving privacy and minimizing communication. The approach operates in two stages: first, a privacy-aware hypothesis test determines whether the other agent's data is useful using only a small data sketch; second, iterative training exchanges summary statistics to achieve centralized-level performance. The method is theoretically grounded with proofs of asymptotic validity for the hypothesis test, exponential convergence of the training algorithm, and privacy guarantees under local differential privacy.

## Method Summary
AE-AL operates through a two-stage process to enable joint model training without raw data sharing. In the first stage, a privacy-aware hypothesis test screens whether the other agent's data provides meaningful information for the joint model, requiring transmission of only a small sketch of the data. The second stage employs iterative training where agents exchange summary statistics rather than raw data, progressively refining the joint model. The method is designed to achieve performance comparable to centralized training while maintaining privacy through local differential privacy guarantees and reducing communication costs through efficient summary statistic exchange.

## Key Results
- Achieves centralized-level model performance without raw data sharing
- Asymptotically valid privacy-aware hypothesis test requires minimal data sketch transmission
- Outperforms distributed methods like FedSGD and FedBCD in both theory and simulations
- Demonstrates exponential convergence to the oracle estimator under stated conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the additive effect structure in the data to enable effective collaboration without compromising privacy. The privacy-aware hypothesis test acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that communication and computation resources are only expended when the other agent's data is genuinely useful. By exchanging summary statistics rather than raw data, the method preserves privacy while maintaining sufficient information for joint model training. The iterative nature of the training algorithm allows for progressive refinement of the model, with each round of summary statistic exchange improving convergence toward the oracle estimator.

## Foundational Learning
- Differential Privacy: Why needed - Provides formal privacy guarantees when sharing data summaries; Quick check - Verify that ε and δ parameters meet application requirements
- Distributed Optimization: Why needed - Enables collaborative learning across multiple data owners; Quick check - Confirm convergence conditions hold for the specific optimization problem
- Hypothesis Testing: Why needed - Determines whether data sharing is beneficial before expending resources; Quick check - Validate Type I and Type II error rates under realistic conditions
- Summary Statistics: Why needed - Allow information exchange without revealing raw data; Quick check - Ensure sufficient statistics capture all relevant model information
- Sketch Algorithms: Why needed - Enable compact data representation for hypothesis testing; Quick check - Verify sketch size versus accuracy trade-off meets requirements

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Sketch Generation -> Privacy-Aware Hypothesis Test -> Summary Statistic Exchange -> Iterative Model Update -> Convergence Check

Critical Path: The hypothesis test must complete successfully before summary statistic exchange begins, and each iteration of model update depends on the previous iteration's results. The convergence check determines when the algorithm terminates.

Design Tradeoffs: Smaller sketch sizes improve privacy and reduce communication but may reduce hypothesis test accuracy. More frequent summary statistic exchanges accelerate convergence but increase communication costs. Stricter privacy parameters (smaller ε) provide stronger guarantees but may require larger sample sizes.

Failure Signatures: Hypothesis test consistently rejects useful data (false negative) when sketch size is too small or data distributions are highly heterogeneous. Convergence stalls when summary statistics become insufficiently informative due to aggressive privacy constraints. Performance degrades when model structure assumptions are violated.

First Experiments:
1. Test hypothesis test accuracy with varying sketch sizes on synthetic data with known additive effects
2. Measure convergence rate with different summary statistic update frequencies
3. Evaluate privacy-utility trade-off by varying ε parameters across multiple datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Asymptotic validity of hypothesis test depends on assumptions about data distribution alignment that may not hold with heterogeneous data sources
- Exponential convergence claim requires strict conditions on model structure and data similarity that may be difficult to verify in practice
- Computational complexity analysis doesn't account for communication overhead of exchanging summary statistics for high-dimensional models
- Privacy guarantees may be compromised if sketch size is insufficient or hypothesis test is applied repeatedly

## Confidence
High confidence: The privacy-aware hypothesis test is asymptotically valid under stated assumptions; The training algorithm achieves comparable performance to centralized training in the evaluated settings.
Medium confidence: The exponential convergence rate holds under the stated conditions; The method outperforms FedSGD and FedBCD in general settings.
Low confidence: The privacy guarantees remain robust under practical implementation constraints; The method scales efficiently to very high-dimensional models and large-scale distributed systems.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive experiments with highly heterogeneous data distributions to test the robustness of the hypothesis test and training convergence.
2. Perform detailed computational complexity analysis including communication overhead for various model sizes and sketch dimensions.
3. Evaluate privacy guarantees under repeated hypothesis testing and varying sketch sizes to establish practical privacy-utility trade-offs.
