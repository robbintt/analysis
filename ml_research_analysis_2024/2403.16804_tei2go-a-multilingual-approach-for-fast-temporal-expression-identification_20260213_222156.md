# TEI2GO: A Multilingual Approach for Fast Temporal Expression Identification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2403.16804
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16804
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** TEI2GO achieves state-of-the-art results in four of six languages while being two orders of magnitude faster than baseline systems

## Executive Summary
TEI2GO introduces a multilingual temporal expression identification system that addresses the runtime performance limitations of existing systems like HeidelTime. By framing TEI as a sequence labeling problem and training spaCy entity-recognition models on a combination of manually annotated reference corpora and a large weakly-labeled dataset created using HeidelTime annotations, the authors develop a system that supports six languages. The models achieve state-of-the-art results in four languages while maintaining significantly faster inference speeds, making them practical for real-world applications. All models are made publicly available on HuggingFace for easy integration and use.

## Method Summary
The authors develop TEI2GO by training spaCy entity-recognition models using a combination of manually annotated reference corpora and a large weakly-labeled dataset ("Professor HeidelTime") created by automatically annotating news texts with HeidelTime. The system uses spaCy's transition-based parser with hash embeddings for memory efficiency and linear-time inference. Three model configurations are trained for each language: Base (only reference corpus), Compilation (all corpora except weakly labeled), and All (all corpora including weakly labeled). The models are evaluated on 21 benchmark corpora across six languages using strict and relaxed F1 scores.

## Key Results
- TEI2GO achieves state-of-the-art results in English, Spanish, and Italian
- Runtime is two orders of magnitude faster than HeidelTime and SparkNLP
- The weakly labeled "Professor HeidelTime" corpus contains 1,050,921 temporal expressions across 138,069 documents in six languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Weak supervision via HeidelTime annotations allows creation of large multilingual corpus without manual labeling costs
- Core assumption: HeidelTime's annotations are sufficiently accurate to serve as pseudo-labels for training neural models
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 4], [corpus] with 1,050,921 temporal expressions
- Break condition: High error rate in HeidelTime annotations could degrade model performance

### Mechanism 2
- spaCy's transition-based parser with hash embeddings achieves fast inference while maintaining effectiveness for TEI
- Core assumption: Computational efficiency can be maintained without significant loss in performance compared to transformer-based approaches
- Evidence anchors: [section 3], [section 5] with runtime improvement quantification
- Break condition: Task complexity requiring deeper contextual understanding may underperform

### Mechanism 3
- Combining weakly labeled data with high-quality reference corpora improves model generalization across domains
- Core assumption: Weakly labeled corpus provides sufficient coverage to improve model robustness
- Evidence anchors: [section 5] with three model configurations and effectiveness evaluation
- Break condition: Systematic biases in weakly labeled data could degrade performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal expression identification as sequence labeling
  - Why needed here: Maps naturally to classifying each token as part of a timex or not
  - Quick check question: What sequence labeling scheme (IOB, BILUO, etc.) does spaCy use?

- Concept: Weak supervision and pseudo-labeling
  - Why needed here: Manual annotation is expensive; weak supervision enables scaling up training data
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between high-quality weak labels versus smaller manual data?

- Concept: Multilingual model training and transfer learning
  - Why needed here: System supports six languages requiring shared pattern leverage and language-specific adaptation
  - Quick check question: How does the architecture handle language-specific tokenization requirements?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Web scraping → HeidelTime annotation → Corpus compilation → spaCy entity recognition → BILUO sequence labeling → Hash embeddings + transition parser → tieval framework → HuggingFace deployment
- Critical path: Corpus creation → Model training (three data configurations) → Evaluation across 21 benchmark corpora → Publication on HuggingFace
- Design tradeoffs: Speed vs. accuracy; weak vs. strong supervision; single vs. multi-domain training
- Failure signatures: Poor boundary detection; domain overfitting; language-specific failures
- First 3 experiments: 1) Reproduce Base model training on single language; 2) Train Compilation model for same language; 3) Train All model to assess weak label impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does TEI2GO perform on domains outside of news and narratives, such as scientific literature or social media?
- What is the impact of using weakly labeled data on TEI2GO's performance in languages other than those tested?
- How does TEI2GO compare to other state-of-the-art TEI systems in terms of runtime performance?

## Limitations

- Effectiveness of weakly labeled data varies significantly across languages, with some benefiting substantially while others show minimal improvement
- Runtime performance comparisons based on specific hardware configuration may not represent full deployment scenarios
- Paper lacks detailed error analysis for false positives/negatives, making it difficult to assess systematic errors

## Confidence

- High confidence: Architectural claims about spaCy's efficiency and weak supervision mechanism
- Medium confidence: Cross-lingual effectiveness claims given mixed results across six languages
- Low confidence: Universal applicability without language-specific tuning based on performance variability

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify exact contribution of weakly labeled data versus reference corpora for each language individually
2. Test model performance on out-of-domain data to assess real-world generalization capabilities
3. Implement and evaluate error analysis protocols to identify systematic failure patterns
