# Minimal Sufficient Views: A DNN model making predictions with more evidence has higher accuracy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.01095
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01095
- Authors: Keisuke Kawano; Takuro Kutsuna; Keisuke Sano
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: A greedy algorithm computes minimal sufficient views (MSVs), and models with more MSVs show higher prediction accuracy across different architectures.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces minimal sufficient views (MSVs) as a novel interpretability concept to evaluate the generalization ability of deep neural networks. MSVs are defined as a minimal set of distinct image regions sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, representing the evidence discovered by the DNN. The authors propose a greedy algorithm to efficiently compute MSVs by iteratively removing image regions until the prediction changes. Experiments demonstrate a strong correlation between the number of MSVs and prediction accuracy across various models and datasets. The MSV metric is shown to be less dependent on overfitting and more reliable than existing metrics like average confidence for model selection, as it does not require label information.

## Method Summary
The method involves computing minimal sufficient views (MSVs) using a greedy algorithm. The image is partitioned into β groups via a splitting function (e.g., SLIC superpixels), and the algorithm recursively removes the group whose exclusion minimally alters the prediction score. This continues until the prediction changes, yielding one MSV. The process repeats with remaining regions to find all MSVs. The average number of MSVs across a dataset serves as a model evaluation metric, correlating with prediction accuracy and generalization performance.

## Key Results
- The number of MSVs strongly correlates with prediction accuracy across different models and datasets.
- Models with more MSVs demonstrate better generalization performance, as they rely on multiple distinct pieces of evidence rather than memorization.
- MSVs can be used as a model selection metric without requiring labels, as they measure internal evidence usage rather than prediction correctness.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MSVs capture sufficient evidence by iteratively removing groups of image regions until prediction changes.
- Mechanism: The greedy algorithm partitions the image into β groups via a splitting function (e.g., SLIC superpixels), then recursively removes the group whose exclusion minimally alters the prediction score. This continues until the prediction changes, yielding one MSV. The process repeats with remaining regions to find all MSVs.
- Core assumption: Removing any single group from a minimal sufficient view will change the prediction, ensuring each MSV is truly minimal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a greedy algorithm to heuristically compute MSVs, in which Minimality condition in Definition 1 is relaxed to β-Split-Minimality."
  - [section] "Every view in V obtained by Algorithm 1 satisfies both Sufficiency and β-Split-Minimality."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no corpus paper explicitly validates this iterative removal strategy.
- Break condition: If the splitting function produces groups that overlap in evidence content, the algorithm may miss some MSVs or produce redundant ones.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A higher number of MSVs correlates with better generalization because the model relies on multiple, distinct pieces of evidence rather than memorization.
- Mechanism: When a model predicts based on several disjoint MSVs, it demonstrates reliance on diverse features, reducing dependence on spurious correlations. This multi-view evidence structure aligns with theoretical models of generalization.
- Core assumption: Distinct MSVs correspond to distinct, task-relevant features, not overlapping spurious cues.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We empirically demonstrated a strong correlation between the number of MSVs (i.e., the number of pieces of evidence) and the generalization performance of the DNN models."
  - [section] "There is a clear relationship between the number of views used in the prediction and the accuracy of the prediction: the more views the prediction uses, the more accurate the prediction is."
  - [corpus] No corpus paper directly supports this claim; related works discuss multi-view learning but not MSVs.
- Break condition: If the model relies on correlated spurious features that happen to be disjoint in partitioning, MSV count may not reflect true generalization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: MSVs can be used as a model selection metric without requiring labels because they measure internal evidence usage rather than prediction correctness.
- Mechanism: By computing the average number of MSVs across a set of unlabeled images, one can rank models by their evidence richness, which correlates with validation accuracy. This sidesteps the need for held-out labels.
- Core assumption: The correlation between MSV count and accuracy holds consistently across datasets and model families.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Since label information is not required to compute MSVs... it is possible to select a model by evaluating the MSVs of an unlabeled dataset."
  - [section] "Figure 1 has a practical implication that we can select the best performing DNN model by evaluating the proposed MSVs on unlabeled data."
  - [corpus] No corpus paper validates unlabeled MSV-based model selection.
- Break condition: If the correlation between MSV count and accuracy weakens on out-of-distribution data, unlabeled model selection may fail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-view learning theory (Allen-Zhu & Li, 2023)
  - Why needed here: Provides theoretical motivation that models using multiple independent evidence sources generalize better.
  - Quick check question: In multi-view learning, what is the assumed structure of the data that improves generalization?

- Concept: Interpretability via feature attribution (e.g., Integrated Gradients, Grad-CAM)
  - Why needed here: MSVs are positioned as an XAI method; understanding existing attribution methods clarifies the novelty of multi-view explanations.
  - Quick check question: How does a single heatmap explanation differ conceptually from a set of disjoint sufficient views?

- Concept: Greedy algorithms and heuristic search
  - Why needed here: The MSV computation uses a greedy recursive strategy; knowing its guarantees and limitations is crucial for correct usage.
  - Quick check question: What is the main trade-off when relaxing exact minimality to β-Split-Minimality in a greedy search?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input image -> Splitting function (SLIC/Voronoi) -> β groups -> Model forward pass -> Prediction scores -> Recursive MSV estimator -> Disjoint sufficient views -> Aggregation -> Average MSV count per image/model

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess image into β groups
  2. Compute initial prediction
  3. Iteratively remove groups minimizing score change until prediction changes
  4. Record MSV, remove from active set, repeat
  5. Average MSV counts across dataset for model comparison

- Design tradeoffs:
  - β small -> faster but coarser MSVs
  - β large -> finer MSVs but slower
  - Splitting method choice (SLIC vs Voronoi) affects group coherence and MSV interpretability

- Failure signatures:
  - Very low MSV counts across all images -> model may rely on spurious features or the splitting method is too coarse
  - MSV count uncorrelated with accuracy -> either weak correlation in this domain or bugs in algorithm
  - High variance in MSV count across similar images -> instability in splitting or prediction

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run MSV estimator on a simple CNN (e.g., ResNet-18) with β=8 and SLIC on a small image set; verify MSV count matches expected minimal sufficient regions.
  2. Compare MSV counts between a well-generalizing model and an overfit model on the same training set; check if overfit model has fewer MSVs.
  3. Evaluate MSV-based model selection by ranking two models on unlabeled data and checking if ranking matches validation accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do minimal sufficient views (MSVs) vary across different architectures and datasets, and what underlying factors influence these variations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the relationship between MSVs and model performance across various architectures and datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how MSVs differ based on architecture type, dataset characteristics, or training procedures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to systematically compare MSVs across different model architectures (e.g., convolutional, transformer-based) and datasets (e.g., ImageNet, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-C) would provide insights into the factors influencing MSV variations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the number of MSVs be used as a reliable indicator of model robustness to adversarial attacks or data corruption?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions evaluating MSVs on the ImageNet-C dataset, which includes corrupted images, suggesting a potential link between MSVs and robustness.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explicitly explore the relationship between MSVs and model robustness to adversarial attacks or data corruption.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating MSVs on adversarially attacked images and comparing them to clean images, as well as analyzing the correlation between MSVs and model performance on corrupted datasets, would provide evidence for the relationship between MSVs and robustness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do MSVs relate to other interpretability methods, such as saliency maps or counterfactual explanations, and can they be combined to provide a more comprehensive understanding of model predictions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions comparing MSVs to other interpretability methods like LIME, Integrated Gradients, and GradCAM, highlighting the potential for a multi-view perspective.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between MSVs and other interpretability methods or explore potential synergies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to compare MSVs with other interpretability methods on the same images and analyzing their agreement or disagreement would provide insights into their complementary nature. Additionally, exploring ways to combine MSVs with other methods to provide a more comprehensive understanding of model predictions would be valuable.

## Limitations

- The correlation between MSV count and accuracy may not hold for out-of-distribution data, limiting the reliability of unlabeled model selection.
- The theoretical grounding of MSVs in multi-view learning theory is weak, as no direct citations or proofs are provided.
- The MSV framework assumes that disjoint image regions discovered by the greedy algorithm truly represent independent pieces of evidence, which is not explicitly validated.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The experimental results showing correlation between MSV count and accuracy on standard datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100).
- Medium confidence: The claim that MSVs provide a label-free model selection metric, as this is supported by internal experiments but lacks external validation.
- Low confidence: The theoretical grounding of MSVs in multi-view learning theory, as no direct citations or proofs are provided.

## Next Checks

1. Test MSV correlation on a held-out dataset with known spurious correlations to verify if MSV count reflects true generalization rather than memorization.
2. Compare MSV-based model selection with validation-accuracy-based selection on a domain-shifted dataset to assess robustness.
3. Implement MSVs using a different splitting method (e.g., Voronoi) and check if results are consistent, validating the method's insensitivity to partitioning choices.
