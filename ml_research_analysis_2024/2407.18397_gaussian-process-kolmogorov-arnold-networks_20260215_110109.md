# Gaussian Process Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.18397
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18397
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: 98.5% MNIST accuracy with 80k parameters vs. 1.5M for SOTA

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GP-KAN, a probabilistic extension to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks that replaces non-linear neurons with Gaussian Processes. The key innovation is a fully analytical method for propagating uncertainty through multiple GP layers by computing the function inner product of GP function samples with input distributions. This approach maintains Gaussian-distributed outputs at each layer, enabling exact analytical uncertainty propagation without variational approximations. When tested on MNIST, GP-KAN achieved 98.5% accuracy with only 80,000 parameters, outperforming state-of-the-art models using 1.5 million parameters while providing inherent uncertainty estimates.

## Method Summary
GP-KAN replaces the B-spline neurons in standard KANs with Gaussian Process neurons that maintain analytical mean and variance propagation. Each GP neuron learns a univariate function component, and multiple neurons are summed to form fully-connected GP layers. The model uses inducing points for computational efficiency and employs a bijective normalization step to bound mean and variance while avoiding exploding gradients. Training occurs directly on the log-likelihood objective function, with uncertainty estimates emerging naturally from the GP framework. The architecture can be extended to convolutional layers using im2col/col2im transformations.

## Key Results
- 98.5% test accuracy on MNIST with only 80,000 parameters
- Outperforms state-of-the-art models using 1.5 million parameters
- Provides inherent uncertainty quantification without variational approximations
- Successfully learns exact univariate function components on synthetic datasets
- Demonstrates robust non-linear modeling with few parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The inner product of a GP function sample with an input distribution preserves Gaussian output distributions analytically. By computing ⟨f, p(x)⟩ where f is a GP function sample and p(x) is a Gaussian input distribution, the result is analytically shown to be Gaussian with closed-form mean and variance expressions. Core assumption: The input distribution remains Gaussian throughout the network layers.

### Mechanism 2
GP-KAN achieves uncertainty propagation without variational approximations by maintaining Gaussian distributions throughout. Each layer's output is Gaussian-distributed, allowing exact analytical uncertainty propagation to subsequent layers without needing Monte Carlo estimation or variational lower bounds. Core assumption: The set of Gaussian random variables is closed under addition, which is the only multivariate operation in KANs.

### Mechanism 3
GP neurons learn exact univariate function components of multivariate functions, enabling interpretability. Each GP neuron learns a univariate function that, when composed with other neurons, reconstructs the multivariate function, similar to the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Core assumption: Complex multivariate functions can be decomposed into univariate functions connected by addition.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian Process fundamentals including mean functions, covariance functions, and predictive posterior
  - Why needed: Understanding how GPs work is essential for implementing GP neurons and understanding their uncertainty propagation properties
  - Quick check: What are the components needed to fully specify a Gaussian Process, and how does conditioning on data affect predictions?

- Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and its implications for neural network design
  - Why needed: The theoretical foundation for why KANs can represent any multivariate function using univariate functions and addition
  - Quick check: How does the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem justify using univariate functions as network building blocks?

- Concept: Uncertainty quantification in deep learning and why analytical methods are preferable to approximations
  - Why needed: Understanding the motivation for GP-KAN's analytical uncertainty propagation versus traditional variational methods
  - Quick check: What are the limitations of variational methods for uncertainty propagation in deep GP models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → GP neuron layers → activation/normalization layers → output layer → loss computation → backpropagation
- Critical path: Data flows through GP neurons with analytical mean/variance propagation, undergoes normalization to maintain stability, and produces probabilistic outputs with uncertainty estimates
- Design tradeoffs: GP neurons provide uncertainty quantification but may be computationally expensive; maintaining Gaussian distributions simplifies analysis but restricts activation function choices
- Failure signatures: Non-Gaussian outputs indicating broken uncertainty propagation; poor training performance suggesting insufficient inducing points or inappropriate covariance function
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a single GP neuron and verify analytical mean/variance against Monte Carlo estimates
  2. Build a simple 2-layer GP-KAN and test on a synthetic function with known decomposition
  3. Compare GP-KAN with standard KAN on MNIST using similar parameter counts to validate efficiency claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the theoretical upper bound on the number of inducing points needed in GP-KAN to achieve near-optimal performance on high-dimensional datasets? The paper mentions GPs' curse of dimensionality and the need for large (h, z) to map the input space, but does not provide systematic analysis of how inducing point count scales with input dimensionality.

### Open Question 2
How does GP-KAN's uncertainty quantification capability compare to other probabilistic deep learning methods like MC Dropout or Deep Ensembles in terms of calibration and robustness to out-of-distribution data? The paper only evaluates performance on in-distribution MNIST data without comparing uncertainty estimates to other methods.

### Open Question 3
What is the theoretical justification for the bijective mapping used in the normalization step, and are there alternative mappings that could provide better performance or stability? The paper presents this as a design choice without exploring alternatives or providing rigorous theoretical justification.

## Limitations

- Computational scalability concerns for large-scale applications due to full covariance matrix propagation
- Kernel function restrictions to analytically tractable forms limit model flexibility
- Unclear whether efficiency gains hold across diverse problem domains beyond MNIST

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The analytical derivation of Gaussian output distributions from GP function inner products with Gaussian inputs appears mathematically sound and is well-supported by the theoretical framework presented.

**Medium Confidence**: The 98.5% MNIST accuracy claim with 80k parameters is supported by experimental results, though independent reproduction would strengthen this claim. The comparison to state-of-the-art models lacks detailed architectural specifications for proper benchmarking.

**Medium Confidence**: The interpretability claims regarding GP neurons learning exact univariate function components are demonstrated on synthetic functions but would benefit from additional validation on real-world datasets with known underlying structures.

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Test**: Evaluate GP-KAN performance and training time on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets to assess computational scalability beyond MNIST. Measure memory usage and training time per epoch as network depth increases.

2. **Kernel Function Ablation**: Systematically compare performance using different analytically tractable kernels (e.g., squared exponential vs. Matérn) to quantify the impact of kernel choice restrictions on model accuracy and uncertainty quality.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Test GP-KAN on diverse regression tasks with known functional forms (e.g., physics-based simulations) to validate the interpretability claims and assess whether the univariate function decomposition generalizes beyond synthetic examples.
