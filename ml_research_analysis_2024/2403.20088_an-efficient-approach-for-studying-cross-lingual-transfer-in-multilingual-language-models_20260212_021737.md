# An Efficient Approach for Studying Cross-Lingual Transfer in Multilingual Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.20088
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20088
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This paper proposes an efficient method to study cross-lingual transfer in multilingual language models by disentangling downstream tasks from language using dedicated adapter units.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an efficient approach to study cross-lingual transfer in multilingual language models by disentangling downstream tasks from language using dedicated adapter units. The method involves training a task adapter once for a downstream task, performing minimal unsupervised finetuning on a transfer language, and comparing performance on a target language with and without the finetuning. This allows efficient assessment of how transfer languages affect target languages. The study reveals that no transfer language is universally beneficial, but languages unseen during pre-training consistently benefit from transfer from almost any language. The approach also enables quantification of negative interference from language interactions.

## Method Summary
The method uses adapter modules to disentangle task and language representations. A task adapter is trained once on multilingual data for a given task. Language effects are studied by applying different language adapters or performing short unsupervised finetuning steps on transfer languages without retraining the task adapter. The approach compares target language performance with and without transfer language finetuning to assess transfer effects. Adapter fusion is used to quantify negative interference from language interactions by comparing multilingual and monolingual adapter combinations.

## Key Results
- No single transfer language is universally beneficial for all target languages
- Languages unseen during pre-training consistently benefit from transfer from almost any language
- The method efficiently quantifies negative interference from language interactions
- Promising transfer-target language configurations can be identified through this approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adapter modules allow task and language representations to be disentangled, enabling isolated study of each effect.
- Mechanism: Task adapters are trained once on multilingual data for a given task. Language effects are then studied by applying different language adapters or short finetuning steps without re-training the task adapter.
- Core assumption: Adapter composition preserves task performance while allowing independent modification of language representations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "our approach disentangles downstream tasks from language, using dedicated adapter units"; [section] "these adapters are also composable: one can stack an independently trained language adapter and task adapter"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Short-step language model finetuning isolates the effect of a single transfer language without full retraining.
- Mechanism: Masked language modeling is applied for only 1, 10, or 100 steps on a single transfer language. This biases language representations minimally while retaining task performance from the task adapter.
- Core assumption: Minimal finetuning steps change only language-specific aspects of the model without altering learned task representations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We then perform unsupervised finetuning on unannotated transfer language data for a minimal number of steps"; [section] "comparing the performance of the model on the target language with and without the previous step results in a direct assessment of the effect of the transfer language"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adapter fusion efficiently quantifies negative interference from language interactions.
- Mechanism: Multiple language adapters are fused together using adapter-fusion tuning. Performance differences between multilingual and monolingual adapter combinations quantify interference.
- Core assumption: Differences in task performance between fused and single-language adapters reflect interference from language interactions.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We additionally use our modular approach to quantify negative interference efficiently"; [section] "we compare different combinations of language adapters and compute the interference occurring due to increased interactions"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adapter modules and adapter fusion
  - Why needed here: Understanding how lightweight adapter modules can be stacked or fused is essential to grasp the paper's modular approach to studying cross-lingual transfer.
  - Quick check question: What is the key advantage of using adapter modules instead of full model finetuning for studying language effects?

- Concept: Catastrophic forgetting
  - Why needed here: The paper investigates how minimal language finetuning can bias representations without losing task knowledge, directly relating to catastrophic forgetting.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper limit language finetuning to a minimal number of steps?

- Concept: Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer
  - Why needed here: The paper's core method evaluates transfer performance without task-specific target language data, which is the definition of zero-shot transfer.
  - Quick check question: How does the paper's approach differ from standard zero-shot cross-lingual transfer evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base multilingual model (e.g., mBERT) → Task adapter (trained once per task) → Language adapters or finetuned base model → Evaluation on target language
- Critical path: Task adapter training → Base model finetuning or language adapter training → Adapter stacking/fusion → Evaluation and comparison
- Design tradeoffs: Adapter-based approach is efficient but may miss interactions that full model finetuning would capture. Minimal finetuning steps reduce computational cost but may not fully capture language effects.
- Failure signatures: Performance degradation when stacking adapters indicates interference. No performance difference between finetuned and base models suggests the transfer language has no effect.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a task adapter on multilingual NER data and evaluate zero-shot performance on target languages.
  2. Fine-tune the base model on one transfer language for 10 steps and evaluate on the same task and target languages with and without the task adapter.
  3. Train language adapters for several languages, fuse them in pairs, stack with the task adapter, and evaluate to measure interference.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of base model (e.g., mBERT vs XLM-R) affect the cross-lingual transfer performance for different task types (e.g., token-level vs sentence-level tasks)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that XLM-R provides superior performance for NLI tasks compared to mBERT, while both models show similar patterns for token-level tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares mBERT and XLM-R for a limited set of tasks and languages. The underlying reasons for the differences in performance across task types are not fully explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive experiments comparing multiple base models (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R, mT5) across a wider range of tasks (including tasks not covered in the paper) and languages would provide insights into the factors influencing the choice of base model for different scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the patterns of positive transfer change when using languages unseen during pre-training as transfer languages for target languages seen during pre-training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper finds that transferring from unseen languages to unseen languages generally helps, but transferring from unseen languages to seen languages does not provide substantial utility.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the nuances of this phenomenon, such as the impact of language family, typology, or script similarity on the transfer performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of transfer performance for various combinations of seen and unseen languages, considering factors like language family, typology, and script similarity, would shed light on the underlying mechanisms and potential strategies for leveraging unseen languages in cross-lingual transfer.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the number of training steps for the transfer language finetuning affect the cross-lingual transfer performance, especially for languages with different resource levels (e.g., low-resource vs high-resource languages)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper investigates the effect of different training steps (1, 10, 100, 1000) and finds that most languages benefit from minimal training steps, while some unseen languages show sustained improvement with longer training.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between training steps, resource levels, and transfer performance. It is unclear how to determine the optimal number of training steps for different scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments systematically varying the number of training steps for different transfer languages and target languages, while considering their resource levels, would help identify the factors influencing the optimal training duration and potential strategies for efficient adaptation.

## Limitations

- Dataset availability and reproducibility is uncertain due to incomplete specification of data sources and preprocessing steps.
- Adapter fusion methodology lacks complete specification, particularly regarding the exact computational procedure for quantifying negative interference.
- Generalization across architectures is uncertain as the approach is primarily validated on mBERT only.

## Confidence

- High confidence in the core methodology: The approach of using adapter modules to disentangle task and language effects is well-established in the literature.
- Medium confidence in transfer score interpretation: While the computation method is clear, it's uncertain whether minimal finetuning steps capture all relevant language effects.
- Low confidence in negative interference quantification: The paper provides limited detail on how interference scores are derived from fused adapter performance.

## Next Checks

1. Verify adapter stacking integrity by testing whether stacking a task adapter trained on one language combination with language adapters from different languages maintains task performance.

2. Apply the exact methodology to a different multilingual model (e.g., XLM-R) using the same datasets and transfer languages to test generalization beyond mBERT.

3. Systematically vary adapter fusion parameters (number of adapters fused, fusion training steps, regularization) to determine how sensitive negative interference measurements are to methodological choices.
