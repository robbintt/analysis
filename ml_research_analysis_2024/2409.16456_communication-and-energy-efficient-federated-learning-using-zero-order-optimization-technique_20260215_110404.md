  To tackle this issue, the authors propose a zero-order (ZO) optimization method,
  DZOFL, where each device sends only a quantized scalar per iteration instead of

# Communication and Energy Efficient Federated Learning using Zero-Order Optimization Technique

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16456
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16456
- Authors: Elissa Mhanna; Mohamad Assaad

- Key outcome: DZOFL achieves superior communication efficiency and energy consumption in federated learning by using zero-order optimization with quantized scalar exchanges

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the communication bottleneck in federated learning (FL) where high-dimensional gradient exchanges between devices and servers lead to significant energy consumption and communication overhead. The authors propose DZOFL, a zero-order optimization method that reduces each device's communication to a single quantized scalar per iteration instead of full gradient vectors. The method incorporates quantization effects and packet dropping due to wireless errors, with theoretical convergence guarantees in non-convex settings. Numerical results on binary image classification demonstrate superior performance in communication efficiency and energy consumption compared to standard gradient-based FL methods.

## Method Summary
The DZOFL method employs zero-order optimization where each device computes a quantized scalar based on the difference of two function evaluations rather than sending full gradients. The server aggregates these scalars and broadcasts them back to devices. This approach fundamentally changes the communication pattern from high-dimensional gradient exchanges to scalar transmissions, significantly reducing bandwidth requirements. The method incorporates practical considerations like quantization noise and wireless packet loss, with theoretical analysis proving convergence in non-convex optimization settings.

## Key Results
- DZOFL achieves superior communication overhead compared to standard gradient-based FL methods
- Energy consumption is reduced through minimal scalar exchanges instead of full gradient transmissions
- Competitive convergence time maintained while significantly improving communication efficiency
- Theoretical convergence guarantees established for non-convex optimization problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by replacing gradient-based updates with function evaluation differences, enabling each device to communicate only a single scalar value per iteration. This scalar captures essential optimization information while dramatically reducing communication overhead. The server aggregates these scalars to compute model updates, maintaining learning effectiveness while minimizing bandwidth usage.

## Foundational Learning
- **Zero-order optimization**: Needed to understand how function evaluations can replace gradients; quick check: can the method work without gradient access?
- **Federated learning architecture**: Essential for grasping device-server communication patterns; quick check: how does this differ from centralized learning?
- **Quantization effects**: Critical for understanding communication efficiency trade-offs; quick check: what accuracy loss occurs at different quantization levels?
- **Wireless packet dropping**: Important for realistic deployment scenarios; quick check: how does the method handle varying network reliability?
- **Non-convex optimization**: Foundation for understanding convergence guarantees; quick check: does the method work for convex problems too?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Devices -> Function Evaluations -> Scalar Quantization -> Server Aggregation -> Broadcast -> Devices

**Critical Path**: Device computes two function values → calculates difference → quantizes to scalar → sends to server → server aggregates → broadcasts aggregated scalar → devices update local models

**Design Tradeoffs**: Communication efficiency vs. computational overhead on devices (multiple function evaluations), quantization precision vs. bandwidth savings, convergence speed vs. communication frequency

**Failure Signatures**: Poor convergence due to excessive quantization noise, increased computational load overwhelming device resources, network congestion from frequent scalar transmissions

**First Experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison with standard FedAvg on same task, 2) Communication overhead measurement under varying network conditions, 3) Energy consumption profiling on resource-constrained devices

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Multiple function evaluations per iteration may offset communication savings on resource-constrained devices
- Assumes smooth, non-convex loss functions without addressing non-smooth objectives common in practice
- Quantization scheme's impact on convergence in heterogeneous device settings not fully explored

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Theoretical convergence analysis in non-convex settings, basic communication efficiency claims
- **Medium Confidence**: Energy consumption comparisons, numerical results on binary image classification task
- **Medium Confidence**: Packet dropping resilience claims require more extensive validation

## Next Checks
1. Measure actual wall-clock time and energy consumption on resource-constrained devices to verify net efficiency gains when accounting for additional function evaluations
2. Evaluate DZOFL performance across devices with varying computational capabilities and communication qualities
3. Test the method on multi-class classification tasks and larger datasets to validate scalability beyond binary image classification
