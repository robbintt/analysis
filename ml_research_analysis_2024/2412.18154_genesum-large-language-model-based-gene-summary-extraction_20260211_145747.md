core_contribution: This paper introduces GeneSUM, a two-stage automated gene summary
  extraction framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address the challenge
  of efficiently navigating and synthesizing the rapidly expanding biomedical literature
  on gene functions. The first stage retrieves and filters relevant gene literature
  using signature term filtering and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation expansion, while
  the second stage fine-tunes an LLM (Gemma-7B) to generate concise gene summaries.

# GeneSUM: Large Language Model-based Gene Summary Extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.18154
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18154
- Reference count: 36
- GeneSUM achieves ROUGE-2 score of 0.1856, outperforming baselines by at least fourfold

## Executive Summary
GeneSUM is a two-stage automated framework for gene summary extraction that leverages large language models to address the challenge of efficiently navigating the rapidly expanding biomedical literature on gene functions. The system combines signature term filtering and Gene Ontology annotation expansion for literature retrieval with fine-tuned LLM summarization (Gemma-7B) to generate concise gene summaries. Experimental results on 8,887 human genes demonstrate significant improvements in ROUGE metrics compared to baselines, while maintaining traceability to source literature to address LLM hallucination concerns.

## Method Summary
GeneSUM employs a two-stage approach: first, it retrieves and filters relevant gene literature using signature term filtering combined with Gene Ontology annotation expansion to ensure comprehensive coverage; second, it fine-tunes the Gemma-7B LLM on the filtered literature to generate concise gene summaries. The framework is specifically designed to handle the growing volume of biomedical literature by automating the extraction of key functional information about genes from multiple sources.

## Key Results
- ROUGE-1 score of 0.3874, ROUGE-2 score of 0.1856, and ROUGE-L score of 0.3681
- Outperforms baselines by at least fourfold in ROUGE-2 metrics
- Generated summaries closely align with expert-written descriptions
- Maintains traceability to source literature passages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GeneSUM's effectiveness stems from its two-stage approach that combines precise literature retrieval with targeted LLM fine-tuning. The signature term filtering ensures only highly relevant literature is selected, while GO annotation expansion captures broader contextual information about gene functions. Fine-tuning Gemma-7B specifically on gene-related literature allows the model to develop specialized knowledge for biomedical summarization tasks, producing more accurate and relevant summaries than general-purpose LLMs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gene Ontology (GO) annotations**: Standardized vocabulary for gene function descriptions; needed for comprehensive literature expansion; quick check: verify GO terms cover functional aspects of target genes
- **ROUGE metrics**: Evaluation metrics comparing generated summaries to reference summaries; needed for quantitative assessment; quick check: ensure ROUGE scores are calculated correctly with proper tokenization
- **LLM fine-tuning**: Process of adapting pre-trained models to specific domains; needed for specialized gene summarization; quick check: validate fine-tuning dataset quality and balance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Literature Retrieval -> Literature Filtering -> Gemma-7B Fine-tuning -> Summary Generation

**Critical Path**: Signature Term Filtering → GO Annotation Expansion → Fine-tuning Dataset Creation → Gemma-7B Summary Generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system prioritizes precision over recall in literature retrieval to minimize noise in the fine-tuning process, accepting potential coverage gaps for improved summary quality. Uses Gemma-7B for computational efficiency while maintaining sufficient capacity for biomedical text.

**Failure Signatures**: Low ROUGE scores indicate either poor literature retrieval or inadequate fine-tuning; summary hallucinations suggest insufficient source material or model capacity limitations; inconsistent traceability points to problems in the linking mechanism between summaries and source passages.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test literature retrieval precision by manually evaluating top-10 results for randomly selected genes
2. Evaluate Gemma-7B fine-tuning convergence by monitoring loss curves during training
3. Assess traceability by verifying source links for a sample of generated summaries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results only validated on human genes, limiting generalizability to other organisms
- Sparse methodology details for Gemma-7B fine-tuning and traceability implementation
- Case studies are qualitative and limited in scope, making comprehensive quality assessment difficult

## Confidence
- ROUGE score improvements: Medium
- Summary quality and accuracy: Medium
- Traceability and hallucination mitigation: Low
- Generalizability to non-human genes: Low
- Methodology robustness: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests) on ROUGE score improvements to validate the reported 4x increase in ROUGE-2 is not due to chance.

2. Evaluate GeneSUM on gene summary generation for non-human organisms (e.g., model organisms like mice or fruit flies) to assess generalizability beyond human genes.

3. Implement a systematic evaluation of the traceability feature by randomly sampling generated summaries and verifying the accuracy and relevance of cited source literature passages.
