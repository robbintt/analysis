# Meta-experiments: Improving experimentation through experimentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.16629
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16629
- Reference count: 0
- Increased proportion of sufficiently powered experiments by 10% with statistical significance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces meta-experiments as a method to improve the experimentation process itself through A/B testing. The approach involves running experiments on experiments to identify and address common pain points like insufficient statistical power. By using experiments as randomization units and providing targeted interventions (alerts with one-click fixes), the team increased the proportion of sufficiently powered experiments by 10% with statistical significance. The method allows for causal attribution of improvements and reliable impact quantification while providing dogfooding benefits for experimentation teams.

## Method Summary
The meta-experiment used experiments as the randomization unit, targeting underpowered experiments identified at 1-week runtime. The treatment group received alerts explaining power issues with a one-click option to adjust experiment parameters. The control group received no intervention. Key metrics tracked included the proportion of experiments achieving sufficient power, click-through rates on alerts (40%), and changes to experiment settings (15% increase). The experiment ran for several months with 100-400 experiments to achieve adequate sample size despite the inherent constraints of low experiment volume.

## Key Results
- Proportion of sufficiently powered experiments increased by 10% (p=0.0045)
- 40% of alerted experimenters clicked the provided link
- 15% more experimenters changed experiment settings (p=0.0008)
- No significant change in shipment rates of experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Using experiments as randomization units enables direct measurement of whether power interventions improve individual experiment outcomes.
- Mechanism: By randomizing at the experiment level rather than the experimenter level, the success metric (sufficient power) can be measured per experiment, avoiding the complexity of aggregating multiple experiments per experimenter.
- Core assumption: Experiment outcomes are independent when randomization occurs at the experiment level.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "using experiments as randomization units and measuring whether sufficient power is achieved"
  - [section] "we chose experiments as the randomization unit, so that our success metric can be sufficient power for each sample experiment"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for experiment-level randomization effectiveness
- Break condition: If experimenters run many experiments simultaneously, variant spillover occurs, violating independence assumptions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Targeting experiments with known power problems (underpowered at 1 week) increases the detectable effect size of interventions.
- Mechanism: By focusing only on experiments that are already underpowered, the intervention addresses a specific, measurable pain point, making it easier to observe improvements in power metrics.
- Core assumption: The proportion of underpowered experiments is stable enough to provide consistent sample size across meta-experiments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the team increased the proportion of sufficiently powered experiments by 10% with statistical significance"
  - [section] "we only included samples which had a problem and which would receive the treatment if in variant"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus support for targeting underpowered experiments specifically
- Break condition: If the underlying causes of underpowered experiments change (e.g., new experiment types), the intervention effect may diminish.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Providing one-click power adjustment reduces friction, increasing adoption of power improvements.
- Mechanism: The alert includes a direct link to adjust experiment parameters, converting awareness into action by removing the manual calculation barrier.
- Core assumption: The primary barrier to sufficient power is not understanding but the practical difficulty of calculations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "40% of alerted experimenters clicked the link, and 15% more changed experiment settings"
  - [section] "investigation showed two main reasons: lack of understanding of power and practical difficulty in doing power calculations correctly"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus support for one-click intervention effectiveness
- Break condition: If experimenters have complex power requirements beyond the one-click solution, adoption may plateau.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Statistical power and minimum detectable effect
  - Why needed here: Understanding power is essential to design experiments that can detect meaningful effects, which is the core problem being addressed
  - Quick check question: If an experiment has 80% power to detect an effect of size 0.5, what is the minimum detectable effect?

- Concept: Randomization unit selection tradeoffs
  - Why needed here: Choosing between experiment-level and experimenter-level randomization affects bias, complexity, and interpretability of results
  - Quick check question: What are the main risks of using experimenters as the randomization unit when experimenters run multiple experiments?

- Concept: Sequential testing and covariate adjustment
  - Why needed here: These methods can increase power when sample sizes are limited, as is the case with meta-experiments
  - Quick check question: How does sequential testing help when the minimum detectable effect is unknown?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Experiment creation system -> Power calculation engine -> Alert delivery system -> Experiment parameter adjustment UI
- Critical path: Power calculation -> Underpowered detection -> Alert generation -> User action -> Power re-evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Experiment-level randomization provides cleaner metrics but risks spillover; longer runtimes increase sample size but slow iteration
- Failure signatures: Low click-through rates suggest poor alert relevance; no power improvement despite clicks suggests intervention inadequacy
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run a short meta-experiment (1-2 months) with a simple alert-only intervention to establish baseline engagement
  2. Add the one-click parameter adjustment to measure impact on power improvements
  3. Test different alert timing (1 week vs 2 weeks) to optimize for detection without being too early

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the performance of meta-experiments compare to traditional qualitative feedback methods for experimentation teams?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper contrasts meta-experiments with qualitative feedback from leadership and experimenters, noting that traditional approaches make it difficult to causally attribute improvements to interventions and quantify impact reliably
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide direct comparative data or analysis between meta-experiments and traditional qualitative feedback methods
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparison studies showing the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of meta-experiments versus traditional qualitative feedback approaches for experimentation teams

## Limitations

- Sample size constraints limit the feasibility of meta-experiments for organizations running fewer experiments
- The 10% improvement in sufficient power, while statistically significant, represents a modest absolute gain
- Long-term sustainability of power improvements and behavior change is unknown

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The basic mechanism of using experiments as randomization units and measuring power improvements is well-established and the results are statistically robust (p-values provided for key metrics).
- **Medium Confidence**: The generalizability of the 40% click-through and 15% setting change rates across different organizational contexts and experiment types.
- **Low Confidence**: The long-term sustainability of power improvements and whether the intervention creates lasting behavior change beyond the immediate meta-experiment period.

## Next Checks

1. **Sample Size Sensitivity Analysis**: Re-run the meta-experiment with different power thresholds and sample size requirements to determine the minimum viable scale for detecting meaningful improvements.
2. **Spillover Effect Quantification**: Measure whether experimenters running multiple experiments experience any cross-contamination between treatment groups, potentially violating independence assumptions.
3. **Longitudinal Power Tracking**: Monitor the same cohort of experiments for 6-12 months post-intervention to assess whether power improvements persist or decay over time.
