# Efficient Performance Tracking: Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Construction of Scientific Leaderboards

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2409.12656
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12656
- **Reference count**: 36
- **Primary result**: LLM-based framework with RAG achieves high leaderboard coverage for TDMR extraction and normalization, though result extraction remains challenging

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of automated scientific leaderboard construction amid the exponential growth of research publications. It introduces SCILEAD, a manually curated dataset containing 27 leaderboards from 43 NLP papers, designed to overcome limitations of existing datasets such as incomplete coverage and inconsistent TDM entity normalization. The authors propose an LLM-based framework employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation to extract, normalize, and rank task-dataset-metric-result (TDMR) tuples from publications. Three experimental settings simulate real-world scenarios: fully defined, partially defined, or undefined TDM triples. Results show that GPT-4 excels at extracting and normalizing TDM triples, achieving high leaderboard coverage, though result extraction remains challenging. The framework demonstrates robustness and generalizability across domains, offering a practical solution for automatic leaderboard construction. Limitations include dataset size and domain/language bias, with future work suggested to address these.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework employs a three-stage pipeline for automated leaderboard construction. First, it uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with an LLM to extract task-dataset-metric-result (TDMR) tuples from scientific papers. Second, it normalizes the extracted TDM triples to a pre-defined taxonomy or dynamically creates new leaderboards. Third, it ranks papers by their corresponding performance to construct leaderboards. The framework is evaluated using a manually curated SCILEAD dataset containing 27 leaderboards derived from 43 NLP papers, with three experimental settings that simulate real-world scenarios where TDM triples are fully defined, partially defined, or undefined during leaderboard construction.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 achieves high leaderboard coverage in TDMR extraction and normalization across all three experimental settings
- Result extraction remains the most challenging aspect, with significantly lower performance compared to task, dataset, and metric extraction
- The framework demonstrates robustness and generalizability across different normalization settings and leaderboard construction scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The LLM-based framework achieves high leaderboard coverage because it combines TDMR extraction, normalization, and ranking into a single pipeline.
- Mechanism: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is used to extract TDMR tuples from scientific papers, then normalization maps these tuples to existing or new leaderboards, and finally ranking sorts results to construct the leaderboards.
- Core assumption: The LLM can accurately extract TDMR tuples from scientific papers and correctly normalize them to pre-defined or dynamically created TDM taxonomies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "To address these diverse settings, we develop a comprehensive LLM-based framework for constructing leaderboards."
  - [section]: "We propose a three-stage framework for constructing leaderboards, harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting to streamline the process: (i) extracting task, dataset, metric and result (TDMR) tuples from individual papers; (ii) normalizing extracted TDM triples to the existing pre-defined TDM triple taxonomy or creating new leaderboards; and (iii) ranking papers by their corresponding performance to construct leaderboards."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework's performance is robust across different normalization settings (fully defined, partially defined, or undefined TDM triples) because it simulates real-world scenarios.
- Mechanism: The framework proposes three experimental settings that mimic real-world scenarios where TDM triples are fully defined, partially defined, or undefined during leaderboard construction. This allows the framework to handle a variety of leaderboard construction tasks.
- Core assumption: The framework can accurately handle different levels of TDM triple definition and still produce high-quality leaderboards.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Building on this dataset, we propose three experimental settings that simulate real-world scenarios where TDM triples are fully defined, partially defined, or undefined during leaderboard construction."
  - [section]: "In particular, the normalization module maps these tuples to a pre-defined TDM taxonomy or dynamically updates the taxonomy to integrate new TDM entities. In the second step, we design three experimental settings that mimic diverse real-world scenarios where we need to update existing leaderboards or create new ones from scratch."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework can effectively reconstruct scientific leaderboards in real-world scenarios because it uses a manually curated dataset (SCILEAD) with comprehensive annotations.
- Mechanism: SCILEAD is a manually curated Scientific Leaderboard dataset that includes 27 leaderboards derived from 43 NLP papers. It provides complete and accurate TDMR annotations, which are used to evaluate the framework's performance.
- Core assumption: The SCILEAD dataset accurately represents real-world leaderboard construction scenarios and provides a reliable benchmark for evaluating the framework's performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In this work, we present SCILEAD, a manually-curated Scientific Leaderboard dataset that overcomes the aforementioned problems."
  - [section]: "To fulfill these requirements, we created SCILEAD, a new manually-curated Scientific Leaderboard dataset. We first selected leaderboards that have a large number of publications from NLP-progress. We downloaded PDFs of the relevant publications from arXiv or corresponding venues. We then manually extracted a complete set of TDMR tuples from these publications (Coverage), in contrast to previous datasets."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: RAG is used to extract TDMR tuples from scientific papers by combining an LLM with a knowledge-based retrieval system. This allows the framework to efficiently process long documents and extract relevant information.
  - Quick check question: How does RAG improve the accuracy of TDMR extraction compared to using an LLM alone?

- Concept: TDM Triple Normalization
  - Why needed here: Normalization is essential for comparing results from different papers that use different terminology to refer to the same entity. This ensures that the framework can accurately construct leaderboards by mapping extracted TDMR tuples to existing or new leaderboards.
  - Quick check question: What are the challenges of TDM triple normalization, and how does the framework address them?

- Concept: Leaderboard Construction and Ranking
  - Why needed here: Leaderboard construction involves aggregating and ranking TDMR tuples from different papers under the corresponding leaderboards defined by TDM triples. This allows the framework to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research in a specific domain.
  - Quick check question: How does the framework handle the ranking of papers when there are multiple TDMR tuples from the same paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PDF papers → Text chunking → Vector database → TDMR extraction (RAG) → TDM normalization → Leaderboard ranking → Constructed leaderboards
- Critical path: TDMR Extraction → Normalization → Leaderboard Construction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using RAG for TDMR extraction improves accuracy but increases computational complexity
  - Normalizing to existing leaderboards ensures comparability but may miss newly introduced benchmarks
  - Ranking papers based on their best-reported results provides a fair comparison but may not capture the full performance landscape
- Failure signatures:
  - Low leaderboard recall: The framework fails to identify relevant leaderboards for the extracted TDMR tuples
  - Low paper coverage: The framework fails to assign papers to the correct leaderboards
  - Low result coverage: The framework fails to extract accurate result values from the papers
  - Poor average overlap: The framework's constructed leaderboards have low similarity to the gold leaderboards
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate TDMR extraction accuracy on a small subset of papers using exact tuple match metrics
  2. Test normalization accuracy by mapping extracted TDM triples to existing leaderboards and measuring the success rate
  3. Assess leaderboard construction performance by comparing the framework's constructed leaderboards to gold leaderboards using paper and result coverage metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can LLM-based leaderboard construction systems effectively extract and normalize result values across diverse metrics and scales?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that extracting result values is the most challenging aspect for LLMs, with performance dropping significantly compared to extracting task, dataset, and metric information. The authors note that result values vary in format and scale, making universal normalization difficult.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies result extraction as a key bottleneck but does not provide a comprehensive solution for handling the diversity of metric scales and formats. Current methods focus on percentage-like metrics but lack a universal approach for metrics like perplexity or arbitrary scales.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating a universal normalization method that can handle diverse metric scales and formats, or demonstrating improved result extraction accuracy across a wide range of metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can few-shot prompting strategies be optimized to improve LLM performance in leaderboard construction tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explore few-shot prompting but find it slightly underperforms zero-shot prompting for exact tuple match (ETM) and individual item match (IIM) tasks. They suggest that better strategies for selecting and ordering few-shot examples could enhance performance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper tests few-shot prompting, it does not explore advanced strategies for example selection or ordering, leaving potential performance gains untapped.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing different few-shot prompting strategies, such as dynamic example selection or curriculum-based ordering, to determine their impact on leaderboard construction accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can leaderboard construction frameworks be extended to handle non-English scientific publications and diverse research domains?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge that their dataset is predominantly English and focused on machine learning, limiting generalizability. They suggest expanding the framework to other languages and domains as a promising direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current framework is not designed to handle multilingual or cross-domain publications, and the paper does not provide evidence of its effectiveness in such scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the framework on non-English datasets or publications from diverse scientific domains, and demonstrating its ability to normalize and construct leaderboards across these contexts.

## Limitations

- The SCILEAD dataset contains only 43 papers and 27 leaderboards, limiting generalizability to broader scientific domains
- Performance drops significantly in scenarios with undefined TDM triples, indicating dependence on existing taxonomy knowledge
- The framework's practical utility for continuous leaderboard updates remains unproven, as evaluation relies on simulation experiments

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The framework's ability to extract TDMR tuples and normalize them to existing leaderboards is well-supported by quantitative metrics (ETM, IIM scores) across multiple experimental settings. The three-stage pipeline architecture is clearly specified and implemented.

**Medium Confidence**: Claims about generalizability across domains and real-world applicability are supported by results but limited by the narrow scope of the SCILEAD dataset (primarily NLP papers from NLP-progress). The framework's performance in undefined TDM triple scenarios shows promise but requires further validation.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that the framework can effectively reconstruct scientific leaderboards in "real-world scenarios" is primarily supported by simulation experiments rather than actual deployment in production environments. The practical utility for continuous leaderboard updates remains unproven.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Generalization Test**: Apply the framework to scientific papers from non-NLP domains (e.g., computational biology, materials science) to assess cross-domain performance and identify domain-specific challenges in TDMR extraction and normalization.

2. **Continuous Update Validation**: Implement a live leaderboard monitoring system that processes newly published papers weekly, tracking the framework's ability to maintain leaderboard accuracy and completeness over extended periods.

3. **Human Evaluation Benchmark**: Conduct blinded human evaluations comparing framework-constructed leaderboards against expert-curated leaderboards for the same paper sets, measuring agreement rates and identifying systematic errors in entity normalization.
