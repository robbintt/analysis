core_contribution: This paper proposes an unsupervised feature selection algorithm
  based on graph filtering and self-representation to address the problem that existing
  methods cannot fully capture the intrinsic structure of data without considering
  higher-order neighborhood information. The core method applies a higher-order graph
  filter to the data to obtain its smooth representation, and designs a regularizer
  to combine the higher-order graph information for self-representation matrix learning
  to capture the intrinsic structure of the data.

# Unsupervised Feature Selection Algorithm Based on Graph Filtering and Self-representation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.00270
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00270
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Proposes an unsupervised feature selection algorithm using graph filtering and self-representation that outperforms state-of-the-art methods on nine benchmark datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an unsupervised feature selection algorithm that combines higher-order graph filtering with self-representation learning to capture intrinsic data structure more effectively. The method applies a heat kernel graph filter to obtain a smooth data representation, then jointly learns a self-representation matrix and feature selection matrix using L_{2,1} norms for robustness and row sparsity. Experimental results demonstrate superior clustering performance compared to existing methods while reducing the number of features needed.

## Method Summary
The algorithm constructs a k-nearest neighbor graph from the data, computes the normalized Laplacian, and applies a heat kernel filter to obtain a smooth representation. It then jointly optimizes a feature selection matrix W and self-representation matrix Z using alternating minimization. The objective includes L_{2,1} norms on reconstruction error and W for robustness, plus a graph-guided regularization term that aligns the self-representation with the higher-order graph structure. The feature selection matrix W is updated via eigenvalue decomposition while Z is updated using ADMM.

## Key Results
- Outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection methods on nine benchmark datasets
- Achieves better clustering accuracy, normalized mutual information, and purity metrics
- Can significantly reduce the number of features used for clustering while improving performance
- The algorithm captures intrinsic data structure more effectively than methods considering only first-order neighborhood information
