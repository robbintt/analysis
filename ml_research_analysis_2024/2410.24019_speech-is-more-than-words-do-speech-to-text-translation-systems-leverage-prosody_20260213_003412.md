## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CONTRA PROST, a benchmark for evaluating prosody-awareness in speech-to-text translation (S2TT) systems. The benchmark uses contrastive examples generated via large language models and controllable text-to-speech to cover diverse prosodic phenomena like sentence stress, prosodic breaks, intonation patterns, emotional prosody, and politeness. Experiments with 31 S2TT models across English-to-German, English-to-Spanish, and English-to-Japanese translations reveal that end-to-end (E2E) systems outperform cascaded models in capturing prosody, though internal prosodic representations are often insufficient to affect translations. The study highlights the need for further improvements in prosody-aware S2TT, such as auxiliary losses or fine-tuning on prosody-rich data.

## Method Summary
The paper develops an automated data generation pipeline using GPT-4 to create contrastive examples covering five prosodic categories, which are then synthesized into speech using controllable text-to-speech. A contrastive evaluation framework measures prosody-awareness through likelihood-based metrics and translation quality estimation. The approach is applied to 31 S2TT models (E2E, AED-cascade, CTC-cascade) across three language pairs, with oracle translations generated by GPT-4 to serve as gold standards. The benchmark enables systematic evaluation of how well models capture prosodic differences in translation.

## Key Results
- E2E models outperform cascaded models on CONTRA PROST, confirming their theoretical advantage in prosody-aware translation
- Global agreement scores remain around 10%, indicating limited prosody-awareness despite above-chance performance
- Model size and architecture type (E2E vs. cascade) significantly impact prosody-aware translation performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: End-to-end S2TT systems outperform cascaded models on prosody-aware translation because they have direct access to the speech signal during translation decisions.
- Mechanism: E2E models process the raw audio waveform through their encoder and directly feed this continuous representation into the decoder for translation, preserving prosody cues like stress, intonation, and rhythm. Cascaded systems lose these cues when converting speech to text in the ASR step.
- Core assumption: The encoder in E2E models can encode prosody-rich features that are strong enough to influence translation output.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "E2E systems outperform cascades of speech recognition and text translation systems, confirming their theoretical advantage in this regard"
  - [section]: "E2E models outperform cascaded models on CONTRA PROST"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; related papers discuss prosody but don't directly compare E2E vs cascade architectures.
- Break condition: If the prosody signal in the audio is weak or the encoder fails to capture it, E2E models lose their advantage over cascades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prosody-aware contrastive evaluation using double-contrastive examples can isolate prosody influence on translation better than standard metrics like BLEU or COMET.
- Mechanism: By generating minimal pairs of speech that differ only in prosody but share the same transcript, the benchmark forces models to translate based on prosodic cues rather than lexical differences. The contrastive likelihood and contrastive quality metrics measure whether models correctly distinguish between these pairs.
- Core assumption: Models have internal representations of prosody that can be detected through contrastive testing even if not reflected in final translations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our methodology uses large language models (LLMs) and controllable text-to-speech (cTTS) to generate contrastive examples"
  - [section]: "we develop a contrastive evaluation framework (Sennrich, 2017)"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus neighbors mention prosody evaluation but don't detail contrastive methodology.
- Break condition: If prosody is not sufficiently represented in the generated audio or if translations are overly explanatory, the contrastive evaluation loses discriminative power.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLM-based oracle translation can generate context-aware, prosody-sensitive translations that serve as gold standards for evaluation.
- Mechanism: GPT-4 is prompted with both the prosodic annotations and semantic interpretations, allowing it to generate translations that reflect prosodic differences while avoiding overly explanatory text. This creates reference translations that are sensitive to prosody.
- Core assumption: LLMs can understand and translate prosody when given appropriate context and constraints.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our methodology uses large language models (LLMs) and controllable text-to-speech (cTTS) to generate contrastive examples"
  - [section]: "we utilize GPT-4 as a prosody- and context-aware oracle translator"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus mentions LLM-based translation but not specifically for prosody.
- Break condition: If the LLM generates translations that are overly explanatory or identical for different prosodic cases, the oracle translations become unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prosody and its linguistic functions (stress, intonation, rhythm)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how prosody affects meaning is essential for designing the benchmark and interpreting results
  - Quick check question: What are the three main prosodic features mentioned that can change sentence meaning?

- Concept: Contrastive evaluation methodology
  - Why needed here: The benchmark relies on minimal pairs to isolate prosody effects from other translation factors
  - Quick check question: How does double-contrastive evaluation differ from standard contrastive evaluation?

- Concept: Speech signal processing and representation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how speech features are encoded helps explain why E2E models might capture prosody better
  - Quick check question: What speech features are typically extracted to represent prosody?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GPT-4 (example generation) → TTS (speech synthesis) → Quality Assessment → Oracle Translation → Contrastive Evaluation Framework → 31 S2TT models

- Critical path:
  1. Generate prosody-rich English sentences with contrastive pairs
  2. Synthesize high-quality speech with controlled prosody
  3. Generate oracle translations sensitive to prosody
  4. Evaluate all S2TT models using contrastive metrics
  5. Analyze results by model type, size, and language pair

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Automated vs. manual data generation (automation enables scale but introduces noise)
  - Standard vs. contrastive evaluation (standard metrics miss prosody effects)
  - E2E vs. cascade architectures (E2E preserves prosody but may have other limitations)

- Failure signatures:
  - Low contrastive scores despite good standard metrics (prosody not captured)
  - Identical translations for contrastive pairs (oracle translation issues)
  - Poor audio quality or incorrect prosody in TTS (data generation problems)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a simple E2E model vs. a simple cascade model on the benchmark to confirm the theoretical advantage
  2. Test the contrastive evaluation methodology with manually verified examples to validate the approach
  3. Vary TTS voice parameters to determine optimal settings for prosody encoding

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the most effective methods for improving prosody-awareness in speech-to-text translation systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes that "The most important implication of our findings is the need for exploring improvements of S2TT regarding prosody-awareness, e.g. through auxiliary losses or finetuning on prosody-rich data."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a need but does not explore specific methods for improving prosody-awareness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing different methods (e.g., auxiliary losses, prosody-aware pretraining, prosody-augmented fine-tuning) and their impact on prosody-aware translation performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does prosody-awareness in speech-to-text translation vary across different language families and typological features?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes differences between German, Spanish, and Japanese but does not explore language family or typological factors.
- Why unresolved: The study only examined three Indo-European and Japonic languages, limiting conclusions about cross-linguistic patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of S2TT models on languages from diverse families (e.g., tonal languages, languages with different rhythmic patterns) to identify systematic patterns in prosody awareness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent can contextual information improve prosody-aware speech-to-text translation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "We hypothesize that some prosodic phenomena could be correctly translated by having access to the broader context of the conversation (context-aware S2TT), which we leave for future research."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as a potential factor but does not investigate it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing prosody-aware translation performance with and without contextual information (e.g., previous utterances, speaker information, situational context).

## Limitations

- Automated data generation pipeline introduces potential noise through LLM-generated examples and TTS synthesis quality
- Oracle translations generated by GPT-4 may be overly explanatory or produce identical translations for different prosodic cases
- Global agreement scores remain around 10%, indicating limited prosody-awareness despite above-chance performance

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The comparative advantage of E2E models over cascaded systems on CONTRA PROST is well-supported by experimental results across multiple language pairs and model sizes.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that prosody representations exist within models but are insufficient to affect translations is based on reasonable evidence from contrastive scores and translation analysis.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that auxiliary losses or fine-tuning on prosody-rich data would significantly improve prosody-aware translation remains speculative without experimental validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Probing Study**: Conduct detailed probing experiments to verify whether E2E models actually encode prosody representations in their intermediate layers, and compare these representations to those in cascaded systems.

2. **Human Evaluation**: Supplement the automated contrastive evaluation with human judgment studies to validate that the generated speech examples accurately convey the intended prosodic differences and that model outputs reflect these differences appropriately.

3. **Model Architecture Analysis**: Systematically vary encoder architectures and decoder architectures in E2E models to determine which components are most critical for prosody awareness, and test whether adding explicit prosody modeling components improves performance beyond the current approaches.
