# Approximation Error and Complexity Bounds for ReLU Networks on Low-Regular Function Spaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.06727
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06727
- Reference count: 34
- One-line primary result: This paper derives error and complexity estimates for ReLU neural networks approximating a broad class of bounded functions with minimal regularity assumptions.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes theoretical bounds on the approximation error and network complexity when using ReLU neural networks to approximate functions with low regularity. The target functions have absolutely integrable Fourier transforms but need not be continuous or differentiable. The authors construct a ReLU network that approximates a Fourier features residual network, using special ReLU networks to facilitate composition and linear combination. The resulting error bounds are proportional to the uniform norm of the target function and inversely proportional to the product of network width and depth.

## Method Summary
The authors approach the approximation problem by first constructing a Fourier features residual network that approximates the target function. They then approximate each component of this network (specifically beta and beta prime functions) using standard ReLU networks. To combine these approximations, they employ special ReLU networks that enable efficient composition and linear combination without exploding width. The proof involves bounding the approximation error at each step and showing that the total error is proportional to the target function's uniform norm while the network complexity depends on the product of width and depth.

## Key Results
- Approximation error can be bounded by a quantity proportional to the uniform norm of the target function and inversely proportional to the product of network width and depth
- The target function class includes functions with absolutely integrable Fourier transforms but need not be continuous or differentiable
- Special ReLU networks enable efficient composition and linear combination of standard ReLU networks for the approximation construction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ReLU networks can approximate low-regularity functions with bounded complexity.
- Mechanism: The proof constructs a ReLU network by approximating a Fourier features residual network, using special ReLU networks to handle composition and linear combinations.
- Core assumption: The target function has an absolutely integrable Fourier transform and its uniform norm is bounded by the L1 norm of its Fourier transform.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We show that the approximation error can be bounded from above by a quantity proportional to the uniform norm of the target function and inversely proportional to the product of network width and depth."
  - [section 4.1]: Introduces Fourier features residual networks and their connection to the target function class.
  - [corpus]: Weak - neighbors focus on covering numbers and quantization, not Fourier-based approximation.
- Break condition: If the target function does not have an absolutely integrable Fourier transform, the proof strategy fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Special ReLU networks enable efficient composition and linear combination of standard ReLU networks.
- Mechanism: Special networks reserve top neurons for source channels and bottom neurons for collation channels, facilitating recursive summation and composition without exploding width.
- Core assumption: The source channel neurons are ReLU-free and the collation channel neurons can feed back into the main computational channels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2]: Defines special ReLU networks and their properties.
  - [section 5]: Uses special networks to construct the ReLU approximation of the Fourier features residual network.
  - [corpus]: Missing - neighbors do not discuss special network architectures.
- Break condition: If the recursive composition depth exceeds practical limits, the network complexity bounds may become invalid.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The approximation error bound scales with the regularity of the target function.
- Mechanism: The constant of proportionality in the error bound depends on the maximum frequency present in the target function, which is related to its regularity.
- Core assumption: Functions with higher regularity have Fourier transforms that decay faster, limiting the maximum frequency needed for approximation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: Discusses the relationship between the constant of proportionality and the target function regularity.
  - [section 5.2]: Extends the proof for multi-dimensional input and discusses the role of maximum frequency.
  - [corpus]: Weak - neighbors focus on covering numbers and quantization, not regularity-dependent bounds.
- Break condition: If the target function has isolated high-frequency content despite high regularity, the maximum frequency and hence the error bound may be large.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fourier transform and its properties
  - Why needed here: The target function class is defined in terms of the L1 norm of its Fourier transform, and the proof strategy involves approximating a Fourier features residual network.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the uniform norm of a function and the L1 norm of its Fourier transform?

- Concept: ReLU neural networks and their approximation capabilities
  - Why needed here: The main result concerns the approximation of low-regularity functions by ReLU networks, and the proof involves constructing a ReLU network that approximates a Fourier features residual network.
  - Quick check question: How does the width and depth of a ReLU network affect its approximation capability?

- Concept: Special ReLU networks and their role in composition and linear combination
  - Why needed here: The proof uses special ReLU networks to facilitate the recursive summation and composition of networks, which is necessary to approximate the Fourier features residual network.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between standard and special ReLU networks, and how do they enable efficient composition and linear combination?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Fourier features residual network -> Special ReLU networks -> Standard ReLU networks

- Critical path:
  1. Construct a Fourier features residual network that approximates the target function
  2. Approximate each component of the Fourier features network (beta and beta prime functions) using ReLU networks
  3. Combine the ReLU approximations using special networks to form the final ReLU network

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Width vs. depth: The proof uses a combination of strategies that absorb complexity into width and depth, depending on the specific operation (composition vs. linear combination)
  - Regularity vs. maximum frequency: The error bound depends on the regularity of the target function, which determines the maximum frequency needed for approximation

- Failure signatures:
  - If the target function does not have an absolutely integrable Fourier transform, the proof strategy fails
  - If the recursive composition depth exceeds practical limits, the network complexity bounds may become invalid
  - If the target function has isolated high-frequency content despite high regularity, the maximum frequency and hence the error bound may be large

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple ReLU network that approximates a one-dimensional sine function, using the proof strategy outlined in the paper
  2. Extend the implementation to a multi-dimensional input and compare the approximation error and complexity with the theoretical bounds
  3. Experiment with different levels of target function regularity and observe the effect on the maximum frequency and the error bound

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal trade-off between network width and depth for minimizing approximation error in ReLU networks approximating functions in S?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows that approximation error is inversely proportional to the product of width and depth, but does not investigate the optimal allocation between these two parameters.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on establishing existence of networks with bounded error and complexity, but does not explore the trade-off between width and depth.
- What evidence would resolve it: Numerical experiments varying width and depth while keeping their product constant, to determine which allocation yields better approximation error.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the derived error bounds compare to those of other neural network architectures (e.g., Fourier features networks) for approximating functions in S?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses Fourier features residual networks as a starting point, but does not directly compare the error bounds of ReLU networks to those of Fourier features networks.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on deriving bounds for ReLU networks, but does not benchmark them against other architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Deriving error bounds for Fourier features networks approximating functions in S and comparing them to the ReLU network bounds.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the derived error bounds be extended to more general function spaces beyond S?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on a specific function space S, but the techniques used (e.g., Fourier features, special ReLU networks) may be applicable to other spaces.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore generalizations to other function spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the techniques to other function spaces and deriving error bounds for those spaces.

## Limitations
- The approach assumes target functions have absolutely integrable Fourier transforms, which may not hold for many practical functions
- The complexity bounds depend on unknown constants C, ωmax, and ω that are function-specific and not explicitly computed
- The special ReLU network construction relies on recursive composition, which may become impractical for deep networks due to vanishing gradients or numerical instability

## Confidence
- Approximation error bound claims: Medium - While the theoretical framework is sound, the constants are unspecified and may not be tight in practice
- Special ReLU network construction: Low - The paper introduces a novel architecture without empirical validation or comparison to existing methods
- Complexity bounds for multi-dimensional inputs: Medium - The extension to higher dimensions is presented but lacks concrete examples or numerical verification

## Next Checks
1. Verify the approximation error bound for a concrete example, such as a piecewise constant function with known Fourier transform, by computing the constants C, ωmax, and ω explicitly and comparing the theoretical bound with numerical results
2. Implement the special ReLU network construction and test its ability to compose and linearly combine standard ReLU networks for increasingly deep compositions, measuring the growth in width and depth against the theoretical bounds
3. Extend the complexity analysis to a multi-dimensional input function (e.g., a product of one-dimensional functions) and compute the approximation error and network complexity, comparing them with the theoretical bounds for the multi-dimensional case
