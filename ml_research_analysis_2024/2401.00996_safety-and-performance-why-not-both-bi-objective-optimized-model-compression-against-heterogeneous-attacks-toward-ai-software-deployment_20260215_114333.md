# Safety and Performance, Why Not Both? Bi-Objective Optimized Model Compression against Heterogeneous Attacks Toward AI Software Deployment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.00996
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00996
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes SafeCompress, a framework for jointly optimizing model performance and safety during compression against privacy attacks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of compressing deep neural network models while maintaining both high performance and safety against privacy attacks. The proposed SafeCompress framework introduces a test-driven sparse training approach that iteratively optimizes model performance and safety by simulating attack mechanisms. Unlike traditional two-step approaches that compress models first and then add defenses, SafeCompress integrates both objectives from the beginning. The framework is specifically configured to defend against black-box and white-box membership inference attacks, and can be extended to handle multiple heterogeneous attacks. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that SafeCompress significantly outperforms baseline solutions in balancing performance and safety.

## Method Summary
SafeCompress employs a test-driven sparse training framework that integrates model compression and safety optimization through bi-objective optimization. The core mechanism simulates attack mechanisms during training to iteratively adjust model sparsity while maintaining both accuracy and privacy guarantees. The framework is configured to defend against black-box and white-box membership inference attacks, with the attack configurability principle allowing easy extension to other attack types. SafeCompress optimizes for multiple heterogeneous attacks by incorporating different attack simulations into the training process. The approach contrasts with traditional two-step methods by jointly optimizing both performance and safety from the outset rather than sequentially.

## Key Results
- SafeCompress significantly outperforms baseline solutions in balancing model performance and safety against membership inference attacks
- The framework demonstrates effectiveness across five diverse datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, Purchase-100, and Texas-100)
- SafeCompress successfully extends to handle multiple heterogeneous attacks while maintaining good performance-safety trade-offs
- The approach achieves superior results compared to traditional two-step methods that compress first and then add privacy defenses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SafeCompress works by integrating privacy attack simulation directly into the sparse training process, creating a unified optimization framework that simultaneously considers both model performance and safety. During training, the framework simulates attack mechanisms to estimate privacy leakage and uses this information to guide the sparse training process. This iterative approach allows the model to learn which weights and connections are critical for both task performance and privacy preservation. By incorporating attack simulations throughout training rather than as a post-processing step, SafeCompress can make more informed decisions about which parameters to prune while maintaining safety guarantees. The bi-objective optimization ensures that neither performance nor safety is compromised at the expense of the other.

## Foundational Learning
- **Membership Inference Attacks**: Attacks that determine whether a specific data sample was used in training a model. Why needed: Understanding this attack type is crucial since SafeCompress is primarily designed to defend against it. Quick check: Can you explain how an attacker might determine if a specific patient's record was in a medical model's training data?
- **Sparse Training**: Training neural networks with built-in sparsity patterns rather than pruning after training. Why needed: This is the core compression technique used by SafeCompress instead of traditional post-training pruning. Quick check: What's the difference between training with sparsity and pruning after training?
- **Bi-objective Optimization**: Simultaneous optimization of two competing objectives (performance and safety in this case). Why needed: SafeCompress needs to balance accuracy with privacy, requiring joint optimization rather than sequential approaches. Quick check: How does optimizing two objectives simultaneously differ from optimizing them sequentially?
- **Attack Simulation**: The process of emulating attack mechanisms during training to estimate vulnerability. Why needed: SafeCompress uses simulated attacks to guide the compression process toward safer models. Quick check: Why is simulating attacks during training more effective than just measuring privacy after compression?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data -> Model Architecture -> Sparse Training Engine -> Attack Simulator -> Performance/Safety Metrics -> Weight Updates -> Model

**Critical Path**: Training data flows through the model architecture, where the sparse training engine simultaneously optimizes for task performance while the attack simulator evaluates privacy leakage. These dual objectives generate feedback that guides weight updates, producing a compressed model that balances both requirements.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency during training for better final performance-safety balance. While the iterative optimization process requires more computation than traditional two-step approaches, it produces models that better satisfy both objectives simultaneously.

**Failure Signatures**: Models may exhibit degraded performance if the attack simulation is too aggressive, or insufficient privacy protection if the safety objective is underweighted. The framework may also struggle with very large models where computational costs become prohibitive.

**First 3 Experiments to Run**:
1. Test SafeCompress on a simple CNN with CIFAR-10 to verify basic functionality and compare against baseline compression methods
2. Evaluate the framework's performance against different attack strengths to understand robustness boundaries
3. Compare computational overhead versus two-step approaches to quantify the training cost trade-off

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can SafeCompress be effectively extended to defend against other types of attacks beyond membership inference attacks (e.g., attribute inference attacks or model inversion attacks)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that SafeCompress follows the attack configurability principle and can be easily configured to fight against a given attack mechanism. It also provides examples of how SafeCompress could be adapted to attribute inference attacks and model inversion attacks.

- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing that SafeCompress can effectively defend against attribute inference attacks and model inversion attacks, while maintaining good performance on the target task.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance-safety trade-off in SafeCompress compare to that of other model compression techniques, such as quantization or knowledge distillation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents experimental results comparing SafeCompress to various two-step baseline approaches that combine model compression and membership inference attack defense techniques. However, it does not directly compare SafeCompress to other model compression techniques that do not explicitly consider privacy.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of SafeCompress in balancing performance and safety. It does not explore how SafeCompress compares to other model compression techniques in terms of the performance-safety trade-off.

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that SafeCompress was tested on a larger model (ResNet50) and a larger dataset (ImageNet) in addition to the smaller models and datasets used in the main experiments. It reports that SafeCompress achieved a good performance-safety trade-off on these larger-scale settings.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides a single data point for the scalability of SafeCompress on a larger model and dataset. It does not explore how the scalability of SafeCompress changes as the size of the model and dataset increase further.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing how the performance, safety, and time consumption of SafeCompress change as the size of the model and dataset increase, across a range of scales.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to five specific datasets, which may not generalize to other domains or real-world deployment scenarios
- Performance under diverse attack types beyond membership inference remains untested, raising questions about comprehensive safety
- Computational overhead of the iterative bi-objective optimization process is not quantified, limiting understanding of practical deployment efficiency

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The framework's ability to jointly optimize model performance and safety against membership inference attacks is well-supported by experimental results across multiple datasets
- **Medium Confidence**: The generalizability claims to heterogeneous attacks are supported by experiments with white-box and black-box membership inference, but extent to other attack types is uncertain
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about real-world deployment readiness are not substantiated, particularly regarding computational efficiency and robustness against non-membership-inference attacks

## Next Checks
1. **Generalizability Test**: Evaluate SafeCompress on additional datasets from diverse domains (e.g., medical imaging, NLP) to verify robustness beyond the five tested datasets
2. **Attack Surface Expansion**: Test the framework's performance against other privacy attacks such as adversarial examples, model inversion, or model extraction to validate safety claims comprehensively
3. **Computational Overhead Analysis**: Quantify the runtime and resource requirements of the iterative optimization process to assess practical deployment feasibility
