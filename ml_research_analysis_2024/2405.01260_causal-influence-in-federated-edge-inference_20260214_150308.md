# Causal Influence in Federated Edge Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.01260
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01260
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: This paper addresses the problem of quantifying causal influence of individual agents in federated inference systems where agents cooperate via a fusion center to infer a hidden state from streaming observations.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of quantifying causal influence of individual agents in federated inference systems where agents cooperate via a fusion center to infer a hidden state from streaming observations. The authors develop a causal framework using hypothetical interventions to distinguish true causal effects from correlations induced by confounding factors. They derive closed-form expressions for causal impact scores under both synchronous and asynchronous communication scenarios, where agents may intermittently participate in information sharing.

The key theoretical results show that an agent's causal impact is proportional to its informativeness, participation frequency, and assigned confidence weight. Experimental validation with synthetic data and a real-world multi-camera crowd counting application confirms the theoretical findings and demonstrates that asymmetric communication protocols (where the fusion center updates non-participating agents) yield more robust and fair decision-making compared to symmetric protocols. The methodology provides a principled approach for evaluating and mitigating the effects of outlying agents in collaborative inference systems.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a causal framework using hypothetical interventions to quantify the true causal effect of individual agents in federated inference systems. They employ a hidden Markov model where agents observe the hidden state through noisy measurements and share information via a fusion center. The framework distinguishes causal effects from correlations by considering counterfactual scenarios where individual agents' contributions are removed.

For synchronous communication, the causal impact score is derived as a closed-form expression involving the agent's observation precision, participation probability, and confidence weight. For asynchronous scenarios, the framework accounts for intermittent participation through Markovian participation models. The authors prove that under certain conditions, causal impact is proportional to an agent's information contribution and participation frequency. They also demonstrate that asymmetric communication protocols, where the fusion center updates non-participating agents with the current global estimate, lead to more robust and fair decision-making compared to symmetric protocols.

## Key Results
- Causal impact score is proportional to agent's informativeness, participation frequency, and assigned confidence weight
- Asymmetric communication protocols (fusion center updates non-participating agents) yield more robust and fair decision-making than symmetric protocols
- Closed-form expressions for causal impact derived for both synchronous and asynchronous communication scenarios
- Experimental validation confirms theoretical findings using synthetic data and multi-camera crowd counting application

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by explicitly modeling the causal relationships between agents' observations, their participation decisions, and the resulting global inference quality. By using hypothetical interventions, it breaks spurious correlations that arise from common causes (like the hidden state affecting multiple agents' observations simultaneously). The asymmetric protocol ensures that all agents maintain up-to-date information, preventing outdated beliefs from degrading system performance when intermittent participants return.

## Foundational Learning
- Hidden Markov Models (HMMs): State-space models where observations depend on hidden states; needed for modeling the temporal evolution of the system state and agent observations
- Causal Inference Framework: Methods to distinguish correlation from causation using counterfactual analysis; needed to properly attribute influence to individual agents
- Markovian Participation Models: Stochastic models for agent availability; needed to handle realistic scenarios where agents join and leave intermittently
- Information Theory Metrics: Measures of informativeness like Fisher information; needed to quantify how much each agent contributes to state estimation
- Fusion Center Architecture: Centralized aggregation of distributed information; needed for the cooperative inference framework
- Asymmetric vs Symmetric Communication: Different information sharing protocols; needed to optimize system robustness and fairness

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Agents -> Fusion Center -> Global Estimate -> Agents
Critical path: Observation → Local Processing → Information Sharing → Global Fusion → Updated Estimate
Design tradeoffs: Computational complexity vs accuracy, communication overhead vs robustness, fairness vs efficiency
Failure signatures: Outlier agents skewing estimates, communication delays causing outdated information propagation, participation dropout degrading system performance
First experiments:
1. Validate closed-form causal impact expressions using synthetic data with known ground truth
2. Compare asymmetric vs symmetric protocols under varying participation patterns
3. Test sensitivity of causal impact to observation noise levels and agent confidence weights

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework assumes Gaussian likelihoods and linear state transitions, limiting generalizability to non-linear observation models
- Asymmetric protocol's performance advantage demonstrated only in limited experimental scenarios
- Treatment of agent confidence weights as exogenous parameters without guidance on calibration methodology
- Single real-world case study insufficient to establish broad practical utility claims

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework derivation (High): The mathematical foundations appear sound within stated assumptions
- Causal impact score interpretation (Medium): The link between causal impact and practical system behavior needs more empirical validation
- Asymmetric protocol superiority (Medium): Limited experimental evidence prevents high confidence claims
- Real-world applicability (Low): Single case study insufficient for broad claims about practical utility

## Next Checks
1. Test the causal framework with non-Gaussian observation models and non-linear state transitions using Monte Carlo simulations
2. Conduct systematic ablation studies varying agent capabilities, observation qualities, and communication patterns to validate the causal impact metric's sensitivity
3. Implement the methodology on multiple real-world federated inference problems with varying numbers of agents and heterogeneous capabilities to assess generalizability
