## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BDA, a Bangla text augmentation framework that combines model-based and rule-based methods to generate synthetic data for low-resource languages. The framework uses Synonym Replacement, Random Swap, Back-Translation, and Paraphrasing to create diverse, semantically equivalent text variants, along with a filtering mechanism to maintain quality. Experiments on five Bangla datasets show that BDA improves F1 scores across multiple data scarcity levels, achieving performance comparable to models trained on full datasets while using only 50% of the data.

## Method Summary
BDA applies four augmentation strategies (Synonym Replacement, Random Swap, Back-Translation, Paraphrasing) to generate synthetic variants, then filters them with SBERT and BLEU to retain semantic meaning while maximizing lexical variation. The framework processes input text through random augmentation method selection, generation, semantic similarity checking via SBERT, lexical similarity checking via BLEU, and dataset merging before model training.

## Key Results
- BDA improves F1 scores across five Bangla datasets at 15%, 50%, and 100% data scarcity levels
- Achieves performance comparable to full-dataset models using only 50% of original data
- No single augmentation method dominates; optimal method varies by dataset characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Data augmentation with BDA compensates for low-resource constraints by increasing lexical and semantic diversity without changing label semantics.
- Mechanism: BDA applies four augmentation strategies to generate synthetic variants, then filters them with SBERT and BLEU to retain semantic meaning while maximizing lexical variation.
- Core assumption: Synthetic samples remain semantically equivalent to originals and preserve class labels if similarity scores exceed predefined thresholds.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "a filtering process is included to ensure that the new text keeps the same meaning as the original"; [section] "Only augmented texts that meet both the meaning and lexical similarity thresholds are added to the dataset."
- Break condition: If augmented text similarity scores fall below thresholds, low-quality or label-flipped samples are discarded.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Augmentation effectiveness scales with dataset size: small datasets benefit from over-represented synthetic samples; large datasets benefit from higher diversity without memorization.
- Mechanism: At 15% data clipping, augmentation acts like oversampling; at 50% clipping, added diversity improves generalization; at 100% clipping, gains are marginal or negative due to noise.
- Core assumption: Diversity is more valuable than sheer volume once a critical mass of real data is reached.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "achieving performance comparable to models trained on full datasets while using only 50% of the data"; [section] "as the dataset size increases, such as when 50% of the data is used, the model benefits more from the greater diversity and reduced memorization."
- Break condition: If augmented samples introduce too much noise, F1 scores drop.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Different augmentation methods are optimal for different dataset characteristics; no single method dominates across all tasks.
- Mechanism: SR and RS work best for small/medium datasets due to minimal semantic drift; BT and PP add more variation but risk altering sentence structure; hybrid approach balances these effects.
- Core assumption: Each method's trade-off between lexical diversity and semantic stability is predictable based on dataset properties.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "there is no single augmentation method that outperforms others in all scenarios"; [section] Table 9 lists ideal datasets per method.
- Break condition: If dataset characteristics change, previously optimal method may underperform.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semantic similarity vs lexical diversity in text augmentation
  - Why needed here: BDA relies on balancing these two dimensions to avoid label flipping while increasing variety
  - Quick check question: If cosine similarity between original and augmented text is 0.98 but BLEU score is 0.20, is the sample likely to be accepted?

- Concept: Threshold-based filtering in synthetic data pipelines
  - Why needed here: Filtering is central to BDA's quality control; wrong thresholds lead to either noise or low coverage
  - Quick check question: What happens to F1 score if semantic similarity threshold is raised from 0.85 to 0.99?

- Concept: Transformer-based vs rule-based augmentation trade-offs
  - Why needed here: BDA combines both; understanding their strengths/weaknesses is critical for tuning
  - Quick check question: Which augmentation method would you choose for a dataset with heavy spelling errors and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input preprocessing → Random augmentation method selection → Generation (SR/RS/BT/PP) → SBERT semantic similarity check → BLEU lexical similarity check → Dataset merge → Model training
- Critical path: Generation → Filtering → Merge → Training. Filtering must happen before merge to avoid contaminating the dataset.
- Design tradeoffs: High filtering thresholds → cleaner data but fewer augmentations; low thresholds → more samples but higher noise risk.
- Failure signatures: F1 drops with higher augmentation; model overfitting on augmented data; label drift in classification tasks.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run BDA on 15% clipped dataset with default thresholds; measure F1 gain vs baseline.
  2. Vary semantic similarity threshold (0.85→0.99) and observe impact on F1 and augmentation coverage.
  3. Compare individual augmentation methods on a small/medium dataset to identify optimal choice.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between transformer-based and rule-based augmentation methods for different Bangla dataset characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper found that transformer-based methods offer more diverse and contextually relevant augmentations, while rule-based methods are faster and simpler, with no single method universally optimal.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests a hybrid approach but does not provide specific guidelines for when to prioritize each method based on dataset properties.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing various hybrid combinations across diverse Bangla datasets, measuring performance gains relative to dataset size, noise level, and class balance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the sentence similarity model be improved to better prevent label flipping in Bangla text augmentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that implementing a more advanced similarity model could yield better results in preventing label flipping of classification datasets in augmented texts.
- Why unresolved: The current filtering process uses Sentence-BERT and SacreBLEU, but the authors acknowledge room for improvement in this area.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different advanced similarity models (e.g., contrastive learning approaches) on Bangla datasets, measuring label preservation accuracy and overall classification performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specialized methods are needed to effectively augment Bangla informal texts containing spelling errors, out-of-vocabulary words, and English character mixing (Banglish)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies this as a limitation, noting that BDA's current methods (except Random Swap) are not applicable to such datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the problem but does not propose or test solutions for handling noisy, informal Bangla text.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of augmentation methods specifically designed for noisy Bangla text, measuring performance on datasets containing spelling errors and Banglish content.

## Limitations
- Filtering threshold sensitivity: Dataset-dependent thresholds lack systematic analysis across data scarcity levels
- Single-experiment design: Results based on one run per condition without variance measures or statistical significance testing
- Ablation study gaps: Lacks comprehensive analysis of individual filtering mechanism contributions

## Confidence
- High Confidence: BDA improves F1 scores on low-resource Bangla datasets (well-supported by experimental results)
- Medium Confidence: Optimal augmentation methods vary by dataset characteristics (supported by ablation results but lacks statistical validation)
- Low Confidence: BDA achieves "comparable performance using only 50% of the data" (lacks proper statistical backing)

## Next Checks
1. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary semantic similarity thresholds (0.85→0.99) and lexical similarity thresholds (<45%→<90%) across all five datasets to quantify the impact on F1 scores and augmentation coverage.

2. **Statistical Significance Testing**: Conduct multiple experimental runs (minimum 5) for each dataset-clipping combination to calculate confidence intervals and perform t-tests comparing augmented vs non-augmented models.

3. **Method-Specific Ablation**: Isolate each augmentation method's contribution by running experiments with only SBERT filtering, only BLEU filtering, and no filtering to determine the individual impact of each quality control mechanism.
