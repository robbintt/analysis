# Multi-resolution Rescored ByteTrack for Video Object Detection on Ultra-low-power Embedded Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.11488
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11488
- Reference count: 38
- Multi-resolution inference reduces per-frame compute load by up to 43% while maintaining accuracy through temporal correlation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MR2-ByteTrack, a video object detection framework designed for ultra-low-power embedded systems that combines multi-resolution inference with a rescored ByteTrack algorithm. The method alternates between full-resolution (320×320) and down-sized (192×192) frames to reduce computational load while maintaining accuracy through temporal correlation and a novel confidence aggregation mechanism. The framework was evaluated on a GAP9 microcontroller using three state-of-the-art tiny object detectors, demonstrating an average accuracy increase of 2.16% and 43% latency reduction compared to baseline frame-by-frame inference.

## Method Summary
MR2-ByteTrack implements a multi-resolution approach where object detection alternates between full-resolution images and multiple down-sized frames, reducing average Multiply-Accumate (MAC) operations per frame. The system integrates the ByteTrack tracker with a novel Rescore algorithm that maintains a confidence aggregation score for each tracked object, updated probabilistically when new detections match existing tracker instances. This allows correction of misclassifications over time while avoiding expensive feature matching by using IoU-based association. The framework was deployed on a GAP9 microcontroller using pre-trained YOLOX-Nano, NanoDet-Plus, and EfficientDet-D0 models.

## Key Results
- Average accuracy increase of 2.16% compared to baseline frame-by-frame inference
- 43% reduction in average MAC operations per frame
- Up to 1.76x lower inference latency with no increase in DNN parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-resolution inference reduces per-frame compute load by interleaving full-resolution and down-sized frames
- Mechanism: The system alternates between processing high-resolution images (320×320 pixels) and multiple down-sized frames (192×192 pixels), reducing average MAC operations per frame by up to 43% while maintaining accuracy through temporal correlation
- Core assumption: Temporal correlation of object detections across frames is strong enough to compensate for accuracy degradation from lower resolution inputs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "reduces the average compute load of an off-the-shelf Deep Neural Network (DNN) based object detector by up to 2.25× by alternating the processing of high-resolution images (320×320 pixels) with multiple down-sized frames (192×192 pixels)"
  - [section]: "We design our framework around existing pre-trained single-shot object detectors...we can interleave one full-res image...with P low-res ones...reducing average number of MAC operations per frame"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct corpus papers discuss multi-resolution inference specifically for ultra-low-power embedded systems
- Break condition: Temporal correlation becomes weak (e.g., fast-moving objects or camera motion), causing the system to fail at tracking and correcting low-res frame detections

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Rescore algorithm improves classification accuracy by aggregating detection confidence scores over time
- Mechanism: The Rescore algorithm extends ByteTrack by maintaining a confidence aggregation score (conf_agg) for each tracked object, which is updated probabilistically when new detections match existing tracker instances
- Core assumption: The confidence score from detections can be interpreted as a probability that the classification is correct, and these probabilities can be meaningfully combined over time
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "corrects potential misclassification using a novel probabilistic Rescore algorithm"
  - [section]: "We augment ByteTrack with the Rescore algorithm to improve the estimation of the class index and confidence scores of an active tracker instance by accounting for the history of matched detections"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no corpus papers discuss probabilistic rescore algorithms for video object detection
- Break condition: The system cannot recover from persistent misclassification if the initial detection is wrong and subsequent detections consistently reinforce the incorrect classification

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ByteTrack tracker exploits temporal correlation to maintain object identity across frames without requiring feature matching
- Mechanism: ByteTrack uses a Kalman filter to predict object positions and matches detections to tracker instances using IoU scores, avoiding the need for expensive feature matching that would require storing intermediate feature maps
- Core assumption: Spatial proximity (IoU) is sufficient for tracking object identity across frames in the multi-resolution setting
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "correlates the output detections over time using the ByteTrack tracker"
  - [section]: "ByteTrack matches the bbox bounding boxes of {Di}N i=1 and the predicted bbox kf ones of {Tj}M j=1, using a cost matrix determined by Intersection-over-Union (IoU) scores"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers discuss tracking but not specifically ByteTrack with multi-resolution inference
- Break condition: When objects overlap significantly or occlude each other, IoU-based matching fails to correctly associate detections with tracker instances

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kalman filtering for object tracking
  - Why needed here: ByteTrack uses Kalman filters to predict object positions between frames and smooth detection noise
  - Quick check question: How does a Kalman filter update its state estimate when a new measurement arrives?

- Concept: Intersection over Union (IoU) metric
  - Why needed here: IoU is used to match detections with tracker instances and determine when objects are the same across frames
  - Quick check question: What is the formula for calculating IoU between two bounding boxes?

- Concept: Multi-scale feature extraction in CNNs
  - Why needed here: The same CNN backbone processes both full-resolution and low-resolution images without requiring different parameters
  - Quick check question: Why can the same convolution filters be applied to feature maps of different sizes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input preprocessing -> CNN backbone -> Detection output -> ByteTrack tracker -> Rescore algorithm -> GAP9 MCU deployment
- Critical path: Input → CNN inference → ByteTrack matching → Rescore update → Output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Resolution vs. accuracy: Lower resolution reduces computation but requires tracking to recover accuracy
  - Tracker persistence: Keeping trackers alive for up to 5 timestamps without detections balances robustness and resource usage
  - Memory vs. latency: On-chip vs. external memory allocation for activations
- Failure signatures:
  - High false positive rate: Low-res frames consistently misclassify objects
  - ID switching: Tracker instances incorrectly change identity due to IoU matching failures
  - Performance degradation: System struggles with fast-moving objects or significant camera motion
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate multi-resolution inference alone: Run baseline object detector on alternating full-res and low-res frames without tracking, measure mAP and MAC reduction
  2. Test ByteTrack with full-res only: Implement ByteTrack on single-resolution full-res frames, measure improvement over frame-by-frame baseline
  3. Deploy complete MR2-ByteTrack on GAP9: Run multi-resolution with tracking on actual hardware, measure FPS, energy consumption, and accuracy compared to baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal strategy for selecting between full-resolution and low-resolution frames in a multi-resolution VOD system to balance accuracy and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the use of multi-resolution inference but does not explore the optimal strategy for frame selection
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how to dynamically choose the resolution of frames based on scene complexity or object movement
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing different frame selection strategies and their impact on VOD performance metrics like mAP and computational cost

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the Rescore algorithm handle scenarios where the tracked object's class changes frequently over time?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the Rescore algorithm but does not discuss its performance in scenarios with frequent class changes
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results or analysis of the Rescore algorithm's robustness to frequent class changes
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing the Rescore algorithm's performance on datasets with objects that frequently change class, along with a comparison to other tracking algorithms

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different confidence thresholds on the performance of MR2-ByteTrack?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper sets confidence thresholds but does not explore the impact of varying these thresholds on VOD performance
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a sensitivity analysis of the confidence thresholds on metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score
- What evidence would resolve it: A study showing how different confidence threshold values affect the VOD performance metrics across various datasets and scenarios

## Limitations
- The Rescore algorithm's probabilistic mechanism is incompletely specified, making it difficult to validate whether the confidence aggregation truly improves classification accuracy
- The paper does not address how the system performs under varying motion dynamics or camera conditions, which could significantly impact the effectiveness of multi-resolution inference and temporal tracking
- No comparison is provided against alternative tracking algorithms (e.g., DeepSORT, SORT) or different multi-resolution strategies

## Confidence
- Multi-resolution inference effectiveness (High): The 43% latency reduction claim is directly supported by the MAC operations calculation, though the accuracy preservation claim depends on untested assumptions about temporal correlation strength
- ByteTrack integration benefits (Medium): While ByteTrack is well-established, the paper doesn't quantify the tracking improvement over frame-by-frame baseline, only reporting the combined MR2-ByteTrack performance
- Rescore algorithm impact (Low): The probabilistic mechanism is vaguely described without mathematical formulation or ablation studies showing its contribution to the reported accuracy gains

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component: measure baseline object detector performance, multi-resolution only, ByteTrack only, and Rescore only on the same dataset
2. Test the system across diverse motion scenarios (stationary, slow-moving, fast-moving objects) to identify performance degradation patterns and establish operational boundaries
3. Implement a simplified version of the Rescore algorithm with different confidence aggregation methods (e.g., simple averaging vs. exponential smoothing) to determine whether the specific probabilistic formulation is critical to the reported accuracy improvements
