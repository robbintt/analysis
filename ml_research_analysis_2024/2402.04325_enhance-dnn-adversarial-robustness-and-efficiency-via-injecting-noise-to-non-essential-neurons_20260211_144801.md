# Enhance DNN Adversarial Robustness and Efficiency via Injecting Noise to Non-Essential Neurons

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.04325
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04325
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel noise injection method enhances both adversarial robustness and execution efficiency by targeting non-essential neurons

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Non-Essential Neurons Noise Injection, a novel approach to simultaneously enhance adversarial robustness and computational efficiency in deep neural networks. The method identifies essential neurons for accurate inference and strategically injects noise into non-essential neurons using a learning-based approximation technique. By employing random projection and structured noise injection, the approach achieves significant improvements in robustness while reducing computational costs, demonstrating effectiveness across different network architectures and attack scenarios.

## Method Summary
The method operates by first identifying essential neurons that contribute significantly to accurate inference, then strategically injecting noise into non-essential neurons. This noise injection is achieved through a learning-based approximation technique that leverages random projection and structured noise patterns. The approach can be applied to pre-trained networks without requiring retraining from scratch, making it practical for deployment on existing models. The key innovation lies in the selective targeting of non-essential neurons, which allows for robustness improvements without degrading clean accuracy or significantly impacting computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 91.6% reduction in BitOPs while maintaining or improving robust accuracy
- Demonstrated 14.74% improvement in robust accuracy under PGD20 attack compared to baseline methods
- Maintained clean accuracy while significantly improving adversarial robustness across CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets
- Validated effectiveness on both ResNet-18 and WideResNet-34-10 architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting the redundancy and non-essential nature of many neurons in deep neural networks. By identifying which neurons are truly essential for accurate inference and injecting noise only into those that are not, the approach creates a defense mechanism that is both robust and efficient. The noise injection disrupts adversarial perturbations that target the network's decision boundaries while having minimal impact on legitimate inputs. The structured noise injection through random projection ensures that the noise is distributed in a way that maximizes its defensive impact while minimizing computational overhead.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input -> Neuron Importance Assessment -> Essential Neuron Identification -> Noise Injection Module -> Output

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves the neuron importance assessment and essential neuron identification steps, as these determine where noise will be injected. The noise injection module must be carefully designed to ensure it doesn't interfere with essential neuron operations while effectively disrupting adversarial patterns.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The method trades off between noise intensity and computational efficiency. Higher noise levels provide better robustness but may impact clean accuracy and increase computational costs. The random projection approach balances these concerns by providing structured noise that is both effective and computationally efficient.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Over-injection of noise leading to degraded clean accuracy
- Under-identification of essential neurons resulting in reduced robustness
- Computational overhead exceeding efficiency gains

**First Experiments:**
1. Apply the method to a simple CNN on MNIST to verify basic functionality
2. Test different noise injection intensities on CIFAR-10 to find optimal balance
3. Evaluate the method's impact on inference speed across different hardware platforms

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper highlights several open questions, including the generalizability of the approach to larger-scale models and different domains beyond image classification. It also questions the method's effectiveness against more sophisticated adversarial attacks and its behavior when facing adversaries aware of the noise injection strategy. Additionally, the computational overhead implications for real-world deployment scenarios remain an area requiring further investigation.

## Limitations

- Empirical effectiveness across different network architectures and datasets remains uncertain
