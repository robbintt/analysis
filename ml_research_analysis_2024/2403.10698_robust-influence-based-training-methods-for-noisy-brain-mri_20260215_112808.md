# Robust Influence-based Training Methods for Noisy Brain MRI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.10698
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10698
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Influence-based training methods (ISR and ISP) improve robustness to noise in brain MRI classification

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two novel training methods, Influence-based Sample Reweighing (ISR) and Influence-based Sample Perturbation (ISP), to improve deep learning model robustness when trained on noisy brain MRI data. The methods leverage influence functions to either reweigh training samples or inject helpful perturbations, enabling models to better handle various noise patterns. Evaluated on a brain tumor dataset with simulated Gaussian and Rician noise, both methods significantly outperform traditional training approaches, with ISP achieving the highest test accuracy among all baselines.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two influence-based training methods for noisy brain MRI data. ISR dynamically adjusts the importance weights of training samples based on their influence on model performance, giving higher weight to samples that positively contribute to learning. ISP injects perturbations during training based on influence functions to improve model robustness. Both methods are implemented as modifications to standard training procedures and evaluated against naive training, adversarial training, and noise2void-based approaches. The influence functions are computed using Hessian-vector products to estimate each sample's impact on model parameters.

## Key Results
- ISR and ISP achieve higher test accuracy than baseline methods on noisy brain MRI data
- ISP demonstrates the best overall performance among all evaluated methods
- Both methods show significant improvements over naive training approaches
- The methods are effective against both Gaussian and Rician noise patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methods work by leveraging influence functions to identify and utilize the most valuable training samples or perturbations. Influence functions estimate how much each training sample affects the model's parameters and predictions. By reweighing samples based on their positive influence (ISR) or injecting perturbations guided by influence functions (ISP), the training process becomes more robust to noise. This approach allows the model to focus on samples that contribute meaningfully to learning while mitigating the impact of noisy or uninformative data points.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Influence Functions**
   - Why needed: To estimate each training sample's impact on model parameters and predictions
   - Quick check: Can compute how removing a sample affects the model's loss

2. **Noise Types in MRI**
   - Why needed: Understanding Gaussian vs Rician noise characteristics for proper evaluation
   - Quick check: Can distinguish between different noise patterns in medical imaging

3. **Robust Training Methods**
   - Why needed: To compare new methods against established approaches
   - Quick check: Understand adversarial training and noise injection techniques

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Training Data -> Influence Function Calculator -> ISR/ISP Module -> Model Updates -> Loss Function

Critical Path: The influence function calculation is the computational bottleneck, as it requires Hessian-vector products. The method's effectiveness depends on accurate influence estimation and proper weight/perturbation application.

Design Tradeoffs: ISR trades computational cost for improved sample selection, while ISP trades perturbation complexity for better robustness. Both methods require additional memory for storing influence values.

Failure Signatures: Poor influence function estimation leads to incorrect sample weighting or ineffective perturbations. Large influence values for noisy samples can degrade performance.

First Experiments:
1. Compare influence-based sample weights against random weighting schemes
2. Test different perturbation magnitudes in ISP on validation performance
3. Evaluate computational cost scaling with dataset size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to simulated noise rather than real clinical noise patterns
- Single dataset and classification task evaluation
- Computational cost and scalability concerns for large datasets
- Unclear impact on model performance for clean data

## Confidence

1. ISR and ISP improve robustness to simulated noise (High)
2. ISP outperforms all baseline methods (Medium)
3. Methods are effective for noisy medical imaging data (Low - limited to one dataset and noise type)

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate ISR and ISP on real clinical MRI data with varying noise characteristics to assess real-world applicability
2. Test the methods on diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., different organs, modalities, and classification problems) to determine generalizability
3. Compare computational efficiency and scalability of influence-based methods against other robust training approaches for large-scale medical imaging datasets
