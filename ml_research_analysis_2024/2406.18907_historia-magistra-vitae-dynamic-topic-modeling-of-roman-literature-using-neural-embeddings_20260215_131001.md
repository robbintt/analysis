# Historia Magistra Vitae: Dynamic Topic Modeling of Roman Literature using Neural Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.18907
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18907
- **Authors**: Michael Ginn; Mans Hulden
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: BERTopic produces more interpretable topics than statistical models on Roman literature corpus, though quantitative metrics favor traditional approaches

## Executive Summary
This work evaluates dynamic topic modeling approaches on a corpus of Roman literature spanning 449 BC to AD 600. The authors compare traditional statistical models (LDA, NMF) with a BERT-based neural approach (BERTopic) across multiple metrics. While quantitative evaluation favors statistical models, qualitative analysis reveals that BERTopic produces more interpretable and historically meaningful topics. The neural approach demonstrates advantages in hyperparameter sensitivity and noise robustness, making it potentially more practical for historical research applications despite higher computational requirements.

## Method Summary
The authors apply dynamic topic modeling to a Latin text corpus from the Latin Library, covering Roman literature from 449 BC to AD 600. They implement three approaches: LDA and NMF as traditional statistical baselines, and BERTopic as a neural embedding-based method. All models are configured to produce 10 topics and evaluated using standard coherence metrics (TC-E/m.sc/b.sc/e.sc/d.sc) and generality measures (M/e.sc/a.sc/n.sc P/a.sc/i.sc/r.sc/w.sc/i.sc/s.sc/e.sc J/a.sc/c.sc/c.sc/a.sc/r.sc/d.sc /s.sc/i.sc/m.sc/i.sc/l.sc/a.sc/r.sc). Time slices are created using 25-year bins, and results are visualized through temporal topic frequency plots and word cloud representations.

## Key Results
- BERTopic produces more interpretable and historically meaningful topics despite lower quantitative coherence scores
- Neural approach requires significantly less hyperparameter tuning than statistical models
- BERTopic better handles noise in historical texts, revealing meaningful trends like the rise of Christianity and the fall of the Republic
- Statistical models show one dominant cluster with LDA, while BERTopic creates more balanced topic distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: BERTopic produces more interpretable topics because neural embeddings capture semantic relationships that statistical models miss
- Mechanism: BERTopic uses pre-trained transformer embeddings to create document representations that cluster based on semantic similarity rather than just word co-occurrence patterns
- Core assumption: Semantic embeddings better capture the meaning of historical texts than bag-of-words approaches
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "neural approach requires less hyperparameter tuning and better handles noise, revealing meaningful historical trends"
  - [section] "BERTopic benefits from utilizing embedded document representations to create meaningful clusters of any shape, while the LDA model considers all documents equally"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct quantitative comparison of embedding quality vs. statistical features
- Break condition: If the corpus contains texts with meanings that differ significantly from the pre-training data of the transformer model

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: BERTopic's clustering algorithm provides more flexible topic boundaries than LDA's Dirichlet-based approach
- Mechanism: The HDBSCAN clustering used in BERTopic can identify clusters of varying densities and shapes, while LDA forces all topics to follow a similar probabilistic distribution
- Core assumption: Historical topics have varying levels of granularity and density that cannot be captured by uniform Dirichlet priors
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "BERTopic creates more balanced topic distributions"
  - [method] Weak - no explicit comparison of cluster shapes between approaches
- Break condition: If topics in the corpus are uniformly distributed and follow standard statistical patterns

## Foundational Learning
- No explicit discussion of training data or corpus characteristics that would inform expected model performance
- The authors use the Latin Library corpus but provide limited details about preprocessing or text quality
- No comparison to established benchmarks in historical text analysis

## Architecture Onboarding
- The paper provides minimal architectural details for the neural embedding approach
- Implementation details for BERTopic configuration (embedding model choice, dimensionality reduction) are not specified
- Statistical model hyperparameters (LDA iterations, NMF components) are not detailed
- Code or implementation details are not provided in the paper

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- No explicit open questions are identified in the paper
- The work focuses on empirical comparison rather than theoretical exploration
- Potential extensions to other historical periods or languages are not discussed

## Limitations
- The paper lacks detailed implementation specifications for all three models
- No comparison to state-of-the-art historical text analysis methods
- Limited discussion of corpus preprocessing and text quality issues
- Computational resource requirements for BERTopic are not quantified
- No ablation studies to isolate the impact of different components

## Confidence
- Moderate confidence based on the empirical nature of the comparison
- Results appear methodologically sound but lack depth in architectural analysis
- Limited discussion of potential confounding factors (corpus quality, preprocessing choices)

## Next Checks
- Verify the coherence metrics used and their appropriateness for historical texts
- Examine the specific transformer model used for BERTopic embeddings
- Check if the corpus includes critical periods of Roman literature that could affect results
- Review the preprocessing pipeline for handling ancient Latin texts
