# Debiased Recommendation with Noisy Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.17182
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17182
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes three estimators (OME-EIB, OME-IPS, OME-DR) that extend debiasing methods to account for outcome measurement errors in recommendation systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of unbiased recommendation learning under both missing not at random (MNAR) data and noisy feedback (outcome measurement errors, OME). The authors propose three novel estimators that extend existing debiasing methods to handle outcome measurement errors. They introduce an alternating denoising training approach to jointly correct MNAR and OME effects, providing theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and generalization bounds.

## Method Summary
The paper tackles unbiased recommendation learning under MNAR data and OME by extending existing debiasing estimators (EIB, IPS, DR) to account for outcome measurement errors, resulting in OME-EIB, OME-IPS, and OME-DR estimators. An alternating denoising training approach is proposed to jointly correct both MNAR and OME effects. The methods are evaluated on real-world datasets (Coat, Music, KuaiRec) and a semi-synthetic MovieLens-100K dataset, demonstrating superior performance in accuracy and robustness across varying levels of MNAR and OME.

## Key Results
- Proposed OME estimators outperform existing baselines in minimizing true prediction inaccuracy
- Methods show robust performance across varying levels of MNAR and OME in experiments
- Theoretical analysis provides unbiasedness guarantees and generalization bounds for the proposed estimators

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's approach works by simultaneously addressing two major sources of bias in recommendation systems: MNAR data and outcome measurement errors. By extending existing debiasing estimators to account for noisy feedback, the proposed methods can more accurately estimate true user preferences even when observed ratings are corrupted. The alternating denoising training approach effectively learns both the propensity model and the denoising imputation model in an iterative manner, improving overall estimation accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Propensity modeling**: Understanding how to estimate the probability of observing an interaction given user-item features. Why needed: Crucial for addressing MNAR bias. Quick check: Can you derive the propensity score formula for a logistic regression model?
- **Outcome measurement error**: Grasping the concept of observed ratings differing from true ratings with certain probabilities. Why needed: Central to understanding OME and its impact on recommendation accuracy. Quick check: Can you explain how ρ01 and ρ10 affect the observed rating distribution?
- **Doubly robust estimation**: Understanding how to combine propensity weighting with direct modeling to reduce bias. Why needed: Key to the DR-based approach for handling both MNAR and OME. Quick check: Can you write down the doubly robust estimator formula and explain its components?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Data Preprocessing -> OME Estimators (EIB, IPS, DR) -> Alternating Denoising Training -> Evaluation

**Critical path:**
Preprocessing (binarizing ratings, creating MAR test sets) -> Implement OME estimators -> Alternating training of propensity and denoising models -> Evaluation on test sets

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Extension of existing estimators vs. development of entirely new methods
- Alternating training approach vs. joint optimization of propensity and denoising models
- Use of semi-synthetic data vs. reliance on real-world datasets with naturally occurring OME

**Failure signatures:**
- Poor performance due to inaccurate estimation of OME parameters (ρ01, ρ10)
- High variance in results due to small sample sizes or imbalanced data
- Convergence issues in the alternating training approach

**3 first experiments:**
1. Implement and test OME-EIB estimator on a simple synthetic dataset with known MNAR and OME patterns
2. Compare the performance of OME-IPS and OME-DR estimators on the Coat dataset
3. Analyze the impact of varying OME parameters (ρ01, ρ10) on the performance of the proposed methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:**
How does the OME-DR estimator perform when the measurement error parameters (ρ01 and ρ10) are unknown and must be estimated from the data, rather than being known a priori? The paper proposes an alternating denoising training approach to estimate these parameters but doesn't explicitly analyze the performance impact of this estimation process.

**Open Question 2:**
Can the proposed OME-EIB, OME-IPS, and OME-DR estimators be extended to handle more complex forms of outcome measurement error, such as class-conditional or instance-dependent error structures? The paper focuses on a specific form of OME but doesn't discuss applicability to other error structures.

**Open Question 3:**
How do the proposed OME estimators compare to existing denoising methods in recommendation systems, such as surrogate loss minimization or self-guided denoising learning? The paper compares against some existing methods but doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison to all relevant denoising approaches.

## Limitations
- Reliance on semi-synthetic data generation for OME experiments may not fully capture real-world noise patterns
- Alternating denoising training approach lacks detailed implementation specifics that could impact reproducibility
- Performance gains may be partially attributed to controlled experimental setup rather than inherent superiority of proposed methods

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework and estimator design: High
- Experimental results and practical performance: Medium
- Alternating denoising training approach details: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments on additional real-world datasets with naturally occurring OME to validate generalizability beyond semi-synthetic settings
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of propensity modeling and denoising imputation to overall performance improvements
3. Investigate sensitivity of proposed methods to variations in OME parameters and MNAR mechanisms to assess robustness across different data conditions
