# Ensemble Methods for Sequence Classification with Hidden Markov Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2409.07619
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07619
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** HMM-e ensemble framework improves performance on imbalanced sequence classification tasks compared to single HMMs and deep learning baselines

## Executive Summary
This work introduces HMM-e, an ensemble framework for sequence classification using Hidden Markov Models. The method addresses class imbalance by training diverse models on random subsets of data and combining their likelihood scores into composite metrics. The approach improves performance on imbalanced datasets compared to both single HMMs and deep learning baselines like CNNs and LSTMs, achieving higher average precision and AUC. The method is model-agnostic and supports multi-class settings, offering a robust, interpretable alternative for sequence modeling in data-scarce environments.

## Method Summary
HMM-e trains multiple HMMs per class on random subsets of the training data, creating diverse models that capture different patterns. For classification, sequences are evaluated under all models and composite scores are computed via pairwise likelihood comparisons between positive and negative class models. The framework can be used directly with composite scores or as feature extractors for downstream classifiers. The approach handles variable sequence lengths through model-driven normalization, comparing relative likelihoods rather than absolute values.

## Key Results
- Outperforms single HMMs and deep learning baselines (CNNs, LSTMs) on genomic sequence classification tasks
- Achieves higher average precision and AUC scores, particularly on imbalanced datasets
- Demonstrates effective handling of variable sequence lengths through composite scoring
- Shows utility as both standalone classifier and feature extractor for downstream models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Training models on random data subsets ensures diversity and robustness under class imbalance. Random subsampling creates distinct patterns captured by each model while maintaining collective modeling of the entire data distribution. Core assumption: random subsampling produces sufficiently diverse subsets. Evidence: ensemble-based scoring method achieves high average precisions and AUCs. Break condition: highly overlapping subsets eliminate diversity benefits.

### Mechanism 2
Composite scoring enables fair comparison of sequences of varying lengths by using pairwise likelihood comparisons rather than absolute values. This approach normalizes for sequence length by comparing relative likelihoods across models. Core assumption: pairwise comparisons are length-independent. Evidence: method enables comparison of sequences of any length. Break condition: non-discriminative model likelihoods fail to separate classes.

### Mechanism 3
Using HMM ensemble scores as features for downstream classifiers improves performance beyond raw likelihoods alone. Likelihood vectors serve as high-dimensional features capturing different aspects of sequence behavior. Core assumption: feature space contains sufficient information for class separation. Evidence: combination with downstream models outperforms established deep-learning baselines. Break condition: overfitting occurs when feature dimensionality exceeds training sample size.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Hidden Markov Models and the forward-backward algorithm
  - Why needed here: Ensemble approach relies on training multiple HMMs and computing sequence likelihoods
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the forward-backward algorithm computes the likelihood of a sequence given an HMM?

- **Concept:** Ensemble learning and diversity
  - Why needed here: Method depends on training diverse models on random data subsets
  - Quick check question: Why does training models on random subsets of data improve ensemble performance compared to training on the full dataset?

- **Concept:** Feature extraction and representation learning
  - Why needed here: Approach uses HMM likelihood scores as features for downstream classifiers
  - Quick check question: How do likelihood scores from multiple models serve as informative features for classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data preprocessing -> HMM training pipeline (multiple models per class) -> Composite score computation -> Evaluation and downstream modeling -> Hyperparameter search and model selection

- **Critical path:** 1) Load and preprocess dataset, 2) Split data into random subsets for each model, 3) Train HMM ensemble (N positive, M negative models), 4) Compute composite scores for validation data, 5) Evaluate performance (AUC, AP), 6) Optionally train downstream classifier on likelihood features

- **Design tradeoffs:** Larger ensemble size improves performance but increases computation; smaller subset factor increases diversity but may underfit individual models; number of HMM states affects model capacity and training time; composite scores vs. downstream modeling involves simplicity vs. performance tradeoff

- **Failure signatures:** Low ensemble diversity (models too similar) → check subset factor and initialization; poor class separation in composite scores → check if models learn meaningful patterns; overfitting in downstream models → check feature dimensionality vs. training data size; computational bottlenecks → profile training and inference separately

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Train single HMM per class and evaluate baseline performance, 2) Train small ensemble (e.g., 10 models per class) and compare composite score performance, 3) Use ensemble likelihood features to train simple downstream classifier and compare against ensemble scores alone

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Claims about improved performance on imbalanced datasets rely heavily on empirical results without extensive ablation studies on ensemble diversity mechanisms
- Computational cost of training 250 HMMs per class is not discussed, raising scalability questions
- Method's performance relative to other ensemble approaches (beyond deep learning baselines) is not explored

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Ensemble framework is clearly defined and mathematical formulation for composite scoring is sound
- **Medium confidence:** Claim that random subsampling ensures model diversity is plausible but not rigorously validated through similarity metrics
- **Low confidence:** Assertion that pairwise likelihood comparisons normalize for sequence length needs more empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. **Ensemble Diversity Analysis:** Compute pairwise similarity metrics (e.g., KL divergence) between trained HMMs to verify that random subsampling produces diverse models

2. **Ablation Study:** Systematically vary the subset factor and ensemble size to identify optimal tradeoff between diversity and model capacity

3. **Length Normalization Test:** Evaluate composite scoring method on sequences of varying lengths to confirm length normalization is effective and does not introduce bias
