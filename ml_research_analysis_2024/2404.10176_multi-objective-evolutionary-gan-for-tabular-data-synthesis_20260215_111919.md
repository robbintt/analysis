# Multi-objective evolutionary GAN for tabular data synthesis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2404.10176
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10176
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GAN-based synthetic tabular data generation with balanced utility and minimal disclosure risk using multi-objective evolutionary optimization.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating synthetic tabular data that is both highly useful for analysis and has minimal disclosure risk. The authors propose SMOE-CTGAN, a GAN-based approach that combines CTGAN with multi-objective evolutionary optimisation. Unlike standard GANs, SMOE-CTGAN uses an evolutionary algorithm to balance two objectives: utility (measured by CIO and ROC) and disclosure risk (measured by TCAP). A key innovation is the Improvement Score, which helps select generators that offer high utility with extremely low risk during early training. Experiments on four national census datasets show that SMOE-CTGAN achieves comparable or better utility than CTGAN while significantly reducing risk—often to near-zero or even negative TCAP values, indicating disclosure risk lower than random guessing. The method outperforms CTGAN and approaches the utility of Synthpop and DataSynthesizer, while maintaining a strong advantage in risk reduction. The authors conclude that GANs, enhanced with multi-objective optimisation, can produce highly useful synthetic tabular data with negligible re-identification risk.

## Method Summary
SMOE-CTGAN integrates CTGAN with multi-objective evolutionary optimisation to generate synthetic tabular data balancing utility and disclosure risk. The approach uses an evolutionary algorithm to simultaneously optimise for Conditional Information Obfuscation (CIO), ROC-AUC (utility metrics), and Total Correct Attribution Probability (TCAP, disclosure risk). A novel Improvement Score guides generator selection during training, prioritising models that achieve high utility with minimal risk. The method was evaluated against CTGAN, Synthpop, and DataSynthesizer on four census datasets, demonstrating superior risk reduction while maintaining comparable utility.

## Key Results
- SMOE-CTGAN achieved comparable or better utility than CTGAN while significantly reducing disclosure risk.
- Negative TCAP values were observed, suggesting disclosure risk lower than random guessing.
- The method outperformed CTGAN and approached the utility of Synthpop and DataSynthesizer while maintaining superior risk reduction.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SMOE-CTGAN works by framing synthetic data generation as a multi-objective optimisation problem. Traditional GANs optimise a single objective (typically data fidelity), which can lead to over-fitting and high disclosure risk. By incorporating evolutionary algorithms that simultaneously optimise utility and risk metrics, SMOE-CTGAN finds a Pareto-optimal balance. The Improvement Score is critical—it enables early identification of generators that achieve high utility without compromising privacy, preventing the model from converging to risky solutions. This mechanism allows the model to explore the trade-off space more effectively than single-objective approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Conditional Information Obfuscation (CIO)** - Measures how well synthetic data preserves the statistical relationships between variables while preventing exact reconstruction of sensitive attributes. *Why needed:* Ensures synthetic data remains analytically useful while protecting individual records. *Quick check:* Compare CIO scores between synthetic and real data distributions.

**Total Correct Attribution Probability (TCAP)** - Quantifies the likelihood of correctly re-identifying individuals in synthetic data. *Why needed:* Provides a direct measure of disclosure risk. *Quick check:* Verify TCAP values against random guessing baseline (0.5 for binary, 1/k for k-class).

**Improvement Score** - A metric that evaluates the trade-off between utility gains and risk increases during generator selection. *Why needed:* Guides the evolutionary algorithm toward safe yet useful solutions. *Quick check:* Track Improvement Score trends across generations to ensure monotonic improvement.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Evolutionary Algorithm -> Generator Population -> Multi-objective Evaluation (CIO, ROC, TCAP) -> Selection -> Improvement Score -> Next Generation

**Critical Path:** Generator creation → Multi-objective evaluation → Improvement Score computation → Generator selection → Training iteration

**Design Tradeoffs:** Balancing utility (CIO, ROC) against risk (TCAP) requires careful weight assignment in the evolutionary algorithm. Overemphasis on utility risks disclosure; overemphasis on privacy reduces analytical value.

**Failure Signatures:** Stagnant Improvement Scores indicate premature convergence; consistently high TCAP values suggest insufficient privacy protection; low CIO/ROC values indicate poor utility preservation.

**First Experiments:** 1) Compare SMOE-CTGAN vs CTGAN on a single census dataset with varying TCAP thresholds. 2) Test Improvement Score sensitivity by modifying its weighting parameters. 3) Validate negative TCAP interpretation by cross-referencing with external privacy benchmarks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Negative TCAP interpretation lacks comprehensive validation across diverse datasets.
- No formal privacy guarantees (e.g., differential privacy) are provided.
- Limited evaluation to four census datasets with similar structure reduces generalizability.

## Confidence
- **Utility claims:** High - Well-supported by experimental results on tested datasets.
- **Risk claims:** Medium - TCAP-based metrics are proxy measures; negative values require further validation.
- **Generalizability:** Medium - Results may not extend to non-census or high-dimensional datasets.

## Next Checks
1. Test SMOE-CTGAN on diverse tabular datasets (e.g., medical, financial) to assess generalization.
2. Conduct formal privacy audits or differential privacy analysis to validate TCAP-based risk claims.
3. Compare SMOE-CTGAN’s utility-risk trade-off against non-GAN methods on high-dimensional and sparse datasets.
