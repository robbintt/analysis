# The Framework of a Design Process Language

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2404.13721
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13721
- **Reference count:** 26
- **Primary result:** Proposes a Design Process Language (DPL) using linguistic categories to unify design object and process description, enabling representation of design knowledge for human theorizing and future computer support.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the lack of a rigorous, unified language for describing both design objects and design processes, which hinders scientific progress and computer assistance. The core method proposes a Design Process Language (DPL) based on linguistic categories—verb, preposition, conjunctive relations, and modifiers—to express relationships (sentences) that define concepts. In this framework, design is viewed as an iterative concept-formation process where the designer progressively specifies the design object by relating it to known concepts, while also describing the process via the same relational structures. DPL explicitly includes modal relations (e.g., possibility, futurity) and treats functional and structural aspects within one system. The primary result is a conceptual framework that enables representation of design knowledge for both human theorizing and future computer support, offering a path toward integrated design models and improved automation.

## Method Summary
The method is philosophical/conceptual analysis: (1) Review design literature and intelligence theory (Sternberg) to identify design as relational concept formation. (2) Critique existing knowledge representation systems for expressiveness. (3) Develop DPL by classifying linguistic relations needed for design. (4) Show how DPL can describe both object (e.g., "vessel has hull") and process (e.g., "designer calculates weight"). No algorithmic training is described; the paper proposes a grammar operating on relations but does not define its rules.

## Key Results
- Design knowledge can be captured and manipulated by constructing sentences that relate unknown concepts to known concepts, using a unified set of linguistic relations.
- Modal relations (can, will, must, should) are essential to represent the inherent uncertainty, futurity, and normative aspects of design, distinguishing ability, requirement, and intention.
- A single grammatical system applied to the same set of relation categories can describe both the evolving design object specification and the sequence of design activities (the process), avoiding a bifurcation into separate "object model" and "process model."

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Design knowledge can be captured and manipulated by constructing sentences that relate unknown concepts (the design object) to known concepts, using a unified set of linguistic relations.
- **Mechanism:** The design process is framed as concept formation where the designer incrementally builds a network of relationships (sentences) in design memory. Each sentence uses relations (verbs, prepositions, conjunctions, modifiers) to connect concepts. The DPL provides the grammar and vocabulary, ensuring both object descriptions (e.g., "vessel has hull") and process descriptions (e.g., "designer calculates weight") are expressed in the same relational language. This allows for consistent representation, search, and inference.
- **Core assumption:** Understanding or defining any concept depends entirely on its explicit relations to other concepts; there is no innate, context-free meaning. The system operates on propositional (explicit) knowledge, with semantic (implicit) knowledge anchored only via relationships to known concepts.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "the designer progressively specifies the design object by relating it to known concepts... the design process itself may be described by relating known concepts - by organizing known abilities into particular patterns of activation." [section] Chapter 4 develops this as a communication model where a concept (e.g., ship) is defined only through sentences connecting it to other known concepts (e.g., "has length," "has machinery"). [corpus] Limited direct evidence. Neighbor *Exploring and Verbalizing Academic Ideas by Concept Co-occurrence* supports relational knowledge representation via concept co-occurrence, but does not address process integration. Evidence for this mechanism is primarily internal to the paper's logic.
- **Break condition:** If a concept cannot be connected to any known concept via DPL relations, it remains undefined and unusable. The system fails if it cannot establish a semantic anchor (a relation to a generally understood concept).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Modal relations (can, will, must, should) are essential to represent the inherent uncertainty, futurity, and normative aspects of design, distinguishing ability, requirement, and intention.
- **Mechanism:** Modal verbs modify non-modal (material, intensive, possessive) verb relations to encode epistemic states (possibility, ability) and deontic states (obligation, intention). For example, "pump *can* handle 100 tons" expresses latent ability, while "pump *must* handle 100 tons" expresses a requirement. This allows the same underlying concept ("pump handles 100 tons") to appear in different modal contexts, supporting planning, constraint checking, and hypothesis generation.
- **Core assumption:** Design involves reasoning about future, non-existent states and unfulfilled conditions, which cannot be captured by simple true/false propositions. Modal operators are first-class citizens in the language, not afterthoughts.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "DPL explicitly includes modal relations, or relations describing futurity, possibility, willingness, hypothetical events, and the like." [section] Chapter 5 dedicates a major subsection to modal relations, detailing semantics of *can*, *must*, *should*, *will*, etc., and differentiating their scopes (e.g., *can* for ability, *should* for expectation). [corpus] Neighbor *Learning Planning Abstractions from Language* uses language for planning tasks, indirectly supporting that modality is needed to capture goals and preconditions. However, direct evidence for modal primitives in a design language is not evident in neighbors.
- **Break condition:** Omission or misuse of modal relations leads to conflation of requirement with fact, or ability with execution, causing invalid inferences. The system breaks if it cannot represent or reason about "what if" scenarios or unmet constraints.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** A single grammatical system applied to the same set of relation categories can describe both the evolving design object specification and the sequence of design activities (the process), avoiding a bifurcation into separate "object model" and "process model."
- **Mechanism:** The DPL treats process actions as material verb relations (e.g., "designer writes specification," "program calculates weight"). These are syntactically identical to object-state relations (e.g., "vessel has length"). The difference lies in the modal context and temporal anchoring. A process is represented as a series of enacted sentences (using *do*, *did*, *will do*) that modify design memory. Control knowledge (which action to take next) is also expressed relationally (e.g., "execute A before B").
- **Core assumption:** There is no fundamental ontological divide between "process" and "object"; both are networks of relations. The distinction emerges from how relations are used (e.g., material vs. intensive) and their modal/temporal modifiers.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "DPL ... contains relations used for describing process and object within the same general system." [section] Chapter 5's discussion on material relations explicitly links them to transactions that change memory (process) versus static possession (object). Prepositions like "before" and "after" apply equally to temporal sequences of actions or spatial arrangements of components. [corpus] Neighbor *Toward an Agricultural Operational Design Domain: A Framework* discusses a unified framework for behavior and environment, but not specifically a unified language. Neighbors focus on concept learning or capture, not process/object integration.
- **Break condition:** If the grammar forces a hard separation (e.g., different syntax for actions vs. states), the system cannot dynamically reframe a design activity as a new object definition or vice versa, limiting adaptability and learning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Concept: Relational Concept Formation**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire DPL approach rests on the idea that concepts gain meaning only through their explicit relationships to other concepts. A new designer must internalize that there is no standalone meaning; every definition is a set of relations.
  - **Quick check question:** How would you define the concept "propeller" without referring to any other concepts (e.g., "has blades," "connected to shaft")? What if the target audience knows nothing about ships?
- **Concept: Modal Verb Semantics**
  - **Why needed here:** Modal relations distinguish requirement (*must*), expectation (*should*), ability (*can*), and intention (*will*). Misusing them leads to specifications that cannot be verified or plans that cannot be executed.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the practical difference between writing "deck must support 10 tons/m²" and "deck supports 10 tons/m²" in a design specification?
- **Concept: Transitive/Inversive Preposition Relations**
  - **Why needed here:** Spatial and temporal reasoning in design (e.g., component layout, process sequencing) relies on understanding how prepositions like *above*, *before*, *inside* chain and invert. A single inconsistency breaks layout validation or schedule logic.
  - **Quick check question:** If "A is above B" and "B is above C," what can be inferred? What if "A is inside B" and "B is inside C?"

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Parser/Interpreter -> Relation Engine -> Concept Dictionary -> Modal Logic Module -> Query/Planner
- **Critical path:** A new engineer should first understand the sentence construction paradigm (verb + concepts). Second, learn the seven relation categories and their interplay. Third, practice with simple object descriptions before adding process and modalities. Fourth, study the resolution algorithm: how new sentences trigger searches for missing definitions or conflicting statements.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Expressiveness vs. Ambiguity:** Natural language categories are intuitive but carry ambiguity. The DPL requires strict, context-free definitions for each relation term (e.g., exactly what does *on* mean? Is it purely spatial or also functional?). Over-constraining reduces flexibility; under-constraining causes ambiguous inference.
  - **Unified vs. Layered:** The paper argues against separate process and object models. However, for implementation, one may still store sentences in different "memories" (design vs. long-term), but the underlying representation must be identical.
  - **Propositional vs. Semantic:** The DPL is propositional; all meaning is in relationships. This works if the entire relevant universe is expressible as concepts and relations. Pure geometric or continuous data (e.g., shape) may need to be encoded as semantic concepts with external formulas.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Undefined concept chain:** A sentence introduces a new concept that cannot be grounded via existing relations to any semantic anchor (e.g., "D-object has glurk"). The system cannot interpret or use this.
  - **Modal inconsistency:** A *must* statement never gets a corresponding true proposition (e.g., "hull must be watertight" never followed by evidence that it is). Or, a *can* ability is never mobilized when preconditions are met.
  - **Relation category misuse:** Using an intensive verb (*is*) where a material verb (*moves*) is required to represent state change, causing the system to miss process steps.
  - **Prepositional violation:** Violating transitivity (e.g., A above B, B above C, but C above A). The system cannot maintain a consistent spatial or temporal layout.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Object description test:** Input: "Vessel has hull. Hull has length. Length is 100m." Verify system stores these sentences and can answer "What is vessel length?" by chaining *has* and *is*. Check that "hull" is now known as a concept defining part of "vessel."
  2. **Modal requirement propagation:** Input: "Deck must support 10 tons/m²" and "Deck has area 200m²." Expect the system to infer the missing requirement: "Deck total load must be ≤ 2000 tons." Test if it flags an inconsistency if later given "Deck total load is 2500 tons."
  3. **Process as object test:** Input a process: "Designer will calculate weight." Verify that "will calculate" is a distinct modal/material relation from "calculates" (present) and "calculated" (past). Then add: "Calculation is finished." Check if the system can interpret that the *will* relation is satisfied and update the modal state to *did calculate*.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can Sternberg's seven-component model of intelligent behavior fully account for the cognitive processes involved in engineering design as conceptualized by the Design Process Language (DPL)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author explicitly states in the "Further work" section that one should "Investigate whether design activity is usefully explained in terms of Sternberg's seven components." This aligns with the paper's earlier discussion linking design to information processing theory.
- Why unresolved: The proposed correspondence between Sternberg's meta-components (e.g., problem structuring, strategy selection) and DPL's relational operations remains hypothetical. No empirical validation exists to confirm that all design phenomena map onto these seven components or that DPL's relational framework captures them fully.
- What evidence would resolve it: Coding design protocols (e.g., think-aloud sessions) using both Sternberg's component framework and DPL's relational taxonomy. High inter-mapping agreement across multiple design tasks would support the alignment, while systematic mismatches would indicate gaps needing theoretical refinement.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Which categories of relations (e.g., material verbal, modal, prepositional) are most critical for effectively representing both design objects and processes in the Design Process Language?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The "Further work" section lists investigating "what kinds of relations among concepts are most important" as a key task. Chapter 5 defines multiple relation categories but does not prioritize their utility.
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces relation categories comprehensively but provides no empirical data on their relative importance for different design contexts (e.g., conceptual vs. detailed design). Designer preferences, domain-specific needs, and effectiveness in automated reasoning remain unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Corpus analysis of design documents and protocols to quantify usage frequency of each relation category. Complementary expert surveys rating the expressiveness and necessity of each category for various design tasks. Consistent patterns across domains would establish critical categories.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the proposed set of modal relations (can, could, may, might, should, will, must, etc.) in DPL epistemologically adequate to represent all necessary modalities (e.g., futurity, possibility, requirement, intention) in design reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author emphasizes modal relations as important and explicitly recommends investigating "whether the set of modal relations is an 'epistemologically adequate' set" in the "Further work" section.
- Why unresolved: The modal set is derived from linguistic categories but may not exhaust all modal nuances needed in design (e.g., gradations of obligation, conditional likelihood, hypothetical revision). Unclear if current terms avoid ambiguity or insufficient coverage for formal design reasoning and automation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic analysis of design problem statements, specifications, and reasoning traces to identify modal expressions. Verifying that all intended modal meanings map uniquely onto DPL's modal relations without loss would demonstrate adequacy; discovering frequent mismatches would signal needed extensions.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can observed design behaviors be systematically categorized using the relational taxonomy of DPL to validate its coverage of design phenomena and identify missing relation types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The "Further work" section directs researchers to "classify phenomena detected in design behavior in terms of the relations used to describe these phenomena as defined in the Design Process Language framework."
- Why unresolved: The DPL framework remains untested against real design data. Its relation categories have not been applied to classify actual design activities, decisions, and knowledge transformations, leaving uncertain whether the taxonomy can capture the full spectrum of design phenomena without gaps.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying DPL relations to code design session recordings (verbal, written, or computational). Detection of uncodable behavioral segments would reveal missing relation types, while comprehensive coverage across diverse design tasks would validate the framework's completeness and highlight necessary refinements.

## Limitations
- The exact grammatical rules for interpreting sentences in DPL are not defined, leaving ambiguity in implementation.
- The scope and boundaries of DPL are unclear; no concrete examples show complex design reasoning across multiple stages.
- The paper does not address how to handle open-world assumption and knowledge gaps in real design scenarios.

## Confidence
- **Mechanism 1 (Relational Concept Formation):** Medium confidence. While the relational approach is philosophically coherent and supported by concept co-occurrence literature, the paper lacks empirical validation of its sufficiency for complex design tasks.
- **Mechanism 2 (Modal Relations):** Medium confidence. The paper provides detailed semantics for modal operators, but their practical utility in design reasoning is not demonstrated.
- **Mechanism 3 (Unified Process/Object Description):** Medium confidence. The theoretical argument against separating process and object models is compelling, but implementation challenges (e.g., handling continuous vs. discrete knowledge) are not addressed.

## Next Checks
1. **Test Modality Propagation:** Implement a simple system to track modal requirement satisfaction. Input "Pump must flow 100 L/min" and later "Pump flows 90 L/min." Verify the system correctly flags the unsatisfied requirement.
2. **Validate Transitive Prepositions:** Create a test case with chained spatial relations: "A is above B," "B is above C." Confirm the system can infer "A is above C" and detect violations (e.g., "C is above A" creates a cycle).
3. **Resolve Composed Attributes:** Build a resolver for attribute dependencies. Given "weight = density × volume" and object descriptions, test if the system can compute "weight of hull" by recursively resolving "density of steel" and "volume of hull."
