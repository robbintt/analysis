# Identifiability of a statistical model with two latent vectors: Importance of the dimensionality relation and application to graph embedding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.19760
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19760
- Reference count: 8
- Key outcome: Establishes identifiability conditions for a model with two latent vectors and auxiliary data, revealing dimensionality relationships, and applies this to graph embedding.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the identifiability of a statistical model with two latent vectors and single auxiliary data, generalizing nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA). The key contributions are establishing various identifiability conditions for the proposed model, applying the identifiability theory to a statistical model for graph data, and proposing a practical method for identifiable graph embedding called graph component analysis (GCA). The paper provides a significant step towards interpretable data representation learning in unsupervised settings by establishing identifiable conditions for models with two latent vectors.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a statistical model with two latent vectors and single auxiliary data, generalizing nonlinear ICA. The model's identifiability conditions are established under various assumptions, revealing insightful dimensionality relationships among the latent vectors and auxiliary data. The paper also proposes a practical method for identifiable graph embedding called graph component analysis (GCA), which is based on density ratio estimation. GCA is evaluated on synthetic graph data generated from the proposed generative model, demonstrating its ability to recover latent vectors and the dependence of model identifiability on the maximum value of link weights in graph data.

## Key Results
- Establishes various identifiability conditions for a model with two latent vectors and auxiliary data, revealing insightful dimensionality relationships.
- Proves that the indeterminacies of the proposed model are the same as linear ICA under certain conditions.
- Demonstrates that identifiability of the statistical model for graph data depends on the maximum value of link weights.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The model achieves identifiability when the sum of the dimensionalities of the two latent vectors and auxiliary data is at least twice the dimensionality of the target latent vector.
- Mechanism: The statistical dependencies encoded in the conditional distribution over latent variables given auxiliary data provide sufficient constraints to break the inherent symmetries of nonlinear ICA.
- Core assumption: The conditional distribution takes a specific form with separable functions of individual latent variables and auxiliary data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Unlike previous work, the two latent vectors in the proposed model can have arbitrary dimensions, and this property enables us to reveal an insightful dimensionality relation among two latent vectors and auxiliary data in identifiability conditions."
  - [section 3.2]: "Theorem 1... Dimensionality assumption: 2ds ≤ dv + dw"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no directly comparable identifiability results with similar dimensional relationships found.
- Break condition: If the auxiliary data dimensionality is too small relative to the target latent vector, or if the conditional distribution does not separate into the required form.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Full identifiability (up to permutation and scales) is achieved when both latent vectors have equal dimensionality and the conditional distribution is elementwise separable.
- Mechanism: Equal dimensionality and elementwise separability of the conditional distribution allow for unique recovery of the mixing functions without residual nonlinearities.
- Core assumption: ds = dv and the conditional distribution is of the form log psv|w(s, v|w) = Σ q(i)(s(i), v(i), w).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "surprisingly, we prove that the indeterminacies of the proposed model has the same as linear ICA under certain conditions"
  - [section 3.3]: "Theorem 3... ds = dv =: d and the conditional distribution psv|w can be expressed as (9)"
  - [corpus]: No direct matches; the claim of linear-ICA-level identifiability in a nonlinear setting appears novel.
- Break condition: If the dimensionality condition fails or the conditional distribution cannot be expressed in the required elementwise form.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: For graph embedding applications, identifiability depends on the maximum link weight relative to the latent dimension.
- Mechanism: Higher maximum link weights provide stronger constraints in the conditional distribution, enabling unique recovery of the embedding function.
- Core assumption: The conditional distribution over link weights given latent variables satisfies the same form as in Theorem 3.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "As a result, one of the identifiability conditions includes an appealing implication: Identifiability of the statistical model could depend on the maximum value of link weights in graph data."
  - [section 5.2]: "Corollary 5... The maximum link state K has to be equal to or larger than ds"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no directly comparable results linking link weight magnitude to identifiability.
- Break condition: If the maximum link state is smaller than the latent dimension, or if the link weights do not follow the assumed distribution.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Smooth embeddings and manifolds
  - Why needed here: The latent variables are mapped to embedded submanifolds of the data space, which is essential for the identifiability proofs.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a smooth embedding and a general smooth map?

- Concept: Conditional independence and statistical dependencies
  - Why needed here: The identifiability conditions rely on specific forms of conditional independence or dependence among latent variables and auxiliary data.
  - Quick check question: How does conditional independence differ from unconditional independence in the context of ICA?

- Concept: Jacobian rank conditions and full-rank matrices
  - Why needed here: The proofs require checking that certain matrices (e.g., Jacobians of inverse functions) have full rank to ensure unique recovery.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for a matrix to have full rank, and why is this important for identifiability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data vectors and link weights -> Latent variable model with two latent vectors (s, v) and auxiliary data (w) -> Identifiability conditions (Theorems 1-3, Proposition 4) -> Graph Component Analysis (GCA) method -> Estimated latent vectors
- Critical path: Data → Latent variable model → Check identifiability conditions → Apply method (e.g., GCA) → Estimate latent variables
- Design tradeoffs: Relaxing the dimensionality conditions may improve practical applicability but could weaken identifiability guarantees. Using auxiliary data enables identifiability but requires careful selection of relevant signals.
- Failure signatures: Poor recovery of latent variables, especially when the dimensionality conditions are violated or the auxiliary data is uninformative.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate synthetic data with known latent structure and test the recovery of latent variables under varying dimensionality conditions.
  2. Apply the GCA method to graph data with different maximum link states and measure the impact on latent vector recovery.
  3. Investigate the effect of violating the conditional distribution assumptions (e.g., non-separable forms) on identifiability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Under what specific conditions on the latent vectors s and v does Proposition 4 guarantee the removal of indeterminacy for nonlinear functions, and how does this compare to the indeterminacy conditions in linear ICA?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Proposition 4 states that when the conditional distribution psv|w satisfies a specific linear relationship between s(i) and v(i) for each i, the indeterminacy of elementwise nonlinear functions is removed, resulting in identifiability up to permutation, scales, and additive constants.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide concrete examples or simulations demonstrating the practical implications of this proposition or the specific types of functions q(i) that would satisfy the required conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Numerical experiments showing the recovery of s from data generated with different types of q(i) functions, some satisfying the linear relationship in Proposition 4 and others not, would clarify the practical applicability and limitations of this result.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the dimensionality relation among the latent vectors s and v, and the auxiliary data w, affect the identifiability of the proposed model, and what are the implications for choosing the dimensionality of the auxiliary data in practical applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Theorems 1, 2, and 3 establish identifiability conditions that explicitly depend on the dimensionalities of s, v, and w, revealing insightful relationships between these dimensions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide concrete guidance on how to choose the dimensionality of the auxiliary data w in practice to ensure identifiability, especially when dealing with limited data or specific applications like graph embedding.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of the proposed methods (GCA) with different dimensionalities of the auxiliary data w on various datasets, including graph data, would provide insights into the practical implications of the dimensionality conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed generative model for graph data relate to other existing models for graph embedding, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of using this model in terms of identifiability and interpretability of the learned embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper applies the identifiability theory to a statistical model for graph data and establishes identifiability conditions, one of which includes an appealing implication about the maximum value of link weights affecting identifiability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the proposed model with other existing models for graph embedding, such as matrix factorization methods or deep learning-based approaches, in terms of identifiability, interpretability, and performance on real-world graph datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies on various graph datasets, evaluating the identifiability, interpretability, and performance of the proposed GCA method against other state-of-the-art graph embedding methods, would provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.

## Limitations

- The empirical validation relies on synthetic graph data, which may not fully capture real-world complexities.
- The proposed GCA method depends on density ratio estimation, which can be sensitive to model misspecification and hyperparameter tuning.
- The assumption that the conditional distribution takes a specific separable form may be restrictive in practice.

## Confidence

- Confidence in the identifiability results (Theorems 1-3, Proposition 4): High
- Confidence in the application to graph embedding (GCA method): Medium
- Confidence in the claim that maximum link weight magnitude affects identifiability: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Test the robustness of GCA on real-world graph datasets with varying link weight distributions to assess practical identifiability beyond synthetic settings.

2. Systematically evaluate the impact of violating the dimensionality condition (2ds ≤ dv + dw) on latent vector recovery to better understand the practical limits of the theory.

3. Investigate the sensitivity of the density ratio estimation in GCA to different neural network architectures and optimization strategies to ensure stable performance across implementations.
