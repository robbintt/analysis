# Composite Bayesian Optimization In Function Spaces Using NEON -- Neural Epistemic Operator Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.03099

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces NEON (Neural Epistemic Operator Networks), a parameter-efficient method for quantifying epistemic uncertainty in operator learning models. NEON combines the Epistemic Neural Network (ENN) framework with operator learning architectures to generate predictions with uncertainty using a single model backbone. The authors demonstrate NEON's effectiveness for composite Bayesian Optimization, where the goal is to optimize a function that is a composition of a known, cheap-to-compute functional and an unknown map that outputs elements of a function space. Through experiments on various benchmarks including environmental modeling, chemical reaction systems, optical interferometry, and cellular network optimization, NEON achieves state-of-the-art performance while being significantly more parameter-efficient than existing methods like deep ensembles.

## Method Summary
NEON integrates epistemic uncertainty quantification directly into operator learning architectures by extending the Epistemic Neural Network framework to handle function-space predictions. The method uses a single model backbone to generate both predictions and uncertainty estimates, contrasting with deep ensembles that require multiple trained models. For composite Bayesian Optimization, NEON combines this uncertainty-aware operator learning with the Leaky Expected Improvement (L-EI) acquisition function, a variant of Expected Improvement designed to facilitate optimization while maintaining similar local extrema. The approach is specifically tailored for scenarios where the objective function is a composition of a known functional and an unknown operator mapping to function spaces.

## Key Results
- NEON achieves state-of-the-art performance in composite Bayesian Optimization across multiple benchmarks
- Uses orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters compared to deep ensemble methods
- Demonstrates effectiveness on diverse applications including environmental modeling, chemical reactions, optical interferometry, and cellular network optimization
- The Leaky Expected Improvement acquisition function facilitates optimization while retaining similar local extrema to standard Expected Improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NEON works by integrating epistemic uncertainty quantification directly into the operator learning architecture rather than relying on ensemble methods. This is achieved through the ENN framework, which learns to predict both the output function and its associated uncertainty from a single model backbone. The key insight is that epistemic uncertainty in operator learning can be captured through the model's internal representations rather than requiring multiple independent models. For composite BO, this uncertainty quantification is combined with the L-EI acquisition function, which modifies the standard Expected Improvement to better handle the exploration-exploitation trade-off in function space optimization. The single-model approach maintains computational efficiency while providing reliable uncertainty estimates that guide the optimization process.

## Foundational Learning

**Epistemic Uncertainty**: Uncertainty arising from limited data or model knowledge rather than inherent randomness. Needed because operator learning often faces data scarcity in function spaces. Quick check: Compare predictive variance to data density.

**Operator Learning**: Learning mappings between function spaces rather than finite-dimensional spaces. Needed because many scientific problems involve infinite-dimensional inputs/outputs. Quick check: Verify functional consistency across input function variations.

**Bayesian Optimization**: Sequential optimization framework using probabilistic models to balance exploration and exploitation. Needed for efficient optimization of expensive black-box functions. Quick check: Monitor acquisition function behavior during optimization.

**Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs)**: Neural networks designed to quantify epistemic uncertainty through their architecture. Needed to avoid computationally expensive ensemble methods. Quick check: Validate uncertainty estimates through calibration tests.

**Function Space Composition**: Optimization problems where the objective is a composition of known and unknown functionals. Needed for realistic scientific modeling scenarios. Quick check: Test with varying composition structures.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Functions -> Operator Network (NEON) -> Epistemic Predictions -> L-EI Acquisition -> Candidate Selection -> Next Query

**Critical Path**: The operator network processes input functions to generate both predictions and uncertainty estimates, which feed into the L-EI acquisition function to select the next evaluation point. This loop continues until convergence.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Single-model uncertainty quantification versus ensemble methods (parameter efficiency vs. potential overconfidence), L-EI versus standard EI (optimization facilitation vs. theoretical guarantees), function-space versus finite-dimensional representations (generality vs. computational complexity).

**Failure Signatures**: Overconfident predictions in data-sparse regions, premature convergence due to exploration-exploitation imbalance, poor generalization across different function compositions, computational bottlenecks in high-dimensional function spaces.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test NEON on a simple 1D function composition benchmark to verify basic functionality
2. Compare NEON's uncertainty estimates against deep ensemble baselines on a synthetic operator learning task
3. Evaluate the L-EI acquisition function's behavior compared to standard EI on a toy optimization problem

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Primary validation focuses on synthetic benchmarks and relatively low-dimensional function spaces, with limited testing on high-dimensional real-world scientific problems
- Computational complexity trade-offs between NEON and ensemble methods during training (time and memory) are not thoroughly addressed
- The Leaky Expected Improvement acquisition function lacks comprehensive theoretical analysis of convergence properties

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: NEON's parameter efficiency claims and basic uncertainty quantification capabilities
- **Medium Confidence**: Composite BO performance improvements over baselines require additional validation on more diverse real-world problems
- **Medium Confidence**: L-EI acquisition function effectiveness needs more rigorous theoretical grounding and broader empirical testing

## Next Checks
1. Test NEON on high-dimensional real-world operator learning problems (climate modeling, fluid dynamics) with complex compositions and noisy data
2. Conduct systematic ablation studies comparing training time, memory usage, and inference speed between NEON and ensemble methods across different problem scales
3. Perform theoretical analysis of L-EI acquisition function convergence properties and conduct controlled experiments comparing it with alternative acquisition functions in exploration-exploitation critical settings
