# Mitigating the Curse of Dimensionality for Certified Robustness via Dual Randomized Smoothing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2404.09586
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09586
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Dual Randomized Smoothing (DRS) partitions images into two lower-dimensional sub-images and smooths each independently, achieving superior certified robustness with a rate of (1/√m + 1/√n) where m + n = d.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Dual Randomized Smoothing (DRS) to address the curse of dimensionality in Randomized Smoothing (RS) for certified robustness. DRS partitions high-dimensional input images into two lower-dimensional sub-images and smooths each independently with Gaussian noise. The method theoretically guarantees a tight ℓ2 certified robustness radius and achieves a superior upper bound on robustness radius that decreases at a rate of (1/√m + 1/√n) where m + n = d. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate that DRS consistently outperforms standard RS in both accuracy and certified robustness when integrated with existing RS methods like Gaussian augmentation, consistency regularization, and diffusion-denoising.

## Method Summary
DRS mitigates the curse of dimensionality by partitioning input images into two lower-dimensional sub-images using 2×2 pixel-index matrices, then independently smoothing each sub-image with Gaussian noise. The method trains two separate base classifiers on the noise-corrupted sub-images, aggregates their probability outputs, and uses Monte Carlo sampling to estimate certified robustness bounds. DRS is integrated with existing RS techniques including Gaussian augmentation, consistency regularization, and diffusion-denoising to enhance both accuracy and certified robustness.

## Key Results
- DRS achieves superior upper bound on ℓ2 robustness radius with rate (1/√m + 1/√n) where m + n = d
- Consistently improves certified accuracy and average certified robustness across different noise levels
- Model ensemble further enhances DRS performance
- Outperforms standard RS in both accuracy and certified robustness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: DRS mitigates curse of dimensionality by partitioning high-dimensional input into two lower-dimensional sub-images and smoothing each independently.
- **Mechanism**: DRS reduces uncertainty inherent in high-dimensional isotropic Gaussian noise by operating in lower-dimensional spaces (m and n dimensions where m + n = d), decreasing the rate at which certified robustness radius diminishes.
- **Core assumption**: Spatial redundancy in images allows meaningful partitioning without significant loss of classification-relevant information.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "The proposed Dual Randomized Smoothing (DRS) down-samples the input image into two sub-images and smooths the two sub-images in lower dimensions." [section] "To minimize the information loss caused by the partition of the input for the classification, this paper harnesses the spatial redundancy inherent in the image and partitions the input through image down-sampling with two predefined indexes."
- **Break condition**: If spatial redundancy assumption fails (e.g., highly non-redundant inputs like random noise), DRS performance degrades significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: DRS provides tight ℓ2 certified robustness radius for original high-dimensional input through dual smoothing in lower-dimensional space.
- **Mechanism**: Certified radius R is calculated as σ√2(Φ−1(plA) + Φ−1(prA)), combining robustness contributions from both sub-images to guarantee same certification level as full-dimensional smoothing with reduced uncertainty.
- **Core assumption**: Smoothed classifier based on averaging probabilities from both sub-images maintains same adversarial vulnerability properties as standard RS.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "Theoretically, we prove that DRS guarantees a tight ℓ2 certified robustness radius for the original input." [section] "Theorem 2... Then g(x + δ) = cA establishes for all adversarial perturbations δ satisfying that ∥δ∥2 ≤ R, where: R = σ√2(Φ−1(plA) + Φ−1(prA) − 2Φ−1(˜p/2))."
- **Break condition**: If averaging of probabilities from sub-images doesn't accurately represent original image's classification behavior.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: DRS achieves superior upper bound on ℓ2 robustness radius that decreases at rate (1/√m + 1/√n) where m + n = d.
- **Mechanism**: By splitting input dimension d into m and n, DRS effectively reduces 1/√d decay rate to (1/√m + 1/√n), significantly slower for balanced partitions.
- **Core assumption**: Upper bound formula from Proposition 1 applies independently to each sub-image and can be combined additively.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "DRS attains a superior upper bound on the ℓ2 robustness radius, which decreases proportionally at a rate of (1/√m + 1/√n) with m + n = d." [section] "Equation 15... signifies that compared with RS, the DRS, which employs smoothing within the lower-dimensional space, exhibits a significantly more favorable upper bound for ℓ2 certified radius."
- **Break condition**: If upper bound calculation doesn't hold for certain distributions or if sub-image dependencies violate independence assumptions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Randomized Smoothing (RS) fundamentals
  - **Why needed here**: DRS builds directly on RS theory, extending it to dual smoothing
  - **Quick check question**: What is the certified radius formula for standard RS with confidence level p?

- **Concept**: Neyman-Pearson lemma and its application to robustness certification
  - **Why needed here**: Theorem 1 (tightness of RS) relies on this lemma, which DRS extends
  - **Quick check question**: How does the Neyman-Pearson lemma guarantee tight robustness bounds?

- **Concept**: Curse of dimensionality and its impact on high-dimensional statistics
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding why RS degrades with dimension is crucial for appreciating DRS's value
  - **Quick check question**: Why does the certified radius of RS scale as 1/√d with input dimension d?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input → Downsample → Add Noise → Interpolate → Classify → Aggregate → Sample → Estimate Lower Bound → Certify
- **Critical path**: Input → Downsample → Add Noise → Interpolate → Classify → Aggregate → Sample → Estimate Lower Bound → Certify
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Partition strategy: 2×2 diagonal indexing maximizes information retention vs. alternative downsampling methods
  - Noise level selection: {0.18, 0.36} vs. {0.25, 0.50} balances accuracy and robustness differently
  - Sampling budget: 100,000 samples provides tight bounds but increases computational cost
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Degraded accuracy with high noise levels indicates information loss during downsampling
  - Certification failure (ABSTAIN) suggests classifier inconsistency between sub-images
  - Unexpectedly low certified radii may indicate violated independence assumptions
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Verify downsampling preserves class-discriminative information by comparing classification accuracy on sub-images vs. original
  2. Test sensitivity to partition strategy by comparing diagonal indexing vs. random or checkerboard patterns
  3. Measure computational overhead of DRS vs. RS across different sampling budgets and noise levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the choice of partition size (m, n) affect the trade-off between accuracy and robustness in DRS?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper states that DRS achieves a superior upper bound for ℓ2 certified radius at a rate of (1/√m + 1/√n) with m + n = d, but doesn't explore the impact of different partition sizes on accuracy and robustness.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper doesn't provide experiments or analysis on how varying m and n affects the performance of DRS.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experiments comparing DRS with different partition sizes (m, n) on the same dataset and noise levels, showing the trade-off between accuracy and robustness for each partition size.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can DRS be extended to partition the input into more than two sub-images (k-partitioning) while maintaining or improving its performance?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper briefly discusses the feasibility of k-partitioning based smoothing but doesn't provide a concrete implementation or analysis of its performance.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper only explores the case of k=2 and mentions that the objective function for k>2 is non-convex, making it challenging to find a numerically stable solution for the global minimum.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An implementation of DRS with k-partitioning (k>2) and experiments comparing its performance with DRS (k=2) on the same dataset and noise levels, showing whether k-partitioning improves or degrades the accuracy and robustness.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does the choice of noise variance (σl, σr) for each sub-image in DRS affect its performance?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper briefly discusses the feasibility of using Gaussian noise with different variances to smooth the sub-images in DRS but doesn't provide experiments or analysis on the impact of different noise variances.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper only mentions the theoretical analysis of the certified robustness boundary for DRS under different variances smoothing but doesn't explore the practical implications on accuracy and robustness.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experiments comparing DRS with different noise variances (σl, σr) on the same dataset and partition sizes, showing the trade-off between accuracy and robustness for each noise variance configuration.

## Limitations
- Theoretical foundation relies heavily on spatial redundancy assumptions that may not hold for all input types
- Limited experimental validation to only two datasets (CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) with specific noise levels
- Modest performance gains over RS in some cases
- Computational overhead of processing two sub-images separately is not fully characterized

## Confidence
- **High Confidence** (well-supported by evidence):
  - DRS successfully partitions images into lower-dimensional sub-images
  - Theoretical proof of tight ℓ2 certified robustness radius
  - Superior upper bound formula with (1/√m + 1/√n) rate
- **Medium Confidence** (partially supported):
  - DRS consistently improves certified accuracy over RS
  - Integration with existing RS methods enhances both accuracy and robustness
  - Model ensemble further improves DRS performance
- **Low Confidence** (weakly supported or speculative):
  - Generalization to non-image domains with spatial redundancy
  - Performance on datasets with different spatial characteristics
  - Scalability to extremely high-dimensional inputs

## Next Checks
1. **Partition Strategy Robustness**: Test DRS with alternative downsampling methods (random indexing, checkerboard patterns, adaptive partitioning) to verify that the 2×2 diagonal approach is optimal.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Evaluate DRS on non-image data (e.g., audio spectrograms, medical imaging) where spatial redundancy assumptions may differ significantly.

3. **Computational Efficiency Analysis**: Measure and compare the computational overhead of DRS versus RS across different sampling budgets and noise levels, including wall-clock time and memory usage.
