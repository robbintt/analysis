# DRL-Based Resource Allocation for Motion Blur Resistant Federated Self-Supervised Learning in IoV

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.09194
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09194
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: DRL-BFSSL combines motion blur-resistant federated self-supervised learning with DRL-based resource allocation to minimize energy consumption and delay while improving model accuracy in IoV.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of federated self-supervised learning in Internet of Vehicles where motion blur from vehicle movement degrades model performance and increases resource consumption. The authors propose DRL-BFSSL, which integrates a motion blur-resistant learning method (SimCo) with a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based resource allocation strategy. The approach achieves better classification accuracy, lower energy consumption, and reduced delay compared to existing methods, particularly when dealing with motion blur in vehicle-captured images.

## Method Summary
The DRL-BFSSL framework operates through three main components: vehicles capture images and perform local SimCo-based training using dual temperature loss; the base station estimates motion blur from vehicle velocity and aggregates weighted models; and a SAC agent allocates CPU frequency and transmission power to minimize energy and delay while meeting blur and error rate constraints. The system processes CIFAR-10 data over multiple episodes with vehicles following truncated Gaussian velocity distributions.

## Key Results
- DRL-BFSSL achieves 2.3% higher Top1 accuracy than CADD and 1.5% higher than FDML on motion-blurred CIFAR-10
- Energy consumption reduced by 18% compared to CADD baseline
- Average delay decreased by 22% compared to FDML baseline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dual temperature in SimCo removes the need for a shared negative sample dictionary, thus protecting privacy in federated settings.
- Mechanism: By replacing the momentum encoder dictionary with a dual temperature contrastive loss, vehicles can train local models without uploading any negative sample references, eliminating a key privacy leakage vector.
- Core assumption: Dual temperature sampling sufficiently controls the distribution of negative samples locally.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Simplified Contrast (SimCo) addresses the privacy leakage issue in MoCo-based FSSL by using dual temperature instead of a dictionary to control sample distribution."
  - [section] "The improved MoCo method Simplified Contrast (SimCo) uses dual temperature to control sample distribution to eliminate the usage of dictionary."
  - [corpus] Weak: No corpus evidence found for SimCo's dual temperature efficacy.
- Break condition: If dual temperature fails to approximate the effect of a large dictionary, local training performance degrades and privacy benefits vanish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Motion blur level is used as a weighting factor during model aggregation to mitigate its negative impact on model performance.
- Mechanism: The BS estimates the blur level from vehicle velocity, then weights each local model's contribution inversely to its blur level before averaging into the global model.
- Core assumption: Higher vehicle velocity correlates linearly with motion blur severity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we utilize the level of motion blur as a crucial weighting factor on IID and Non-IID datasets during model aggregation."
  - [section] "According to Eq. (45), we assign smaller weights to the parameters obtained from training vehicles with higher blur levels in the local model, thus reducing the impact of the motion blur and improving the performance of the global model."
  - [corpus] Weak: No corpus evidence for blur-level-based weighting in federated learning.
- Break condition: If velocity-based blur estimation is inaccurate or blur impact is non-linear, the weighting scheme misallocates model contributions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SAC-based resource allocation jointly optimizes CPU frequency and transmission power to minimize energy and delay while meeting blur- and error-rate constraints.
- Mechanism: SAC's entropy-regularized policy explores continuous action space (power, frequency) to solve the non-convex resource allocation problem under packet error and blur constraints.
- Core assumption: The optimization problem is effectively non-convex and benefits from reinforcement learning rather than convex optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we address energy consumption and delay in the BFSSL process by proposing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based resource allocation scheme, called DRL-BFSSL."
  - [section] "The optimization problem C is a NonLinear Programming (NLP) problem... we adopt SAC algorithm to solve the optimization problem C."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct corpus evidence linking SAC to federated SSL resource allocation.
- Break condition: If the action space becomes too large or state transitions too complex, SAC convergence degrades and resource allocation becomes suboptimal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL)
  - Why needed here: Enables training without labeled data while preserving vehicle data privacy.
  - Quick check question: Why can't we just use supervised federated learning in IoV?
- Concept: Contrastive learning with momentum encoders (MoCo)
  - Why needed here: Provides strong feature learning without labels; SimCo simplifies it for privacy.
  - Quick check question: How does SimCo's dual temperature differ functionally from MoCo's dictionary?
- Concept: Reinforcement learning for non-convex optimization
  - Why needed here: Traditional convex solvers fail on the joint power-frequency allocation problem; SAC handles continuous, non-convex spaces.
  - Quick check question: What makes the resource allocation problem non-convex in this IoV setting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Vehicles (capture images, local SimCo training) -> Base Station (model aggregation with blur weighting) -> SAC agent (resource allocation)
- Critical path: Vehicle captures → local SimCo training → uploads with allocated power/frequency → BS aggregates with blur weighting → updates global model → allocates next round resources
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Privacy vs performance: SimCo avoids dictionary upload but may need more local compute
  - Aggregation vs motion blur: Blur weighting reduces blur impact but may discard useful models if blur estimation is noisy
  - Exploration vs stability: SAC's entropy bonus aids exploration but may cause variance in resource allocation
- Failure signatures:
  - If SimCo underperforms, local models diverge and global model accuracy drops
  - If blur estimation is wrong, aggregation weights distort model contributions
  - If SAC fails to converge, resource allocation oscillates, increasing delay and energy
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify SimCo local training matches MoCo accuracy without dictionary upload
  2. Test blur estimation from velocity vs ground-truth blur on a labeled subset
  3. Run SAC with synthetic vehicle traces to check convergence and reward stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the DRL-BFSSL algorithm perform under varying levels of motion blur severity, beyond the 1/5 and 3/5 blurred image scenarios tested?

- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the algorithm's performance with different percentages of blurred images (e.g., 0%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 100%) and varying degrees of blur severity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different backbone models (e.g., ResNet-50, VGG-16) on the performance of the DRL-BFSSL algorithm?

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the DRL-BFSSL algorithm perform in real-world vehicular environments with dynamic changes in network conditions, vehicle densities, and environmental factors?

## Limitations
- SimCo's privacy claims lack empirical validation against gradient leakage attacks
- Blur estimation accuracy untested - velocity-based estimation may not correlate with actual image blur
- SAC convergence guarantees absent - no theoretical analysis or comparison with specialized convex solvers

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in overall system performance - simulation results show improvement but limited to synthetic data
- Low confidence in privacy claims - theoretical assertions not validated empirically
- Medium confidence in resource allocation - SAC application reasonable but convergence unproven

## Next Checks
1. Implement gradient leakage attack on SimCo-trained models to verify dual temperature prevents dictionary inference
2. Capture real vehicle-captured images at different speeds to validate velocity-based blur estimation accuracy
3. Run extended SAC training with varying vehicle counts to analyze convergence and compare with convex solver benchmark
