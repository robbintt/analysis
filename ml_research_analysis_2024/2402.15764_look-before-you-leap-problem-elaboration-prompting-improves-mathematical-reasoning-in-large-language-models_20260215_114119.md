# Look Before You Leap: Problem Elaboration Prompting Improves Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.15764
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15764
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: PEP improves mathematical reasoning by decomposing and elucidating problem context before reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Problem Elaboration Prompting (PEP), a novel approach that enhances mathematical reasoning in large language models by systematically breaking down and clarifying problem contexts before initiating reasoning steps. PEP works by encouraging models to first elaborate on the problem structure, identify key elements, and establish relationships before proceeding to solution steps. The method shows consistent performance improvements over standard Chain-of-Thought prompting across multiple mathematical reasoning datasets, with particularly notable gains on distraction-heavy problems.

## Method Summary
PEP modifies the prompting strategy by inserting an explicit elaboration phase before standard reasoning chains. When presented with a mathematical problem, the model is first prompted to decompose the problem into constituent parts, identify relationships between variables, and establish the problem's structural framework. Only after this elaboration phase does the model proceed to generate solution steps. This two-phase approach aims to improve context modeling and parsing efficiency by forcing the model to build a comprehensive understanding of the problem before attempting solutions. The method is designed to be easily integrated with existing prompting strategies and shows particular effectiveness on problems containing irrelevant information or complex relationships.

## Key Results
- PEP consistently outperforms standard Chain-of-Thought prompting across various mathematical reasoning datasets
- Achieves 9.93% improvement on GSM8k with GPT-3.5 using greedy decoding
- Demonstrates particular strength in handling distraction problems with irrelevant information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PEP improves reasoning performance by restructuring the cognitive workflow of language models. By forcing an explicit elaboration phase, the model must first build a comprehensive mental model of the problem before attempting solutions. This decomposition helps the model identify relevant information, establish relationships between problem elements, and create a clearer roadmap for solution generation. The approach addresses common failure modes where models jump to conclusions or get distracted by irrelevant information by ensuring proper problem comprehension precedes solution generation.

## Foundational Learning
- Chain-of-Thought prompting: Sequential reasoning approach where models explain their thinking step-by-step; needed to understand baseline methodology and why PEP improves upon it
- Context modeling in LLMs: How models represent and maintain problem information; critical for understanding PEP's focus on pre-processing problem comprehension
- Distraction problems: Mathematical problems containing irrelevant information; important for understanding PEP's particular strength in filtering noise
- Greedy decoding: Standard decoding method that selects highest probability token at each step; relevant for understanding baseline performance metrics
- Token efficiency: Measures computational overhead and resource usage; needed to evaluate PEP's practical implementation costs

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input Problem -> Elaboration Phase -> Reasoning Phase -> Solution Output
- Critical path: Problem decomposition occurs before any solution steps, creating a two-phase workflow that must complete sequentially
- Design tradeoffs: PEP adds preprocessing overhead but potentially reduces errors from premature reasoning; tradeoff between computational cost and accuracy
- Failure signatures: Models may still struggle with extremely complex problems or fail to properly identify relevant relationships during elaboration
- First experiments: 1) Compare single-step vs. multi-step elaboration effectiveness, 2) Test PEP performance on varying distraction complexity levels, 3) Measure token efficiency overhead compared to standard CoT

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on mathematical reasoning tasks, limiting generalizability to other domains
- Analysis of PEP's effectiveness on distraction problems remains correlational rather than establishing causal mechanisms
- Limited ablation studies examining interaction effects with alternative reasoning strategies

## Confidence
- High confidence: PEP consistently improves performance on GSM8k and other mathematical datasets compared to standard CoT prompting
- Medium confidence: PEP's particular strength with distraction problems stems from improved context modeling and problem decomposition
- Medium confidence: Easy integration with other methods without degradation of performance

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing PEP with other advanced prompting techniques like Tree-of-Thoughts or Active Prompting to isolate PEP's unique contributions
2. Measure actual computational overhead and token consumption differences between PEP and standard CoT across diverse reasoning tasks
3. Perform causal analysis of why PEP particularly benefits distraction problems, potentially through controlled experiments varying distraction complexity and type
