# Towards Full-parameter and Parameter-efficient Self-learning For Endoscopic Camera Depth Estimation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2410.00979
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00979
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Primary result:** Achieves 4.1% error reduction on SCARED dataset compared to state-of-the-art models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of adapting depth foundation models for endoscopic camera depth estimation through a novel two-stage learning framework. The method overcomes limitations of existing adaptation techniques that restrict parameter updates to low-rank subspaces and alter training dynamics. By simultaneously adapting attention, convolution, and multi-layer perception subspaces in the first stage, and then employing memory-efficient optimization to compose these subspaces in the second stage, the approach achieves significant performance improvements on the SCARED dataset.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework consists of a two-stage adaptation process. First, low-rank updates are applied simultaneously to attention, convolution, and multi-layer perception subspaces, allowing for comprehensive parameter adaptation while maintaining efficiency. Second, a memory-efficient optimization composes these adapted subspaces in a unified space to further improve performance. This approach addresses the limitation of existing methods that only allow parameter searches within restricted subspaces, enabling full-parameter adaptation with improved training dynamics.

## Key Results
- Reduces error from 10.2% to 4.1% across multiple metrics (Sq Rel, Abs Rel, RMSE, and RMSE log)
- Improves δ metric from 0.979 to 0.983 on the SCARED dataset
- Demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in endoscopic depth estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by overcoming the fundamental limitation of existing adaptation techniques that restrict parameter updates to low-rank subspaces. By simultaneously adapting multiple subspaces (attention, convolution, and MLP) and then composing them through memory-efficient optimization, the approach enables more comprehensive parameter adaptation while maintaining computational efficiency. This allows the model to better capture the complex visual characteristics of endoscopic scenes compared to traditional fine-tuning or subspace-restricted adaptation methods.

## Foundational Learning
- **Low-rank subspace updates**: Why needed - enables efficient parameter adaptation without full fine-tuning; Quick check - verify rank constraints don't overly limit model capacity
- **Multi-subspace composition**: Why needed - combines benefits of different adaptation strategies; Quick check - ensure composition maintains gradient flow
- **Memory-efficient optimization**: Why needed - prevents computational bottleneck during adaptation; Quick check - monitor GPU memory usage during training
- **Attention mechanism adaptation**: Why needed - captures long-range dependencies in endoscopic images; Quick check - validate attention maps on endoscopic data
- **Convolutional feature adaptation**: Why needed - preserves spatial feature extraction capabilities; Quick check - compare feature maps before/after adaptation
- **MLP subspace adaptation**: Why needed - enables fine-grained parameter updates; Quick check - verify weight distributions remain stable

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input images → Multi-subspace adaptation (attention/conv/MLP) → Composition stage → Depth estimation output
- **Critical path**: The composition stage is critical as it unifies the adapted subspaces for final depth prediction
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balance between full-parameter adaptation capability and memory efficiency; simultaneous vs sequential subspace updates
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance if subspace composition doesn't properly integrate learned features; memory overflow during composition stage
- **First experiments**: 1) Verify each subspace adaptation stage independently, 2) Test composition with synthetic subspaces, 3) Validate memory efficiency claims with ablation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Scalability to larger datasets and more complex surgical scenarios remains uncertain
- Evaluation limited to SCARED dataset, which may not represent real-world endoscopic diversity
- Computational overhead of simultaneous multi-subspace adaptation requires further investigation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical implementation of low-rank subspace updates
- **Medium confidence**: Reported performance improvements on SCARED dataset
- **Low confidence**: Method's generalizability to other endoscopic datasets and clinical settings

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method on multiple endoscopic datasets (e.g., Hamlyn, EndoVis) to assess cross-dataset generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of each subspace adaptation component (attention vs. convolution vs. MLP)
3. Measure wall-clock training time and GPU memory consumption compared to baseline fine-tuning approaches to verify memory efficiency claims
