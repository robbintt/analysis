# A Survey on Benchmarks of Multimodal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2408.08632
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08632
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Comprehensive survey of 200 benchmarks across five domains for MLLM evaluation, identifying capabilities, limitations, and future research directions

## Executive Summary
This survey presents a systematic overview of 200 benchmarks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), organized across five key domains: perception and understanding, cognition and reasoning, specific domains, key capabilities, and other modalities. The authors analyze benchmark focus areas including object detection, visual relation reasoning, knowledge-based reasoning, mathematical question answering, and hallucination detection. The survey provides performance statistics for top MLLMs across 83 benchmarks and discusses current limitations in evaluation methods while identifying promising future research directions.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a comprehensive review of existing MLLM benchmarks, categorizing them into five domains and analyzing their focus areas and evaluation methods. They collected performance data for top-3 MLLMs across 83 benchmarks and synthesized findings on model strengths, weaknesses, and evaluation limitations. The survey methodology involved systematic literature review, benchmark categorization, and empirical analysis of performance patterns, though specific evaluation protocols and complete benchmark lists are not fully detailed in the paper.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive categorization of 200+ benchmarks into five domains covering perception, cognition, specific domains, key capabilities, and other modalities
- Performance analysis showing OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini exhibit superior performance across multiple benchmark categories
- Identification of critical evaluation gaps including self-awareness in perception, hallucination detection beyond object hallucination, and multi-cultural/language evaluation capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The survey's comprehensive categorization into five domains enables systematic comparison of MLLM capabilities across diverse evaluation scenarios.
- **Mechanism:** By organizing 200+ benchmarks into perception/understanding, cognition/reasoning, specific domains, key capabilities, and other modalities, the survey provides a structured taxonomy that allows researchers to identify gaps, overlaps, and emerging trends in MLLM evaluation.
- **Core assumption:** That a hierarchical categorization system can capture the multidimensional nature of MLLM capabilities and their evaluation requirements.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Our survey covers five key areas of MLLM evaluation, encompassing 20-30 detailed categories"
  - [section] "Our survey covers five key areas of MLLM evaluation, encompassing 20-30 detailed categories"
- **Break condition:** If new MLLM capabilities emerge that don't fit within the five-domain framework, the categorization system would need expansion or restructuring.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The survey's inclusion of performance statistics for top MLLMs across benchmarks provides empirical grounding for understanding model strengths and limitations.
- **Mechanism:** By presenting data on top-3 MLLM performance across 83 benchmarks since 2024, the survey offers concrete evidence of which models excel in which areas, guiding both research directions and practical applications.
- **Core assumption:** That performance rankings across standardized benchmarks accurately reflect real-world capabilities and limitations.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We provide statistics on the performance of the top three MLLMs across 83 benchmarks since 2024"
  - [section] "The data indicates that OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini exhibit superior performance"
- **Break condition:** If benchmark performance doesn't correlate with real-world task success, the empirical grounding would be misleading.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The survey's identification of current limitations in MLLM evaluation methods drives future research by highlighting critical gaps.
- **Mechanism:** By discussing limitations of current evaluation methods and exploring promising future directions, the survey creates a roadmap for addressing unsolved problems in MLLM assessment.
- **Core assumption:** That articulating current limitations will inspire targeted research to address those specific gaps.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Finally, we discuss the limitations of the current evaluation methods for MLLMs and explore promising future directions"
  - [section] "Despite these efforts, a comprehensive overview that captures the full scope of these evaluations is still lacking"
- **Break condition:** If the identified limitations are not addressable with current technology, or if new limitations emerge that weren't anticipated.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multimodal integration in neural networks**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how MLLMs combine visual and language processing is fundamental to grasping the survey's evaluation framework
  - Quick check question: What architectural component bridges visual and language modalities in MLLMs?

- **Concept: Benchmark taxonomy and evaluation methodology**
  - Why needed here: The survey's organization depends on understanding how different evaluation approaches measure different aspects of MLLM capabilities
  - Quick check question: How does the survey categorize benchmarks differently from simply grouping by task type?

- **Concept: Emergent capabilities in large language models**
  - Why needed here: Many MLLM capabilities arise from scale and interaction rather than explicit design, which is crucial for interpreting evaluation results
  - Quick check question: Why might an MLLM perform well on reasoning tasks without being explicitly trained for that specific reasoning type?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** The survey's five-domain architecture maps to different evaluation components: perception/understanding (input processing), cognition/reasoning (internal processing), specific domains (specialized capabilities), key capabilities (user-facing features), and other modalities (extended input types).

- **Critical path:** Understanding the survey's taxonomy → identifying relevant benchmarks for specific research questions → analyzing performance data → recognizing limitations → planning future work.

- **Design tradeoffs:** The survey trades comprehensiveness (200+ benchmarks) for depth in individual evaluations, requiring readers to navigate between breadth and specificity.

- **Failure signatures:** If a researcher cannot map their research question to the survey's taxonomy, or if they find significant evaluation gaps that the survey doesn't address.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Map a specific MLLM capability (e.g., spatial reasoning) to the survey's taxonomy and identify all relevant benchmarks
  2. Analyze the performance data for top-3 MLLMs on a specific benchmark category to identify patterns
  3. Select one identified limitation and propose a research direction to address it, justifying why it's important based on the survey's findings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can benchmarks be designed to more effectively evaluate MLLMs' understanding of self-awareness in perception, particularly in scenarios where the correct response is "I Don't Know"?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper discusses MM-SAP and VQAv2-IDK as benchmarks developed to assess MLLMs' understanding of self-awareness, particularly in scenarios where the correct response is "I Don't Know".
- **Why unresolved:** While these benchmarks exist, the paper suggests that many incorrect responses from MLLMs stem from their difficulty in understanding what they can and cannot perceive in images. This indicates a gap in evaluating MLLMs' self-awareness in perception.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evidence that demonstrates MLLMs' ability to accurately identify when they lack sufficient information to provide a correct answer, or evidence of improved performance in benchmarks specifically designed to test self-awareness in perception.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can benchmarks be designed to more comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' hallucination detection capabilities, beyond object hallucination?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper discusses various benchmarks for hallucination detection, including POPE, GA VIE, M-HalDetect, and MMHAL-BENCH. However, it notes that these benchmarks primarily focus on object hallucination and neglect other types of hallucinations in MLLMs.
- **Why unresolved:** While some benchmarks have been developed to evaluate hallucinations related to objects, attributes, and spatial relations, there is a need for more comprehensive evaluation methods that cover a wider range of hallucination types.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evidence of benchmarks that successfully evaluate MLLMs' hallucination detection capabilities across various categories, including object, attribute, and spatial relation hallucinations, as well as other potential hallucination types.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can benchmarks be designed to more effectively evaluate MLLMs' capabilities in handling diverse cultures and languages, beyond the current focus on English and a few other major languages?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper discusses CMMU, CMMMU, and MULTI as benchmarks designed to evaluate multi-modal and multi-type questions in Chinese. It also mentions Henna, LaVy-Bench, and MTVQA as benchmarks designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of Arabic culture, Vietnamese visual language tasks, and multilingual text-rich scenarios, respectively.
- **Why unresolved:** While these benchmarks represent progress in evaluating MLLMs' capabilities in diverse cultures and languages, the paper suggests that most benchmarks primarily use English, leading to the neglect of other languages and cultures. This indicates a need for more comprehensive evaluation methods that cover a wider range of languages and cultures.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evidence of benchmarks that successfully evaluate MLLMs' capabilities in handling diverse cultures and languages, covering a wide range of languages, cultures, and cultural contexts.

## Limitations
- **Missing complete benchmark list:** The survey references 200+ benchmarks but does not provide a complete, publicly accessible list, preventing independent verification of comprehensiveness.
- **Incomplete evaluation protocols:** Specific evaluation metrics and protocols for individual benchmarks are not detailed, requiring readers to seek this information from primary sources.
- **Potential taxonomy gaps:** The five-domain categorization system may not capture emerging MLLM capabilities that fall outside established categories.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The existence and general structure of the survey (categorization into five domains, coverage of 200+ benchmarks) - supported by multiple direct quotes from the abstract and body.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim about providing performance statistics for top-3 MLLMs across 83 benchmarks - this is mentioned but specific data is not provided in the abstract.
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that this survey fills a critical gap in comprehensive MLLM evaluation - while the paper claims this, the actual impact would require validation from the research community.

## Next Checks
1. Obtain the complete list of 200 benchmarks referenced in the survey and verify their inclusion across all five domains.
2. Compare the survey's five-domain taxonomy against independent attempts to categorize MLLM evaluation benchmarks to assess its comprehensiveness and appropriateness.
3. Replicate the performance analysis by collecting benchmark results for top-3 MLLMs across the 83 benchmarks mentioned to verify the claimed patterns of model strengths and limitations.
