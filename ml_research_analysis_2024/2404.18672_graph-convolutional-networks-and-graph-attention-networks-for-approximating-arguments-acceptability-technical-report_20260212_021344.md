# Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks for Approximating Arguments Acceptability -- Technical Report

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.18672
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18672
- Reference count: 29
- The paper proposes AFGAT, a Graph Attention Network variant that outperforms GCN-based approaches on credulous and skeptical acceptability queries in abstract argumentation.

## Executive Summary
This technical report presents improvements to neural network-based approaches for solving abstract argumentation problems, specifically focusing on credulous and skeptical acceptability queries. Building upon the state-of-the-art AFGCN solver, the authors propose modifications including enhanced node embeddings with gradual semantics features and a faster Rust-based implementation. They also introduce AFGAT, a Graph Attention Network variant that uses attention mechanisms to weigh neighbor contributions differently.

Experimental results show that AFGAT achieves the highest accuracy across tested problems (DC-co, DC-st, DS-pr, DS-st), outperforming AFGCN variants and competing solvers like HARPER++ and FARGO-LIMITED from ICCMA 2023. The key finding is that Graph Attention Networks provide a significant improvement in accuracy for approximate reasoning in abstract argumentation compared to Graph Convolutional Networks.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces AFGAT, a Graph Attention Network that builds on AFGCNv2 by incorporating attention mechanisms to weigh neighbor contributions differently. The method uses 3 graph attentional layers with 5 heads for the first layer and 3 heads for the second and third layers, followed by a Sigmoid output layer. Node embeddings include features such as eigenvector centrality, graph centrality, in-degree and out-degree, PageRank, graph coloring, gradual semantics acceptability degrees (h-cat, nsa, Mbs, Cbs), and grounded semantics status. The implementation leverages a Rust-based parser and grounded extension solver for improved runtime efficiency.

## Key Results
- AFGAT achieves the highest accuracy across all tested acceptability problems (DC-co, DC-st, DS-pr, DS-st)
- AFGCN-P128 with enhanced features outperforms AFGCN-P11 with only centrality features
- The Rust implementation provides faster computation of graph centrality and avoids memory errors on large instances

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph Attention Networks (GATs) improve performance over Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) because they weigh neighbor contributions differently based on learned attention scores.
- Mechanism: Each node's embedding update in a GAT layer computes attention coefficients between the source node and its neighbors, allowing the model to emphasize more relevant neighbors.
- Core assumption: Not all neighbors contribute equally to a node's acceptability; attackers with certain properties (e.g., grounded extension membership) should be weighted differently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "using Graph Attention Networks (GATs) instead" and "improves even more the efficiency"
  - [section 2.2] "not all neighbours of an arguments have the same impact on its acceptability" and describes attention coefficient computation
  - [corpus] Weak correlation - neighbor titles mention GCN vs GAT comparisons but no direct citation to this work
- Break condition: If attention scores converge to uniform weights across neighbors, GAT reduces to GCN performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Enhanced node embeddings with gradual semantics features improve GCN model precision by providing more informative node representations.
- Mechanism: The node embedding includes acceptability degrees from gradual semantics (h-cat, nsa, Mbs, Cbs) and grounded semantics status, giving the model richer information than randomized features alone.
- Core assumption: These semantic features capture structural properties relevant to acceptability that random features cannot.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1.2] Describes adding "acceptability degrees of the argument for various gradual semantics" and "acceptability status w.r.t. the grounded semantics"
  - [section 2.1.2] Compares AFGCN-P128 (with features) vs AFGCN-P11 (without random features), showing improved performance
  - [corpus] No direct supporting citations found
- Break condition: If gradual semantics features don't correlate with the target acceptability problems, they add noise rather than signal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Rust-based implementation improves runtime efficiency by optimizing graph centrality computation and memory management.
- Mechanism: Replacing Python's NetworkX centrality computation with a Rust package that uses linear algorithms and data structures reduces computation time and avoids memory errors on large instances.
- Core assumption: Graph centrality computation is the bottleneck in AFGCNv2's runtime, and Rust provides significant performance advantages over Python for this task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1.1] States "the main improvement regarding runtime is computation of the graph centrality" and "much faster with the Rust package than with the Python-based NetworkX library"
  - [section 2.1.1] Mentions avoiding "out-of-memory errors with large instances" through linear algorithm approach
  - [corpus] No direct supporting citations found
- Break condition: If graph centrality is not the primary bottleneck, or if the Rust implementation introduces overhead that negates benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Graph Neural Networks:
  - Why needed here: The paper applies GNNs to abstract argumentation frameworks where arguments are nodes and attacks are edges, requiring graph-structured processing
  - Quick check question: How do GCNs aggregate information from neighbors differently than standard feed-forward networks?

- Abstract Argumentation Semantics:
  - Why needed here: The task involves credulous and skeptical acceptability queries under various semantics (complete, preferred, grounded, stable), which define the ground truth the models learn to predict
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between credulous and skeptical acceptability in terms of the extensions considered?

- Attention Mechanisms:
  - Why needed here: GATs use attention to weight neighbor contributions differently, which is central to understanding why they outperform GCNs in this domain
  - Quick check question: How does multi-head attention in GATs differ from single attention in terms of information processing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input AF graph → Rust pre-processing (grounded extension, node embedding) → Neural network (GCN or GAT layers with dropout) → Sigmoid output layer → Acceptability prediction
- Critical path: Graph parsing → Grounded extension computation → Node embedding generation → Neural network forward pass → Acceptability prediction
- Design tradeoffs: Using 11 meaningful features vs 128 features (with randomization) balances information richness against overfitting risk; dropout layers help generalization but may lose important features
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on instances where grounded extension status doesn't correlate with target semantics; overfitting on training data; runtime timeouts on large instances
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare AFGCN-P11 vs AFGCN-P128 on a small benchmark to verify feature importance
  2. Test GAT vs GCN on instances where neighbor importance varies significantly
  3. Measure runtime improvement of Rust implementation vs Python baseline on large AFs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would AFGAT perform on incomplete argumentation frameworks compared to complete frameworks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions extending approaches to other kinds of abstract argumentation frameworks, like Incomplete AFs, as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates AFGAT on complete argumentation frameworks and does not provide any results or analysis for incomplete frameworks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing AFGAT's performance on complete vs. incomplete argumentation frameworks, measuring accuracy and runtime.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the number of attention heads in AFGAT on its performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that AFGAT uses 5 heads for the first layer and 3 heads for the second and third layers, but does not explore the impact of different numbers of heads.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any analysis or results on how the number of attention heads affects AFGAT's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing AFGAT's performance with different numbers of attention heads, measuring accuracy and runtime.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does AFGAT's performance compare to other neural network-based approaches for approximate reasoning in abstract argumentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares AFGAT to AFGCN variants and mentions other approaches like HARPER++ and FARGO-LIMITED, but does not provide a comprehensive comparison with all neural network-based approaches.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a complete analysis of AFGAT's performance relative to all other neural network-based approaches in the literature.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive experimental comparison of AFGAT with all other neural network-based approaches for approximate reasoning in abstract argumentation, measuring accuracy and runtime.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks detailed ablation studies to isolate the impact of individual improvements (Rust implementation, enhanced features, GAT vs GCN).
- Evaluation focuses on accuracy metrics without reporting runtime comparisons for the new AFGAT variant.
- Implementation details for critical components like the Rust-based grounded extension solver are not specified, limiting reproducibility.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The accuracy improvements of AFGAT over AFGCN on ICCMA 2023 test instances are well-supported by the experimental results presented.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that GAT's attention mechanism improves performance by weighting neighbors differently is theoretically sound but lacks direct experimental validation through ablation.
- **Low confidence**: The specific runtime improvements attributed to the Rust implementation are not empirically demonstrated with timing data.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contribution of enhanced features vs GAT architecture vs Rust implementation.
2. Report runtime comparisons between AFGCNv2 (Python) and AFGAT (Rust) on identical test instances.
3. Test the model's robustness on argumentation frameworks where neighbor importance varies significantly to validate the attention mechanism's effectiveness.
