# Optimal Convergence Rates for Neural Operators

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.17518
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17518
- Reference count: 40
- This paper derives minimax-optimal convergence rates for neural operators in the NTK regime.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes theoretical foundations for learning operators between function spaces using two-layer neural operators trained with gradient descent in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. The authors prove that early-stopped gradient descent achieves minimax-optimal convergence rates for non-parametric regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, with explicit bounds on the required number of neurons and samples. They demonstrate that neural operators can approximate any operator approximable by neural networks with parameters close to initialization, and apply their results to the Poisson equation, showing that optimal rates can be achieved with only O(√nU) neurons and O(√nU) second-stage samples.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes two-layer neural operators trained with gradient descent in the NTK regime. The method involves symmetric initialization of parameters, followed by gradient descent with early stopping on an empirical risk objective. The theoretical analysis derives convergence rates by decomposing the excess risk into approximation error (controlled by neuron count), discretization error (controlled by sample size), and generalization error (controlled by stopping time). The authors assume source conditions characterizing the target operator's regularity and eigenvalue decay conditions on the NTK integral operator.

## Key Results
- Early-stopped gradient descent achieves minimax-optimal convergence rates for non-parametric regression in RKHS.
- Neural operators can approximate any operator approximable by neural networks with parameters near initialization.
- For the Poisson equation, optimal rates are achieved with O(√nU) neurons and O(√nU) second-stage samples.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Gradient descent in the NTK regime achieves minimax-optimal convergence rates for learning non-linear operators.
- Mechanism: Early-stopped gradient descent minimizes the empirical risk in a vector-valued RKHS induced by the NTK, with the number of neurons and samples carefully controlled to match the capacity of the hypothesis space.
- Core assumption: The operator to be learned lies in the range of powers of the NTK integral operator (source condition) and the NTK eigenvalues decay sufficiently fast (effective dimension condition).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "For early-stopped gradient descent (GD), we derive fast convergence rates that are known to be minimax optimal within the framework of non-parametric regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS)."
  - [section] "Our next general result establishes an upper bound for the excess risk in terms of the stopping time T and the number of neurons M of our gradient descent algorithm (2.5), under the assumption that the weights remain in a vicinity of the initialization."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Neural operators can approximate any operator approximable by finite-width neural networks, and their RKHS can approximate the target operator.
- Mechanism: A two-layer neural operator with symmetric initialization and sufficient width can represent any continuous operator; the associated NTK RKHS contains operators close to the target within approximation error.
- Core assumption: The target operator is continuous and can be approximated by neural networks with parameters close to initialization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Inspired by the approximation properties of neural operators, our first theorem demonstrates that the vvRKHS associated with the vvNTK can approximate all operators that can also be approximated by neural operators, whose parameters do not deviate significantly from their initialization."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The number of required neurons and samples is governed by the interplay between source condition smoothness (r) and eigenvalue decay (b).
- Mechanism: The excess risk bound decomposes into Taylor approximation error (controlled by neuron count M), discretization error (controlled by sample size nX), and generalization error (controlled by stopping time T). Optimal rates are achieved when M and nX scale as functions of T, r, and b.
- Core assumption: The NTK integral operator has summable eigenvalues and the weights stay close to initialization during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We can reformulate Theorem 3.5 to obtain the sample complexity required to achieve a certainε-accuracy. On order for the excess risk to have accuracy ofε > 0, the algorithm requires O(ε− 2r+b r ) first stage samples and O(ε−2 log2(ε−1/r)) second stage samples."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) and integral operators
  - Why needed here: The NTK induces an RKHS whose elements are the hypothesis space for operator learning; understanding its properties is essential for deriving convergence rates.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the NTK integral operator and the RKHS it generates?

- Concept: Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and its spectral properties
  - Why needed here: The NTK governs the dynamics of gradient descent in the infinite-width limit; its eigenvalues determine the effective dimension and thus the sample complexity.
  - Quick check question: How does the eigenvalue decay of the NTK integral operator affect the required number of samples?

- Concept: Source conditions and interpolation spaces
  - Why needed here: The source condition characterizes the regularity of the target operator and determines the convergence rate; it's analogous to smoothness assumptions in nonparametric regression.
  - Quick check question: How does the parameter r in the source condition influence the convergence rate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input functions u from space U -> Kernel integral operator A -> Matrix multiplication B2 -> Bias function c -> Output functions v in space V

- Critical path:
  1. Sample training functions u_i and solutions v_i
  2. Initialize neural operator parameters symmetrically
  3. Run gradient descent with early stopping
  4. Evaluate generalization error on test set
  5. Tune M (neurons) and nX (samples) based on r and b

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More neurons M → better approximation but higher computational cost
  - More samples nX → better discretization but higher cost
  - Earlier stopping → less overfitting but higher bias
  - Larger r → faster rates but stronger assumptions

- Failure signatures:
  - If weights drift far from initialization → approximation error dominates
  - If M too small → Taylor approximation error dominates
  - If nX too small → discretization error dominates
  - If T too large → overfitting occurs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify that a simple Poisson equation can be learned with M=O(√nU) and nX=O(√nU) as predicted.
  2. Test sensitivity of convergence rate to the source condition parameter r by varying the smoothness of target operators.
  3. Measure eigenvalue decay of the empirical NTK to confirm effective dimension assumptions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How many neurons and second-stage samples are needed to achieve optimal rates for "hard learning problems" where 2r + b ≤ 1?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "In this paper we only investigate easy learning problems and leave the question, how many neurons M and second stage samples are needed to obtain optimal rates in hard learning problems Lin et al. (2020), open for future work."
- Why unresolved: The authors only analyze the case where 2r + b > 1, leaving the analysis of hard learning problems for future research.
- What evidence would resolve it: Mathematical analysis and experimental results showing the required number of neurons and samples for hard learning problems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the eigenvalue decay of the kernel integral operator L∞ associated with the neural tangent kernel for neural operators?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that "For neural operators, however, the RKHS has not yet been explored, at least to the best of our knowledge. We hope to build on the existing results for neural networks in future research to gain a deeper understanding of the RKHS in the context of neural operators."
- Why unresolved: The RKHS and eigenvalue decay of the NTK for neural operators have not been studied, unlike for standard neural networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis or empirical estimates of the eigenvalue decay of L∞ for neural operators.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the neural operator's performance scale with the number of hidden neurons M and second-stage samples nX in practice, especially for high-dimensional PDEs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the authors provide theoretical bounds, their numerical experiments only consider a simple 1D Poisson equation. The paper states "For additional numerical simulations that underscore the utility and significance of neural operators, see for example Lowery et al. (2024); Kovachki et al. (2023); Li et al. (2021); Gin et al. (2020); Kovachki et al. (2024a); Kaijun et al. (2024); Bhattacharya et al. (2021)."
- Why unresolved: The theoretical bounds are general, but practical scaling behavior for complex PDEs is not demonstrated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive numerical experiments on high-dimensional PDEs showing the relationship between M, nX, and performance.

## Limitations
- The analysis assumes weights remain close to initialization throughout training, which may not hold in practice.
- The source condition and eigenvalue decay assumptions may not be satisfied for all practical operator learning problems.
- The paper only analyzes "easy learning problems" where 2r + b > 1, leaving hard learning problems for future work.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The derivation of convergence rates under stated assumptions is mathematically rigorous and follows established techniques from RKHS learning theory.
- Medium Confidence: The claim that neural operators can approximate any operator approximable by neural networks is theoretically sound but depends on the approximation power of neural networks being close to initialization.
- Medium Confidence: The application to the Poisson equation demonstrating O(√nU) scaling is supported by the theory but would benefit from empirical validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Source Condition Verification**: Test the learned operators on target functions with varying levels of smoothness to empirically validate how the convergence rate depends on the source condition parameter r.

2. **Initialization Sensitivity**: Systematically vary the initialization scale and measure how much the weights drift from initialization during training, checking if this correlates with performance degradation.

3. **Eigenvalue Decay Analysis**: Compute and analyze the empirical eigenvalue decay of the NTK integral operator for different kernel choices and input distributions to verify the effective dimension assumptions.
