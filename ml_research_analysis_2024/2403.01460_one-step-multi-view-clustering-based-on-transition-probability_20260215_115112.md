# One-Step Multi-View Clustering Based on Transition Probability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.01460
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01460
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Proposed OSMVC-TP achieves state-of-the-art clustering accuracy on six benchmark datasets, with 100% accuracy on MSRC

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces OSMVC-TP, a novel one-step multi-view clustering method that leverages transition probabilities for improved interpretability and performance. The method directly learns transition probabilities from anchor points to categories and from samples to categories, obtaining soft label matrices for both. To maintain consistency across views, Schatten p-norm constraints are applied to the tensor of soft labels. Extensive experiments on four small and two large-scale datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of OSMVC-TP, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
OSMVC-TP is a one-step multi-view clustering method that uses anchor graphs to represent transition probabilities from samples to anchor points. The method jointly learns transition probability matrices from samples to categories and from anchors to categories, obtaining soft label matrices for both. To maintain consistency across views, Schatten p-norm constraints are applied to the tensor composed of the soft labels. The optimization is performed using an Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) framework, which alternates between updating the transition probability matrices and the regularization terms. The method is evaluated on six benchmark datasets, including MSRC, HW4, Mnist4, Scene15, Reuters, and NoisyMNIST, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

## Key Results
- OSMVC-TP achieves 100% clustering accuracy on the MSRC dataset
- The method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on all six benchmark datasets
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of OSMVC-TP across different datasets and parameter settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Anchor graphs represent transition probabilities from samples to anchors, enabling probabilistic interpretation of clustering.
- Mechanism: Each element in the anchor graph S(i,j) is non-negative and row sums to 1, making it a valid transition probability matrix. By treating S as a Markov transition matrix, we can directly compute transition probabilities from samples to categories via SH, where H is the transition matrix from anchors to categories.
- Core assumption: The anchor graph satisfies Markov property and can be interpreted as a probability transition matrix.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This method adopts a probabilistic approach, which leverages the anchor graph, representing the transition probabilities from samples to anchor points."
  - [section] "Each element in S is non-negative. The sum of elements in each row of S equals 1."
- Break condition: If anchor graph construction fails to satisfy non-negativity or row-sum constraints, the probabilistic interpretation breaks down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Schatten p-norm constraints on tensor G and H enforce view consistency and extract complementary information.
- Mechanism: By applying Schatten p-norm regularization to the tensor of soft label matrices, the method encourages low-rank structure and aligns labels across views. This captures the shared underlying structure while preserving view-specific information.
- Core assumption: Despite different data distributions across views, the intrinsic geometric structure remains consistent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, to maintain consistency in labels across different views, we apply a Schatten p-norm constraint on the tensor composed of the soft labels."
  - [section] "Despite potential significant differences in data distributions across various views, their inherent structures are expected to remain consistent."
- Break condition: If views have fundamentally different cluster structures, forcing consistency via Schatten norm may degrade performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The method learns anchor-to-category transition probabilities directly, avoiding two-stage clustering and post-processing.
- Mechanism: Instead of first learning a bipartite graph and then performing spectral clustering, the method jointly optimizes H (anchor-to-category transitions) and G (sample-to-category transitions) within a single optimization framework using ALM.
- Core assumption: Learning anchor-to-category transitions directly is more efficient and interpretable than two-stage approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our method directly learns the transition probabilities from anchor points to categories, and calculates the transition probabilities from samples to categories, thus obtaining soft label matrices for samples and anchor points, enhancing the interpretability of clustering."
  - [section] "Capitalizing on the concept of transition probability, the article introduces a novel approach to deduce the transition probability matrix from anchors to categories."
- Break condition: If the anchor selection is poor or unrepresentative, direct learning of H may fail to capture true category structure.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Anchor graphs and their properties
  - Why needed here: The method relies on anchor graphs as transition probability matrices, so understanding their construction and properties is fundamental.
  - Quick check question: What are the two key properties that make an anchor graph suitable for representing transition probabilities?

- Concept: Markov chains and transition probabilities
  - Why needed here: The probabilistic interpretation treats anchor graphs as Markov transition matrices, requiring understanding of Markov chain properties.
  - Quick check question: How do you compute multi-step transition probabilities in a Markov chain?

- Concept: Schatten p-norms and tensor regularization
  - Why needed here: The method uses Schatten p-norm constraints to enforce low-rank structure and view consistency in tensor G and H.
  - Quick check question: What happens to the Schatten p-norm as p approaches 0, and why is this useful for enforcing low-rank structure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: Multi-view data X^(v) ∈ R^(N×d) -> Anchor graph construction: S^(v) ∈ R^(n×m) for each view -> Transition matrices: H^(v) ∈ R^(m×c) (anchor-to-category), G^(v) ∈ R^(n×c) (sample-to-category) -> Tensor constraints: Schatten p-norm on G and H tensors -> Optimization: ALM-based joint optimization -> Output: Clustering labels from G matrix

- Critical path:
  1. Construct anchor graphs S^(v) for all views
  2. Initialize variables F^(v), Q^(v), J, A, Y1^(v), Y2^(v), Y3, Y4
  3. Alternate optimization of G^(v), H^(v), F^(v), Q^(v), J, A
  4. Update Lagrange multipliers and penalty parameters
  5. Compute final indicator matrix G and extract labels

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Anchor graph quality vs. computational efficiency
  - Schatten p-norm parameter p vs. flexibility in capturing structure
  - Number of anchors m vs. representation capacity
  - Regularization parameters λ1, λ2 vs. balance between consistency and specificity

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor anchor graph quality leads to inaccurate transition probabilities
  - Inappropriate p value results in either too rigid or too flexible structure
  - Imbalance in λ1 and λ2 causes dominance of one regularization term
  - Convergence issues if penalty parameters μi are not properly tuned

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify anchor graph properties (non-negativity, row sums to 1) on a simple dataset
  2. Test single-view clustering performance with different Schatten p-norm values
  3. Compare multi-view performance with and without Schatten norm constraints on a small dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of p in the Schatten p-norm constraint affect the scalability of the algorithm on very large datasets (e.g., millions of samples)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "By selecting an appropriate value of p, we can more effectively approach the rank of a matrix" and show results for p in [0.1, 1.0] range
- Why unresolved: The experiments only test on datasets up to 50,000 samples. No analysis of performance or convergence properties when scaling to much larger datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Computational time and memory usage analysis for varying p values on datasets with millions of samples

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical guarantee for convergence to a global optimum given the non-convex nature of the objective function?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors present an optimization algorithm using ALM method but don't provide theoretical convergence guarantees
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides empirical convergence plots but doesn't establish whether the algorithm converges to global or local optima
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical proof of convergence properties or empirical evidence showing consistency of results across multiple random initializations

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the method to noise in anchor point selection, and what is the impact of suboptimal anchor points on clustering performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention "by selecting 𝑚 representative anchor points" but don't analyze sensitivity to anchor quality
- Why unresolved: No experiments were conducted with different anchor selection strategies or with deliberately corrupted anchor points
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different anchor selection methods and controlled experiments with varying levels of anchor point corruption

## Limitations
- The probabilistic interpretation depends critically on anchor graph construction satisfying Markov properties; poor anchor selection or construction could invalidate the theoretical framework
- Schatten p-norm regularization assumes shared structure across views, which may not hold when views capture fundamentally different aspects of the data
- The method requires careful tuning of multiple parameters (anchor rate, λ1, λ2, p), increasing practical deployment complexity

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using anchor graphs as transition probability matrices and learning anchor-to-category transitions directly is well-supported by the mathematical framework and experimental results.
**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of Schatten p-norm regularization for enforcing cross-view consistency is demonstrated empirically but could benefit from more theoretical justification.
**Low Confidence**: The generalizability to datasets with highly heterogeneous views or non-linear cluster structures remains untested based on the current experimental scope.

## Next Checks
1. Test the method's robustness to anchor graph quality by systematically varying the anchor selection algorithm and rate on benchmark datasets
2. Evaluate performance when views have significantly different cluster structures to assess the impact of Schatten norm constraints
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (anchor graph transition probabilities, Schatten norm regularization, ALM optimization) to overall performance
