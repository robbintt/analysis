# Greedy Algorithm for Inference of Decision Trees from Decision Rule Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.06793
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06793
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Greedy polynomial-time algorithm simulates decision tree operation with depth at most O(hEAR(S)³ ln(k(S) + 1) + hEAR(S)) times optimal

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a greedy polynomial-time algorithm for inferring decision trees from decision rule systems, focusing on simulating decision tree operation rather than constructing entire trees. The algorithm uses a greedy set cover approach to select attributes at each step, achieving a depth bound that is slightly worse than a previous non-greedy approach but offers practical computational advantages. The authors suggest their greedy and previous algorithms are complementary, with the greedy version performing better for systems with longer decision rules while the previous approach excels with shorter rules.

## Method Summary
The algorithm simulates decision tree operation on attribute value tuples using a greedy set cover approach. It constructs hypergraphs from decision rule systems where nodes represent attributes and edges represent rules. The Agreedy algorithm builds node covers for these hypergraphs, and the main algorithm AEAR sequentially computes attribute values in rounds until all rules are covered or only rules with empty left-hand sides remain. The method achieves polynomial-time complexity while maintaining a theoretical depth bound relative to the optimal decision tree depth.

## Key Results
- The greedy algorithm produces decision trees with depth at most O(hEAR(S)³ ln(k(S) + 1) + hEAR(S)) times the minimum possible depth
- The algorithm achieves polynomial-time simulation of decision tree behavior on attribute value tuples
- The greedy approach complements the previous non-greedy algorithm, working better for systems with longer decision rules

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The greedy algorithm achieves polynomial-time simulation of decision tree behavior while maintaining near-optimal depth.
- Mechanism: The algorithm uses a greedy set cover approach to select attributes at each step, building node covers for hypergraphs corresponding to decision rule systems. At each round, it constructs a node cover B using the Agreedy algorithm, then computes attribute values sequentially.
- Core assumption: The greedy set cover approximation provides a logarithmic factor approximation guarantee, which translates to the depth bound.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Instead of constructing entire decision trees, the authors propose a greedy polynomial-time algorithm that simulates decision tree operation on given attribute value tuples."
  - [section]: "The auxiliary algorithm for it is a standard greedy algorithm for the set cover problem."
- Break condition: If the logarithmic approximation factor becomes too large relative to the optimal depth, or if the number of rounds (bounded by d(S) ≤ hEAR(S)) becomes prohibitively large.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The algorithm's depth bound is O(hEAR(S)³ ln(k(S) + 1) + hEAR(S)) times the minimum possible depth.
- Mechanism: The bound arises from the product of three factors: the number of rounds (at most hEAR(S)), the node cover size per round (at most hEAR(S)² ln(k(S) + 1) + 1), and the logarithmic approximation factor from the greedy set cover algorithm.
- Core assumption: The relationship between node cover size and decision tree depth holds for the specific hypergraph structure derived from decision rule systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Theorem 1. Let S be a decision rule system with n(S) > 0. The algorithm AEAR describes the work of a decision tree Γ, which solves the problem EAR(S) and for which h(Γ) ≤ hEAR(S)³ ln(k(S) + 1) + hEAR(S)."
- Break condition: If the actual depth grows superlinearly with hEAR(S) due to specific rule system structures, or if k(S) becomes extremely large.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The greedy algorithm complements the previous non-greedy approach, working better for systems with longer decision rules.
- Mechanism: The algorithm's performance depends on the relationship between rule length and the greedy set cover approximation quality. Longer rules may benefit more from the greedy approach's ability to cover multiple attributes efficiently.
- Core assumption: The greedy algorithm's approximation quality improves relative to the non-greedy approach as rule length increases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The authors suggest their greedy and previous algorithms are complementary - the greedy version works better for systems with longer decision rules while the previous approach excels with shorter rules."
- Break condition: If empirical testing shows the greedy approach performs poorly regardless of rule length, or if the previous approach's performance is consistently superior.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Decision rule systems and their representation as hypergraphs
  - Why needed here: The algorithm operates on decision rule systems, and understanding their hypergraph representation (nodes as attributes, edges as rules) is crucial for grasping how the greedy set cover algorithm works.
  - Quick check question: In the hypergraph G(S), what do nodes and edges represent for a decision rule system S?

- Concept: Set cover problem and greedy approximation algorithms
  - Why needed here: The core algorithm uses a greedy set cover approach, and understanding the logarithmic approximation guarantee is essential for comprehending the depth bound.
  - Quick check question: What is the approximation guarantee of the greedy algorithm for the set cover problem?

- Concept: Decision tree depth and its relationship to computational complexity
  - Why needed here: The paper's main contribution is bounding the depth of the greedy algorithm's decision tree relative to the optimal depth, which is a key measure of algorithmic efficiency.
  - Quick check question: How does decision tree depth relate to the number of queries needed to classify an instance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Agreedy: Greedy set cover algorithm for constructing node covers
  - AEAR: Main algorithm that simulates decision tree operation
  - G(S): Hypergraph representation of decision rule system S
  - EAR(S): Extended All Rules problem instance

- Critical path:
  1. Construct hypergraph G(Smax) from input decision rule system S
  2. Apply Agreedy to construct node cover B1 for G(Smax)
  3. Sequentially compute attribute values for attributes in B1
  4. If not finished, construct hypergraph G((Sα1)max) and repeat

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Greedy vs non-greedy approach: Greedy provides polynomial time but slightly worse bounds; non-greedy may provide better bounds but is computationally expensive
  - Number of rounds vs depth per round: More rounds with smaller node covers vs fewer rounds with larger node covers
  - Approximation quality vs computational efficiency: Better approximations require more computation

- Failure signatures:
  - Algorithm produces decision trees with depth significantly larger than hEAR(S)³ ln(k(S) + 1) + hEAR(S)
  - Greedy set cover algorithm fails to find reasonable node covers
  - Hypergraph construction from decision rule system produces unexpected structures

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test on a simple decision rule system with known optimal decision tree depth to verify the depth bound holds
  2. Compare performance on rule systems with varying rule lengths to test the complementary claim with the previous algorithm
  3. Measure the number of rounds and depth per round for different input sizes to understand the algorithm's scaling behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the proposed greedy algorithm and the previous non-greedy algorithm compare in practice for different types of decision rule systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "we expect that the considered algorithms are mutually complementary: the old one will work better for systems with short decision rules and the new one will work better for systems with long decision rules."
- Why unresolved: This is a hypothesis based on theoretical analysis rather than empirical testing. The authors acknowledge they plan to do computer experiments in the future.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experimental results on benchmark datasets with varying rule lengths and complexities, measuring depth, accuracy, and computational efficiency of both algorithms.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the practical significance of the slightly worse bound (O(hEAR(S)³ ln(k(S) + 1) + hEAR(S))) compared to the previous non-greedy approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note their bound is "a bit worse in the comparison with the bound for the algorithm considered in [13]" but suggest this may be offset by practical advantages.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides theoretical bounds but doesn't demonstrate the practical impact through experiments or specific examples.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing actual tree depths and performance metrics on real-world datasets, along with analysis of when the theoretical bound differences translate to meaningful practical differences.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can a dynamic programming algorithm be developed to minimize the depth of decision trees more effectively than the greedy approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "We are also planning to develop a dynamic programming algorithm for the minimization of the depth of decision trees."
- Why unresolved: This is explicitly mentioned as future work that hasn't been implemented yet.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of such a dynamic programming algorithm, with comparative analysis against both the greedy and previous non-greedy approaches on various problem instances.

## Limitations

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test the greedy algorithm on diverse decision rule systems to verify the depth bound O(hEAR(S)³ ln(k(S) + 1) + hEAR(S)) experimentally.
2. Conduct a comparative study between the greedy and non-greedy approaches on rule systems with varying rule lengths to validate the complementary performance claim.
3. Analyze the algorithm's behavior on real-world datasets to assess practical performance and identify potential limitations not captured by theoretical bounds.
