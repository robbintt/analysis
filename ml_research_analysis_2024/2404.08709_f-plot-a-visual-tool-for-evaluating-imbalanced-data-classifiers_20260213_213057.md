# $F_β$-plot -- a visual tool for evaluating imbalanced data classifiers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08709
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08709
- Authors: Szymon Wojciechowski; Michał Woźniak
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: Fβ-plot reveals classifier performance across different user preferences by showing how rankings change with β.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Fβ-plot, a visualization tool for evaluating classifiers on imbalanced datasets. The method plots the Fβ metric (harmonic mean of precision and recall) against different values of β, which controls the trade-off between these two metrics. By examining where classifier rankings change across the β range, Fβ-plot reveals which models perform best under different user preferences for precision versus recall. The authors demonstrate this on 8 benchmark imbalanced datasets using 92 oversampling-based kNN classifiers, finding that different models dominate depending on β values.

## Method Summary
The Fβ-plot method evaluates imbalanced data classifiers by calculating the Fβ metric across a range of β values (from 0.1 to 100 on a logarithmic scale). The approach uses k-NN classifiers with various SMOTE-based oversampling techniques, evaluated through 2x5-fold stratified cross-validation. For each classifier and β value, Fβ scores are computed and plotted, with statistical significance indicators showing where performance differences are meaningful. The visualization reveals how classifier rankings shift as the emphasis between precision and recall changes.

## Key Results
- Different classifiers dominate at different β ranges: some favor the majority class (low β), some balance both classes (β≈1), and others favor the minority class (high β)
- Fβ-plot effectively reveals where classifier rankings change, helping users match classifier choice to their specific precision/recall trade-off requirements
- The tool provides statistical significance indicators to distinguish truly better classifiers from those appearing better due to sampling variation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fβ-plot reveals classifier performance across different user preferences by showing how rankings change with β.
- Mechanism: By plotting Fβ values against β on a logarithmic scale, the visualization captures how each classifier's harmonic mean of precision and recall shifts as the weight between these metrics changes. Where curves intersect indicates β values where classifier rankings swap, revealing which models are optimal for different precision/recall trade-offs.
- Core assumption: The Fβ metric properly captures user preferences through its β parameter, where lower β favors precision (majority class) and higher β favors recall (minority class).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By examining where classifier rankings change across the β range, Fβ-plot reveals which models perform best under different user preferences for precision vs. recall."
  - [section]: "Fβ-plot is a tool for observing changes in ranking depending on theβ parameter."
- Break condition: If the underlying Fβ metric doesn't accurately reflect user preferences, or if classifier performance is identical across all β values, the plot would show no meaningful variations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fβ-plot helps identify the appropriate classifier for specific imbalanced data scenarios based on the degree of imbalance.
- Mechanism: The tool shows how different oversampling methods perform across varying β values, allowing system designers to select methods that best match their specific imbalance ratio and error cost preferences. The visualization makes it easy to see which methods dominate at extreme β values (strongly favoring one class) versus moderate β values (balanced approach).
- Core assumption: The degree of class imbalance correlates with the appropriate β value, and different oversampling techniques create distinct performance profiles across the β spectrum.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "their key finding is that different models dominate depending on β: some favor the majority class (low β), some balance both classes (β≈1), and others favor the minority class (high β)."
  - [section]: "The experiment aims to investigate observable relationships and discuss their interpretation."
- Break condition: If oversampling techniques don't create meaningful performance differences, or if the relationship between imbalance ratio and optimal β is non-linear or context-dependent.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fβ-plot provides statistical significance indicators to distinguish truly better classifiers from those appearing better due to sampling variation.
- Mechanism: By incorporating standard deviations from cross-validation and using paired t-tests, the visualization can mark statistically significant performance differences, helping users avoid selecting classifiers that appear better due to random variation rather than true performance advantages.
- Core assumption: Statistical tests can reliably identify performance differences across the β range, and these differences are meaningful for practical classifier selection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The result is presented as a black line near the bottom axis, marking the area where the best algorithm is statistically significantly better than other algorithms."
  - [section]: "From this, it can be determined that in the case of an extreme preference against recall (β > 7.56), ISMOTE is the only one to achieve the highest score."
- Break condition: If statistical tests lack power due to limited data or if the variance structure violates test assumptions, the significance indicators may be misleading.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fβ metric and its relationship to precision and recall
  - Why needed here: Understanding how Fβ varies with β is fundamental to interpreting the plot and making informed classifier choices
  - Quick check question: What happens to Fβ as β approaches 0 versus infinity?

- Concept: Imbalanced data classification challenges and loss functions
  - Why needed here: The motivation for using Fβ-plot stems from the lack of reliable metrics when we don't know the true loss function
  - Quick check question: Why is accuracy a poor metric for imbalanced datasets?

- Concept: Confusion matrix and basic classification metrics
  - Why needed here: Fβ is calculated from precision and recall, which are derived from the confusion matrix
  - Quick check question: How are precision and recall calculated from the confusion matrix?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing (oversampling) -> Classifier training (k-NN) -> Metric calculation (Fβ across β range) -> Statistical testing (paired t-tests) -> Visualization (Fβ-plot with significance markers)
- Critical path: Data → Preprocessing → Classification → Metric Calculation → Statistical Analysis → Visualization
- Design tradeoffs: Using a single parametric metric (Fβ) versus multiple simple metrics; computational cost of evaluating across many β values versus comprehensiveness; statistical significance testing versus potential false negatives
- Failure signatures: Flat Fβ curves indicating no meaningful performance differences; excessive intersections suggesting instability; wide confidence intervals indicating insufficient data
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run Fβ-plot on a simple binary dataset with known imbalance to verify the visualization works and produces expected curve shapes
  2. Test with synthetic data where one classifier is known to be superior at specific β values to validate the tool's ability to identify optimal ranges
  3. Evaluate on a real imbalanced dataset with cross-validation to assess statistical significance features and practical utility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Fβ-plot method perform when applied to multi-class imbalanced datasets beyond the binary classification case?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on binary imbalanced classification and does not extend the method to multi-class scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates Fβ-plot on binary classification problems and does not explore its applicability to multi-class imbalanced datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results applying Fβ-plot to multi-class imbalanced datasets with analysis of how the method scales and what modifications might be needed.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of β values to sample when creating Fβ-plots to balance computational efficiency with capturing meaningful classifier behavior?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a continuous range of β values but doesn't discuss the trade-off between resolution and computational cost.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't address how densely β values should be sampled or whether certain ranges require more granularity than others.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the number and spacing of β values to determine when additional resolution provides diminishing returns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does Fβ-plot compare to other multi-metric visualization approaches like ROC curves or precision-recall curves for imbalanced data evaluation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper positions Fβ-plot as an alternative to single-metric approaches but doesn't compare it to other visualization methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide empirical comparisons with established visualization techniques for classifier evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing when Fβ-plot provides unique insights versus when traditional curves might be more informative.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How sensitive is Fβ-plot interpretation to the choice of underlying evaluation protocol (hold-out vs cross-validation) and what are the implications for reproducibility?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates both hold-out and cross-validation approaches but doesn't systematically analyze their impact on Fβ-plot interpretation.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents both protocols but doesn't discuss how protocol choice affects the reliability or interpretability of Fβ-plot results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies comparing Fβ-plot stability across different evaluation protocols and guidelines for protocol selection based on dataset characteristics.

## Limitations
- The generalizability of Fβ-plot findings beyond kNN classifiers and oversampling methods remains untested
- The optimal β range for practical applications (0.1-100) is somewhat arbitrary and may not cover all user preferences
- Statistical significance testing relies on paired t-tests, which may not be appropriate for all data distributions

## Confidence
- High confidence: The Fβ metric's fundamental properties and its relationship to precision/recall trade-offs
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of Fβ-plot in revealing classifier rankings across β ranges, based on the presented experimental results
- Low confidence: The claim that Fβ-plot solves the "no reliable metrics" problem when the loss function is unknown, as this requires broader empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Test Fβ-plot on non-kNN classifiers (e.g., decision trees, SVMs) to assess method generality
2. Evaluate the tool's sensitivity to different β value ranges and sampling strategies
3. Compare Fβ-plot recommendations against domain-specific loss functions in real-world imbalanced classification problems
