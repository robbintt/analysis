# Explaining Explaining

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.18052
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18052

- Primary result: Proposes a hybrid approach using knowledge-based infrastructure supplemented by machine learning for explainable AI, implemented in Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs) that can explain their operation through under-the-hood panels.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical need for explainable AI in high-stakes domains where user trust is paramount. The authors argue that current machine learning-based systems lack true explainability, often redefining explanation rather than genuinely clarifying system functioning. They propose a hybrid approach combining knowledge-based infrastructure with machine learning, implemented through Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). This system can provide detailed explanations of its operations, including language interpretation, visual perception, reasoning, and decision-making processes, demonstrated through a simulated robot search-and-retrieve system.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs) as a hybrid approach to explainable AI, combining knowledge-based systems with machine learning. The method involves creating agents that can not only perform tasks but also provide detailed explanations of their reasoning and actions. The system is demonstrated using a simulated robot scenario where multiple robots collaborate to find lost keys. The LEIAs can show traces of their functioning through various panels, including language interpretation, visual perception, reasoning, and decision-making processes. This approach aims to provide true explanations of system behavior, contrasting with current XAI methods that often redefine explanation rather than genuinely clarifying system functioning.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated a hybrid approach using knowledge-based infrastructure supplemented by machine learning for explainable AI
- Implemented Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs) that can explain their operation through under-the-hood panels
- Showed the system's ability to explain actions and reasoning in a simulated robot search-and-retrieve scenario
- Provided transparency into system functioning including language interpretation, visual perception, reasoning, and decision-making

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach works by combining the interpretability of knowledge-based systems with the flexibility of machine learning. Knowledge-based components provide explicit reasoning traces and interpretable decision-making processes, while machine learning handles complex pattern recognition and adaptation. This combination allows the system to not only make decisions but also explain its reasoning in human-understandable terms. The under-the-hood panels provide visibility into the system's thought processes, agendas, and interpreted sensory data, enabling users to understand how the AI arrived at its conclusions.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge representation: Needed for explicit reasoning and decision-making processes. Quick check: Can the system explain its knowledge structure and how it uses it to make decisions?
- Natural language processing: Required for language interpretation and communication. Quick check: Does the system accurately interpret and generate human language for explanations?
- Computer vision: Essential for visual perception and interpretation of sensory data. Quick check: Can the system accurately describe what it sees and how it uses visual information in decision-making?
- Reasoning and inference: Critical for logical decision-making and explanation of thought processes. Quick check: Can the system show its reasoning steps and justify its conclusions?
- Machine learning: Provides flexibility and adaptation capabilities. Quick check: How does the system balance learned patterns with explicit knowledge in its explanations?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: User Interface -> LEIA Core -> Knowledge Base <- Machine Learning Modules -> Sensors/Actuators
Critical path: User query -> Language interpretation -> Knowledge retrieval -> Reasoning -> Decision making -> Action explanation
Design tradeoffs: Balancing transparency with performance, interpretability with complexity, and real-time operation with detailed explanation generation
Failure signatures: Inability to explain decisions, inconsistent reasoning, sensor interpretation errors, knowledge base gaps
First experiments:
1. Test explanation generation for simple, predefined scenarios
2. Evaluate user comprehension of system explanations in low-stakes situations
3. Assess system performance impact when explanation generation is enabled

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited validation in real-world, high-stakes scenarios
- Unclear scalability to more complex domains
- Potential trade-offs between transparency and system performance not fully explored
- Effectiveness of explanations in improving user trust not empirically validated
- Handling of unexpected situations or adversarial inputs not thoroughly addressed

## Confidence
High: The conceptual framework for hybrid explainable AI is sound
Medium: Effectiveness of explanations in high-stakes scenarios needs further validation
Low: Real-world performance and scalability in complex domains remain uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of explanations in improving trust and decision-making in critical domains
2. Test system performance and explanation quality under time constraints and high-pressure scenarios
3. Assess the system's ability to handle unexpected situations and adversarial inputs while maintaining explainability
