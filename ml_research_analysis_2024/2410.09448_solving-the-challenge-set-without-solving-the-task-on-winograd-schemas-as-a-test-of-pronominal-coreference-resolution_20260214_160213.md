core_contribution: This paper questions the assumption that high performance on a
  challenge set (like the Winograd Schema Challenge) implies strong performance on
  the broader task it represents. The authors show that prompted large language models
  (LLMs), which perform well on WSC-like datasets, struggle with certain pronominal
  coreference resolution (PCR) tasks in naturally occurring text annotated in OntoNotes

# Solving the Challenge Set without Solving the Task: On Winograd Schemas as a Test of Pronominal Coreference Resolution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.09448
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09448
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: High performance on WSC-like datasets does not guarantee strong performance on naturally occurring pronominal coreference resolution tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether high performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) and similar datasets truly indicates strong capabilities in pronominal coreference resolution (PCR). The authors demonstrate that prompted large language models (LLMs) which excel on WSC-like datasets struggle with certain PCR tasks in naturally occurring text from OntoNotes and related corpora. They propose an ensemble method combining a supervised coreference resolution system with a prompted LLM, achieving higher accuracy across both challenge sets and naturally occurring PCR problems. The study concludes that evaluating systems on any single dataset, even a challenge set, does not provide a complete picture of their capabilities.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate prompted LLMs on WSC-like datasets and compare their performance to supervised coreference resolution systems on naturally occurring PCR problems from OntoNotes and related datasets. They propose an ensemble method that combines predictions from both approaches. The ensemble uses the supervised system as a base and incorporates LLM predictions when the supervised system shows uncertainty or lower confidence. Performance is measured across multiple PCR benchmarks to assess generalizability.

## Key Results
- Prompted LLMs perform well on WSC-like datasets but struggle with naturally occurring PCR problems in OntoNotes
- An ensemble method combining supervised coreference resolution with LLM predictions achieves higher accuracy across both challenge sets and naturally occurring PCR problems
- The study demonstrates that high performance on any single dataset, even a challenge set, does not guarantee strong performance on the broader PCR task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ensemble approach leverages the strengths of both supervised systems (robust performance on naturally occurring text) and LLMs (strong reasoning on carefully constructed examples), while mitigating their individual weaknesses. Supervised systems excel at common coreference patterns in naturally occurring text but may struggle with complex reasoning scenarios, while LLMs show the opposite pattern.

## Foundational Learning
- **Pronominal Coreference Resolution**: Identifying which noun phrases pronouns refer to in text; needed to understand the core task being evaluated; quick check: can you trace pronoun antecedents in simple sentences?
- **Winograd Schema Challenge**: A dataset designed to test commonsense reasoning through pronoun resolution; needed as the primary challenge set being evaluated; quick check: can you solve basic WSC examples?
- **OntoNotes Corpus**: A large corpus of naturally occurring text with coreference annotations; needed as the benchmark for real-world PCR performance; quick check: are you familiar with coreference annotation schemes?
- **Large Language Models**: Foundation models capable of few-shot or zero-shot learning; needed as the primary technology being evaluated; quick check: can you distinguish between different prompting strategies?
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models to improve overall performance; needed as the proposed solution; quick check: can you explain how majority voting works in ensembles?
- **Supervised Coreference Resolution**: Traditional machine learning approaches trained on annotated data; needed as the baseline system; quick check: do you understand the difference between rule-based and learned approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Supervised Coreference System -> Ensemble Layer -> Final Prediction
LLM System -> Ensemble Layer -> Final Prediction

**Critical Path**
1. Input text processed by both supervised system and LLM
2. Each system generates pronoun resolution predictions with confidence scores
3. Ensemble layer combines predictions based on confidence and domain appropriateness
4. Final prediction output

**Design Tradeoffs**
- The ensemble method requires maintaining and running two separate systems
- Computational cost increases compared to single-model approaches
- The ensemble approach may introduce complexity in deployment and maintenance

**Failure Signatures**
- When both systems fail on the same examples, the ensemble cannot recover
- Over-reliance on LLM predictions for naturally occurring text may degrade performance
- The ensemble may struggle with domain-specific language not well-represented in training data

**First Experiments**
1. Compare individual system performance on WSC vs OntoNotes to confirm the performance gap
2. Test different ensemble combination strategies (weighted voting, confidence-based selection)
3. Evaluate the ensemble on additional PCR datasets to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights that current PCR benchmarks may not fully capture the diversity of coreference phenomena encountered in real-world applications. There are uncertainties about whether OntoNotes and WinoCore datasets represent the full breadth of coreference challenges practitioners face.

## Limitations
- The specific LLMs evaluated may not be representative of all prompting strategies or model architectures
- OntoNotes and WinoCore datasets, while valuable, may not fully represent the diversity of coreference phenomena in practice
- The ensemble method was only tested on specific model combinations, limiting generalizability claims

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core finding that challenge set performance does not guarantee task performance is well-supported by empirical evidence across multiple datasets
- **Medium confidence**: The ensemble method's general applicability is supported but limited to specific model combinations tested
- **Low confidence**: Broader claims about LLMs' overall capabilities in PCR are constrained by the limited scope of models and datasets examined

## Next Checks
1. Test the ensemble approach across a wider variety of coreference resolution models and LLM architectures
2. Evaluate performance on additional PCR datasets beyond OntoNotes and WinoCore to assess generalizability
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of different components in the ensemble method
