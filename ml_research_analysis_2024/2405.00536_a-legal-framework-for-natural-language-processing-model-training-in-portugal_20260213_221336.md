- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00536
- Authors: Rúben Almeida; Evelin Amorim
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Provides legal framework for Portuguese NLP research addressing copyright and data privacy in LLM development

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a legal framework for Portuguese Natural Language Processing research, focusing on the intersection of copyright law and data privacy regulations. The authors analyze three common NLP use cases—loading Brazilian datasets, crawling Portuguese websites, and using tweets for political profiling—to identify applicable legal requirements. The framework clarifies that scientific research is generally exempt from copyright and data privacy restrictions, but explicit consent is mandatory for processing sensitive data like political opinions. The work bridges the communication gap between legal experts and computer scientists to promote compliant NLP research in Portugal.

## Method Summary
The authors systematically analyze Portuguese and EU legislation relevant to NLP research, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the recently introduced AI Act, and the 2019 Copyright Directive. They examine three specific NLP use cases to identify applicable legal requirements and exemptions. The framework maps legal requirements to technical implementation considerations, providing researchers with actionable guidance for compliance. The methodology involves reviewing legal texts, identifying exemptions for scientific research, and analyzing data collection and processing requirements under various scenarios.

## Key Results
- Scientific research exemptions generally apply to NLP model training under EU and Portuguese law
- Web crawling is permitted when website terms and conditions allow data collection
- Explicit consent is required for processing sensitive data like political opinions, even for research purposes
- The framework identifies relevant licenses for popular NLP resources and datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Scientific research exemptions in copyright and data privacy laws enable compliant NLP model training in Portugal
- Mechanism: The legal framework identifies specific legislative exemptions for scientific research, allowing NLP researchers to use copyrighted data and personal data without explicit consent when the research is conducted for non-commercial, academic purposes
- Core assumption: The research project qualifies as "scientific research" under EU and Portuguese law, meeting criteria such as non-profit status or reinvestment of profits into research
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2019) directive introduces a comprehensive definition of scientific work founded on the concept of profit: 'research organisation means a university, including its libraries, a research institute or any other entity, the primary goal of which is to conduct scientific research or to carry out educational activities involving also the conduct of scientific research: (a) on a not-for-profit basis or by reinvesting all the profits in its scientific research; or (b) pursuant to a public interest mission recognised by a Member State'"
  - [section]: "Many of the legislation listed in the following subsections establish exceptions to scientific work. For that reason, we believe it is paramount to clarify what is considered scientific work by the Portuguese law."
  - [corpus]: "Natural Language Processing for the Legal Domain: A Survey of Tasks, Datasets, Models, and Challenges" - suggests NLP in legal domains is recognized as scientific research, supporting the exemption claim
- Break condition: If the research involves commercial activities, for-profit organizations, or does not meet the strict definition of "scientific research" as defined by EU and Portuguese law

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Web crawling is permitted for NLP corpus creation when terms and conditions allow it
- Mechanism: The legal framework clarifies that web crawling is a permissible activity for NLP researchers as long as the terms and conditions of the websites being crawled explicitly permit such activity. This allows researchers to create large corpora from publicly available web data
- Core assumption: The terms and conditions of the websites being crawled explicitly allow data collection and use for research purposes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "In Figure 2, we describe the legal considerations researchers should pay attention to while crawling websites."
  - [section]: "Web crawling is permitted"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains papers on legal NLP but does not directly address web crawling permissions
- Break condition: If the terms and conditions of the websites prohibit data collection, scraping, or use for training AI models, or if the data is behind a paywall or requires authentication

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sensitive data processing requires explicit consent and is prohibited without it, even for scientific research
- Mechanism: The legal framework emphasizes that processing sensitive data (e.g., political opinions, ethnic data) requires explicit consent from data subjects, and this requirement cannot be overridden by scientific research exemptions. This protects individuals' privacy rights
- Core assumption: The definition of "sensitive data" under Portuguese and EU law includes the types of data the researcher intends to process
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Article 35 of the Portuguese constitution (República Portuguesa, 1976) strictly prohibits the digital processing of sensitive ethnic, political, sexual, or religious data without explicit consent and for scientifically motivated purposes that may positively impact society."
  - [section]: "The RGPR and the Portuguese Constitution prohibit any form of automated processing of sensible data, including political opinions."
  - [corpus]: "Health Insurance Coverage Rule Interpretation Corpus: Law, Policy, and Medical Guidance for Health Insurance Coverage Understanding" - suggests sensitive data (health information) requires careful handling, supporting the consent requirement
- Break condition: If the researcher obtains explicit consent from data subjects, anonymizes the data, or the data does not fall under the definition of "sensitive data"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Legal terminology and distinctions (public vs. semi-public vs. private crimes, regulations vs. directives)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the legal framework requires familiarity with key legal concepts and terminology to correctly interpret the applicable laws and their implications for NLP research
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a regulation and a directive in EU law, and how does this distinction affect the implementation of legal requirements for NLP research in Portugal?

- Concept: Data privacy principles (consent, anonymization, data minimization)
  - Why needed here: NLP researchers must understand and apply data privacy principles to ensure their research complies with GDPR and other relevant data protection laws
  - Quick check question: What are the key principles of data privacy under GDPR, and how do they apply to the collection and use of data for training NLP models?

- Concept: Copyright law and exceptions (fair use, text and data mining exceptions)
  - Why needed here: NLP researchers must understand copyright law to determine whether they can legally use copyrighted material for training their models and what exceptions may apply
  - Quick check question: What are the copyright exceptions for text and data mining under EU law, and how do they apply to the use of copyrighted material for training NLP models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Legal analysis engine -> NLP model training pipeline -> Compliance checker -> Data anonymization module
- Critical path: Legal analysis → Data collection and preprocessing → Model training → Compliance checking → Deployment
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Balancing data privacy with model performance: Stricter privacy measures may limit the amount of data available for training, potentially impacting model performance
  - Compliance overhead vs. research agility: Ensuring compliance with complex legal requirements may slow down the research process
- Failure signatures:
  - Legal analysis engine: Inability to accurately extract relevant legal information or identify applicable laws
  - NLP model training pipeline: Poor model performance due to limited or biased data
  - Compliance checker: False positives or negatives in identifying compliance issues
  - Data anonymization module: Inadequate anonymization leading to privacy breaches
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the legal analysis engine on a sample of legal documents to evaluate its accuracy in extracting relevant information
  2. Train an NLP model using a small dataset to assess the impact of data privacy measures on model performance
  3. Simulate a compliance check on a sample NLP research project to identify potential issues and evaluate the effectiveness of the compliance checker

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the EU AI Act's risk-based approach for regulating AI systems apply to Portuguese NLP research that focuses on non-sensitive domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the AI Act categorizes NLP research as minimal-risk if it doesn't involve sensitive data or significantly impact daily lives
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't specify how the risk categories are determined for different NLP research projects in Portugal
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies of Portuguese NLP research projects classified under different risk categories in the AI Act

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the transposition of EU directives, such as the 2019/790 directive on copyright, affect the legal framework for NLP research in Portugal?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that Portugal has a reputation for delays in transposing EU directives and gives the example of the 2019/790 directive
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide details on the specific impacts of delayed transposition on NLP research in Portugal
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the legal implications of delayed transposition of EU directives on Portuguese NLP research projects

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the potential legal challenges for Portuguese NLP researchers when using datasets from non-EU countries that may not comply with GDPR?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that GDPR applies to data processing in the EU, regardless of the data's origin, and that additional measures may be needed for data from countries without an adequacy decision
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't discuss specific scenarios or legal challenges faced by Portuguese researchers when using non-EU datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies of Portuguese NLP projects using non-EU datasets and the legal measures taken to ensure GDPR compliance

## Limitations

- Legal interpretation variability may lead to different compliance approaches across research groups
- Evolving regulatory landscape creates uncertainty about long-term applicability of the framework
- Limited scope of analyzed use cases may not cover all NLP research scenarios

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Scientific research exemptions for copyright and data privacy laws are well-established in EU legislation, with clear definitions provided by the 2019 Copyright Directive and GDPR
- Medium Confidence: Web crawling permissions based on terms and conditions are technically sound but may face practical challenges in implementation and enforcement across different jurisdictions
- Medium Confidence: Sensitive data processing requirements are clearly defined in Portuguese constitutional law, but the practical implementation of consent mechanisms in NLP contexts requires further validation

## Next Checks

1. Have the framework reviewed by Portuguese legal experts specializing in intellectual property and data protection law to verify the interpretations and identify any potential oversights or alternative interpretations

2. Apply the framework to additional NLP use cases beyond the three presented (e.g., medical text analysis, financial document processing) to test its generalizability and identify gaps in coverage

3. Conduct a pilot implementation of the framework in an active NLP research project, documenting the practical challenges of integrating legal compliance checks into the development workflow and measuring the impact on research productivity
