# Advancing NAM-to-Speech Conversion with Novel Methods and the MultiNAM Dataset

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2412.18839
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18839
- **Reference count:** 36
- **Primary result:** Novel diffusion-based approach (Diff-NAM) achieves WER of 3.55% for NAM-to-speech conversion, outperforming existing methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating intelligible speech from Non-Audible Murmur (NAM) signals, a form of silent speech interface. Current NAM-to-speech conversion methods rely on paired whisper data for ground-truth simulation, which limits generalizability and is impractical for users who cannot whisper. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose novel methods to simulate ground-truth speech without paired whispers. These include using phoneme-level alignments from NAM-text pairs with a TTS system and a diffusion-based method that leverages lip video and NAM data. The authors introduce the MultiNAM dataset, containing over 7.96 hours of paired NAM, whisper, video, and text data from two speakers. Results show that the diffusion-based method (Diff-NAM) outperforms existing approaches, achieving lower word error rates (WER) for both ground-truth simulation and NAM-to-speech conversion, particularly in resource-scarce scenarios.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces two novel approaches to simulate ground-truth speech for NAM-to-speech conversion without relying on paired whisper data. The first method uses phoneme-level alignments from NAM-text pairs with a TTS system to generate ground-truth speech. The second, more effective approach (Diff-NAM) employs a diffusion-based model that leverages both NAM signals and lip video data to synthesize high-quality ground-truth speech. The authors also introduce the MultiNAM dataset, featuring over 7.96 hours of paired NAM, whisper, video, and text data from two speakers, providing a comprehensive resource for training and evaluating NAM-to-speech systems. These innovations address the critical limitation of current NAM-to-speech methods that require whisper data, which is impractical for many users and limits the generalizability of these systems.

## Key Results
- Diff-NAM achieves WER of 4.28% for ground-truth simulation and 3.55% for NAM-to-speech conversion
- The diffusion-based approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in resource-scarce scenarios
- Phoneme-level alignment method shows promise but is outperformed by the diffusion-based approach
- The MultiNAM dataset provides comprehensive paired data (NAM, whisper, video, text) from two speakers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The diffusion-based approach (Diff-NAM) works by leveraging the complementary information from NAM signals and visual lip movements. While NAM captures internal vocal tract vibrations, lip video provides visual articulation cues. By combining these modalities through a diffusion model, the system can generate more accurate ground-truth speech representations that capture both the acoustic and articulatory aspects of speech production. This multimodal approach compensates for the inherent limitations of NAM signals alone, which lack the full spectral information of audible speech. The diffusion model's iterative denoising process allows for the synthesis of high-quality speech that better matches the intended phonemes and prosody encoded in the NAM signals.

## Foundational Learning
- **Non-Audible Murmur (NAM) signals:** Whispered-like sounds produced by internal vocal tract vibrations without audible output. *Why needed:* Understanding NAM as the input modality is crucial for developing appropriate conversion methods.
- **Diffusion models:** Generative models that learn to denoise data through iterative steps. *Why needed:* Forms the basis of the Diff-NAM approach for synthesizing high-quality speech from multimodal inputs.
- **Phoneme-level alignments:** Temporal mapping between text phonemes and acoustic features. *Why needed:* Essential for the TTS-based ground-truth simulation method and for understanding speech production in NAM.
- **Multimodal learning:** Combining information from different input modalities (NAM and video). *Why needed:* The key innovation in Diff-NAM that leverages complementary information sources.
- **Whisper speech:** Low-amplitude speech produced with constrained vocal fold vibration. *Why needed:* Understanding the relationship between NAM and whisper helps explain why paired whisper data has been traditionally used.
- **Word Error Rate (WER):** Standard metric for evaluating speech recognition and synthesis systems. *Why needed:* The primary quantitative measure used to compare the proposed methods against baselines.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
NAM signal -> Feature extraction -> Diff-NAM model <- Lip video feature extraction <- Video input

**Critical path:**
NAM and video features → Diffusion denoising process → High-quality speech synthesis

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Modality fusion vs. model complexity: Combining NAM and video improves quality but increases computational requirements
- Diffusion steps vs. inference speed: More steps improve quality but slow down generation
- Dataset size vs. generalization: Larger datasets improve performance but are expensive to collect

**Failure signatures:**
- Poor performance with occluded faces or low-quality video
- Degradation when NAM signals contain excessive noise or artifacts
- Limited generalization to speakers outside the training distribution

**3 first experiments to run:**
1. Ablation study removing video input to quantify its contribution to performance
2. Cross-speaker evaluation using one speaker for training and another for testing
3. Comparison of different diffusion step counts to analyze quality-speed tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to only two speakers, raising questions about generalizability to diverse speakers and accents
- Reported improvements over baselines are statistically significant but relatively modest (1.42% WER reduction)
- Diffusion model's reliance on lip video data may introduce additional complexity and failure modes

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The validity of the MultiNAM dataset creation methodology and the basic implementation of the proposed methods
- **Medium confidence:** The superiority of Diff-NAM over existing approaches, as this is based on comparisons with relatively few baselines and limited speaker diversity
- **Low confidence:** The practical applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios with diverse speakers and challenging conditions

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the proposed methods on NAM-to-speech conversion with a more diverse set of speakers, including different accents, ages, and speaking styles, to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct user studies to measure the intelligibility and naturalness of the generated speech from NAM signals, as WER alone may not capture all aspects of speech quality.
3. Test the robustness of the Diff-NAM approach under challenging conditions, such as poor video quality, occlusions, or background noise, to assess its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.
