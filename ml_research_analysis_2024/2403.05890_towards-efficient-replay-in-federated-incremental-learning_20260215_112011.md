# Towards Efficient Replay in Federated Incremental Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.05890
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05890
- Authors: Yichen Li; Qunwei Li; Haozhao Wang; Ruixuan Li; Wenliang Zhong; Guannan Zhang

- Primary result: Re-Fed achieves up to 19.73% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in federated incremental learning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in Federated Incremental Learning (FIL), where clients must learn new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous tasks with limited storage. The authors propose Re-Fed, a framework that coordinates clients to cache important samples for replay by calculating sample importance scores using a personalized informative model that incorporates both local and global information. The framework demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across six datasets in class-incremental and domain-incremental learning scenarios.

## Method Summary
Re-Fed introduces a novel approach to federated incremental learning by implementing a coordinated replay mechanism. The framework uses a personalized informative model that calculates sample importance scores based on both local client data and global federated information. This allows clients to selectively cache the most informative samples for replay during subsequent learning tasks. The approach addresses the dual challenges of catastrophic forgetting and limited storage capacity in federated environments, while also reducing communication overhead compared to traditional methods.

## Key Results
- Re-Fed achieves up to 19.73% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods
- Requires fewer communication rounds compared to baseline approaches
- Demonstrates robustness across various parameter settings and dataset types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of Re-Fed stems from its ability to identify and preserve the most informative samples across federated clients. By calculating personalized importance scores that combine local and global information, the framework ensures that each client caches samples that are most valuable for preventing catastrophic forgetting while being efficient with storage constraints. The coordination mechanism allows for knowledge sharing without excessive communication overhead.

## Foundational Learning
- Federated Learning: Distributed machine learning where multiple clients collaborate without sharing raw data
  - Why needed: Enables privacy-preserving collaborative learning across distributed clients
  - Quick check: Understanding how local and global models interact in federated settings

- Catastrophic Forgetting: Phenomenon where neural networks forget previously learned information when trained on new tasks
  - Why needed: Core challenge being addressed in incremental learning scenarios
  - Quick check: How neural networks lose previously learned knowledge during sequential task learning

- Incremental Learning: Learning paradigm where models are trained sequentially on new tasks while retaining knowledge of previous tasks
  - Why needed: Represents the learning scenario where catastrophic forgetting occurs
  - Quick check: Understanding the balance between learning new information and preserving old knowledge

- Sample Importance Scoring: Method of evaluating which data samples are most valuable for model learning
  - Why needed: Enables efficient selection of samples to cache for replay
  - Quick check: How importance scores are calculated and used for sample selection

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Clients -> Personalized Informative Model -> Sample Selection -> Replay Buffer -> Federated Coordination

Critical path: Sample selection and importance scoring -> Federated coordination and knowledge sharing -> Replay buffer management

Design tradeoffs: Storage efficiency vs. model performance, communication overhead vs. accuracy gains, personalization vs. generalization

Failure signatures: Poor sample selection leading to catastrophic forgetting, excessive communication overhead, storage constraints limiting effective replay

First experiments:
1. Test sample importance scoring accuracy on individual clients with synthetic data
2. Evaluate federated coordination efficiency with varying numbers of clients
3. Measure catastrophic forgetting rates with different replay buffer sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to six specific datasets may not reflect broader real-world applicability
- Assumes clients have sufficient storage capacity for sample caching, which may not hold in resource-constrained edge devices
- Scalability to large-scale deployments with hundreds of clients remains unverified
- Real-world federated scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions and varying client participation rates not fully explored

## Confidence
- Theoretical convergence analysis: High
- Empirical performance improvements: High
- Real-world applicability and robustness: Medium
- Scalability to large deployments: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test Re-Fed on larger-scale federated learning scenarios with hundreds of clients and realistic network conditions
2. Evaluate the framework's performance under different storage constraints and varying client availability patterns
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the personalized informative model versus the coordination mechanism in achieving the reported improvements
