# Building Trust in Black-box Optimization: A Comprehensive Framework for Explainability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.14573
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14573
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: IEMSO provides model-agnostic metrics that enhance transparency and trust in black-box optimization through comprehensive explainability across sampling, batch selection, optimization process, and feature importance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap in explainability for black-box optimization (BBO) methods, particularly focusing on surrogate optimization approaches. While existing work emphasizes convergence, practical interpretation of optimization decisions remains underexplored. The authors propose IEMSO (Inclusive Explainability Metrics for Surrogate Optimization), a comprehensive framework of model-agnostic metrics designed to enhance transparency and trust in BBO processes. The framework is structured around four categories: Sampling Core Metrics, Batch Properties Metrics, Optimization Process Metrics, and Feature Importance Metrics, enabling practitioners to understand exploration-exploitation trade-offs, assess batch diversity, and interpret feature significance throughout the optimization workflow.

## Method Summary
The IEMSO framework introduces model-agnostic explainability metrics applicable to any surrogate optimization framework. It implements four categories of metrics: Sampling Core Metrics (explaining individual sample points like PCE, MDPE, CHEE), Batch Properties Metrics (analyzing batch selection with DES, DIS, ABD, HVE), Optimization Process Metrics (tracking convergence and stability via PSSA, CR, OS), and Feature Importance Metrics (quantifying feature contributions through FIEE, FIBB, FIS). The framework is validated on synthetic and real-world benchmarks including 10-dimensional Rastrigin, 2-dimensional Rosenbrock, 14-dimensional Robot Pushing, 6-dimensional Levy, and 60-dimensional Rover Trajectory problems, using various surrogate optimization baselines (qEI, qUCB, qGibbon, qMES, DEEPA) with specific batch sizes and candidate sets.

## Key Results
- IEMSO metrics effectively provide actionable insights for understanding exploration-exploitation trade-offs in batch selection
- The framework enables practitioners to assess batch diversity and interpret feature significance across different surrogate models
- Experimental results demonstrate that IEMSO metrics build trust in optimization outcomes by providing transparency at multiple stages of the surrogate optimization process

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: IEMSO metrics improve user trust by providing both intermediate and post-hoc explanations.
- Mechanism: By offering interpretability at multiple stages—before and after expensive evaluations—users can understand the optimizer's decisions in real time, not just after the fact.
- Core assumption: Users' trust increases when they can validate optimizer choices before committing computational resources.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Through these metrics, we provide both intermediate and post-hoc explanations to practitioners before and after performing expensive evaluations to gain trust."
  - [section] "Unlike (Chakraborty, Seifert, and Wirth 2024), which focuses on explaining the parameter space, we also address the explanation of single and batch BO proposals."
- Break condition: If the metrics fail to convey actionable insights or are computationally prohibitive, trust gains will not materialize.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The model-agnostic design enables broad applicability across surrogate frameworks.
- Mechanism: Since the metrics are not tied to a specific surrogate model or optimizer, they can be integrated into existing systems without redesign.
- Core assumption: Practitioners use a variety of surrogate models and acquisition functions, so a flexible framework increases adoption.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our proposed metrics are designed to be model-agnostic and can be applied to any framework."
  - [section] "Our metrics are divided into four main categories, each focusing on a different aspect of the surrogate optimization process."
- Break condition: If the metrics lose interpretability when applied to certain surrogate models, adoption will drop.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Diverse metric categories (sampling, batch, process, feature) cover the full optimization workflow.
- Mechanism: Each category targets a distinct phase of surrogate optimization, ensuring that no critical decision point lacks transparency.
- Core assumption: Optimization transparency is multi-dimensional—sampling choices, batch composition, convergence behavior, and feature importance all contribute to trust.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We consider four primary categories of metrics, each targeting a specific aspect of the SO process: Sampling Core Metrics, Batch Properties Metrics, Optimization Process Metrics, and Feature Importance."
  - [section] "This comprehensive set of metrics ensures that the decision-making processes in surrogate optimization are transparent, interpretable, and trustworthy."
- Break condition: If any category fails to provide meaningful metrics, users may distrust that phase of optimization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Surrogate Optimization (SO) fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on SO concepts to design explainability metrics, so understanding the optimization loop is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary goal of surrogate optimization in black-box optimization?

- Concept: Exploration-exploitation tradeoff
  - Why needed here: Many IEMSO metrics (e.g., MDPE, HVE) quantify this balance, so recognizing its role is critical.
  - Quick check question: How does the exploration-exploitation tradeoff influence batch selection in BO?

- Concept: Hypervolume in multi-objective optimization
  - Why needed here: CHEE and HVE metrics use hypervolume to measure contributions to exploration-exploitation, so familiarity with this concept is necessary.
  - Quick check question: Why is hypervolume a suitable metric for evaluating exploration-exploitation contributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Evaluated sample points -> Four metric categories (Sampling Core, Batch Properties, Optimization Process, Feature Importance) -> Metric values, visualizations, interpretability insights
- Critical path: Evaluate -> Select batch -> Compute metrics -> Provide explanations -> Trust decision
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Granularity vs. computational cost: More detailed metrics (e.g., PSSA with decision trees) are more informative but computationally heavier.
  - Model-agnostic vs. model-specific: Flexibility comes at the cost of potentially less precise explanations for certain models.
- Failure signatures:
  - Metrics return zero or constant values (coverage metrics failing).
  - High variance in batch properties (DES, DIS) indicating unstable sampling.
  - Feature importance metrics dominated by noise rather than signal.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run IEMSO on a simple 2D synthetic benchmark (e.g., Branin) with qEI and qUCB to validate metric outputs.
  2. Compare metric trends across different surrogate models (GP vs. MARS) on a small real-world problem.
  3. Test batch diversity metrics (DIS, ABD) on a high-dimensional problem to ensure scalability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed IEMSO framework perform in high-dimensional optimization problems compared to other state-of-the-art surrogate optimization methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the application of IEMSO to high-dimensional problems like the Rover Trajectory benchmark but does not provide a detailed comparison with other methods in high-dimensional settings.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of IEMSO with other methods specifically in high-dimensional optimization problems, leaving the effectiveness of IEMSO in such scenarios unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed comparative study of IEMSO with other state-of-the-art methods on a range of high-dimensional optimization problems, measuring convergence rate, stability, and explainability metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the IEMSO metrics scale with the number of features and dimensions in the optimization problem?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the application of IEMSO to problems with varying dimensions but does not explicitly address how the metrics scale with increasing feature and dimension counts.
- Why unresolved: The scalability of the IEMSO metrics is not thoroughly explored, which is crucial for understanding their applicability to very large-scale optimization problems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating the computational efficiency and effectiveness of IEMSO metrics as the number of features and dimensions increases, possibly including a theoretical analysis of computational complexity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the IEMSO framework be effectively integrated with human-in-the-loop optimization processes to improve user trust and decision-making?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the potential for human collaboration with surrogate optimization but focuses on gaining user trust rather than incorporating human feedback.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the practical integration of IEMSO with human-in-the-loop processes, which could enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of optimization outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or experiments demonstrating the integration of IEMSO with human-in-the-loop optimization, measuring improvements in user trust, decision-making quality, and overall optimization performance.

## Limitations

- Computational overhead of some metrics (particularly PSSA and feature importance methods) may limit scalability to high-dimensional problems, though not explicitly quantified
- Framework assumes access to surrogate model's predictions and uncertainty estimates, which may not be available in all BBO implementations
- Effectiveness of explanations for non-expert users is not validated through user studies

## Confidence

- High confidence: The model-agnostic design enabling broad applicability across surrogate frameworks
- Medium confidence: The claim that IEMSO metrics improve user trust through intermediate and post-hoc explanations
- Medium confidence: The comprehensive coverage of optimization workflow through diverse metric categories

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing user trust levels with and without IEMSO explanations on the same optimization problems
2. Measure the computational overhead of each metric category across problems of increasing dimensionality (from 2D to 60D)
3. Test the framework's interpretability when applied to surrogate models beyond GPs and MARS, including tree-based models and neural networks
