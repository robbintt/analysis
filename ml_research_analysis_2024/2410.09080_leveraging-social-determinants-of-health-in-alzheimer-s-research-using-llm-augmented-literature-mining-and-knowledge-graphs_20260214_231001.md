# Leveraging Social Determinants of Health in Alzheimer's Research Using LLM-Augmented Literature Mining and Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.09080
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09080
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SDoH-augmented knowledge graph improves Alzheimer's disease link prediction MRR by 0.004-0.009 compared to biomedical-only baseline

## Executive Summary
This study presents an automated framework that combines large language models and natural language processing to extract social determinants of health (SDoH) knowledge from biomedical literature and integrate it with existing knowledge graphs for Alzheimer's disease research. The framework uses GPT-4o to identify SDoH entities from PubMed abstracts, validates relationships through co-occurrence analysis, and constructs an SDoH knowledge graph that is integrated with the PrimeKG biomedical knowledge graph. The resulting SDoH-augmented graph demonstrates improved link prediction performance across seven target relations, with MRR scores ranging from 0.927 to 0.958 compared to 0.923 to 0.949 for the baseline. The approach successfully predicted novel gene-SDoH and gene-gene relationships, identifying 36 AD-related genes potentially influenced by SDoH factors.

## Method Summary
The framework consists of five key steps: (1) literature collection using PubMed keyword searches for Alzheimer's disease and SDoH-related terms, (2) entity extraction using PubTator and scispaCy followed by GPT-4o classification, (3) relationship extraction and co-occurrence filtering with threshold >0.5, (4) knowledge graph construction, and (5) integration with PrimeKG using identifier mapping. The integrated graph is evaluated using graph convolutional networks for link prediction tasks across seven target relations. The pipeline leverages LLM capabilities to improve entity classification accuracy and employs co-occurrence analysis to ensure statistically significant relationships.

## Key Results
- SDoH-augmented graph (SDoHenPKG) shows MRR improvements of 0.004-0.009 across seven target relations compared to biomedical-only subPrimeKG
- The framework successfully predicted 36 AD-related genes potentially influenced by SDoH factors
- Co-occurrence filtering with threshold 0.5 retained 14,549 SDoH-related edges from the initial extraction
- Integration required mapping 12,773 PubMed abstracts to 10,410 entities in the final knowledge graph

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-augmented entity extraction improves SDoH identification accuracy compared to pure NLP toolkits
- Mechanism: GPT-4o classifies ambiguous terms that scispaCy flags as "potential SDoH candidates," filtering out biomedical entities and retaining context-specific SDoH terms
- Core assumption: GPT-4o reliably distinguishes SDoH factors from biomedical entities in biomedical text
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "To accurately identify the SDoH factors from the candidates, we leveraged OpenAI’s GPT-4o model...For the remaining ones, GPT-4o further classified them into the most relevant subtype"
  - [abstract]: "This study presents a novel, automated framework that leverages recent advancements of large language model (LLM) and natural language processing techniques to mine SDoH knowledge from extensive literature"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct comparative accuracy studies found in corpus
- Break condition: GPT-4o misclassifies domain-specific terms (e.g., "gene" as SDoH) or misses context-dependent SDoH factors

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Co-occurrence filtering with threshold 0.5 ensures statistically significant entity relationships
- Mechanism: For each biomedical-SDoH pair, calculate co-occurrence score as ratio of sentences containing both entities to max frequency of either entity
- Core assumption: Co-occurrence score > 0.5 indicates meaningful relationship rather than chance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Only pairs with a co-occurrence score greater than 0.5 were retained, ensuring that the relationships we included in the knowledge graph were statistically significant and contextually relevant"
  - [abstract]: "we employ GPT’s language abilities to extract their potential relations and filter for co-occurrences to ensure accuracy"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no statistical validation of threshold choice found in corpus
- Break condition: True relationships have co-occurrence < 0.5 due to sparse mentions or threshold is too conservative

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SDoH integration improves link prediction performance by adding complementary social-biological context
- Mechanism: Graph neural networks learn better node representations when trained on SDoH-augmented graph compared to biomedical-only graph
- Core assumption: SDoH entities provide non-redundant information that enhances GCN predictive capability
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "SDoHenPKG shows a significant improvement in the link prediction task across all selected relations compared to subPrimeKG"
  - [abstract]: "the resulting SDoH-augmented graph demonstrates improved link prediction performance across seven target relations, with MRR scores ranging from 0.927 to 0.958 compared to 0.923 to 0.949 for the baseline"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no comparative studies found in corpus for similar SDoH-KG integration approaches
- Break condition: GCN fails to leverage SDoH features effectively or SDoH information is redundant with existing biomedical edges

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge graph construction and link prediction
  - Why needed here: Framework builds an SDoH knowledge graph and evaluates it through link prediction tasks to demonstrate utility
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a knowledge graph from a regular graph in this context?

- Concept: Graph neural networks (GCNs) for link prediction
  - Why needed here: GCNs are used to learn node embeddings and predict missing edges in both baseline and SDoH-augmented graphs
  - Quick check question: How does a GCN aggregate information from neighboring nodes to create node representations?

- Concept: Entity mapping across biomedical databases
  - Why needed here: Integration requires mapping SDoH graph entities to PrimeKG using identifiers like MeSH, OMIM, MONDO, DrugBank
  - Quick check question: Why is it necessary to use multiple identifier systems when integrating knowledge graphs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Literature collection -> Entity extraction -> GPT-4o filtering -> Co-occurrence filtering -> Knowledge graph construction -> Integration with PrimeKG -> Link prediction evaluation
- Critical path: Entity extraction -> GPT-4o classification -> Co-occurrence filtering -> Graph construction -> Integration -> Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Using GPT-4o provides high accuracy but introduces API costs and latency; pure NLP would be faster but less accurate
- Failure signatures: Low MRR scores suggest integration issues; high false positive rates suggest classification problems; integration failures suggest mapping errors
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run entity extraction on small PubMed sample and verify GPT-4o classifications against manual labels
  2. Test co-occurrence calculation on known entity pairs to validate threshold choice
  3. Compare MRR scores on subPrimeKG vs SDoHenPKG for single relation to confirm integration impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework be generalized to other diseases beyond Alzheimer's disease?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that the pipeline is general and can be well applied to other domains, and that the framework is generalizable to other diseases or health conditions where SDoH factors play a significant role.
- Why unresolved: While the authors mention the potential for generalization, they do not provide specific examples or demonstrate the application of the framework to other diseases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the framework to at least one other disease, with a comparison of results to those obtained for Alzheimer's disease.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the computational resource requirements for processing large volumes of literature, and how can they be reduced?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that the computational resources required for graph construction were substantial due to the need to process duplicated content across large volumes of literature.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific details on the computational resources used or strategies for reducing these requirements.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed breakdown of the computational resources used (e.g., processing time, memory usage) and proposed strategies for reducing these requirements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the classification models be refined to improve the accuracy of SDoH factor identification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that some SDoH factors were difficult to classify accurately, especially those that are ambiguous or context-dependent.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose specific methods for refining the classification models or improving their accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparison of the current classification accuracy with that achieved using refined models, along with a description of the methods used to improve the models.

## Limitations

- The co-occurrence threshold of 0.5 lacks statistical justification and may exclude meaningful relationships with lower co-occurrence scores
- GPT-4o prompt effectiveness and classification accuracy are not empirically validated against human annotations
- Link prediction improvements of 0.004-0.009 represent modest gains that may not justify the added complexity of SDoH integration

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Framework architecture and methodology are clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Link prediction results show consistent improvements, but statistical significance testing is absent
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about biological relevance of predicted gene-SDoH relationships lack experimental validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human annotation study on 100 randomly sampled entity classifications to empirically measure GPT-4o accuracy and false positive/negative rates
2. Perform statistical power analysis to determine if observed MRR improvements are significant given the sample sizes and variance
3. Validate predicted gene-SDoH relationships through literature review or experimental studies to assess biological plausibility claims
