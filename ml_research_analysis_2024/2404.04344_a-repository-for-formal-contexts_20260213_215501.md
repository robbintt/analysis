# A Repository for Formal Contexts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.04344
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04344
- Reference count: 34
- One-line primary result: Proposed a git-based FCA repository to address lack of central data sets, enabling reproducible research and easy access to formal contexts.

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses the absence of a central repository for Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) data sets, which impedes reproducible research and comparison of results in the field. The authors propose a simple, file-based FCA repository hosted on GitHub that stores formal contexts in the Burmeister "cxt" format alongside machine-readable metadata. This approach leverages git for version control, enables automatic generation of derivatives like lattice diagrams, and lowers the barrier for both tool integration and manual curation. Initial implementation includes 12 contexts and metadata, with integration into existing FCA tools like the Python library "concepts" underway. The authors identify challenges for sustainability and acceptance, and propose establishing a working group to develop curation policies and promote community adoption.

## Method Summary
The method involves creating a GitHub repository to host FCA contexts in Burmeister "cxt" format, developing a metadata schema with required fields (title, source, language, description), and implementing a system to automatically generate derivatives like lattice diagrams and statistics. The repository uses a single YAML file for metadata, stores each context as a self-contained .cxt file, and employs CI/CD workflows for validation and derivative generation. The approach centers on formal contexts rather than full FCA structures to maximize adoption and simplicity.

## Key Results
- Proposed a git-based FCA repository to address lack of central data sets
- Initial implementation includes 12 contexts and metadata with CI/CD for validation
- Integration with existing FCA tools like Python's "concepts" library underway

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The file-based approach with git enables both reproducibility and collaboration without requiring a complex backend.
- Mechanism: Each formal context is a self-contained file in a standard format (Burmeister .cxt), stored in a git repository. This allows version control, easy forking, and automated CI/CD pipelines for derivative generation (e.g., lattice diagrams).
- Core assumption: Researchers are comfortable with git and file-based workflows; tooling exists to parse .cxt files reliably.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "each context is a file in a git repository, and the metadata for each context is described in a file that is machine-readable and human-editable."
  - [section 4.2] "Using the git version control system automatically solves this problem."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence from corpus papers about git-based repositories.
- Break condition: If the FCA community lacks git familiarity or prefers web-based GUIs over file manipulation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Machine-readable metadata alongside human-editable YAML files lowers the barrier for both tool integration and manual curation.
- Mechanism: Metadata is stored in YAML, a human-friendly format, but structured enough for machines to parse and consume. This supports both programmatic access and easy editing by non-technical contributors.
- Core assumption: YAML is sufficiently expressive for FCA metadata needs and widely supported.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "Using YAML, the context from Example 1 could be represented as follows: [example]"
  - [abstract] "machine-readable and human-editable"
- Break condition: If metadata complexity outgrows YAML's simplicity or if tooling support for YAML in FCA libraries is lacking.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Limiting scope to formal contexts (not full FCA structures) increases adoption by focusing on the community's immediate need.
- Mechanism: By centering the repository on formal contexts, the authors avoid the complexity of representing implications, concept lattices, or triadic contexts upfront, making the repository easier to populate and use.
- Core assumption: Most FCA research and teaching starts with formal contexts, and other structures can be derived as needed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.4] "It is centered around formal contexts and there is no intention for a comprehensive or even complete modeling of all FCA data structures."
  - [abstract] "Data is always at the center of the theoretical development and investigation of the applicability of formal concept analysis."
- Break condition: If users demand richer structure representation early, leading to fragmentation or confusion.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Git and version control basics
  - Why needed here: The repository's sustainability and collaboration model relies on git workflows.
  - Quick check question: Can you fork a repo, make a commit, and open a pull request without breaking the build?

- Concept: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding formal contexts, objects, attributes, and incidence relations is essential to contribute valid data.
  - Quick check question: Given a small dataset, can you manually construct the formal context and identify its concepts?

- Concept: YAML syntax and structure
  - Why needed here: Metadata is stored in YAML; contributors need to write and edit it correctly.
  - Quick check question: Can you write a YAML file describing a dataset with title, source, language, and description fields?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Repository root: Contains `contexts/` (all .cxt files), `metadata.yaml` (central metadata), `README.md`, `.github/` (CI/CD workflows).
  - Contexts: One .cxt file per formal context, named in lowercase with underscores and language code.
  - Metadata: Single YAML file mapping context filenames to metadata fields.
  - CI/CD: Automated checks for .cxt validity, metadata consistency, and derivative generation.

- Critical path:
  1. Contributor adds a .cxt file to `contexts/`.
  2. Contributor updates `metadata.yaml` with required fields.
  3. CI checks file validity and metadata completeness.
  4. Derivatives (e.g., diagrams) are auto-generated.
  5. PR is reviewed and merged.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. expressiveness: Chosen to favor simplicity (KISS principle) to ensure adoption.
  - Single metadata file vs. per-file metadata: Single file reduces redundancy but may complicate bulk edits.
  - Git-based vs. database-backed: Git offers transparency and decentralization but lacks advanced querying.

- Failure signatures:
  - Broken CI on new PRs: Indicates invalid .cxt or malformed metadata.
  - Missing or incomplete metadata: Suggests contributor confusion or lack of documentation.
  - Repository bloat: Too many trivial or redundant contexts without curation policy.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Clone the repo, add a simple .cxt file with metadata, verify CI passes.
  2. Modify an existing context's metadata, check that derivatives regenerate.
  3. Simulate a contributor conflict by editing the same metadata entry, resolve via PR.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What curation policy and metadata schema should be adopted to ensure scientific reliability and sustainability of the FCA repository?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "a curation policy and metadata schema has to be developed" and propose involving the community in this process.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as a key challenge but does not provide specific details or examples of what the policy should include.
- What evidence would resolve it: A draft curation policy document with specific guidelines for metadata fields, naming conventions, and quality control measures, along with community feedback and revisions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the FCA repository be integrated into existing FCA tools and libraries to enable seamless access for researchers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose: "authors of FCA tools and libraries need to implement a reliable interface to the repository" and mention initial integration efforts with Python libraries.
- Why unresolved: The paper only discusses initial integration examples and does not provide a comprehensive strategy for wider tool adoption.
- What evidence would resolve it: A list of FCA tools and libraries with implemented repository integration, along with documentation of the integration process and user feedback on its effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What measures can be taken to ensure the long-term sustainability and preservation of the FCA repository, including hosting and data migration?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention: "For sustainability, we envision to create snapshots of the git repository on a regular basis and to publish them on suitable platforms, such as Zenodo."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide detailed plans for hosting, data migration, or long-term preservation strategies beyond initial snapshots.
- What evidence would resolve it: A sustainability plan outlining hosting arrangements, data backup and migration procedures, and a timeline for regular snapshots and publications on platforms like Zenodo.

## Limitations
- Repository adoption depends on FCA community's git familiarity and file-based workflow preferences.
- Single YAML metadata file may become a bottleneck for large-scale curation and merge conflicts.
- Scope limitation to formal contexts may frustrate users needing richer FCA structures represented directly.

## Confidence

- Technical feasibility: High
  - Simple .cxt format and widespread git adoption support implementation.

- Community adoption: Medium
  - Depends on FCA community preferences and existing tool support, which are outside paper's control.

- Long-term sustainability: Low
  - Acknowledged as future work without defined governance and curation policies.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a small-scale trial with 5-10 FCA researchers to assess ease of use and identify friction points in the contribution workflow.

2. Benchmark the repository's performance with 100+ contexts to evaluate scalability of the single YAML metadata approach and identify potential bottlenecks.

3. Survey existing FCA tool developers to gauge integration interest and estimate the effort required to support the repository format in their libraries.
