# Synergizing Foundation Models and Federated Learning: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.12844
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12844
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive survey identifying efficiency, adaptability, and trustworthiness challenges in combining foundation models with federated learning, categorizing techniques to address these issues

## Executive Summary
This survey explores the convergence of Foundation Models (FMs) and Federated Learning (FL), two transformative paradigms in artificial intelligence. FMs, characterized by their large-scale pre-training and broad applicability, face significant challenges when deployed in federated settings, including high computational costs, domain adaptation difficulties, and privacy concerns. The paper systematically categorizes these challenges into efficiency, adaptability, and trustworthiness dimensions, providing a structured overview of existing solutions and identifying critical research gaps. By examining techniques such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model compression, and domain-specific adaptations, the survey offers insights into the potential and limitations of federated foundation models across various applications including multilingual NLP, speech processing, recommendation systems, and healthcare.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a comprehensive literature review methodology, systematically categorizing existing research on the intersection of foundation models and federated learning. The authors identify three primary challenge categories—efficiency, adaptability, and trustworthiness—and review representative techniques addressing each dimension. The analysis spans from fundamental optimization methods like parameter-efficient fine-tuning and model compression to advanced approaches for domain adaptation and privacy protection. The survey also examines real-world applications and outlines future research directions, providing a holistic view of the current state and potential developments in federated foundation models.

## Key Results
- Identifies efficiency challenges in federated foundation models and reviews parameter-efficient fine-tuning and compression techniques
- Categorizes adaptability challenges into domain-centric, client-centric, and system-centric adaptation approaches
- Highlights trustworthiness issues including IP protection, privacy preservation, and attack robustness in federated settings
- Outlines applications in multilingual NLP, speech, recommendation, and healthcare domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The synergy between foundation models and federated learning addresses the fundamental tension between leveraging large-scale pre-trained models and preserving data privacy through decentralized training. Foundation models provide strong general-purpose representations that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, while federated learning enables model training without centralizing sensitive data. This combination allows organizations to benefit from advanced AI capabilities while maintaining data sovereignty and privacy compliance. The effectiveness stems from parameter-efficient techniques that reduce communication overhead, domain adaptation methods that handle heterogeneous data distributions, and privacy-preserving mechanisms that protect both model intellectual property and user data.

## Foundational Learning

### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
- **Why needed**: Reduces computational costs and communication overhead in federated settings
- **Quick check**: Compare parameter updates between full fine-tuning and PEFT methods like LoRA or prompt tuning

### Federated Learning Basics
- **Why needed**: Enables collaborative model training without data centralization
- **Quick check**: Verify convergence guarantees under non-IID data distributions and client heterogeneity

### Model Compression Techniques
- **Why needed**: Reduces model size for efficient transmission and storage in resource-constrained environments
- **Quick check**: Measure accuracy-latency tradeoffs between pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation

### Domain Adaptation
- **Why needed**: Addresses distribution shifts between pre-training and target domains in federated settings
- **Quick check**: Evaluate performance degradation when applying models to out-of-distribution data

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
FM Server -> Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning -> Client Devices -> Federated Aggregation -> Updated Global Model -> FM Server

### Critical Path
Initialization of pre-trained FM → Client-side fine-tuning with PEFT → Local inference and gradient computation → Secure aggregation → Global model update → Distribution to clients

### Design Tradeoffs
Model capacity vs. communication efficiency (larger models provide better performance but increase bandwidth requirements); privacy protection vs. model utility (stronger privacy mechanisms may reduce model accuracy); centralization of computation vs. decentralization of data (balancing computational resources with privacy constraints)

### Failure Signatures
Stalled convergence due to non-IID data distributions; model degradation from excessive compression; privacy leakage through gradient inversion attacks; communication bottlenecks from large model updates

### First 3 Experiments
1. Benchmark PEFT methods (LoRA, prompt tuning) against full fine-tuning in federated setting with varying client numbers
2. Evaluate compression techniques (pruning, quantization) on model accuracy and communication efficiency
3. Test attack robustness against gradient inversion and membership inference attacks in federated foundation model deployment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The survey identifies several critical open questions including the development of efficient federated black-box tuning methods, exploration of continual learning in federated foundation model contexts, investigation of multimodal federated learning scenarios, and addressing the challenges of AI-generated content in federated settings. Additionally, the paper highlights the need for standardized evaluation frameworks for federated foundation models and the development of techniques that can effectively handle the massive scale and complexity of foundation models in decentralized environments.

## Limitations

The survey acknowledges the rapidly evolving nature of both foundation models and federated learning, which may quickly render some findings outdated. The comprehensive scope may result in varying depths of coverage across different topics, potentially overlooking nuanced details in specific areas. The effectiveness of proposed techniques for combining FMs and FL in real-world applications remains largely untested, particularly in complex, heterogeneous environments with diverse data distributions and resource constraints.

## Confidence

- Efficiency improvements through parameter-efficient fine-tuning and model compression: High
- Adaptability challenges in federated foundation models: Medium
- Trustworthiness issues (privacy, IP protection, attack robustness): Medium
- Real-world applicability of FM-FL techniques: Low

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a systematic literature review to identify and verify the most recent advancements in FM-FL techniques since the survey's publication
2. Implement and evaluate the proposed efficiency and adaptation techniques on a benchmark dataset to assess their practical effectiveness
3. Design and execute a case study in a specific domain (e.g., healthcare or multilingual NLP) to validate the survey's claims about real-world applicability and challenges of FM-FL systems
