# Towards Automated Causal Discovery: a case study on 5G telecommunication data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2402.14481
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14481
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** AutoCD system automates causal discovery with precision >0.8 and recall >0.6 on synthetic data, handling mixed data types and latent confounders

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AutoCD, a system for fully automated causal discovery and reasoning. AutoCD integrates automated feature selection, causal structure learning, and causal query answering into a single pipeline. The system optimizes both the choice of causal discovery algorithm and its hyperparameters, handles mixed data types and latent confounders, and produces interpretable outputs such as edge confidence scores and causal paths. In a real-world 5G telecommunications case study with 429 variables across three time lags, AutoCD identified the Markov boundary of the target variable and estimated a causal graph with 163 edges, showing extensive confounding. On synthetic and resimulated data, AutoCD achieved Markov boundary precision >0.8 and recall >0.6, with edge confidence AUC between 0.67 and 0.8 depending on sample size.

## Method Summary
AutoCD is a comprehensive system that automates the entire causal discovery process from raw data to actionable insights. The system combines multiple components including automated feature selection using Markov boundary estimation, causal structure learning with algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, and causal query answering for specific causal effect estimation. AutoCD handles both discrete and continuous variables, accounts for latent confounders through algorithms like FCI and RFCI, and provides interpretable outputs including edge confidence scores and causal paths. The system was tested on a 5G telecommunications dataset with 429 variables and three time lags, as well as synthetic and resimulated data to evaluate performance metrics.

## Key Results
- AutoCD achieved Markov boundary precision >0.8 and recall >0.6 on synthetic and resimulated data
- Edge confidence AUC ranged from 0.67 to 0.8 depending on sample size
- In 5G case study, AutoCD identified 163 causal edges among 429 variables, revealing extensive confounding
- System successfully handled mixed data types and latent confounders in real-world telecommunications data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AutoCD works by automating the traditionally manual and complex process of causal discovery. The system first identifies relevant variables through Markov boundary estimation, then selects and optimizes appropriate causal discovery algorithms based on data characteristics. By handling both discrete and continuous variables and accounting for latent confounders, AutoCD can discover more accurate causal structures than methods that assume complete data or require manual preprocessing. The integration of feature selection, algorithm optimization, and query answering into a single pipeline eliminates the need for domain expertise at each step, making causal discovery accessible to non-experts while maintaining rigorous statistical foundations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Markov boundary estimation**: Identifies the minimal set of variables that shield the target from all other variables, reducing dimensionality while preserving causal information
- **Causal structure learning algorithms**: Methods like PC, FCI, and GES that infer causal relationships from observational data under specific assumptions
- **Latent variable handling**: Techniques for discovering causal relationships when unmeasured confounders are present, using algorithms like FCI and RFCI
- **Hyperparameter optimization**: Automated tuning of algorithm parameters to maximize performance on specific datasets
- **Mixed data type handling**: Methods for simultaneously analyzing discrete and continuous variables in causal discovery
- **Causal query answering**: Techniques for estimating specific causal effects once a causal graph is learned

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Raw Data -> Feature Selection -> Algorithm Selection -> Structure Learning -> Edge Confidence Scoring -> Causal Query Answering

**Critical Path:** Feature Selection (Markov boundary) -> Algorithm Selection (based on data type and latent confounder presence) -> Structure Learning (FCI/RFCI/PC) -> Edge Confidence Scoring (bootstrap resampling) -> Query Answering (do-calculus)

**Design Tradeoffs:** 
- Uses multiple algorithms (PC, FCI, RFCI, GES) to handle different data scenarios rather than specializing in one
- Trades computational efficiency for robustness by running multiple algorithms and combining results
- Prioritizes interpretability and accessibility over raw performance, producing edge confidence scores and causal paths

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Low precision in Markov boundary detection indicates irrelevant variables not filtered out
- Wide variation in edge confidence scores suggests instability in causal structure learning
- Poor query answering performance may indicate violation of causal discovery assumptions

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Run AutoCD on a small synthetic dataset with known ground truth to verify basic functionality
2. Test feature selection component alone on high-dimensional data to evaluate Markov boundary accuracy
3. Compare edge confidence scores from bootstrap resampling against simple frequency counts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but implicit questions include: How does AutoCD perform on datasets with different types of latent confounding structures? What is the impact of temporal dependencies in time-series data on causal discovery accuracy? How can the system be extended to handle dynamic causal models and changing relationships over time?

## Limitations
- Limited real-world validation with only one case study on 5G telecommunications data
- Performance metrics based primarily on synthetic and resimulated data rather than purely real-world testing
- No comparison with established causal discovery benchmarks to contextualize performance claims
- System complexity may still present challenges for truly non-expert users despite automation

## Confidence
- **Automated causal discovery performance (precision >0.8, recall >0.6):** Medium
- **Real-world applicability to 5G telecommunications:** Medium
- **Accessibility for non-expert users:** Low
- **Handling of latent confounders:** Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct independent validation on additional real-world 5G datasets from different telecom operators to assess generalizability
2. Compare AutoCD performance against established causal discovery methods (PC, FCI, GES) on standardized benchmark datasets
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of individual components (feature selection, algorithm optimization, query answering) to overall performance
