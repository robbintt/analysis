# Inferring Preferences from Demonstrations in Multi-Objective Residential Energy Management

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.07722
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07722
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: DWPI algorithm accurately infers user preferences in simulated multi-objective residential energy management scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the Dynamic Weight Preference Inference (DWPI) algorithm for inferring user preferences in multi-objective residential energy management systems. The method uses a Dynamic Weight Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (DWMORL) agent to generate demonstrations paired with preference weights, which are then used to train a supervised learning model. The approach is evaluated on three scenarios: always maximizing comfort, always saving cost, and a mixture of both objectives. Results show the DWPI model can accurately infer user preferences, with agent-generated outcomes closely resembling user-generated outcomes in simulated comparisons.

## Method Summary
The DWPI algorithm employs a two-stage approach to preference inference. First, a DWMORL agent generates demonstrations by interacting with the environment while optimizing multiple objectives (cost and comfort) using dynamically weighted rewards. These demonstrations are paired with their corresponding preference weights. Second, a supervised learning model is trained on this demonstration dataset to learn the mapping between state-action trajectories and preference weights. During inference, the trained model predicts user preferences from new demonstrations. The method leverages the advantage of reinforcement learning in handling complex, sequential decision-making problems while using supervised learning for efficient preference inference from demonstrations.

## Key Results
- DWPI accurately infers preferences in three test scenarios: always comfort-maximizing, always cost-saving, and mixed preferences
- Agent-generated outcomes closely resemble user-generated outcomes in simulated comparison experiments
- Inferred preferences significantly influence agent behavior patterns, aligning them with corresponding user preferences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The DWPI algorithm works by combining reinforcement learning's ability to generate diverse demonstrations with supervised learning's efficiency in pattern recognition. The DWMORL agent explores the state space while optimizing multiple objectives with dynamic weights, creating a rich dataset of state-action trajectories paired with preference weights. The supervised model then learns to recognize patterns in these trajectories that correspond to different preference weights. This approach leverages the strengths of both reinforcement learning (exploration and optimization) and supervised learning (efficient inference from examples) to create an effective preference inference system.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-objective reinforcement learning**: Needed to handle multiple competing objectives in energy management; quick check - can the agent balance cost and comfort effectively
- **Dynamic weight adjustment**: Required to generate diverse demonstrations with different preference weights; quick check - does weight variation produce distinct behavior patterns
- **Preference inference from demonstrations**: Core capability for learning user preferences without explicit specification; quick check - can the model accurately predict weights from new trajectories
- **Residential energy management**: Application domain requiring understanding of HVAC and appliance control; quick check - does the model produce realistic energy consumption patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
User Demonstrations -> DWMORL Agent -> Demonstration Dataset -> Supervised Learning Model -> Preference Inference

Critical Path:
DWMORL agent generates demonstrations → Dataset creation with preference weights → Supervised model training → Preference inference from new demonstrations

Design Tradeoffs:
- Reinforcement learning for demonstration generation provides rich data but is computationally expensive
- Supervised learning for inference is efficient but requires substantial training data
- Balancing exploration vs exploitation in DWMORL affects demonstration diversity

Failure Signatures:
- Poor inference accuracy suggests insufficient demonstration diversity or inadequate model capacity
- Computational inefficiency may indicate suboptimal reinforcement learning hyperparameters
- Inconsistent results across scenarios may reveal overfitting to specific preference patterns

First 3 Experiments:
1. Test DWPI inference accuracy on simple two-state environments with known preferences
2. Evaluate robustness by introducing noise in demonstration trajectories
3. Compare inference performance across different supervised learning model architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the DWPI algorithm perform when inferring preferences from real human user demonstrations rather than simulated rule-based demonstrations?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions extending the work to incorporate demonstrations from real human users rather than simulated users as a potential future direction.
- Why unresolved: The current study only uses simulated demonstrations following rule-based approaches, not actual human behavior which may be more complex and noisy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with real human user demonstrations and comparing the inference accuracy to the current simulated results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would incorporating additional objectives beyond cost and comfort (such as environmental impact or peak demand reduction) affect the accuracy and complexity of preference inference?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions extending to more complex scenarios with multiple objectives like heating, air conditioning, and sweeping robots as a potential direction.
- Why unresolved: The current study only considers two objectives, and the impact of adding more objectives on inference performance is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the DWPI algorithm to scenarios with three or more objectives and measuring changes in inference accuracy and computational requirements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would the preference inference performance change when applying DWPI in a multi-agent context where multiple users have different preferences?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions extending this work into a multi-agent context as a potential future research direction.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses on single-user preference inference, and the challenges of inferring multiple users' preferences simultaneously are unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the DWPI algorithm in a multi-agent environment and comparing the inference accuracy and computational efficiency to the single-agent case.

## Limitations
- Results based on simulated demonstrations rather than real human user behavior
- Limited evaluation to only three predefined preference scenarios
- No assessment of method's robustness to noisy or inconsistent demonstrations

## Confidence
- **Method validity**: Medium - Shows promise in controlled scenarios but lacks real-world validation
- **Generalizability**: Medium - Performance on three scenarios suggests potential but broader testing needed
- **Robustness**: Low - No testing with noisy or inconsistent demonstrations
- **Scalability**: Low - Unexplored for scenarios with more than two objectives

## Next Checks
1. Test the DWPI algorithm with real user demonstrations from diverse residential settings to assess performance with actual user behavior.
2. Evaluate the method's robustness to noisy or inconsistent demonstrations by introducing controlled variations in the input data.
3. Extend the evaluation to include a wider range of preference scenarios beyond the three tested, including edge cases and more complex preference combinations.
