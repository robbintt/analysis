# Balanced Resonate-and-Fire Neurons

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.14603
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14603
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: BRF-RSNNs achieve higher accuracy with fewer spikes and parameters compared to ALIF-RSNNs on sequential MNIST, permuted sequential MNIST, ECG, and Spiking Heidelberg datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes balanced resonate-and-fire (BRF) neurons to overcome limitations of standard resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons in recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs). BRF neurons incorporate a refractory period and smooth reset mechanism to improve stability and learning. Experiments on sequential MNIST, permuted sequential MNIST, ECG, and Spiking Heidelberg datasets show that BRF-RSNNs achieve higher accuracy with fewer spikes and parameters compared to baseline ALIF-RSNNs. BRF-RSNNs also exhibit faster and more stable convergence during training, even for long sequences. The improved performance is attributed to the BRF neurons' ability to effectively learn underlying frequency patterns in the input signals through their resonating behavior.

## Method Summary
The method involves implementing BRF and BHRF neuron models with refractory period, smooth reset, and divergence boundary. These neurons are then trained on sequential MNIST, permuted sequential MNIST, ECG, and Spiking Heidelberg datasets using backpropagation through time (BPTT) with double-Gaussian surrogate gradient. The performance is compared against baseline ALIF-RSNNs in terms of test accuracy, number of spikes, number of parameters, and convergence speed. The training uses Adam/RAdam/RMSprop optimizer with early stopping on validation loss.

## Key Results
- BRF-RSNNs achieve higher accuracy with fewer spikes and parameters compared to ALIF-RSNNs on benchmark datasets
- BRF-RSNNs exhibit faster and more stable convergence during training, even for long sequences
- Improved performance attributed to BRF neurons' ability to effectively learn underlying frequency patterns in input signals

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The BRF neuron's refractory period and smooth reset mechanism reduces excessive spiking and improves learning stability.
- Mechanism: The refractory period increases the firing threshold after each spike, preventing continuous spiking. The smooth reset mechanism decays the oscillation amplitude faster after firing, maintaining the oscillatory behavior while reducing noise.
- Core assumption: The combination of refractory period and smooth reset effectively balances spiking sparsity with maintaining resonant behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "BRF neurons incorporate a refractory period and smooth reset mechanism to improve stability and learning."
  - [section]: "To reduce continuous spiking of the neuron and induce spiking sparsity, a refractory period, referred to as q(t), is implemented in the threshold, increasing it after a neuron fires... The influence of implementing the refractory period and the smooth reset can be seen in Figure 2."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Corpus neighbors do not directly address refractory period or smooth reset mechanisms.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The divergence boundary ensures stable oscillation and prevents the membrane potential from diverging.
- Mechanism: By restricting the parameter space to a subspace below the divergence boundary, the BRF neuron ensures that the membrane potential converges or shows sustained oscillation, preventing artificial signals that disrupt the original frequencies.
- Core assumption: The analytically derived relationship between the discrete time scale, dampening factor, and angular frequency effectively prevents divergence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "To alleviate the divergence problem, we propose to restrict the parameter space to a subspace below the divergence boundary... The condition for the neuron to show damped oscillation is found by solving the quadratic inequality for bc."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Corpus neighbors do not directly address divergence boundaries or stability conditions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The BRF neuron's ability to learn underlying frequency patterns in the input signals improves task performance.
- Mechanism: The BRF neuron acts as a narrow band pass filter, allowing only specific ranges of frequencies to pass through based on its angular frequency. This enables the neuron to effectively extract and respond to the relevant frequency patterns in the input signals.
- Core assumption: The input signals contain meaningful frequency patterns that the BRF neuron can learn and utilize for classification tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The improved performance is attributed to the BRF neurons' ability to effectively learn underlying frequency patterns in the input signals through their resonating behavior."
  - [section]: "The RF neuron can also be considered a narrow band pass filter, for which only a specific range of frequencies are filtered depending on its angular frequency... We focused on the BRF neuron and the BHRF remained preliminary in its exploration, as the BRF responses were more sensitive to the input frequencies than BHRF responses."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Corpus neighbors do not directly address frequency pattern learning or band pass filtering.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neuron dynamics
  - Why needed here: Understanding the basic RF neuron dynamics is crucial for comprehending the improvements introduced in the BRF neuron, such as the refractory period and smooth reset mechanism.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between the RF neuron and the traditional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron?

- Concept: Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
  - Why needed here: BPTT is the training algorithm used for the recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) implemented in this paper. Understanding BPTT is essential for grasping how the BRF neuron's parameters are optimized.
  - Quick check question: How does BPTT differ from standard backpropagation in feedforward networks?

- Concept: Frequency response and band pass filtering
  - Why needed here: The BRF neuron's ability to act as a narrow band pass filter is a key factor in its improved performance. Understanding frequency response and band pass filtering is crucial for interpreting the results and the neuron's behavior.
  - Quick check question: What is the significance of the frequency response plot in evaluating the BRF neuron's performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input layer -> BRF/BHRF neurons -> Recurrent connections -> Output layer (Leaky integrator neurons)

- Critical path:
  1. Data preprocessing (e.g., level-cross encoding for ECG)
  2. Forward pass through BRF/BHRF neurons with refractory period and smooth reset
  3. BPTT with surrogate gradient for parameter optimization
  4. Evaluation on test set

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Spiking sparsity vs. information retention: The refractory period and smooth reset reduce spiking but may also limit the information retained in the spike train.
  - Stability vs. flexibility: The divergence boundary ensures stability but may restrict the parameter space, potentially limiting the neuron's adaptability to diverse input signals.

- Failure signatures:
  - Excessive spiking: May indicate that the refractory period is too short or the smooth reset is not effective enough.
  - Divergence: May suggest that the parameters are outside the valid range defined by the divergence boundary.
  - Poor learning performance: Could be due to inappropriate initialization of the angular frequency or dampening factor offset.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify the BRF neuron's frequency response by testing its sensitivity to different input frequencies.
  2. Evaluate the impact of the refractory period and smooth reset on spiking sparsity and learning stability.
  3. Compare the BRF neuron's performance on a simple sequential task (e.g., sequential MNIST) against the standard RF neuron and ALIF neuron.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal angular frequency range for BRF neurons to learn various types of sequential data patterns?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows that BRF networks learned meaningful frequencies underlying the input signals, with clusters around specific ω values for S-MNIST and alignment with theoretical angular frequencies for ECG. However, the optimal range for different types of sequential data is not explored.
- Why unresolved: The paper only explores a limited range of ω values and does not systematically investigate the optimal range for different types of sequential data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conduct experiments with a wider range of ω values for various types of sequential data to determine the optimal range for each type.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of temporal step size δ impact the performance and stability of BRF-RSNNs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper derives a divergence boundary for BRF neurons depending on δ, ω, and bc. It also shows that the frequency response of RF neurons improves with smaller δ values.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of δ on the performance and stability of BRF-RSNNs across different tasks and network configurations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conduct experiments with different δ values for various tasks and network configurations to determine the optimal δ for each case.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the BRF neuron's performance compare to other spiking neuron models on large-scale, complex datasets like CIFAR or Google Speech Command?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares BRF-RSNNs to ALIF-RSNNs on several benchmark datasets and shows superior or comparable performance. However, it does not compare to other spiking neuron models on large-scale, complex datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include experiments on large-scale, complex datasets or comparisons to other spiking neuron models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conduct experiments on large-scale, complex datasets and compare the performance of BRF-RSNNs to other spiking neuron models.

## Limitations

- The paper's claims about BRF neurons' superior performance are primarily supported by experimental results on benchmark datasets, but the underlying mechanisms are not thoroughly validated.
- The frequency response analysis, while informative, lacks quantitative comparisons with other SNN models.
- The stability analysis relies on theoretical derivations that may not fully capture real-world training dynamics.

- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that BRF neurons exhibit faster and more stable convergence during training compared to ALIF neurons, as this claim is primarily based on visual inspection of convergence plots.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a comprehensive ablation study to quantify the individual contributions of the refractory period, smooth reset, and divergence boundary to BRF neuron performance.
2. Compare the computational complexity and memory requirements of BRF neurons with other SNN models to assess their practical feasibility.
3. Investigate the impact of hyperparameters, such as the refractory period duration and smooth reset decay rate, on BRF neuron performance and stability.
