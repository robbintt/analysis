# EventF2S: Asynchronous and Sparse Spiking AER Framework using Neuromorphic-Friendly Algorithm

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.10078
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10078
- Authors: Lakshmi Annamalai; Chetan Singh Thakur
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Achieves 0.94 accuracy on NMNIST and 0.84 on MNIST-DVS with significantly reduced computation cost

## Executive Summary
EventF2S introduces a novel spiking neural network architecture for efficient object recognition using bio-inspired AER sensors. The framework combines asynchronous processing with temporal coding through a two-stage approach: a Sparse Spiking Temporal Encoding (SS-TE) layer that converts raw event data into sparse representations, followed by a First-To-Spike recognition network. This design achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to traditional rate-coded spiking networks.

## Method Summary
EventF2S employs a two-stage approach to process event-based data from AER sensors. First, the SS-TE layer uses parallel asynchronous continuous-time LIF filters to convert raw events into sparse spike representations while filtering noise through spatiotemporal correlation analysis. Second, the First-To-Spike recognition network processes these sparse events through convolutional feature extraction layers and a classification layer using non-leaky IF neurons with temporal coding. The network learns through backpropagation enabled by differentiable spiking dynamics, where the winner neuron fires first and triggers temporal inhibition, promoting sparsity and reducing computation.

## Key Results
- SS-TE layer achieves true positive rates of 0.98-0.99 with false positive rates of 0.37-0.48 across different signal-to-noise ratios
- EventF2S achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 0.94 on NMNIST and 0.84 on MNIST-DVS datasets
- First layer requires only 0.46-6.55 million weight multiplications compared to 2.75-17.92 million for other methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The SS-TE layer effectively reduces event stream noise while preserving informative spatiotemporal features. SS-TE uses parallel asynchronous continuous-time LIF filters that respond preferentially to spatiotemporally correlated events while penalizing Type I (uncorrelated) and Type II (self-temporally correlated) noise. The output is a single spike per pixel when the membrane voltage crosses a threshold.

Core assumption: Type I and Type II noise can be distinguished and filtered by local spatiotemporal correlation analysis.

Evidence anchors:
- [abstract] "We have adapted the principle of denoising and First-To-Spike coding to achieve optimal spike signaling, significantly reducing computation costs."
- [section] "To address this issue, we implement event encoding as a collection of parallel asynchronous continuous-time LIF (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) filters whose spatial sensitiveness is defined to respond best to spatiotemporally correlated events while penalizing the Type II noise."

### Mechanism 2
The First-To-Spike recognition network achieves competitive accuracy with minimal spike signaling through temporal coding. The network uses non-leaky IF neurons with differentiable dynamics that allow backpropagation. The winner neuron fires first and triggers temporal inhibition, promoting sparsity. The loss function is designed to make the correct class neuron fire earlier than others.

Core assumption: Temporal coding can achieve classification accuracy comparable to rate coding while using fewer spikes.

Evidence anchors:
- [abstract] "Experimental evaluation has demonstrated that the proposed method incurs significantly less computation cost to achieve state-of-the-art competitive accuracy."
- [section] "The relation between the neuron's first spike time and input spike time given by Eq. 5 is differentiable with respect to the weights, hence making the network trainable."

### Mechanism 3
The asynchronous processing design eliminates pre-defined accumulation time and enables event-driven computation throughout the system. Both input (SS-TE) and output (classification) layers process events asynchronously. Events are processed as they arrive, and the output neuron fires as soon as it has sufficient evidence, without waiting for a time window to elapse.

Core assumption: Asynchronous processing can maintain accuracy while reducing latency and computational overhead compared to synchronous approaches.

Evidence anchors:
- [abstract] "i) Asynchronous processing: EventF2S exhibits asynchronous processing at the input and output layers. The system processes the events asynchronously as they arrive at the input layer."
- [section] "As and when the value at pixel (x, y) of D(x, y) exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the particular input neuron spikes."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and temporal encoding**
  - Why needed here: EventF2S is fundamentally an SNN that uses temporal coding rather than rate coding, which is essential for understanding how the network processes and learns from sparse, asynchronous events.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between temporal encoding and rate encoding in SNNs, and why is temporal encoding more suitable for AER data?

- **Concept: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron dynamics**
  - Why needed here: SS-TE layer uses LIF filters to process events, and understanding LIF dynamics is crucial for grasping how noise filtering and spike generation work.
  - Quick check question: How does the LIF neuron's membrane potential dynamics enable it to filter noise while preserving signal in the SS-TE layer?

- **Concept: Backpropagation through time for spiking networks**
  - Why needed here: The First-To-Spike recognition network uses differentiable spiking neuron dynamics that allow gradient-based learning, which is non-trivial for SNNs.
  - Quick check question: What makes the neuron dynamics in EventF2S differentiable, and how does this enable backpropagation through the spiking network?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw events → SS-TE encoding → Convolutional feature extraction → Classification layer → Output decision
- **Critical path**: Raw events → SS-TE encoding → Convolutional feature extraction → Classification layer → Output decision
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Sparsity vs. information loss: Single-spike encoding reduces computation but may lose some information
  - Asynchronous vs. synchronous processing: Eliminates accumulation time but requires careful timing management
  - Temporal coding vs. rate coding: More efficient but may sacrifice some accuracy
- **Failure signatures**:
  - High false positive rate in SS-TE: Indicates insufficient noise filtering
  - Low classification accuracy: Suggests feature extraction or temporal coding is inadequate
  - High computational cost: SS-TE or feature extraction may not be optimally configured
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test SS-TE denoising performance on synthetic noisy datasets with known ground truth
  2. Measure computation cost reduction of SS-TE vs. baseline methods on NMNIST dataset
  3. Evaluate classification accuracy vs. number of spikes per pixel (1, 2, 3) to find optimal tradeoff
