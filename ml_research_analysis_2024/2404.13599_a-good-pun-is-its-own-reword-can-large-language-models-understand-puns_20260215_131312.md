# "A good pun is its own reword": Can Large Language Models Understand Puns?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.13599
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13599
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: GPT-4-Turbo and Claude-3-Opus show superior pun understanding, outperforming previous models in pun generation tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) on understanding puns through three tasks: recognition, explanation, and generation. The authors introduce new evaluation methods including dual-biased prompting, punchline check, and overlap indicators for assessing pun originality. Experiments with eight LLMs reveal key challenges including prompt bias sensitivity, difficulty explaining phonetic similarities, and a "lazy pun generation" pattern where models separate double meanings rather than combining them. Despite these issues, GPT-4-Turbo and Claude-3-Opus demonstrate impressive performance, achieving higher accuracy and originality in pun tasks than smaller models.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLM pun understanding. For recognition, dual-biased prompts are used to assess model confidence by presenting conflicting instructions. Pun explanation uses Chain-of-Thought prompting to improve linguistic analysis. Pun generation is evaluated in both free and constrained settings, with originality measured through an overlap indicator comparing generated puns against human-created ones. The evaluation uses datasets from SemEval-2017-Task-7 and ExPun, testing eight LLMs including both open and closed-source models across multiple metrics: accuracy, mention ratios, pairwise comparisons, and originality scores.

## Key Results
- GPT-4-Turbo and Claude-3-Opus outperform other models in all three pun tasks
- Chain-of-Thought prompting improves pun explanation quality for most models
- Larger LLMs show increased tendency to copy human puns rather than generate novel ones
- Homographic puns are easier to recognize than heterographic puns across all models
- LLMs exhibit "lazy pun generation" pattern, often using multiple wordplay words instead of one

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Dual-biased prompting reduces LLM overconfidence in pun recognition.
- **Mechanism:** By presenting conflicting prompts (one favoring "pun" and one favoring "non-pun"), the model's response consistency becomes a proxy for its true understanding.
- **Core assumption:** LLMs without deep pun comprehension will be influenced by prompt wording rather than semantic content.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.385, average citations=0.0. Top related titles: "Pun Unintended: LLMs and the Illusion of Humor Understanding".
- **Break condition:** If LLMs develop meta-awareness to recognize and neutralize prompt bias, the method loses diagnostic power.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Chain-of-Thought prompting improves pun explanation quality.
- **Mechanism:** Requiring reasoning before answering forces LLMs to process the pun structure more deeply, leading to better identification of pun words and meanings.
- **Core assumption:** LLMs can leverage reasoning chains to improve linguistic analysis beyond surface pattern matching.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.385, average citations=0.0. Top related titles: "A Survey of Pun Generation: Datasets, Evaluations and Methodologies".
- **Break condition:** If CoT becomes a memorized pattern without genuine reasoning, it won't improve understanding.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** LLMs can distinguish between genuine pun creation and copying from training data.
- **Mechanism:** The Overlap metric compares generated puns against human-created ones, measuring originality through lemma set differences.
- **Core assumption:** Genuine creativity will produce different word combinations than those found in the training corpus.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.385, average citations=0.0. Top related titles: "Visual Puns from Idioms: An Iterative LLM-T2IM-MLLM Framework".
- **Break condition:** If LLMs learn to paraphrase existing puns to avoid detection, the metric loses effectiveness.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** In-context learning (ICL) paradigm
  - Why needed here: LLMs are evaluated without fine-tuning, relying on prompt examples to guide task performance
  - Quick check question: How does ICL differ from traditional supervised learning in terms of model adaptation?

- **Concept:** Homographic vs heterographic puns
  - Why needed here: Different pun types require different recognition and explanation strategies based on spelling vs sound similarity
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a homographic pun from a heterographic pun in terms of linguistic structure?

- **Concept:** Evaluation metrics for language generation
  - Why needed here: Multiple metrics (accuracy, coherence, originality) are needed to comprehensively assess pun understanding
  - Quick check question: Why can't a single metric like BLEU score adequately evaluate pun generation quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data collection → Prompt engineering → Model selection → Evaluation pipeline → Analysis
- **Critical path:** Prompt design → Model inference → Human/automated evaluation → Error analysis
- **Design tradeoffs:** 
  - Open vs closed-source models (transparency vs capability)
  - Automated vs human evaluation (scalability vs nuance)
  - Simple vs complex prompts (efficiency vs effectiveness)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - High prompt bias sensitivity → Model lacks true understanding
  - Consistent hom-pun > het-pun performance → Phonetic processing limitations
  - "Lazy generation" pattern → Task completion over quality
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Test prompt bias effect by running identical models with pun-favoring vs non-pun-favoring instructions
  2. Compare CoT vs direct response quality for pun explanation task
  3. Evaluate originality metric by comparing generated puns against training corpus examples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do larger LLMs exhibit a stronger tendency to reproduce human puns rather than generate novel ones when provided with contextual words?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that "the larger the LLM, the more prone it is to do this, suggesting that their stronger memory of the corpus adversely affects the generation of creative puns."
- Why unresolved: While the paper observes a correlation between model size and pun copying, it does not establish causation or determine the exact threshold at which this effect becomes significant.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment comparing pun generation success and overlap ratios across different model sizes with identical training data would provide clearer insights into the relationship between model scale and creativity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of LLMs on pun tasks vary across different languages and cultural contexts?
- Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges its limitation to English puns and notes that "puns in languages other than English may have different definitions, structures, or purposes."
- Why unresolved: The study focuses exclusively on English puns, leaving the generalizability of findings to other languages unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the experiments with pun datasets from multiple languages and cultural backgrounds would reveal whether the observed LLM behaviors are universal or language-specific.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the "lazy pun generation" pattern be mitigated through specific prompt engineering techniques or fine-tuning approaches?
- Basis in paper: The paper identifies the "lazy pun generation" pattern where LLMs "tend to include multiple wp when generating puns" and notes that "LLMs often ignore" the unwritten rule of using a single wp.
- Why unresolved: While the pattern is observed and described, the paper does not explore potential solutions to encourage more creative pun generation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing various prompt engineering strategies or fine-tuning methods specifically designed to discourage the use of multiple wp in pun generation would demonstrate whether this behavior can be corrected.

## Limitations

- Evaluation framework creates artificial conditions through dual-biased prompting that may not reflect real-world usage
- Heavy reliance on automated metrics whose sensitivity and specificity are not rigorously validated against human judgment
- Limited generalizability to languages and cultural contexts beyond English

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: GPT-4-Turbo and Claude-3-Opus demonstrate superior pun understanding capabilities compared to other tested models
- **Medium Confidence**: Chain-of-Thought prompting improves pun explanation quality, though effect varies significantly across models
- **Low Confidence**: The Overlap indicator reliably measures pun originality, as validation against actual training data contamination is limited

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the same LLMs on pun datasets from different sources to verify that performance gains are not dataset-specific artifacts

2. **Neutral prompt baseline**: Implement a standardized neutral prompt protocol and compare results against the dual-biased approach to quantify how much performance depends on prompt manipulation rather than genuine understanding

3. **Human evaluation triangulation**: Conduct systematic human judgment studies on a subset of generated puns to validate the automated metrics and establish ground truth for originality measurement
