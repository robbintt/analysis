# Fair Classification with Partial Feedback: An Exploration-Based Data Collection Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11338
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11338
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Exploration-based data collection approach for fair classification with partial feedback that ensures all sub-populations are explored while bounding false positives

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of fair classification when true outcomes are only observed for positively classified samples. The authors propose a novel exploration-based data collection framework that iteratively learns classifiers and collects outcome data about under-represented subpopulations. The approach balances exploitation (using current classifier) and exploration (actively seeking diverse samples) to ensure all sub-populations are represented while maintaining bounded false positive rates.

The framework is demonstrated on real-world datasets (Adult Income and German Credit) and shows significant improvements in collecting representative outcome data and improving true positive rates across all groups, with only minimal reduction in predictive utility. For example, on the Adult Income dataset, the approach achieved a revenue of 74.1 (in thousands) with a false discovery rate of 0.15 and statistical rate disparity of 0.06.

## Method Summary
The paper presents Algorithm 1, which uses an iterative approach combining exploitation and exploration to make predictions and gather data. The method starts with an initial classifier and progressively collects outcome data about under-represented subpopulations through exploration. The exploration strategy is context-dependent and can encode group fairness properties. The framework ensures three key properties: all sub-populations are explored, false positives are bounded, and the trained classifier converges to a desired classifier. The approach addresses the challenge of partial feedback by actively seeking to collect outcome data from groups that are under-represented in the initially collected data.

## Key Results
- On Adult Income dataset: Revenue of 74.1 (in thousands) with false discovery rate of 0.15 and statistical rate disparity of 0.06
- Consistent boost in quality of collected outcome data across all tested datasets
- Improved fraction of true positives for all groups with only small reduction in predictive utility
- Framework successfully balances exploitation and exploration while maintaining bounded false positive rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by iteratively balancing between using the current classifier to make predictions (exploitation) and actively seeking diverse samples to collect outcome data (exploration). This exploration strategy ensures that under-represented subpopulations are not overlooked, which is critical when true outcomes are only observed for positively classified samples. By actively gathering data from diverse groups, the framework prevents the classifier from becoming biased toward the majority population and ensures that fairness constraints are maintained across all groups.

## Foundational Learning
- **Partial feedback learning**: Needed to handle scenarios where only outcomes of positive classifications are observed; quick check: verify that algorithm handles cases where negative outcomes are unknown
- **Exploration-exploitation tradeoff**: Essential for balancing between using current knowledge and seeking new information; quick check: confirm exploration rate decreases appropriately over time
- **Group fairness metrics**: Required to measure and enforce fairness across different demographic groups; quick check: validate that statistical rate disparity remains bounded
- **Iterative classifier refinement**: Necessary for progressively improving the classifier as more data becomes available; quick check: monitor convergence behavior
- **False positive rate bounding**: Critical for ensuring that exploration doesn't lead to excessive incorrect classifications; quick check: verify false positive rates stay within specified bounds
- **Subpopulation representation**: Fundamental to ensuring all groups are adequately represented in the training data; quick check: track representation metrics across iterations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Initial Classifier -> Prediction Engine -> Outcome Collection -> Data Augmentation -> Updated Classifier -> (Loop)

**Critical Path**: The core loop involves: (1) using current classifier to make predictions, (2) collecting outcomes for positive classifications, (3) identifying under-represented subpopulations, (4) exploring to gather additional data from these groups, (5) augmenting training data, and (6) retraining classifier.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades some predictive utility for fairness and comprehensive data collection. The exploration strategy must be carefully tuned - too much exploration wastes resources on redundant data, while too little risks missing important subpopulations. The bounded false positive constraint may limit aggressive exploration strategies.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include: (1) insufficient exploration leading to biased classifiers, (2) excessive exploration causing resource waste, (3) failure to properly bound false positives across all groups, (4) slow convergence when subpopulation distributions are highly skewed, and (5) inability to generalize when exploration strategy is poorly matched to the problem context.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Test convergence behavior on synthetic datasets with known group distributions
2. Evaluate sensitivity to exploration rate parameter across different population skews
3. Compare performance against baseline classifiers that don't use exploration on balanced datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of the exploration strategy, which may be difficult to design for complex, real-world scenarios
- Convergence rate and specific characteristics of the desired classifier are not explicitly analyzed or defined
- Results are limited to specific datasets (Adult Income and German Credit) and may not generalize to all fair classification problems
- The theoretical framework for bounding false positive rates across all sub-populations could benefit from more rigorous proof under various population distributions

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework soundness: High
- Empirical validation on real-world datasets: Medium
- Generalization to diverse scenarios: Medium
- Convergence guarantees: Low
- Practical implementation guidance: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on additional real-world datasets with varying levels of class imbalance and demographic representation to assess its robustness and generalizability
2. Conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine how the exploration strategy's parameters affect the balance between fairness and predictive utility, particularly in edge cases with extreme population skews
3. Implement a formal convergence analysis to quantify the rate at which the classifier approaches the desired classifier and under what specific conditions this convergence is guaranteed
