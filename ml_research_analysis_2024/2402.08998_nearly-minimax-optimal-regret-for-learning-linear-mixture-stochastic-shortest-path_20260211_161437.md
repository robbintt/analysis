# Nearly Minimax Optimal Regret for Learning Linear Mixture Stochastic Shortest Path

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.08998
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08998
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves O(dB√K) regret for linear mixture SSPs, matching the lower bound up to logarithmic factors

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenging problem of linear mixture stochastic shortest path (SSP) learning, where an agent must reach a goal state while minimizing cumulative costs. The authors propose a novel algorithm that achieves nearly minimax optimal regret without requiring restrictive assumptions like positive cost lower bounds or bounds on optimal policy length. By employing a variance-aware and uncertainty-aware weighted regression approach with high-order moment estimation, the algorithm constructs confidence regions using multiple groups of features and recursively estimates value function variance through higher-order moments. The resulting method achieves O(dB√K) regret, which is statistically near-optimal and represents a significant advancement over previous polynomial-dependency approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed algorithm leverages a variance-aware and uncertainty-aware weighted regression framework with high-order moment estimation. It constructs confidence regions using multiple groups of features and recursively estimates value function variance through higher-order moments. This approach allows the algorithm to achieve near-optimal regret without requiring assumptions like positive cost lower bounds or bounds on optimal policy length, which were necessary in previous work. The method effectively balances exploration and exploitation while maintaining statistical efficiency through careful variance estimation and uncertainty quantification.

## Key Results
- Achieves O(dB√K) regret bound, matching the Ω(dB√K) lower bound up to logarithmic factors
- First algorithm to eliminate polynomial dependencies on problem parameters in linear mixture SSPs
- Removes need for restrictive assumptions like positive cost lower bounds or bounds on optimal policy length
- Demonstrates theoretical optimality without requiring prior knowledge of problem structure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm's effectiveness stems from its variance-aware weighted regression approach combined with high-order moment estimation. By recursively computing value function variance through higher-order moments and constructing confidence regions using multiple feature groups, the method achieves optimal exploration-exploitation balance. The variance estimation allows for more informed uncertainty quantification, while the multiple feature groups provide robust confidence region construction. This combination enables the algorithm to navigate the exploration-exploitation tradeoff efficiently without relying on restrictive assumptions about the problem structure.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Feature Extraction -> High-Order Moment Estimation -> Variance-Aware Regression -> Confidence Region Construction -> Policy Update

**Critical Path**: The algorithm's performance critically depends on accurate high-order moment estimation and confidence region construction. The variance-aware regression step bridges these components, enabling efficient exploration-exploitation balance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity for statistical efficiency by employing high-order moment estimation. While this increases computational requirements, it eliminates the need for restrictive problem assumptions and achieves near-optimal regret bounds.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may arise from inaccurate high-order moment estimation, particularly in environments with heavy-tailed distributions or insufficient data. Additionally, violations of the linear mixture assumption could lead to suboptimal performance.

**First Experiments**:
