# Attempt Towards Stress Transfer in Speech-to-Speech Machine Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.04178
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04178
- Reference count: 26
- One-line primary result: Proposed SSMT system improves synthesized speech quality and effectively transfers stress, as evidenced by MOS and st-MOS metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating stress and emphasis in speech-to-speech machine translation (SSMT) systems for Indian languages. The authors propose a methodology that involves annotating a dataset of Indian English speech with stress information, training a stress detection model using acoustic features, and modifying a TTS architecture to incorporate stress based on detected stress cues. The proposed SSMT system aims to enhance the overall quality and engagement of educational content by transferring stress from the source language to the target language. Results show that the approach improves synthesized speech quality and effectively transfers stress, as evidenced by subjective evaluation metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and stress transfer MOS (st-MOS).

## Method Summary
The authors use the IED-IIITH dataset containing Indian English speech recordings from educational lectures, manually annotated with stress information. They train a stress detection model using acoustic features like F0, energy, MFCC, and SDC. The FastPitch TTS architecture is modified with a PDE (Pitch-Duration-Energy) Modifier block to incorporate stress based on detected stress cues. This modified TTS is integrated into an SSMT pipeline consisting of ASR (WhisperX), MT (Helsinki OPUS), MT aligner (simalign), and the stress-incorporating TTS. The system evaluates the quality of synthesized Hindi speech using MOS and stress transfer quality using st-MOS.

## Key Results
- Stress detection model achieves 82% frame-level accuracy using F0, energy, MFCC, and SDC features
- PDE Modifier enables stress incorporation without requiring stressed training data by scaling predicted pitch, duration, and energy variances
- Modified SSMT system shows improved MOS and st-MOS scores compared to baseline, demonstrating effective stress transfer from English to Hindi

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Stress detection model improves SSMT quality by identifying stressed words in source speech and transferring emphasis to target speech
- Mechanism: System detects stressed regions using acoustic features, aligns them with target language words, and modifies TTS variances to replicate stress patterns
- Core assumption: Stress patterns in source language can be meaningfully mapped to equivalent words in target language
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This dataset is used for training a stress detection model, which is then used in the SSMT system for detecting stress in the source speech and transferring it into the target language speech."
  - [section] "The model uses features from a window of frames rather than one frame for more contextual information."
- Break condition: If stress patterns don't align well between languages, or if detection accuracy falls below ~70%, transferred emphasis will sound unnatural

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PDE Modifier block enables stress incorporation without requiring stressed training data
- Mechanism: PDE Modifier scales predicted pitch, duration, and energy variances based on detected stress cues during inference
- Core assumption: Modifying predicted variances based on stress cues is sufficient to create perceptually natural stressed speech
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Since TTS requires very high-quality clean speech data, procuring such amounts of stressed data is not trivial and we overcome this issue by using the PDE Modifier block only during inference."
  - [section] "The output mel-spectrogram ŷ is generated using the modified variances from the PDE Modifier block, thus incorporating stress in the synthesized speech."
- Break condition: If variance scaling factors are poorly calibrated or TTS can't handle extreme modifications, speech may become distorted

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Word-level stress detection with post-processing improves accuracy over frame-level classification
- Mechanism: Frame-level predictions are converted to word-level predictions using ASR alignments with majority frame voting
- Core assumption: Stress manifests consistently enough within word boundaries that majority voting provides reliable word-level stress labels
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "With these alignments, the frame-level predictions are converted to word-level predictions. A word is classified as stressed if the region containing the word has a majority of frames predicted as stress."
  - [section] "This technique not only filters out a considerable amount of false positives but also gives stress detection on the word level which is used in SSMT."
- Break condition: If stress patterns are too brief or fragmented across word boundaries, majority voting may misclassify stressed words

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Acoustic feature extraction (F0, energy, MFCC, SDC)
  - Why needed here: These features capture prosodic characteristics essential for distinguishing stressed from unstressed speech regions
  - Quick check question: What acoustic feature shows the strongest correlation with perceived stress in speech?

- Concept: Frame-to-word alignment conversion
  - Why needed here: Enables mapping continuous acoustic predictions to discrete linguistic units required for TTS processing
  - Quick check question: How does majority voting within word boundaries improve stress detection reliability?

- Concept: Variance scaling for prosodic modification
  - Why needed here: Allows controlled adjustment of pitch, duration, and energy to replicate stress patterns without retraining
  - Quick check question: Why might energy scaling be as important as pitch scaling for stress perception?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ASR (WhisperX) → Stress Detection Model → MT (Helsinki OPUS) → MT Aligner (simalign) → TTS (Modified FastPitch with PDE Modifier)
- Critical path: Source speech → ASR transcription + alignment → Stress detection → English-Hindi translation + word alignment → Stress cue generation → TTS synthesis with stress modification
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Cascaded vs. end-to-end: Cascaded approach allows modular stress incorporation but may accumulate errors
  - Frame-level vs. word-level stress detection: Frame-level provides detail but requires conversion for TTS compatibility
  - Neutral training data vs. stressed data: Using neutral data with PDE Modifier avoids data scarcity but may limit expressiveness
- Failure signatures:
  - Low stress detection accuracy (<70%) → Unnatural or missing emphasis in target speech
  - Poor word alignment quality → Stress transferred to wrong target words
  - Over-aggressive variance scaling → Distorted or unintelligible synthesized speech
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate stress detection accuracy on held-out test set with different feature combinations and window sizes
  2. Test PDE Modifier impact on TTS quality using MOS evaluation with and without stress cues
  3. Compare SSMT output with human evaluation focusing on stress transfer quality (st-MOS) across different scaling factors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the stress detection model be improved to achieve higher accuracy and F1 scores, especially for Indian English speech?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses evaluation of stress detection models but results show room for improvement
- Why unresolved: Current performance can be further enhanced but paper doesn't explore advanced techniques or architectures
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with deep learning models like CNNs or Transformers, exploring additional acoustic features, and using larger datasets

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed TTS architecture be extended to handle multiple Indian languages and preserve the speaker's voice in target speech?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper focuses on English-to-Hindi SSMT but mentions need to preserve speaker's voice
- Why unresolved: Current TTS is trained on Hindi male speaker's database without discussion of other languages or voice preservation
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with multilingual datasets, exploring voice conversion techniques, and evaluating quality across Indian languages

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective subjective and objective evaluation metrics for assessing stress transfer quality in SSMT systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper relies on subjective evaluation through survey and MOS but acknowledges lack of automated evaluation metrics
- Why unresolved: Need for better evaluation metrics particularly for stress transfer quality, but no alternative objective metrics proposed
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and validating objective metrics specifically designed for evaluating stress transfer in SSMT

## Limitations
- Manual annotation process for stress information lacks detailed specifications, making it difficult to assess consistency or reproduce dataset preparation
- Cascaded SSMT architecture may accumulate errors from multiple components (ASR, MT, aligner, TTS)
- Evaluation relies on subjective MOS scores rather than objective stress transfer metrics

## Confidence

**Major Claim Clusters Confidence:**
- **Stress detection accuracy (82%)**: Medium confidence - reported performance but lacks cross-validation details and comparison to baseline methods
- **PDE Modifier effectiveness**: Low confidence - no ablation study showing impact of variance scaling factors or comparison to stressed training data
- **Overall SSMT quality improvement**: Medium confidence - MOS improvements reported but limited to single speaker Hindi TTS and specific scaling factors

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-validation stress detection**: Perform k-fold cross-validation on IED-IIITH dataset to assess stress detection model stability and identify feature importance for different Indian English accents

2. **PDE Modifier sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary pitch, duration, and energy scaling factors (beyond reported 1.2x) to identify optimal ranges and failure modes for natural-sounding stressed speech

3. **Word alignment stress transfer accuracy**: Manually annotate stress transfer accuracy in SSMT output by comparing source stress positions to target stress positions across multiple sentence pairs to quantify alignment quality impact
