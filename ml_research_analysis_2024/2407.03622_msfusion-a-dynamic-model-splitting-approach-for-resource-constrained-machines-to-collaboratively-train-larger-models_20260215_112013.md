# MSfusion: A Dynamic Model Splitting Approach for Resource-Constrained Machines to Collaboratively Train Larger Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2407.03622
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03622
- **Authors:** Jin Xie; Songze Li
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** MSfusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image classification and NLP tasks while requiring less computation

## Executive Summary
MSfusion introduces a collaborative learning framework that enables training of large models on resource-constrained devices through model splitting. The framework employs a novel double shifting scheme that partitions the model across participants and across training rounds, effectively reducing both computation and communication costs. By incorporating adaptive overlapping and a contrastive loss function, MSfusion addresses model drift issues arising from data and model heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSfusion achieves superior performance compared to existing methods while requiring fewer computational resources, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios with limited-device participants.

## Method Summary
MSfusion implements a dynamic model splitting approach that partitions large models across multiple resource-constrained devices. The core innovation is the double shifting scheme, which distributes model components across both participants and training rounds. This creates a collaborative training pipeline where each device processes only a fraction of the model while contributing to the overall training objective. The framework incorporates adaptive overlapping mechanisms to handle model heterogeneity and employs a contrastive loss function to mitigate drift caused by data distribution differences across devices. This design enables efficient distributed training of models that would otherwise be too large to fit on individual resource-constrained machines.

## Key Results
- MSfusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image classification and NLP tasks
- The framework requires substantially less computation compared to baseline approaches
- Strong scalability demonstrated: as the number of participants increases, each can train with a smaller model split while achieving the same target accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The double shifting scheme enables efficient distribution of large models by partitioning them across multiple dimensions - both across participants and across time (training rounds). This multi-dimensional partitioning reduces the memory and computational burden on individual devices while maintaining the integrity of the overall model training process. The adaptive overlapping mechanism ensures that critical model components receive appropriate attention from multiple participants, while the contrastive loss function actively corrects for drift caused by heterogeneous data distributions and model partitions.

## Foundational Learning

**Model Splitting:** Dividing large neural networks into smaller, manageable components that can be distributed across multiple devices. Needed to enable training of large models on resource-constrained hardware. Quick check: Verify that each split component maintains sufficient context for effective training.

**Federated Learning:** Distributed machine learning paradigm where multiple devices collaborate to train a global model without sharing raw data. Needed for privacy-preserving collaborative training. Quick check: Ensure data locality is maintained while achieving convergence.

**Double Shifting:** A two-dimensional partitioning strategy that distributes model components across both participants and training rounds. Needed to balance computational load and communication efficiency. Quick check: Validate that model integrity is preserved across shifting dimensions.

**Contrastive Loss:** A loss function designed to minimize drift between model partitions by contrasting similar and dissimilar representations. Needed to maintain consistency across heterogeneous model splits. Quick check: Monitor drift metrics during training to verify effectiveness.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data → Model Splitting Module → Double Shifting Scheduler → Adaptive Overlapping Controller → Contrastive Loss Function → Gradient Aggregation → Updated Model

**Critical Path:** Model Splitting → Double Shifting → Gradient Computation → Contrastive Loss Application → Gradient Aggregation → Model Update

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades off increased communication overhead (due to multiple shifting operations) against reduced computational burden per device. The adaptive overlapping mechanism adds complexity but improves model drift mitigation. The contrastive loss function increases training time per round but ensures better convergence.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance may indicate insufficient overlapping between model partitions, ineffective contrastive loss application, or communication bottlenecks during gradient aggregation. Convergence issues might suggest problems with the double shifting schedule or model partition sizes.

**First Experiments:**
1. Baseline comparison with standard federated averaging on the same model architecture
2. Ablation study removing the contrastive loss to measure its individual contribution
3. Scalability test varying the number of participants while monitoring per-device computational load

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance comparisons may be sensitive to experimental conditions and hyperparameter tuning
- Adaptive overlapping mechanism and contrastive loss contributions lack comprehensive ablation studies
- Double shifting scheme effectiveness unproven across diverse model architectures beyond tested image classification and NLP tasks
- Scalability claims assume linear or sub-linear scaling benefits that may not hold under real-world network conditions

## Confidence

**Claims about computational efficiency improvements:** High (well-supported by experiments)
**Claims about communication cost reduction:** Medium (lacks detailed breakdown of communication overhead)
**Claims about scalability and participant increase benefits:** Medium (based on limited participant counts in experiments)
**Claims about model drift mitigation effectiveness:** Low (insufficient ablation studies)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of adaptive overlapping and contrastive loss to overall performance improvements
2. Test the framework with heterogeneous device capabilities and real-world network conditions to validate scalability claims
3. Evaluate performance across diverse model architectures (beyond standard image classification and NLP) to assess generalizability of the double shifting scheme
