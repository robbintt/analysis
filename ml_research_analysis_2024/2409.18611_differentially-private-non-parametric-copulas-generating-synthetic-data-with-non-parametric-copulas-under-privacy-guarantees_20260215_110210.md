# Differentially Private Non Parametric Copulas: Generating synthetic data with non parametric copulas under privacy guarantees

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18611
- Reference count: 40
- Enhances DPNPC with Enhanced Fourier Perturbation for privacy-preserving synthetic data generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an enhanced non-parametric copula-based synthetic data generation model (DPNPC) that incorporates differential privacy through Fourier perturbation. The method generates synthetic data for mixed tabular databases while preserving privacy. Evaluation across three public datasets using privacy, utility, and execution time metrics shows that DPNPC outperforms PrivBayes, DP-Copula, and DP-Histogram in modeling multivariate dependencies, maintaining privacy for small ε values, and reducing training times. The approach demonstrates stable performance across different privacy budgets and resolution parameters, with execution times significantly lower than PrivBayes.

## Method Summary
The DPNPC method enhances non-parametric copula-based synthetic data generation by incorporating differential privacy through an Enhanced Fourier Perturbation approach. The model operates by estimating empirical copulas from input data, applying Fourier-based noise addition to ensure privacy guarantees, and generating synthetic data through inverse transformation sampling. The Fourier perturbation technique adds calibrated noise in the frequency domain before reconstructing the copula structure, providing differential privacy while preserving the essential dependency structure between variables. The method handles mixed data types and scales effectively across different dataset sizes and privacy budgets.

## Key Results
- DPNPC outperforms PrivBayes, DP-Copula, and DP-Histogram in modeling multivariate dependencies
- Maintains competitive utility for large datasets while providing effective privacy guarantees for ε < 1
- Reduces training times significantly compared to PrivBayes with stable performance across privacy budgets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Enhanced Fourier Perturbation method works by transforming the empirical copula into the frequency domain, where calibrated noise can be added without destroying the essential dependency structure. This approach leverages the fact that real-world dependencies often concentrate in low-frequency components, allowing high-frequency noise to mask individual records while preserving population-level relationships. The inverse transformation then reconstructs a privacy-preserving copula that maintains multivariate dependencies better than histogram-based approaches. This frequency-domain perspective provides stronger privacy guarantees than spatial perturbations while requiring less data for accurate reconstruction.

## Foundational Learning

**Non-parametric copulas**: Distribution-free methods for modeling multivariate dependencies without assuming specific parametric forms - needed to capture complex real-world relationships; quick check: verify rank-based correlation preservation.

**Differential privacy**: Mathematical framework providing provable privacy guarantees through calibrated noise addition - needed for rigorous privacy protection; quick check: confirm ε-DP holds via composition theorem.

**Fourier perturbation**: Noise addition technique in frequency domain that preserves low-frequency signal structure - needed for maintaining dependencies while ensuring privacy; quick check: verify noise spectrum decays appropriately.

**Empirical copulas**: Non-parametric estimates of dependency structure using empirical distributions - needed as foundation for synthetic data generation; quick check: confirm uniform margins after transformation.

**Inverse transformation sampling**: Method for generating synthetic data from copula distributions - needed to create realistic synthetic records; quick check: validate synthetic data matches marginal distributions.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Raw data -> Empirical copula estimation -> Fourier transform -> Noise addition -> Inverse transform -> Synthetic data generation

Critical path: Data preprocessing → Empirical copula construction → Fourier perturbation → Inverse transformation → Quality evaluation

Design tradeoffs: Privacy-utility tradeoff (higher privacy requires more noise, reducing utility), computational complexity (Fourier methods add overhead but enable better privacy), and dimensionality handling (curse of dimensionality in copula estimation).

Failure signatures: Poor synthetic data quality (excessive noise in low-frequency components), privacy guarantee failure (insufficient noise addition), and performance degradation (inefficient Fourier implementation for high dimensions).

First experiments:
1. Test Fourier perturbation sensitivity by varying noise scale parameters on synthetic benchmark data
2. Compare utility metrics (statistical similarity measures) between DPNPC and baseline methods on simple 2D datasets
3. Validate privacy guarantees by attempting membership inference attacks on generated synthetic data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on only three public datasets, limiting generalizability claims
- Comparison with baseline methods uses fixed parameter settings without sensitivity analysis
- Lack of statistical significance testing to confirm observed performance differences are meaningful
- No formal proof of privacy guarantees for the Fourier perturbation method

## Confidence

Performance Claims (Medium): Empirical demonstration shows utility and privacy improvements, but lacks comprehensive statistical validation and may be dataset-dependent.

Privacy Guarantees (Medium): Claims differential privacy through Fourier perturbation, but mathematical proof of privacy budget accounting and composability is not fully developed.

Execution Time Claims (High): Direct timing measurements between DPNPC and PrivBayes are clearly reported and appear reproducible, though dependent on specific hardware configurations.

## Next Checks

1. Apply statistical significance testing (t-tests or non-parametric equivalents) to compare utility metrics across all datasets and methods to determine if performance differences are statistically meaningful rather than random variation.

2. Test DPNPC on additional heterogeneous datasets including sparse, high-cardinality, and highly correlated attribute combinations to verify generalization claims beyond the three evaluated datasets.

3. Implement formal privacy accounting to verify that the claimed ε values accurately reflect the total privacy loss when combining multiple Fourier perturbations across different copula dimensions and datasets.
