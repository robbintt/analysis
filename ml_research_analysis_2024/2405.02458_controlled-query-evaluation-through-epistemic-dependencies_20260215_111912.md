# Controlled Query Evaluation through Epistemic Dependencies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.02458
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02458
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: ED-based CQE achieves AC0 complexity for acyclic EDs via FO rewritability, matching standard query answering efficiency

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces epistemic dependencies (EDs) as a policy language for Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE) over DL-Lite R ontologies. EDs express what knowledge a user must have about data to access it, enabling more expressive and fine-grained access control than previous approaches. The authors analyze the data complexity of two entailment relations—SC-entailment (under all optimal censors) and IC-entailment (under the intersection of all optimal censors)—and show that while both are coNP-complete in general, they become first-order rewritable (and thus in AC0) for acyclic EDs. This tractability enables practical implementation via SQL, matching the efficiency of standard database query answering. The paper also investigates confidentiality preservation, demonstrating that SC-entailment preserves it for Boolean CQs but not for unions of CQs, while IC-entailment does for both.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize CQE using epistemic dependencies (EDs) as policy rules over DL-Lite R ontologies. They define two query answering semantics: SC-entailment (answering queries under all optimal censors) and IC-entailment (under the intersection of all optimal censors). The complexity analysis proceeds by first establishing coNP-completeness for both semantics in the general case, then showing that for acyclic EDs, both become first-order rewritable, placing them in AC0. This rewritability enables translation to SQL for practical implementation. The confidentiality preservation analysis uses proof-theoretic arguments to show when censorship preserves confidentiality for different query classes (Boolean CQs and UCQs) under each semantics.

## Key Results
- ED-based CQE is coNP-complete for both SC- and IC-entailment in general
- Both SC- and IC-entailment are first-order rewritable for acyclic EDs, achieving AC0 complexity
- SC-entailment preserves confidentiality for Boolean CQs but not UCQs
- IC-entailment preserves confidentiality for both Boolean CQs and UCQs under strict acyclicity conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The tractability results stem from the FO rewritability of query answering for acyclic EDs. When EDs form an acyclic dependency graph, the censorship conditions can be expressed in first-order logic, enabling translation to SQL. This avoids the combinatorial explosion that causes coNP-completeness in the cyclic case. The confidentiality preservation results follow from the specific structure of censorship: SC-entailment preserves confidentiality when each individual censor does, which holds for Boolean CQs but fails for UCQs due to disjunctive reasoning. IC-entailment preserves confidentiality when the intersection of all censors does, which is more restrictive and thus holds for both query classes under strict acyclicity.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE)**: The process of answering queries while enforcing access control policies by censoring answers. Needed to understand the problem domain and why standard query answering is insufficient. Quick check: Can you explain how CQE differs from standard query answering with WHERE clauses?

2. **DL-Lite R ontologies**: A tractable description logic for ontologies that supports efficient query answering. Forms the knowledge representation layer. Quick check: Can you write a simple DL-Lite R axiom and explain its semantics?

3. **Epistemic Dependencies (EDs)**: Policy rules expressing what knowledge users must have to access data. The key innovation enabling more expressive access control. Quick check: Can you contrast EDs with traditional role-based access control?

4. **SC-entailment vs IC-entailment**: Two semantics for CQE—under all optimal censors vs. under their intersection. Determines the strength of censorship. Quick check: Can you give an example where these two semantics yield different answers?

5. **FO rewritability**: The ability to express query answering in first-order logic, enabling translation to SQL. The key to practical tractability. Quick check: Can you sketch a simple FO rewriting for a basic ED policy?

6. **Confidentiality preservation**: Ensuring that censorship does not leak information about confidential data. A critical security property. Quick check: Can you construct a scenario where censorship leaks confidential information?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** DL-Lite R ontology <-[ED policies]-> CQE engine <-[SQL translation]-> Database

**Critical Path:** User query + ED policies → censorship evaluation → FO rewriting → SQL execution → filtered results

**Design Tradeoffs:** Expressive ED policies (good for fine-grained control) vs. complexity (cyclic EDs cause coNP-completeness). Acyclicity enables tractability but may limit policy expressiveness.

**Failure Signatures:** Cyclic ED dependencies cause exponential blowup in censorship evaluation. Poorly structured EDs may fail to preserve confidentiality even when individual censors do.

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement FO rewritings for simple acyclic EDs and measure execution time vs. standard SQL queries
2. Generate cyclic EDs and empirically measure complexity growth
3. Test confidentiality preservation on edge cases for both SC- and IC-entailment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical complexity results show first-order rewritability for acyclic EDs, but practical performance under large-scale ontologies is unverified
- The jump from AC0 to coNP-complete complexity at the acyclic-to-cyclic boundary lacks empirical characterization
- Ensuring and verifying the acyclicity conditions required for confidentiality preservation may be difficult in deployed systems

## Confidence

High confidence:
- Theoretical complexity results for SC- and IC-entailment (coNP-complete in general, AC0 for acyclic EDs)
- FO rewritability proofs for acyclic EDs
- Confidentiality preservation results for Boolean CQs under SC-entailment
- Confidentiality preservation for both CQs and UCQs under IC-entailment

Medium confidence:
- Practical applicability of FO rewritability results, dependent on implementation performance

Low confidence:
- Ease of ensuring and verifying acyclicity conditions in practical deployments

## Next Checks

1. Implement and benchmark the FO rewritings for SC- and IC-entailment on large-scale ontologies with acyclic EDs to measure practical performance and identify bottlenecks
2. Systematically generate and test cyclic EDs to empirically identify the complexity threshold where query answering becomes intractable
3. Develop and evaluate methods for automatically checking acyclicity and confidentiality preservation conditions in real-world policy configurations
