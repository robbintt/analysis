# Enhancing Model Fairness and Accuracy with Similarity Networks: A Methodological Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.05648
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05648
- Authors: Samira Maghool; Paolo Ceravolo
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Introduces a kernel-based similarity network approach that improves fairness metrics while maintaining high classification accuracy on CV datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a methodology to address dataset biases that impact machine learning fairness by transforming datasets into similarity feature spaces. The approach uses kernel-based tuning of pairwise instance similarities to create interpretable similarity networks, with different similarity measures applied based on data format (Gower distance for tabular, NLP embeddings for text, etc.). The method supports downstream tasks including classification, imputation, and augmentation while enforcing fairness criteria like demographic parity. Experimental results on a computer vision dataset demonstrate improved fairness metrics—specifically reduced Equal Opportunity and Equal Mis-opportunity gaps—while maintaining classification accuracy, showing the effectiveness of this approach for producing fairer models.

## Method Summary
The methodology transforms datasets into similarity feature spaces using kernel-based tuning of pairwise instance similarities. Different similarity measures are applied depending on data format: Gower distance for tabular data, NLP-based embeddings for text, and appropriate measures for other formats. Kernel functions like scaled exponential and random walk kernels adjust link weights in the similarity network to balance accuracy and fairness objectives. This framework supports downstream tasks such as classification, imputation, and data augmentation while enforcing fairness criteria including demographic parity. The approach creates interpretable similarity networks that can be used to understand and mitigate biases in the original dataset.

## Key Results
- The method reduces Equal Opportunity and Equal Mis-opportunity gaps on CV datasets
- Classification accuracy is maintained at high levels while improving fairness metrics
- Similarity networks provide interpretable representations that help identify and mitigate dataset biases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by transforming the original feature space into a similarity-based representation where biased patterns become more apparent and can be systematically addressed. By computing pairwise similarities between instances using appropriate measures for each data type, the approach captures nuanced relationships that may be obscured in high-dimensional feature spaces. The kernel functions then weight these similarities to emphasize fairness-relevant patterns while preserving predictive information. This transformation creates a more balanced representation where fairness constraints can be more effectively enforced during downstream model training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Similarity networks**: Graph representations where nodes are instances and edges represent similarity relationships - needed for capturing relational patterns between data points; quick check: verify edge weights reflect meaningful similarities
- **Kernel functions**: Mathematical functions that transform similarity measures into weighted relationships - needed for adjusting the importance of different similarity connections; quick check: ensure kernel parameters are properly tuned
- **Fairness metrics**: Quantitative measures like Equal Opportunity and Demographic Parity - needed for evaluating whether bias mitigation is effective; quick check: compare pre/post metrics across protected groups
- **Pairwise similarity computation**: Process of calculating similarity between all instance pairs - needed as the foundation for building the similarity network; quick check: validate computational complexity is manageable for dataset size
- **Multi-modal similarity measures**: Different techniques (Gower, NLP embeddings, etc.) for different data types - needed to handle diverse input formats appropriately; quick check: ensure measure selection matches data characteristics

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Raw data -> Similarity measure selection -> Pairwise similarity computation -> Kernel weighting -> Similarity network -> Downstream task model

Critical path: Data preprocessing -> Similarity measure application -> Pairwise similarity matrix construction -> Kernel function application -> Weighted similarity network generation -> Fairness-aware model training

Design tradeoffs: The approach trades computational efficiency for improved fairness and interpretability. Pairwise similarity computations scale quadratically with dataset size, making the method potentially expensive for large datasets. However, this computational cost enables the creation of more nuanced representations that better capture fairness-relevant patterns. The choice of similarity measures and kernel functions involves balancing domain appropriateness against implementation complexity.

Failure signatures: The method may fail when similarity measures poorly capture the underlying data structure, when kernel parameters are poorly tuned leading to over/under-weighting of important relationships, or when the transformed space loses too much predictive information. Computational bottlenecks can occur with large datasets due to pairwise similarity calculations. The approach may also underperform if fairness metrics are not properly aligned with the specific bias patterns present in the data.

Three first experiments:
1. Apply the methodology to a tabular dataset with known demographic biases and measure changes in fairness metrics
2. Compare different kernel functions (scaled exponential vs random walk) on the same dataset to quantify their individual impact on fairness improvements
3. Test the approach on multi-modal data combining text and tabular features to validate the flexibility of similarity measure selection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Results are based on a single computer vision dataset, limiting generalizability across domains
- Kernel tuning methodology may not scale well or remain robust across diverse datasets
- The interpretability benefits are conceptual rather than empirically demonstrated
- Computational complexity of pairwise similarity calculations is not thoroughly analyzed

## Confidence
- Fairness improvement claims: Medium confidence (results are promising but limited to one dataset)
- Accuracy maintenance claims: Medium confidence (demonstrated but not extensively validated across benchmarks)
- Interpretability benefits: Low confidence (conceptual rather than empirically demonstrated)
- Scalability assertions: Low confidence (computational complexity not thoroughly analyzed)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the methodology across multiple datasets spanning different domains (text, tabular, multi-modal) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing different kernel functions and similarity measures to quantify their individual contributions to fairness improvements
3. Measure computational complexity and runtime scaling with dataset size to establish practical deployment boundaries
