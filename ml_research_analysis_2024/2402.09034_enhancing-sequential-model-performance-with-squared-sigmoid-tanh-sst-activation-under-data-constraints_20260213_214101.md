# Enhancing Sequential Model Performance with Squared Sigmoid TanH (SST) Activation Under Data Constraints

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.09034
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09034
- Authors: Barathi Subramanian; Rathinaraja Jeyaraj; Anand Paul
- Reference count: 5
- One-line primary result: SST activation improves GRU performance on sparse, limited data, achieving 100% accuracy on sign language and human activity tasks and reducing MSE to 0.08 in gold price forecasting.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Squared Sigmoid TanH (SST) activation function to enhance the performance of sequential models, particularly GRUs, when training data is limited and exhibits sparse patterns. SST works by squaring the outputs of Sigmoid and TanH activations, amplifying differences between strong and weak activations and improving gradient flow and information retention. Experimental results across sign language recognition, gait classification, human activity recognition, and gold price forecasting demonstrate consistent improvements over standard GRU models.

## Method Summary
The method involves replacing standard Sigmoid activations in GRU gates and TanH activations in dense layers with SST, which squares these outputs. This modification aims to amplify gradient differences, improve signal flow, and enhance memory retention in GRU cells. The approach was tested on datasets with induced sparsity (20% for gait and activity recognition) and compared against baseline GRU models using metrics including classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and mean squared error for regression tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieved 100% test accuracy on sign language recognition and human activity recognition tasks.
- Reduced mean squared error to 0.08 in gold price forecasting from 0.28 in the baseline.
- Improved gait classification accuracy to 84.3% under 20% sparsity conditions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Squaring Sigmoid and TanH outputs amplifies gradient differences, improving signal flow in sequential models.
- Mechanism: SST applies mathematical squaring to the outputs of Sigmoid and TanH activations. This increases the relative magnitude of larger values while shrinking smaller ones, enhancing gradient propagation during backpropagation and preserving stronger signals across time steps.
- Core assumption: The squared transformation does not destabilize training or introduce excessive gradient explosion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "SST applies mathematical squaring to amplify differences between strong and weak activations as signals propagate over time, facilitating improved gradient flow and information filtering."
  - [section]: "SST squares the output of Sigmoid function within the GRU layers and TanH Function in the dense layers...This approach enhances model learning efficiency and improves the accuracy of the neural network."
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus coverage; neighboring papers discuss hybrid and adaptive activations but not SST-style squaring.
- Break condition: If squaring leads to gradient explosion or excessive saturation, the benefit diminishes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SST improves memory retention in GRU cells by enhancing recall of contextual information from prior time steps.
- Mechanism: By squaring activation outputs, SST increases the non-linearity of the gating mechanisms (reset and update gates), enabling GRU cells to retain and emphasize important temporal features more effectively over longer sequences.
- Core assumption: Increased non-linearity does not compromise the stability of gating dynamics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "SST squares the output of Sigmoid and TanH AFs...increasing recall of contextual information from prior time steps, which is critical for sequential modelling."
  - [section]: "It also increases non-linearity, enabling better representation of complex temporal patterns across various tasks."
  - [corpus]: Limited direct evidence; related work on adaptive activations does not cover this exact mechanism.
- Break condition: If gates become too rigid or overly selective, useful contextual information may be prematurely discarded.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SST reduces mean squared error in time-series forecasting by sharpening activation gradients.
- Mechanism: The squared transformation produces steeper gradients around activation midpoints, enabling more precise weight updates during training on financial time-series data, thus improving forecast accuracy.
- Core assumption: Sharper gradients translate to better generalization on unseen data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "SST integration significantly reduced the MSE in gold price prediction to 0.08 from 0.28, as well as both training and validation losses."
  - [section]: "These consistent MSE reductions across phases validate SST's capability in accurately modelling temporal dependencies."
  - [corpus]: Sparse; related work on activation functions does not provide evidence for this specific MSE improvement claim.
- Break condition: If sharper gradients cause overfitting to training data, validation error may rise.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Activation functions and their role in introducing non-linearity to neural networks.
  - Why needed here: SST is a novel activation function designed to address specific weaknesses of traditional activations in sequential models.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary role of an activation function in a neural network?
- Concept: Gating mechanisms in GRU cells (reset gate, update gate).
  - Why needed here: SST modifies the outputs feeding into these gates, so understanding their function is essential to grasp SST's impact.
  - Quick check question: What do the reset and update gates control in a GRU cell?
- Concept: Vanishing and exploding gradient problems in recurrent networks.
  - Why needed here: SST is proposed to mitigate these issues by reshaping activation gradients.
  - Quick check question: Why do vanishing gradients pose a problem for learning long-term dependencies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input layer → GRU cells with SST activation in gates → Dense layer with SST activation → Output layer.
  - Key change: Replace standard Sigmoid/Tanh in GRU gates and dense layers with SST.
- Critical path:
  - Forward pass: Apply SST to gate activations → Compute candidate hidden state → Combine with previous hidden state.
  - Backward pass: SST-derived gradients flow back through time steps, amplifying differences.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - SST may improve performance on sparse, limited datasets but could introduce instability if gradients explode.
  - Benefits: Higher accuracy, lower MSE, better handling of temporal dependencies.
  - Risks: Potential overfitting, increased training instability.
- Failure signatures:
  - Training loss diverges rapidly.
  - Validation accuracy plateaus or drops while training accuracy continues to rise.
  - NaN values appear in activations or gradients.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare GRU with SST vs standard GRU on a small, sparse sign language dataset; measure test accuracy.
  2. Evaluate SST's impact on gradient flow by visualizing gradient norms across time steps during training.
  3. Test SST on a time-series forecasting task (e.g., gold price prediction) and compare MSE to baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does SST activation perform on datasets with different sparsity levels beyond the 20% tested in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tested SST with 20% sparsity induced in gait classification and human activity recognition datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates one sparsity level, leaving uncertainty about SST's effectiveness across a range of sparsity scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing SST with multiple sparsity levels (e.g., 10%, 30%, 50%) across various sequential tasks would clarify its robustness and limitations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does SST activation maintain its advantages when scaled to larger datasets or more complex sequential tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on limited datasets with sparse patterns, but doesn't explore performance on large-scale or highly complex sequential problems.
- Why unresolved: The study's emphasis on data-constrained environments leaves open whether SST's benefits persist or diminish with abundant data and increased task complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking SST on large-scale datasets (e.g., large video datasets, extensive time-series) and complex tasks (e.g., long video sequences, multi-modal sequential data) would reveal its scalability and generalization.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the computational overhead of SST compared to traditional activations like Sigmoid and TanH, and how does it impact training efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights SST's performance improvements but does not discuss computational cost or training time implications.
- Why unresolved: While SST shows accuracy gains, its computational efficiency relative to baseline activations remains unclear, which is critical for practical deployment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparisons of training time, memory usage, and FLOPs between SST and traditional activations across different hardware setups would quantify its computational trade-offs.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks explicit hyperparameter specifications for each experiment, making exact reproduction challenging.
- SST activation's implementation details beyond the basic squaring operation are not fully specified.
- The claim of 100% test accuracy on sign language and human activity tasks seems unusually high and may indicate overfitting or insufficient validation rigor.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core mechanism of SST (squaring Sigmoid and TanH outputs) is mathematically well-defined and reproducible. The conceptual improvement in gradient flow is sound.
- Medium confidence: The empirical performance improvements reported across different tasks are promising, but without variance measures or multiple runs, the robustness of these results is uncertain.
- Low confidence: The claim of 100% test accuracy on sign language and human activity tasks seems unusually high and may indicate overfitting or insufficient validation rigor.

## Next Checks

1. Implement SST activation and verify its mathematical properties (range, gradient behavior) match theoretical expectations before applying to full models.
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing SST to other activation functions (ReLU, Swish, etc.) on the same datasets to establish relative performance.
3. Perform multiple training runs with different random seeds for each experiment and report mean ± standard deviation to assess result stability.
