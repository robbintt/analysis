# Scenarios and Approaches for Situated Natural Language Explanations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.05035
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05035
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Specifying both audience and feature in prompts yields better situated explanations than specifying either alone.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how large language models can generate natural language explanations (NLEs) that adapt to specific situational contexts. The authors introduce the SBE dataset containing 100 explanandums, each paired with explanations for three distinct audiences (students, teachers, and parents). Using this dataset, they evaluate three categories of prompting methods—rule-based, meta-prompting, and in-context learning—across multiple pretrained models. Key findings include that combining audience and feature specifications yields the most accurate explanations, that explicitly modeling an "assistant" persona does not significantly improve performance, and that in-context learning helps with template adherence but not with contextual inference.

## Method Summary
The study uses the SBE dataset with 100 explanandums, each paired with explanations for three audiences (students, teachers, parents). Five LLMs are evaluated: GPT-3.5-turbo, Pythia-2.8B, LLaMa2-7B, LLaMa2-13B-chat, and Yi-34B. Three prompting methods are tested: rule-based (specifying audience and/or features), meta-prompting (generating prompts from specifications), and in-context learning (using demonstration examples). Generated explanations are evaluated using similarity scores (cosine similarity of SBERT embeddings with human annotations) and matching scores (cross-entropy loss over three situations).

## Key Results
- Combining audience and feature specifications (1AD) yields the most accurate explanations across all models
- Explicitly modeling an "assistant" persona does not significantly improve explanation quality
- In-context learning prompts excel at template adherence but fail to improve contextual inference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Specifying both audience and desired feature in prompts yields better situated explanations than specifying either alone.
- Mechanism: Dual specification constrains the model's generation space more precisely by simultaneously signaling both who the explanation is for and what aspect of the explanandum to emphasize, reducing ambiguity in the output.
- Core assumption: Language models can effectively parse and integrate multiple contextual cues from a single prompt when both audience and feature are specified.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "1) language models can generate prompts that result in explanations more precisely aligned with the target situations"
  - [section 4.1] "This dual focus enables a more precise tailoring of explanations to the audience's needs and the contextual nuances of the explanandum"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support; no direct citations found for this specific dual-specification mechanism.
- Break condition: If the model fails to parse combined audience-feature specifications, or if the feature is too vague to meaningfully constrain generation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adopting an "assistant" persona does not significantly improve explanation quality for situated NLE tasks.
- Mechanism: The persona framing adds little value because the model's baseline behavior already produces helpful explanations without explicit role-play instructions.
- Core assumption: Language models naturally default to a helpful, explanatory tone regardless of persona cues in the prompt.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.1] "explicitly modeling an 'assistant' persona by prompting 'You are a helpful assistant...' is not a necessary prompt technique for situated NLE tasks"
  - [section 4.1] "explicitly modeling an 'assistant' persona by prompting 'You are a helpful assistant...' is not a necessary prompt technique for situated NLE tasks"
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence found supporting or refuting this mechanism.
- Break condition: If task context requires specific stylistic adherence (e.g., professional tone) that persona framing could help enforce.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: In-context learning prompts excel at template adherence but fail to improve contextual inference for situated explanations.
- Mechanism: Demonstration-based prompts help the model learn the expected format but do not transfer situational understanding from the examples to the target generation.
- Core assumption: In-context learning primarily operates on surface-level pattern matching rather than deep contextual reasoning transfer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "3) the in-context learning prompts only can help LLMs learn the demonstration template but can't improve their inference performance"
  - [section 4.3] "The performance of in-context learning prompts with regard to similarity scores is exemplary, demonstrating a state-of-the-art capability to replicate human-annotated explanations. Nonetheless, the performance in matching scores suggests that these prompts may not effectively aid the model in comprehending the situational context"
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence found; this appears to be a novel finding.
- Break condition: If demonstration examples include richer situational context or if the model size increases significantly to improve reasoning transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cosine similarity for semantic text comparison
  - Why needed here: Used to compute similarity scores between generated and human-written explanations
  - Quick check question: If two sentences have cosine similarity of 0.9, what does this indicate about their semantic relationship?

- Concept: Cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification
  - Why needed here: Used to compute matching scores by treating each situation as a class and evaluating which generated explanation best matches the target
  - Quick check question: In a 3-class problem where the true class is 2 and predicted probabilities are [0.1, 0.7, 0.2], what is the cross-entropy loss?

- Concept: In-context learning mechanics
  - Why needed here: One of the prompting methods evaluated for generating situated explanations
  - Quick check question: What is the primary difference between in-context learning and fine-tuning in terms of how the model learns from examples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Explanandum → Prompt generation → LLM generation → Similarity/matching score computation → Analysis

- Critical path: Explanandum → Prompt generation → LLM generation → Similarity/matching score computation → Analysis

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt specificity vs. model flexibility: More specific prompts improve alignment but may constrain creativity
  - Model size vs. performance: Larger models generally perform better but with diminishing returns
  - Template complexity vs. transferability: Complex templates may not transfer well across different model architectures

- Failure signatures:
  - Low similarity scores with high matching scores: Model is generating appropriate content but in different wording
  - High similarity scores with low matching scores: Model is copying human explanations but not adapting to audience
  - Consistently poor performance across all prompting methods: Dataset or evaluation metric issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test base prompt performance on a single LLM to establish baseline
  2. Compare 1A vs 1D vs 1AD prompt variations on same model to isolate audience vs feature effects
  3. Test persona framing (2F vs 2T) on same model to verify assistant persona findings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between audience and feature specifications in prompts to maximize explanation quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses three categories of prompting methods: rule-based, meta-prompting, and in-context learning, and evaluates their effectiveness in generating situated NLEs. It finds that specifying both the audience and the desired feature (1AD) yields the most accurate explanations.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the relative importance of audience versus feature specifications or whether one can be more influential than the other in certain contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that vary the emphasis on audience versus feature specifications in prompts and measuring their impact on explanation quality could provide insights into the optimal balance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do commercial and open-source LLMs differ in their ability to generate situated NLEs, and what factors contribute to these differences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares the performance of commercial models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Gemini-Pro with open-source models like Pythia-2.8B, LLaMa2-7B, and Yi-34B. It finds that commercial models generally outperform open-source ones.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not delve into the specific factors that contribute to the performance differences between commercial and open-source models, such as model architecture, training data, or fine-tuning processes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analyses comparing the architectures, training datasets, and fine-tuning methods of commercial and open-source models could elucidate the factors contributing to performance differences.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can in-context learning prompts be improved to enhance the model's situational awareness and contextual appropriateness of generated explanations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that while in-context learning prompts show exemplary similarity scores, their matching scores suggest a lack of effective situational context comprehension.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific strategies or modifications to in-context learning prompts that could improve the model's situational awareness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with different structures and content of in-context learning prompts, such as varying the number of demonstrations or the specificity of the examples, could identify approaches that enhance situational awareness.

## Limitations
- The SBE dataset contains only 100 explananda, limiting generalizability to more diverse or complex explanation tasks
- Evaluation relies entirely on automatic metrics (cosine similarity and cross-entropy matching scores) without human judgment of explanation quality
- The study focuses on a specific set of audiences (students, teachers, parents) and may not generalize to other audience types

## Confidence
- High confidence: The finding that combining audience and feature specifications (1AD) improves explanation relevance is well-supported by quantitative results across multiple models and evaluation metrics.
- Medium confidence: The claim that assistant persona framing does not improve performance is reasonable but lacks corpus evidence and may be task-dependent.
- Medium confidence: The observation that in-context learning improves template adherence but not contextual inference is supported by the data but represents a novel finding without external validation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies comparing 1AD, 1A, and 1D prompts to validate whether automatic similarity scores align with human judgments of explanation quality.
2. Test the generalizability of findings by applying the same prompting strategies to a larger, more diverse explanation dataset (e.g., 500+ explananda across multiple domains).
3. Experiment with hybrid prompting approaches that combine in-context learning demonstrations with explicit audience-feature specifications to determine if template learning can be leveraged for better contextual inference.
