- One-line primary result: Novel approach using SignWiring notation system as intermediary for real-time multilingual sign language translation

## Executive Summary
This thesis introduces a novel approach to sign language processing that addresses the critical gap in language technologies for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. The core innovation is SignWiring, a universal sign language transcription notation system that serves as an intermediary between the visual-gestural modality of signed languages and text-based linguistic representations. This approach establishes a new standard for inclusive, real-time, and multilingual language technologies by bridging the gap between text-centric AI and the visual-gestural world of signed languages.

## Method Summary
The proposed method involves using SignWiring as an intermediate representation between sign language videos and spoken language text. The approach consists of a Computer Vision module for converting between video and notation, a Natural Language Processing module for translating between notation and text, and the SignWiring system itself serving as the universal intermediate representation. The method claims to enable faster, more targeted research and more natural, accurate translations across multiple languages by separating visual-gestural processing from linguistic processing.

## Key Results
- Establishes SignWiring as a universal intermediate representation for sign language processing
- Proposes clear separation between Computer Vision and NLP modules for signed language technologies
- Claims to enable faster research and more accurate multilingual translations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SignWiring provides a universal, language-independent intermediate representation that accurately captures the multidimensional nature of signed languages.
- Mechanism: SignWiring encodes signed languages into a discrete, standardized notation system that preserves spatial, temporal, and manual/non-manual features without loss of linguistic information.
- Core assumption: A universal notation system can represent the core phonological and grammatical structures of all signed languages without language-specific modifications.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SignWiring, a universal sign language transcription notation system, as an intermediary between the visual-gestural modality of signed languages and text-based linguistic representations"
  - [section] "Our paradigm using SignWriting is designed to accurately capture the multidimensional and language-independent aspects of signed languages"
  - [corpus] "No direct corpus evidence provided - this is a theoretical claim requiring validation through empirical testing"
- Break condition: If empirical testing shows significant information loss when translating between different signed languages using SignWiring as the intermediate representation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The notation-based approach enables faster, more targeted research and more natural, accurate translations across multiple languages.
- Mechanism: By providing a standardized intermediate representation, researchers can focus on translation models between notation and spoken language text without needing to handle raw video or language-specific gloss systems.
- Core assumption: Translation between notation and spoken language text is computationally simpler and more effective than direct video-to-text translation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "empirical evaluations, we establish the efficacy of our transcription method as a pivot for enabling faster, more targeted research"
  - [section] "Through empirical evaluations, we establish the efficacy of our transcription method as a pivot for enabling faster, more targeted research"
  - [corpus] "No direct corpus evidence provided - this is a computational efficiency claim requiring validation through comparative performance testing"
- Break condition: If direct video-to-text translation approaches consistently outperform notation-based approaches across multiple language pairs and evaluation metrics.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The paradigm establishes a clear boundary between NLP and Computer Vision, mirroring the separation in spoken language technologies.
- Mechanism: SignWiring handles the linguistic aspects of signed languages, while Computer Vision handles the visual-gestural modality conversion to/from notation, creating specialized research streams.
- Core assumption: The separation of linguistic processing from visual processing follows the same successful pattern as in spoken language technologies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This division mirrors the existing separation between NLP and Signal Processing in the realm of spoken language technologies"
  - [section] "Our paradigm establishes a clear boundary between NLP and Computer Vision within the broader context of SLP"
  - [corpus] "No direct corpus evidence provided - this is an architectural claim requiring validation through research community adoption patterns"
- Break condition: If integrated approaches that combine linguistic and visual processing consistently outperform separated approaches across multiple research domains.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sign language phonology and linguistic structure
  - Why needed here: Understanding how signed languages differ from spoken languages is crucial for appreciating why a universal notation system is necessary and how it should function
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components that make up the phonological structure of signed languages?

- Concept: Machine translation pipeline architecture
  - Why needed here: Understanding traditional MT pipelines helps explain how the notation-based approach fits into existing computational frameworks and what advantages it offers
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components of a typical neural machine translation system?

- Concept: Cross-modal translation challenges
  - Why needed here: Understanding the specific challenges of translating between visual-gestural and text-based modalities helps explain why intermediate representations are beneficial
  - Quick check question: What are the three main types of information loss that occur when translating between video and text representations of signed languages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Computer Vision module -> SignWiring notation -> NLP module
- Critical path: Video input → Computer Vision module → SignWiring notation → NLP module → Text output (for translation), with reverse path for production
- Design tradeoffs: The notation-based approach trades computational efficiency for flexibility and universality, requiring initial investment in notation processing but enabling broader language coverage and easier research integration
- Failure signatures: Common failure modes include notation encoding/decoding errors, translation model limitations between notation and text, and Computer Vision accuracy issues in pose estimation and gesture recognition
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline test: Compare direct video-to-text translation performance against notation-based translation pipeline using identical datasets and evaluation metrics
  2. Cross-language test: Test translation accuracy between multiple signed language pairs using notation as intermediate representation to validate language independence
  3. Real-time test: Measure latency and computational requirements of notation-based pipeline versus direct translation approaches to validate efficiency claims

## Limitations
- Lack of empirical validation - proposed SignWiring system benefits remain largely theoretical without direct corpus evidence
- Claims about computational efficiency and real-time performance lack comparative performance data against existing approaches
- No validation of system performance with diverse signers, environments, or real-world constraints

## Confidence

- **Low confidence**: Specific claims about computational efficiency, real-time performance, and universal applicability without empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Comparative performance test: Conduct head-to-head evaluation of notation-based vs direct video-to-text translation using identical datasets and metrics across multiple language pairs
2. Cross-linguistic validation: Test translation accuracy between diverse signed language pairs (e.g., ASL to BSL, LSF to Auslan) to verify universal applicability claims
3. Real-time benchmark: Measure end-to-end latency and computational requirements of the complete pipeline under realistic conditions with varying video qualities and signer characteristics
