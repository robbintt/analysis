# Reflecting on the State of Rehearsal-free Continual Learning with Pretrained Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.09384
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09384
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Simple prompt-tuning PEFT methods match or outperform complex P-RFCL approaches in rehearsal-free continual learning

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the effectiveness of parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods for rehearsal-free continual learning (RFCL) with pretrained models. The study reveals that query-based P-RFCL approaches perform well not due to their sophisticated query mechanisms, but because they effectively implement simple prompt-based PEFT. The research demonstrates that a basic prompt-tuning PEFT baseline (OnlyPrompt) achieves comparable or superior performance to more complex P-RFCL methods across multiple benchmarks. The findings suggest that the number of tunable parameters is a crucial factor in balancing adaptation and forgetting, and that standard regularization techniques can enhance PEFT-based approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper examines various PEFT methods for RFCL, focusing on prompt-based approaches and their comparison to existing P-RFCL techniques. The study employs a comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks, including CIFAR100 and ImageNet, to assess the performance of different methods. The authors analyze the role of tunable parameters in PEFT and investigate how regularization techniques like EWC and SI can be applied to enhance PEFT-based RFCL. The research also compares first-task adaptation with full datastream adaptation to understand their impact on performance.

## Key Results
- Query-based P-RFCL approaches perform similarly to simple prompt-based PEFT methods, collapsing toward the latter
- OnlyPrompt, a basic prompt-tuning PEFT baseline, matches or outperforms more complex P-RFCL methods across benchmarks
- The number of tunable parameters is a key driver of performance, naturally balancing adaptation and forgetting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of simple PEFT methods in P-RFCL stems from their ability to balance task adaptation with knowledge retention. By limiting the number of tunable parameters, these methods constrain the model's capacity to overwrite existing knowledge while still allowing sufficient flexibility for new task learning. This parameter efficiency acts as an implicit regularization mechanism, preventing catastrophic forgetting without the need for complex query-based approaches. The study also shows that applying explicit regularization techniques like EWC and SI to PEFT methods can further enhance their performance, suggesting that the interplay between parameter efficiency and regularization is crucial for successful continual learning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT)**: Essential for reducing computational overhead and preventing overfitting in continual learning scenarios
  - Why needed: To enable efficient adaptation of large pretrained models to new tasks without full finetuning
  - Quick check: Verify that PEFT methods significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters compared to full finetuning

- **Catastrophic forgetting**: The tendency of neural networks to rapidly forget previously learned information when trained on new tasks
  - Why needed: Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for developing effective continual learning strategies
  - Quick check: Measure performance degradation on previous tasks when training on new tasks

- **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)**: A regularization method that protects important weights from significant changes during finetuning
  - Why needed: To prevent catastrophic forgetting by constraining the updates to critical parameters
  - Quick check: Compare EWC-regularized PEFT performance against unregularized PEFT on continual learning benchmarks

- **Rehearsal-free continual learning**: Learning new tasks without storing or replaying previous task data
  - Why needed: To develop memory-efficient continual learning methods suitable for real-world applications
  - Quick check: Ensure that no previous task data is accessed during the training of new tasks

- **Prompt-based learning**: Using learnable prompt embeddings to adapt pretrained models to new tasks
  - Why needed: Provides a flexible and efficient way to condition models on task-specific information
  - Quick check: Verify that prompt embeddings can effectively guide the model's behavior for different tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Pretrained model -> PEFT layer (e.g., prompt embeddings) -> Task-specific adaptation

**Critical path**: Data input → PEFT layer initialization → Task adaptation → Performance evaluation → Regularization (if applied)

**Design tradeoffs**: Parameter efficiency vs. adaptation capacity, simplicity vs. performance, memory constraints vs. model complexity

**Failure signatures**: Catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks, inability to adapt to new tasks, overfitting to specific tasks

**First experiments**:
1. Compare OnlyPrompt performance against complex P-RFCL methods on CIFAR100 benchmark
2. Evaluate the impact of varying the number of tunable parameters on continual learning performance
3. Assess the effectiveness of EWC and SI regularization when applied to PEFT methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The analysis focuses primarily on prompt-based PEFT methods, which may not generalize to other parameter-efficient finetuning techniques
- The benchmarks used (e.g., CIFAR100, ImageNet) may not fully capture the complexity of real-world continual learning scenarios
- The study assumes a fixed set of hyperparameters for PEFT methods, which may not be optimal across all tasks or domains

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Query-based P-RFCL approaches perform similarly to simple prompt-based PEFT methods | High |
| The number of tunable parameters is a key driver of performance | Medium |
| Full datastream adaptation universally outperforms first-task adaptation | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test the robustness of PEFT-based methods on non-image datasets (e.g., text or audio) to assess generalizability
2. Investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning on PEFT performance across different task sequences
3. Compare the scalability of PEFT methods with other RFCL techniques in scenarios with a large number of tasks
