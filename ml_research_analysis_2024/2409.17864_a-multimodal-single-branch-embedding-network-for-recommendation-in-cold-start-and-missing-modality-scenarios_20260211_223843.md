# A Multimodal Single-Branch Embedding Network for Recommendation in Cold-Start and Missing Modality Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.17864
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17864
- Authors: Christian Ganhör; Marta Moscati; Anna Hausberger; Shah Nawaz; Markus Schedl
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SiBraR achieves nDCG@10 scores of 0.1616 (Onion), 0.2593 (ML-1M), and 0.0728 (Amazon) in warm-start, and 0.1982 (Onion), 0.2592 (ML-1M user cold-start), and 0.1479 (Amazon item cold-start) in cold-start scenarios.

## Executive Summary
SiBraR introduces a novel multimodal single-branch network for recommendation that addresses cold-start and missing modality scenarios. The key innovation is using a shared deep neural network to encode different modalities (including user-item interactions) into a common embedding space, enabling effective recommendations even when some modalities are missing. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate SiBraR's effectiveness, significantly outperforming traditional collaborative filtering and state-of-the-art content-based recommender systems in cold-start scenarios while remaining competitive in warm scenarios.

## Method Summary
SiBraR uses a single-branch neural network shared across all modalities, with modality-specific shallow projection networks to match input dimensions. For each user-item pair, it samples a subset of available modalities, projects and encodes them through the shared network, then averages the resulting embeddings. The model is trained using BPR loss with optional InfoNCE contrastive loss to align embeddings from different modalities. During inference, missing modalities are simply skipped, and the remaining ones are averaged. This architecture naturally handles cold-start and missing modality scenarios while reducing the modality gap between different content types.

## Key Results
- SiBraR achieves nDCG@10 of 0.1616 on Onion, 0.2593 on ML-1M, and 0.0728 on Amazon in warm-start scenarios
- In cold-start scenarios, SiBraR achieves 0.1982 on Onion, 0.2592 on ML-1M (user cold-start), and 0.1479 on Amazon (item cold-start)
- SiBraR significantly outperforms traditional collaborative filtering and state-of-the-art content-based recommender systems in cold-start scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** SiBraR reduces modality gap by forcing embeddings of the same entity from different modalities into similar regions of shared space.
- **Mechanism:** A single-branch neural network is shared across all modalities, so during training each modality is encoded through the same weights. This encourages embeddings of the same user/item from text, audio, image, etc. to cluster together, reducing modality gap.
- **Core assumption:** Different modalities of the same entity contain similar semantic information and should map to similar embeddings.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "the model is able to map different modalities to the same region of the shared embedding space, hence reducing the modality gap."
  - [section] "SiBraR aims at constructing embedding vectors for accurate recommendations by taking any available modality as input and projecting them into the same shared space... encouraging the model to encode modalities of the same entity to similar embeddings."
- **Break condition:** If modalities are semantically dissimilar (e.g., image vs. unrelated audio), forcing them into the same space could degrade recommendation quality.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Weight sharing allows SiBraR to naturally handle missing modalities and cold-start scenarios.
- **Mechanism:** By training with any modality available, the model learns to produce reasonable embeddings even if one modality is absent. During inference, missing modalities are simply skipped, and the remaining ones are averaged.
- **Core assumption:** The shared network can extract enough shared semantic information from any single modality to produce usable embeddings.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "This makes SiBraR effective in scenarios of missing modality, including cold start."
  - [section] "The strength of SiBraR... is its ability to tackle missing modality scenarios. It relies on the information extracted from the available modalities by means of a single branch... effective in cold-start scenarios."
- **Break condition:** If a modality carries most of the useful signal and is missing, performance will degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The contrastive loss further aligns embeddings from different modalities, improving cross-modal consistency.
- **Mechanism:** InfoNCE loss penalizes dissimilar embeddings of the same item across modalities and similar embeddings of different items, sharpening the modality alignment beyond weight sharing alone.
- **Core assumption:** The contrastive objective improves modality alignment without harming task performance.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "we also consider the use of a contrastive loss to further align the embeddings from different modalities."
  - [section] "The loss between modalities... aims at penalizing highly dissimilar embeddings of the same items, as well as similar embeddings of different items."
- **Break condition:** If temperature or weight is poorly tuned, contrastive loss may hurt performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Collaborative Filtering (CF) basics and limitations in cold-start.
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding why CF fails without interaction data motivates the hybrid approach.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to CF accuracy when a user or item has zero interactions?

- **Concept:** Multimodal representation learning and modality gap.
  - **Why needed here:** SiBraR's innovation is in multimodal fusion; knowing the modality gap problem is key.
  - **Quick check question:** Why do multi-branch models struggle when a modality is missing?

- **Concept:** InfoNCE contrastive loss formulation.
  - **Why needed here:** The paper optionally uses InfoNCE; understanding its mechanics is essential for tuning.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the temperature parameter 𝜏 affect the contrastive objective?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Single-branch encoder network g shared across all modalities
  - Modality-specific projection networks fᵢ (shallow) to match input dimension
  - User embedding function h (lookup table or DeepMF-like NN)
  - Optional contrastive loss module (symmetric InfoNCE)
  - Recommendation loss (BPR)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Sample user-item pair and negative items
  2. Embed user via h
  3. Sample nmod modalities, project via fᵢ, encode via g, average
  4. Compute recommendation score and BPR loss
  5. If contrastive enabled, compute InfoNCE loss between two sampled modalities
  6. Backpropagate combined loss

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Single-branch vs multi-branch: Simpler, naturally handles missing modalities, but may underfit if modalities are highly dissimilar
  - Modality averaging vs concatenation: Averaging is robust to missing data; concatenation could capture richer interactions but fails when modalities are missing
  - Contrastive loss inclusion: Helps modality alignment but adds complexity and hyperparameters (weight λ, temperature 𝜏)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low performance on cold-start: likely insufficient modality diversity or poor alignment
  - High variance across runs: learning rate or weight decay mis-tuned
  - Degraded performance when all modalities present: contrastive loss too strong or modality averaging too lossy

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train SiBraR on Onion with only interaction data; evaluate nDCG@10 to confirm CF baseline performance
  2. Add one modality (e.g., text) and compare against DropoutNet with same modality to isolate benefit of single-branch
  3. Train with all modalities and evaluate on missing-modality subsets to quantify robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does SiBraR's performance scale with the number of input modalities, and what is the optimal number of modalities for different recommendation domains?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that SiBraR's performance increases with an increasing number of modalities, but does not provide a detailed analysis of the scalability or optimal number of modalities.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic study on how SiBraR's performance changes as the number of input modalities increases, or what the optimal number of modalities is for different recommendation domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments systematically varying the number of input modalities and measuring SiBraR's performance on different recommendation datasets would provide insights into its scalability and optimal configuration.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does SiBraR's performance change when some modalities are missing during training, as opposed to only during inference?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that their analysis of missing-modality scenarios was limited to the case where all modalities are available during training but not during inference.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the scenario where some modalities are missing during training, which could be a more challenging and realistic setting for real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training and evaluating SiBraR with different combinations of missing modalities during both training and inference phases would provide insights into its robustness and performance in more challenging scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the modality gap in SiBraR's embedding space correlate with its recommendation performance, and can this gap be further reduced?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper analyzes the modality gap by visualizing the embeddings of different modalities in SiBraR's shared embedding space and shows that the single-branch network maps all modalities to the same region.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that SiBraR reduces the modality gap, it does not provide a quantitative analysis of the relationship between the modality gap and recommendation performance, or explore methods to further reduce the gap.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring the distance between multimodal embeddings of the same user or item and correlating this with recommendation performance, as well as exploring additional techniques to reduce the modality gap, would provide insights into this relationship and potential improvements.

## Limitations

- The single-branch architecture's effectiveness depends critically on semantic similarity of different modalities for the same entity
- The paper does not provide ablation studies showing performance degradation with dissimilar modalities
- No systematic analysis of the relationship between modality gap and recommendation performance

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: SiBraR outperforms traditional collaborative filtering in cold-start scenarios (supported by statistical significance tests)
- **Medium confidence**: The shared embedding space reduces modality gap (evidence is theoretical and qualitative, lacking quantitative modality gap metrics)
- **Low confidence**: Contrastive loss consistently improves performance (only briefly mentioned as optional with no systematic ablation)

## Next Checks

1. Test SiBraR on datasets with semantically dissimilar modalities to verify robustness when the core assumption breaks
2. Implement ablation studies removing the contrastive loss to quantify its actual contribution beyond weight sharing
3. Measure and report quantitative modality gap metrics (e.g., MRR between modalities) to validate the claimed alignment benefit
