# RetinaQA: A Robust Knowledge Base Question Answering Model for both Answerable and Unanswerable Questions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.10849
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10849
- Authors: Prayushi Faldu; Indrajit Bhattacharya; Mausam
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Introduces RetinaQA, a KBQA model that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on both answerable and unanswerable questions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RetinaQA, a KBQA model that can handle both answerable and unanswerable questions. The key idea is to combine path-based retrieval and schema-based generation via sketch-filling to enumerate logical form candidates, followed by discriminative ranking to select the best candidate. RetinaQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KBQA models on the GrailQAbility benchmark for both answerable and unanswerable questions across different categories of unanswerability. It also sets a new state-of-the-art on the answerable-only GrailQA dataset. The model is more robust and stable compared to adaptations of existing models for unanswerability.

## Method Summary
RetinaQA combines path-based retrieval and schema-based generation via sketch-filling to generate logical form candidates for a given question. The path-based retrieval component uses a trained entity linker and relation extractor to find relevant paths in the knowledge base. The schema-based generation component uses a grammar-based sketch-filling approach to generate logical forms based on the question's semantic structure. The generated candidates are then ranked using a discriminative model that considers various features like path length, entity type matching, and relation compatibility.

## Key Results
- RetinaQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KBQA models on the GrailQAbility benchmark for both answerable and unanswerable questions
- Sets a new state-of-the-art on the answerable-only GrailQA dataset
- Demonstrates improved robustness and stability compared to adaptations of existing models for unanswerability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RetinaQA's effectiveness stems from its ability to combine the strengths of both path-based retrieval and schema-based generation approaches. The path-based retrieval helps in finding relevant paths in the knowledge base, while the schema-based generation ensures that the generated logical forms adhere to the semantic structure of the question. The discriminative ranking further improves the model's performance by selecting the most appropriate candidate based on various features. This hybrid approach allows RetinaQA to handle both answerable and unanswerable questions effectively.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA)**: The task of answering natural language questions using a structured knowledge base.
  - Why needed: KBQA enables machines to leverage structured knowledge for answering questions, which is crucial for various applications like virtual assistants and question-answering systems.
  - Quick check: Ensure the model can accurately retrieve and reason over the knowledge base to generate correct answers.

- **Path-based Retrieval**: A method that uses trained entity linkers and relation extractors to find relevant paths in the knowledge base.
  - Why needed: Path-based retrieval helps in identifying relevant entities and relations in the knowledge base, which are crucial for generating accurate answers.
  - Quick check: Verify that the entity linker and relation extractor are accurate and can handle various types of questions.

- **Schema-based Generation**: A method that uses grammar-based sketch-filling to generate logical forms based on the question's semantic structure.
  - Why needed: Schema-based generation ensures that the generated logical forms adhere to the semantic structure of the question, improving the accuracy of the generated answers.
  - Quick check: Ensure that the grammar-based sketch-filling approach can handle various question types and generate appropriate logical forms.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Question -> Entity Linking & Relation Extraction -> Path-based Retrieval -> Schema-based Generation -> Candidate Generation -> Discriminative Ranking -> Final Answer
- **Critical Path**: The critical path involves entity linking and relation extraction, followed by path-based retrieval and schema-based generation to generate logical form candidates, and finally discriminative ranking to select the best candidate.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The hybrid approach of combining path-based retrieval and schema-based generation allows for better handling of both answerable and unanswerable questions, but it may increase the computational complexity of the model.
- **Failure Signatures**: Potential failures may occur due to inaccurate entity linking or relation extraction, incorrect path retrieval, or inappropriate logical form generation.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Evaluate the accuracy of the entity linker and relation extractor on a held-out test set.
  2. Assess the quality of the generated logical form candidates using human evaluation.
  3. Analyze the impact of the discriminative ranking on the overall performance of the model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation is limited to two benchmarks (GrailQAbility and GrailQA), and the model's performance on other KBQA datasets or real-world knowledge bases remains unknown.
- The path-based retrieval component may struggle with highly complex queries requiring multi-hop reasoning across distant entities.
- The discriminative ranking relies on handcrafted features and trained classifiers that may not generalize well to significantly different knowledge graph schemas.

## Confidence
- Performance claims on GrailQAbility/GrailQA: **High** (well-supported by experimental results)
- Generalizability to other KBQA tasks: **Medium** (limited to two benchmarks)
- Robustness in real-world deployment: **Low** (minimal analysis of failure cases)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Evaluate RetinaQA on additional KBQA benchmarks (e.g., WebQuestions, ComplexQuestions) to assess generalization beyond GrailQA/GrailQAbility.
2. **Ablation studies**: Systematically remove path-based retrieval or schema-based generation components to quantify their individual contributions to the model's performance.
3. **Error analysis on failure modes**: Conduct detailed analysis of unanswerable questions that the model incorrectly attempts to answer, categorizing failure patterns and identifying potential improvements.
