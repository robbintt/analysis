# Improving Execution Concurrency in Partial-Order Plans via Block-Substitution

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.18615
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18615
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Key outcome**: 2.1% overall concurrency improvement with 25% of plans showing measurable gains

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of improving execution concurrency in partial-order plans by establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for non-concurrency constraints under FDR encodings. The authors propose a block substitution algorithm that minimizes non-concurrency constraints through block deordering and substitution techniques. The approach shows significant effectiveness for larger plans (300-350 actions), achieving peak performance in this range, with moderate positive correlation between concurrency improvement and number of independent variables in planning tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce an algorithm that improves execution concurrency by identifying and eliminating non-concurrency constraints in partial-order plans. The method uses block deordering to encapsulate coherent actions in blocks, then exploits these blocks as candidate subplans for substitutions. By establishing formal conditions for when operators in a partial-order plan can execute concurrently under FDR encodings, the algorithm systematically transforms sequential plans into more parallel ones while preserving correctness.

## Key Results
- 25% of plans showed measurable concurrency improvements
- Overall 2.1% increase in concurrency (cflex) across evaluated plans
- Peak performance achieved for larger plans containing 300-350 actions
- Moderate positive correlation between concurrency improvement and number of independent variables

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by systematically identifying non-concurrency constraints that unnecessarily serialize independent operations in partial-order plans. By encapsulating coherent action sequences into blocks and applying substitution techniques, the algorithm creates opportunities for parallel execution without violating plan correctness. The FDR encoding framework provides the theoretical foundation for determining which orderings can be safely relaxed.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Plan representation -> FDR constraint analysis -> Block identification -> Block substitution -> Concurrency evaluation

**Critical Path**: The most critical path is the block substitution phase, where identified opportunities for concurrency are actually implemented. This requires accurate block identification and constraint analysis to ensure correctness while maximizing parallelism.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades some plan simplicity for increased concurrency. More aggressive block substitution yields higher concurrency but may produce harder-to-understand plans. The algorithm balances these concerns by focusing on coherent action blocks that preserve plan structure while enabling parallelism.

**Failure Signatures**: Failure occurs when block substitutions introduce deadlocks or violate domain constraints. The algorithm must detect when attempted concurrency improvements would compromise plan validity, particularly in domains with complex resource dependencies or temporal constraints.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Apply the algorithm to a simple IPC benchmark with known concurrency opportunities
2. Test on a medium-sized plan (100-150 actions) to evaluate scaling behavior
3. Verify the correlation between independent variables and concurrency improvement on a controlled planning task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Performance analysis limited to plans of 300-350 actions, with unclear effectiveness for smaller or larger plans
- Moderate correlation between concurrency improvement and independent variables suggests context-dependent effectiveness
- Experimental validation restricted to standard IPC benchmarks without domain-specific testing
- Modest overall improvement (2.1%) may limit practical impact in some applications

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- Theoretical framework for identifying non-concurrency constraints
- Block substitution algorithm mechanics
- Correlation findings between concurrency and independent variables

**Medium Confidence**:
- Empirical results across diverse planning domains
- Generalizability beyond IPC benchmarks
- Long-term stability of concurrency improvements

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the algorithm on domain-specific planning problems (e.g., robotics, logistics) to assess practical applicability beyond IPC benchmarks.
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine which components of the block substitution method contribute most to concurrency improvements.
3. Test the method's scalability on plans exceeding 350 actions to identify performance boundaries and potential degradation points.
