## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.09833
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09833
- Reference count: 40
- Method to convert videos of real-world scenes into interactive game environments

## Executive Summary
Video2Game presents a method to automatically convert videos of real-world scenes into interactive game environments. The approach combines neural radiance fields (NeRF) for geometry and appearance capture, mesh conversion for real-time rendering, and physics modeling for object interactions. The system enables free exploration and manipulation within photo-realistic virtual environments directly in a web browser. Quantitative results show superior rendering quality and geometry accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, with real-time performance exceeding 100 FPS across various hardware platforms.

## Method Summary
Video2Game is a three-stage pipeline that converts single videos into interactive game environments. First, a large-scale NeRF with depth and normal supervision captures scene geometry and appearance. Second, the NeRF is converted into an explicit mesh with neural textures for real-time rendering. Third, the scene is decomposed into actionable entities with collision geometries and physics parameters for interactive simulation. The framework enables real-time performance, browser compatibility, and photo-realistic rendering while supporting free navigation and object manipulation.

## Key Results
- Real-time performance exceeding 100 FPS across various hardware platforms
- Superior rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Better geometry accuracy (RMSE, MAE, outlier rate) with monocular depth and normal priors
- Browser-compatible interactive environments with physics-based object interactions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: NeRF distillation to mesh with neural textures enables real-time rendering while preserving visual quality
- Mechanism: The system converts the volumetric NeRF representation into an explicit mesh with UV-mapped neural textures, then uses a lightweight MLP shader to handle view-dependent effects during rasterization
- Core assumption: The mesh extraction from NeRF density field can preserve surface geometry well enough for both rendering and physics simulation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We leverage differentiable renderers [39] to render our mesh into RGB images CR and depth maps DR... Finally, the shader computes the sum of the view-independent base color Bi and the view-dependent MLP MLPshader θ (Si, di)"
  - [abstract] "mesh module that distills the knowledge from NeRF for faster rendering"
- Break condition: If mesh extraction fails to capture fine geometry details, visual quality degrades significantly or physics simulation becomes inaccurate

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Monocular depth and normal priors improve NeRF geometry reconstruction for better physical interaction
- Mechanism: The system uses off-the-shelf monocular depth estimators and normal predictors to provide geometric regularization during NeRF training, reducing floaters and improving surface accuracy
- Core assumption: Monocular depth and normal predictions are accurate enough to guide NeRF geometry without introducing significant bias
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Inspired by MonoSDF [88], we leverage off-the-shelf monocular depth estimators [26, 33] to guide and improve the underlying geometry... Lnormal = ∥Nmlp(r) − Nmono(r)∥2 2 + ∥Nmlp(r) − Ndensity(r)∥2 2"
  - [abstract] "monocular cues... substantially improve rendered geometry compared to other baselines"
- Break condition: If monocular depth estimates are unreliable for the scene type, geometry guidance may harm rather than help reconstruction

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Scene decomposition with semantic segmentation enables object-level physics interactions
- Mechanism: The system segments the scene into individual objects using semantic predictions from the NeRF, then creates separate meshes for each object and assigns collision geometries and physical properties
- Core assumption: Semantic segmentation can reliably distinguish between different object types and their boundaries in the scene
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "By identifying the objects each spatial region belongs to, we can use neural fields to guide the decomposition of the mesh... For each object, we perform NeRF meshing individually"
  - [abstract] "physics module that models the interactions and physical dynamics among the objects"
- Break condition: If semantic segmentation fails to properly separate objects, physics interactions will be inaccurate or impossible

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and volume rendering
  - Why needed here: Forms the core representation for capturing geometry and appearance from video
  - Quick check question: How does NeRF volume rendering work to generate images from 3D points and density values?

- Concept: Mesh extraction and UV mapping
  - Why needed here: Enables conversion from volumetric representation to explicit geometry for real-time rendering
  - Quick check question: What is the process of converting a NeRF density field into a mesh using marching cubes?

- Concept: Rigid body physics simulation
  - Why needed here: Allows realistic object interactions and navigation within the virtual environment
  - Quick check question: How do collision geometries (box, sphere, convex, mesh) differ in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video -> Base NeRF training -> Mesh extraction -> Physics decomposition -> Game engine deployment
- Critical path: Video → Base NeRF training → Mesh extraction → Physics decomposition → Game engine deployment
- Design tradeoffs:
  - NeRF vs explicit mesh: NeRF quality vs real-time performance
  - Collision geometry types: Accuracy vs computational efficiency
  - Semantic vs manual decomposition: Automation vs precision
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor geometry quality: Visual artifacts, incorrect physics collisions
  - Low FPS: Inefficient mesh representation or shader complexity
  - Missing object interactions: Failed semantic segmentation or physics parameter assignment
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test NeRF reconstruction quality on a simple indoor scene with known ground truth geometry
  2. Validate mesh extraction quality by comparing rendered images before and after conversion
  3. Verify physics interactions by testing object collision and movement in a simple scene setup

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Video2Game framework handle complex, highly reflective surfaces or transparent materials in real-world scenes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the framework learns view-dependent visual appearance but doesn't address material properties like metallic properties for physics-informed relighting
- Why unresolved: The framework's current design focuses on capturing geometry, appearance, and basic physical interactions but lacks a method to accurately model complex material properties that affect light interaction, such as specularity, transparency, and subsurface scattering
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the framework's performance on scenes with varied material properties, particularly highly reflective or transparent surfaces, and comparisons with baseline methods that explicitly model these properties

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the Video2Game framework generalize to scenes with significant occlusions or missing data in the input video?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the framework performs well on both indoor and large-scale outdoor scenes but doesn't explicitly discuss its performance on scenes with significant occlusions or missing data
- Why unresolved: Real-world videos often contain occlusions or missing data due to objects moving in and out of frame, camera angles, or poor lighting conditions. The framework's ability to handle such scenarios is not addressed
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the framework's performance on scenes with known occlusions or missing data, and comparisons with baseline methods that specifically address these challenges

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the Video2Game framework perform on scenes with dynamic objects or scenes captured from a moving camera?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on converting static scenes from a single video into interactive environments, but it doesn't explicitly discuss its performance on scenes with dynamic objects or scenes captured from a moving camera
- Why unresolved: Real-world videos often contain dynamic objects or are captured from a moving camera, which can introduce additional challenges for scene reconstruction and physics modeling. The framework's ability to handle such scenarios is not addressed
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the framework's performance on scenes with dynamic objects or scenes captured from a moving camera, and comparisons with baseline methods that specifically address these challenges

## Limitations

- Reliance on monocular depth and normal predictions can fail on scenes with reflective surfaces, transparent objects, or complex geometries
- Limited evaluation on diverse real-world scenarios beyond the controlled Garden vase dataset
- Generalization to scenes with dynamic objects, moving cameras, or significant occlusions is not addressed

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core pipeline combining NeRF, mesh extraction, and physics decomposition is technically sound and well-established
- **Medium confidence**: Real-time performance claims of >100 FPS, as hardware specifications and optimization details are limited
- **Medium confidence**: Quantitative comparisons with baselines, given that the baselines may not have been optimized for the specific evaluation protocols
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to complex outdoor scenes and scenarios with moving objects or dynamic lighting

## Next Checks

1. Test the complete pipeline on diverse scene types including outdoor environments with vegetation, reflective surfaces, and complex geometries to assess robustness beyond the Garden vase dataset
2. Conduct ablation studies specifically measuring the impact of monocular depth and normal priors on geometry quality across different scene characteristics
3. Benchmark real-time performance across a range of hardware specifications, including integrated GPUs and mobile devices, to verify the claimed >100 FPS performance
