# Assessing the Portability of Parameter Matrices Trained by Parameter-Efficient Finetuning Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.14228
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14228
- Reference count: 15
- Parameter-efficient finetuning modules can be effectively transferred between different model variants

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the portability of task-specific knowledge encoded in parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) modules across different pretrained language models. The authors conduct a comprehensive study testing the transferability of PEFT modules trained via four techniques (Adapters, Compacters, LoRA, and Prefix Tuning) between raw and instruction-tuned variants of T5 models. Through 1,440 experiments, they demonstrate that ported PEFT modules significantly outperform both randomly initialized and distribution-sampled parameters across all techniques, with Adapters showing the highest portability particularly when transferring from raw to instruction-tuned models.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct extensive experiments across 1,440 configurations to evaluate PEFT module portability. They train PEFT modules using four techniques (Adapters, Compacters, LoRA, Prefix Tuning) on both raw and instruction-tuned T5 models, then transfer these modules to different model variants. The evaluation compares ported modules against random initialization and distribution-sampled parameters using zero-shot and few-shot transfer scenarios. The study systematically varies the source and target model types (raw vs. instruction-tuned) to assess how instruction-tuning affects portability outcomes.

## Key Results
- Ported PEFT modules significantly outperform randomly initialized and distribution-sampled parameters across all tested techniques
- Adapters demonstrate the highest portability, particularly when transferring from raw to instruction-tuned models
- Zero-shot portability is observed in favorable conditions, with transfer success varying based on PEFT technique and model characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The portability of PEFT modules works because these modules capture task-specific transformations that are largely independent of the underlying model's pretraining regime. When instruction-tuning modifies the base model's behavior, the PEFT modules retain their task-specific knowledge while adapting to the new model's representation space. The modular nature of PEFT techniques allows them to encapsulate transferable task knowledge that can be effectively reapplied across different model variants.

## Foundational Learning
**Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT)** - Techniques that update only a small subset of model parameters during adaptation. Needed to understand the efficiency benefits and transferability mechanisms. Quick check: Verify that parameter count reduction maintains task performance.

**Adapters** - Small bottleneck modules inserted into transformer layers that learn task-specific transformations. Needed as the most portable PEFT technique in the study. Quick check: Confirm adapter insertion points and dimensions match original architecture.

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** - Technique that decomposes weight updates into low-rank matrices, reducing trainable parameters. Needed to understand alternative PEFT approaches. Quick check: Verify rank selection and initialization stability.

**Instruction-tuned models** - Models further trained on instruction-following datasets to improve zero-shot performance. Needed to assess how different pretraining regimes affect portability. Quick check: Confirm instruction-tuning objectives and dataset characteristics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** T5 base model -> PEFT module insertion -> Task-specific adaptation -> Portability evaluation

**Critical Path:** PEFT training on source model → Module extraction → Transfer to target model → Performance evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The study balances between comprehensive technique coverage (4 PEFT methods) and controlled experimental conditions (T5-only models). This limits generalizability but enables precise comparative analysis.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor portability manifests as performance degradation approaching random initialization baselines, particularly when transferring between models with substantially different pretraining objectives or architectures.

**First Experiments:**
1. Train Adapters on a raw T5 model and transfer to an instruction-tuned variant
2. Compare LoRA module performance when transferred between same-architecture vs. different-architecture models
3. Evaluate zero-shot vs. few-shot transfer success rates across all four PEFT techniques

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions beyond calling for future work to explore broader model architectures and multi-task scenarios.

## Limitations
- Limited to T5 models, restricting generalizability to other architectures
- Focuses only on four PEFT techniques, omitting other popular methods
- Confined to single-task scenarios without exploring multi-task transfer capabilities

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Ported PEFT modules outperform random initialization and distribution-sampled parameters
- Adapter portability superiority is consistently demonstrated

**Medium Confidence:**
- Zero-shot portability conditions are favorable but context-dependent
- Transfer from raw to instruction-tuned models shows consistent patterns

**Low Confidence:**
- Generalizability to non-T5 architectures remains speculative
- Real-world deployment scenarios lack empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate portability experiments across diverse model architectures (BERT, GPT, RoBERTa) to assess architectural dependency
2. Extend study to multi-task scenarios for cross-task transfer capability analysis
3. Conduct ablation studies on model size, instruction-tuning intensity, and domain specificity impacts on portability
