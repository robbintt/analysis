core_contribution: URIEL is a frequently cited language knowledge base with typological,
  geographical, and phylogenetic data for 7970 languages, but suffers from limited
  linguistic inclusion and usability. URIEL+ addresses these issues by integrating
  five new databases to expand typological feature coverage for 2898 low-resource
  languages, implementing multiple imputation algorithms for missing data, and enabling
  customizable distance calculations with confidence scores.

# URIEL+: Enhancing Linguistic Inclusion and Usability in a Typological and Multilingual Knowledge Base

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.18472
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18472
- Reference count: 40
- Languages available for featural distance calculations increased from 4005 to 4366 (9.01% increase)

## Executive Summary
URIEL+ addresses critical limitations in the widely-used URIEL knowledge base by integrating five new typological databases, implementing multiple imputation algorithms, and enabling customizable distance calculations with confidence scores. These enhancements expand typological feature coverage for 2898 low-resource languages, including ancient and indigenous languages, while improving usability through dynamic distance computation. The system achieves competitive performance on downstream NLP tasks while showing better alignment with established linguistic distance studies, making it a more inclusive and reliable resource for cross-lingual transfer learning.

## Method Summary
URIEL+ integrates five new typological databases (SAPhon, BDPROTO, Grambank, APiCS, eWAVE) to expand feature coverage for 2898 additional languages. Multiple imputation algorithms (k-NN, MIDASpy, SoftImpute) are implemented to handle missing data, enabling distance calculations for all languages in the knowledge base. The system replaces pre-computed distances with dynamic computation allowing user customization of aggregation methods, distance metrics, and feature subsets, while confidence scores quantify data completeness, consistency, and imputation quality. These enhancements increase languages available for featural distance calculations from 4005 to 4366 and demonstrate competitive performance on POS, MT, DEP, and EL downstream tasks.

## Key Results
- Database integration increased languages available for featural distance calculations from 4005 to 4366 (9.01% increase)
- SoftImpute imputation algorithm performed best with high F1 and low RMSE scores
- URIEL+ showed better alignment with linguistic distance studies compared to original URIEL
- Competitive performance achieved on downstream NLP tasks (POS, MT, DEP, EL)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Adding five new typological databases increases languages available for featural distance calculations by 9.01%. Integrating SAPhon, BDPROTO, Grambank, APiCS, and eWAVE extends URIEL's feature coverage to 2898 additional languages, including low-resource and ancient languages, directly increasing the count of languages for which typological distance can be computed. Core assumption: new features are non-redundant and compatible with existing vector format. Evidence anchors: abstract states expanding coverage for 2898 languages and increasing available languages from 4005 to 4366; section 2.1 explains integration increases languages with featural data from 2724 to 4366.

### Mechanism 2
Imputation algorithms allow distance calculations for all languages in the knowledge base, even with missing data. By applying k-NN, MIDASpy, or SoftImpute imputation, missing typological feature values are estimated from similar languages, enabling distance computations without defaulting to placeholder values. Core assumption: imputation methods accurately reconstruct missing values without introducing large bias. Evidence anchors: abstract mentions implementing multiple imputation algorithms for missing data; section 2.2 details integration of three imputation algorithms and states this allows distance calculations for all languages; section 3.2 reports SoftImpute performed best on imputation quality test.

### Mechanism 3
Customizable distance calculations with confidence scores improve usability and reliability. URIEL+ replaces pre-computed distances with dynamic computation, allowing users to choose aggregation methods, distance metrics, and feature subsets; confidence scores quantify data completeness, consistency, and imputation quality. Core assumption: users can correctly interpret and apply confidence scores to assess reliability. Evidence anchors: abstract highlights enabling customizable distance calculations with confidence scores; section 2.3 describes dynamic calculation system with options for aggregation and metrics; section 2.4 introduces confidence scores based on completeness, consistency, and imputation quality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Typological distance**
  - Why needed here: URIEL+ computes distances based on structural language features; understanding typological distance is essential to interpret results and evaluate alignment with linguistic studies
  - Quick check question: What are the main domains used to measure typological distance in URIEL+ (e.g., syntax, phonology, morphology)?

- **Concept: Imputation for missing data**
  - Why needed here: A large portion of URIEL's data is missing; imputation enables distance calculations for all languages and improves data integrity
  - Quick check question: Why does SoftImpute perform better than mean imputation for this dataset?

- **Concept: Confidence scoring for data quality**
  - Why needed here: Distance calculations can be unreliable when based on incomplete or imputed data; confidence scores help users assess result reliability
  - Quick check question: Which three metrics form the basis of URIEL+'s confidence scores?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data layer (five integrated typological databases) -> Processing layer (feature classification, binarization, redundancy resolution, imputation algorithms) -> Calculation layer (dynamic distance computation with user-selectable aggregation, metrics, feature subsets) -> Output layer (distance values, confidence scores, compatibility with downstream NLP frameworks)
- **Critical path**: Data integration → Imputation → Distance calculation → Confidence scoring → Downstream task evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Feature coverage vs. data quality (expanding databases increases coverage but may introduce noise); Imputation accuracy vs. computational cost (more sophisticated imputation is accurate but slower); Flexibility vs. usability (many customization options empower users but increase complexity)
- **Failure signatures**: Distances show no variation for large language groups → likely due to excessive imputation or default values; Confidence scores are uniformly low → data completeness or consistency is poor; Downstream tasks perform worse than baseline → imputation or distance computation may be introducing bias
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run a distance calculation between a pair of closely related languages using default settings and inspect the confidence score
  2. Apply k-NN imputation on a subset of data, compute distances, and compare results to SoftImpute
  3. Use lang2vec to compute distances for a set of languages with and without feature filtering, and evaluate the effect on downstream POS tagging accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the impact of using different imputation algorithms on downstream task performance, and which algorithm consistently performs best across various NLP tasks? The paper compares three imputation algorithms (k-NN, MIDASpy, SoftImpute) and finds SoftImpute performs best in imputation quality test, but impact on downstream tasks is not fully explored. Unresolved because the paper only briefly mentions SoftImpute was used in downstream tasks without detailed comparison across various NLP tasks. Evidence that would resolve it: comprehensive study comparing performance of different imputation algorithms on wide range of NLP tasks using URIEL+ as knowledge base.

### Open Question 2
How does the inclusion of morphological features in URIEL+ affect the accuracy of typological distance calculations, particularly for morphologically rich languages? The paper introduces new morphological feature category and states it's critical for morphologically rich languages, but does not provide empirical evidence of its impact on typological distance calculations. Unresolved because while the paper claims morphological features are important, it does not demonstrate how their inclusion affects accuracy of typological distance calculations. Evidence that would resolve it: study comparing typological distance calculations using URIEL+ with and without morphological features, focusing on languages with varying degrees of morphological complexity.

### Open Question 3
What is the optimal combination of features and data sources for calculating typological distances that best aligns with linguistic distance studies? The paper introduces customizable distance calculations and confidence scores, suggesting optimal combination may vary by use case, and case study shows URIEL+ aligns better than URIEL with linguistic distance metrics, but does not identify optimal combination. Unresolved because the paper does not explore how different combinations affect alignment with linguistic distance studies, nor provide method for determining optimal combination. Evidence that would resolve it: systematic study comparing performance of different feature and data source combinations in calculating typological distances using diverse set of languages and linguistic distance metrics as benchmarks.

## Limitations
- Database integration may introduce feature redundancy or inconsistent feature definitions across sources, potentially affecting distance calculation reliability
- Imputation algorithms rely on assumptions about feature distributions that may not hold for all language families, particularly low-resource languages with sparse data
- Confidence scoring system based on proxy metrics (completeness, consistency, imputation quality) may not fully capture reliability for downstream tasks
- Evaluation focuses on four NLP tasks without extensive ablation studies to isolate impact of each enhancement

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Database integration increased languages available for featural distance calculations from 4005 to 4366 (9.01% increase) - well-supported by abstract and integration section with clear methodology

**Medium Confidence**: SoftImpute performs best among imputation algorithms - supported by imputation quality tests, but evaluation criteria may not fully reflect downstream task performance

**Medium Confidence**: Better alignment with linguistic distance studies - supported by comparison with published results, but evaluation methodology lacks detail on how alignment was quantified across linguistic studies

## Next Checks

1. **Database Integration Validation**: Conduct feature redundancy analysis between the five new databases and existing URIEL features to quantify overlap and potential conflicts, and assess impact on distance calculation stability

2. **Imputation Robustness Test**: Perform cross-validation on languages with complete data by systematically removing features and comparing imputed values to ground truth, stratified by language family and feature type

3. **Downstream Task Ablation Study**: Run controlled experiments isolating contribution of each URIEL+ enhancement (database integration, imputation, customization) to downstream NLP task performance to determine which components provide most value
