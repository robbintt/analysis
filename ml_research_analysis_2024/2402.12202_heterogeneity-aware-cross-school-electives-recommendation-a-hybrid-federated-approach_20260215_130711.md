# Heterogeneity-aware Cross-school Electives Recommendation: a Hybrid Federated Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.12202
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12202
- Reference count: 40
- Proposed HFRec model achieves up to 18% improvement in HR@1 and 16% improvement in NDCG@5 metrics while maintaining privacy in cross-school elective recommendations

## Executive Summary
This paper presents HFRec, a hybrid federated learning approach for cross-school elective course recommendations that addresses data privacy and heterogeneity challenges. The model constructs heterogeneous graphs for each school, integrating content and context information through an attention mechanism, and trains individual school-based models under a federated framework with adaptive learning rates. Experiments demonstrate that HFRec outperforms state-of-the-art federated recommendation methods while preserving privacy by avoiding direct data sharing between institutions.

## Method Summary
HFRec employs a hybrid federated learning framework that constructs heterogeneous graphs for each school to capture content and context information. The model uses a novel attention mechanism to integrate heterogeneous information and implements adaptive learning rates for individual school-based models during federated training. This approach enables privacy-preserving recommendations by keeping school data local while allowing collaborative model training across institutions.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 18% improvement in HR@1 metric compared to baseline federated methods
- Demonstrates 16% improvement in NDCG@5 metric over state-of-the-art approaches
- Outperforms FedMF, FedFast, and PPR baselines in cross-school elective recommendation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid federated architecture enables collaborative learning while preserving data privacy by keeping school data local. The attention mechanism effectively integrates heterogeneous information across schools, capturing both content and context features that are crucial for personalized recommendations. Adaptive learning rates for individual school models help address the challenges of non-IID data distributions across institutions.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Federated Learning**: Distributed machine learning framework that trains models across multiple decentralized devices without exchanging raw data; needed to preserve privacy while enabling collaborative learning, check by verifying model convergence across clients.
2. **Heterogeneous Graph Construction**: Building graphs that capture different types of relationships and features; essential for representing complex elective course selection patterns, verify by examining graph connectivity and feature richness.
3. **Attention Mechanisms**: Neural network components that dynamically weight input features; crucial for integrating heterogeneous information across schools, validate by comparing with fixed-weight approaches.
4. **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Dynamic adjustment of learning rates during training; helps address non-IID data challenges across schools, confirm by monitoring training stability and convergence.
5. **Cross-domain Recommendation**: Techniques for making recommendations across different domains or institutions; fundamental for the cross-school setting, assess by measuring recommendation accuracy across institutional boundaries.
6. **Privacy-preserving ML**: Methods that enable learning while protecting sensitive data; critical for the educational context, verify through privacy analysis and data leakage assessment.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
HFRec consists of heterogeneous graph construction modules for each school -> attention mechanism for information integration -> individual school-based models -> federated aggregation layer with adaptive learning rates.

Critical Path:
Data preprocessing and heterogeneous graph construction -> attention-based feature integration -> local model training at each school -> federated model aggregation -> recommendation generation.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Privacy vs. model performance: federated approach preserves privacy but may limit access to rich collaborative patterns
- Model complexity vs. interpretability: attention mechanisms add complexity but improve recommendation accuracy
- Local vs. global optimization: balancing school-specific preferences with cross-institutional patterns

Failure Signatures:
- Convergence issues when schools have highly divergent data distributions
- Performance degradation when attention mechanism fails to properly integrate heterogeneous information
- Privacy breaches if federated aggregation is not properly implemented

First Experiments:
1. Compare HFRec performance with and without attention mechanism on heterogeneous data
2. Test federated training convergence with varying numbers of schools
3. Evaluate recommendation accuracy under different levels of data heterogeneity across schools

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on public datasets (CiteULike, MovieLens) that may not represent actual elective course selection patterns across schools
- Limited scalability testing with more than two schools in the federated architecture
- No statistical significance testing reported for claimed performance improvements
- Does not address convergence issues with highly non-IID data distributions across schools

## Confidence
- Performance improvement claims: Medium confidence due to limited baseline comparison and lack of statistical testing
- Attention mechanism effectiveness: High confidence based on ablation study, but limited experimental scope
- Privacy preservation: High confidence in federated architecture's ability to maintain privacy
- Scalability to multiple schools: Low confidence due to limited testing with only two schools

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments using real-world educational datasets that capture actual elective course selection patterns across multiple institutions, including validation of model performance with schools of varying sizes and course offerings.
2. Perform statistical significance testing on all reported improvements and conduct robustness analysis across multiple runs to ensure results are not due to random variation or overfitting to specific datasets.
3. Evaluate the model's scalability and convergence properties when federated across more than two schools, particularly focusing on scenarios where schools have highly imbalanced or non-overlapping course offerings.
