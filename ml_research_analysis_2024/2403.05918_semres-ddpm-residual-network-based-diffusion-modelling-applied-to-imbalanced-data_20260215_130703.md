# SEMRes-DDPM: Residual Network Based Diffusion Modelling Applied to Imbalanced Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.05918
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05918
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SEMRes-DDPM improves F1 score to 0.7059, G-mean to 0.8173, and AUC to 0.8979 on 20 imbalanced tabular datasets

## Executive Summary
SEMRes-DDPM introduces a novel oversampling method for imbalanced tabular data classification by leveraging a hybrid neural network (SEMST-ResNet) within the diffusion model's reverse denoising process. The method addresses limitations of existing oversampling techniques by combining residual connections, multi-head self-attention, and soft thresholding to improve noise removal and data quality. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art oversampling methods across multiple evaluation metrics and classification models.

## Method Summary
SEMRes-DDPM is an oversampling method for imbalanced tabular data that uses a diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with a custom reverse denoising network called SEMST-ResNet. The forward diffusion process gradually adds Gaussian noise to real data, while the reverse process uses SEMST-ResNet to predict and remove noise at each step. SEMST-ResNet combines residual connections with multi-head self-attention and soft thresholding to better capture feature correlations and adaptively suppress noise. The model generates synthetic minority-class samples that are closer to the true data distribution, improving classification performance when combined with original data.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art oversampling techniques (SMOTE, ADASYN, GAN-based, and TabDDPM) on 20 real-world imbalanced datasets
- Achieves higher F1 scores (average 0.7059), G-means (average 0.8173), and AUC values (average 0.8979)
- Generates data distributions that are closer to real data distributions than TabDDPM with CWGAN-GP
- Demonstrates better classification performance across 9 different classification models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
SEMRes-DDPM's hybrid neural network structure (SEMST-ResNet) outperforms simple MLP in denoising tabular data during the inverse diffusion process. The SEMST-ResNet combines residual connections with multi-head self-attention and soft thresholding, allowing the network to better capture feature correlations and adaptively suppress noise. The core assumption is that residual and attention mechanisms can effectively separate noise from signal in high-dimensional tabular data.

### Mechanism 2
SEMRes-DDPM generates synthetic minority-class samples that are closer to the true data distribution than TabDDPM and CWGAN-GP. By improving noise removal quality, the reverse diffusion process reconstructs data that better matches original feature distributions, leading to more realistic synthetic samples. The core assumption is that higher-quality denoising leads to more realistic data generation in diffusion models.

### Mechanism 3
SEMRes-DDPM improves classification performance on imbalanced tabular datasets by generating higher-quality minority-class samples. Better synthetic samples lead to more balanced and representative training data, which improves classifier generalization. The core assumption is that synthetic samples generated closer to the true distribution will improve classifier performance more than less realistic samples.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)
  - Why needed here: SEMRes-DDPM is built on DDPM; understanding the forward and reverse diffusion processes is essential to grasp how noise is progressively removed and realistic data is generated.
  - Quick check question: In DDPM, what is the role of the learned reverse process network?

- Concept: Oversampling for Imbalanced Data
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses the problem of imbalanced classification by generating synthetic minority-class samples; knowing how SMOTE, ADASYN, and GAN-based methods work provides context for SEMRes-DDPM's improvements.
  - Quick check question: How does SMOTE generate synthetic samples, and what limitation does it have compared to diffusion-based methods?

- Concept: Residual Networks and Attention Mechanisms
  - Why needed here: SEMST-ResNet uses residual connections and multi-head self-attention; understanding these architectures explains why this network can outperform simple MLP in denoising.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of residual connections in deep networks, and how does multi-head self-attention help in feature extraction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Forward diffusion -> SEMST-ResNet denoising network -> Sampling loop -> Classification training -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Forward diffusion → Training reverse network (SEMST-ResNet) → Sampling synthetic data → Training classifier → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Residual + attention structure improves denoising but adds computational cost vs. simple MLP; fixed denoising steps balance quality and runtime; soft thresholding per sample increases adaptability but adds complexity
- Failure signatures: Poor synthetic data quality (check if reverse network fails to converge or denoising steps are insufficient); mode collapse or unrealistic samples (inspect if forward diffusion loses too much structure); classifier overfitting to synthetic data (compare validation curves on real vs. synthetic samples)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Compare peak SNR between SEMST-ResNet and MLP on a small tabular dataset to verify denoising improvement; 2) Generate synthetic samples and visually compare their distribution to real data using density plots; 3) Train a simple classifier (e.g., logistic regression) on balanced data (real + synthetic) and measure F1 score to confirm performance gain

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does SEMRes-DDPM perform on tabular datasets with different imbalance ratios, and are there optimal imbalance ratios where it outperforms other methods most significantly? The paper tested SEMRes-DDPM on 20 datasets with varying imbalance ratios but did not analyze performance trends across different IR ranges. Detailed analysis of performance across different imbalance ratio ranges would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
What is the computational complexity of SEMRes-DDPM compared to other oversampling methods, and how does it scale with dataset size and dimensionality? While the paper mentions longer training times, it doesn't provide quantitative comparisons of computational complexity or scalability analysis. Empirical measurements of training time, memory usage, and computational complexity across datasets of varying sizes would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
How sensitive is SEMRes-DDPM to hyperparameter choices, particularly the number of denoising steps and network architecture parameters? The paper uses fixed hyperparameters without exploring sensitivity to these choices. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis showing performance variation with different hyperparameter values would resolve this question.

### Open Question 4
Can SEMRes-DDPM be extended to handle multi-class imbalanced datasets effectively, and how would the architecture need to be modified? The paper focuses on binary classification problems and doesn't address multi-class extension. Experimental results showing performance on multi-class imbalanced datasets would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- The core denoising advantage of SEMST-ResNet lacks independent verification through ablation studies comparing different architectural components
- Computational overhead versus simpler baselines is not quantified, making cost-effectiveness unclear
- The "soft thresholding" mechanism is described conceptually but not experimentally isolated

## Confidence
- High confidence: SEMRes-DDPM achieves superior F1, G-mean, and AUC scores compared to SMOTE, ADASYN, and TabDDPM on the tested datasets
- Medium confidence: The SEMST-ResNet architecture provides better denoising than MLP in tabular data contexts; this is shown in paper experiments but lacks external validation
- Low confidence: The claim that SEMST-ResNet "better identifies the data distribution in the form of memories" is abstract and lacks empirical grounding or comparison to alternative memory-based architectures

## Next Checks
1. Run an ablation study isolating residual connections, multi-head attention, and soft thresholding in the reverse network to quantify each component's contribution to denoising quality
2. Compare computational cost (training time, parameter count) of SEMST-ResNet against MLP and TabDDPM to assess practical tradeoffs
3. Validate synthetic data quality by training a classifier on synthetic samples alone and measuring generalization to real test data (train-on-synthetic, test-on-real setup)
