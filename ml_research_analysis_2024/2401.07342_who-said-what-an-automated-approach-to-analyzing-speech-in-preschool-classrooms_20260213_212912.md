# Who Said What? An Automated Approach to Analyzing Speech in Preschool Classrooms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.07342
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07342
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Automated framework achieved 76% speaker classification accuracy and 15% WER for preschool classroom speech analysis

## Executive Summary
This study developed an automated framework using ALICE for speaker classification and Whisper for transcription to analyze speech in noisy preschool classrooms. The framework was tested on 110 minutes of audio recordings from 4 children and 2 teachers. Speaker classification achieved 76% accuracy with a weighted F1 score of 0.76, while transcription accuracy (WER) was 15% for both teachers and children. The results demonstrate substantial progress in analyzing classroom speech, which could support research on children's language development.

## Method Summary
The study employed ALICE for speaker classification (child vs. teacher) and Whisper for speech transcription on audio recordings from preschool classrooms. Audio was preprocessed into 2-minute segments at 16kHz for ALICE and 44.1kHz for Whisper. The automated results were compared against human expert transcriptions and classifications using metrics including overall accuracy, Kappa, weighted F1, and Word Error Rate.

## Key Results
- Speaker classification accuracy: 76% overall, weighted F1 = 0.76
- Transcription accuracy: Word Error Rate = 0.15 for both teachers and children
- Speech feature reliability: Intraclass correlations ranging from 0.84-0.97 between automated and expert analyses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ALICE + Whisper + expert alignment yields high accuracy in speaker classification and transcription
- Mechanism: ALICE performs speaker classification using neural networks trained on audio features, Whisper transcribes speech using large-scale pre-trained models, and expert alignment synchronizes results by matching Whisper transcriptions with human labels, correcting for timing and segment duplication
- Core assumption: The expert speaker labels are sufficiently accurate to serve as ground truth for evaluating automated results
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The overall proportion of agreement, that is, the proportion of correctly classified teacher and child utterances, was .76, with an error-corrected kappa of .50 and a weighted F1 of .76"
  - [section] "ALICE produced the classification (teacher versus child) while Whisper transcription was used to align results with the expert transcription"
- Break condition: Expert labels contain systematic errors or the alignment process misattributes segments due to timing drift or Whisper segmentation differences

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: High intraclass correlation (.84-.97) between automated and expert speech features indicates robust feature extraction
- Mechanism: Speech features (MLU, questions, responses, lexical alignment) calculated from automated transcriptions closely match those from expert transcriptions because Whisper preserves enough lexical detail and timing for feature computation, even when individual word errors exist
- Core assumption: Feature-level reliability is less sensitive to transcription noise than word-level accuracy
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "intraclass correlations ranging from 0.84-0.97" and "the proportion of agreement between expert and Whisper on the occurrence of a question was .96 for both teachers and children"
- Break condition: Whisper systematically misidentifies utterance boundaries or introduces consistent lexical biases that affect feature calculation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Preprocessing (2-minute segmentation, frequency conversion) improves Whisper transcription accuracy
- Mechanism: Whisper performs better on shorter audio segments (reduces duplication errors) and at its native sampling rate (44.1 kHz), while ALICE requires 16 kHz input, so preprocessing optimizes each component for its constraints
- Core assumption: Whisper's error patterns are predictable and mitigatable through segmentation and preprocessing
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Building on our initial experiences with Whisper, we segmented audio into two-minute epochs before submitting them to Whisper. (Preliminary results using longer epochs yielded a higher error rate in which Whisper duplicated segments during audio that did not contain speech)"
- Break condition: Whisper's error patterns change with new data or preprocessing introduces information loss that degrades downstream classification

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Speaker diarization and classification
  - Why needed here: The framework must distinguish between teacher and child speech before analysis
  - Quick check question: What features does ALICE use to classify speakers as teacher vs. child?

- Concept: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) and word error rate
  - Why needed here: Whisper transcribes speech and WER quantifies transcription accuracy
  - Quick check question: How is WER calculated and what does a WER of 0.15 mean?

- Concept: Speech feature extraction and reliability metrics
  - Why needed here: Features like MLU, questions, and responses are the substantive outputs, and intraclass correlations measure their reliability
  - Quick check question: Why use intraclass correlation instead of simple correlation for feature reliability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data source (Sony recorders) -> Preprocessing (2 min segments, resampling) -> ALICE (speaker classification) -> Whisper (transcription) -> Alignment (expert-driven) -> Feature Analysis
- Critical path: Data → Preprocessing → ALICE → Whisper → Alignment → Feature Analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - ALICE accuracy vs. computational cost (neural networks)
  - Whisper transcription quality vs. preprocessing constraints (segmentation, sampling rate)
  - Expert alignment precision vs. scalability (manual effort)
- Failure signatures:
  - Low speaker classification accuracy → check ALICE training data and audio quality
  - High WER → check Whisper preprocessing and segmentation
  - Low feature reliability → check alignment quality and feature extraction logic
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run ALICE and Whisper on a small audio sample and compare outputs to expert labels for speaker classification accuracy
  2. Calculate WER between Whisper and expert transcriptions on teacher vs. child recordings separately
  3. Compute MLU and question rates from both automated and expert transcriptions to verify feature-level reliability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can speaker classification accuracy be improved for preschool classroom audio recordings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies speaker classification as an area requiring improvement, noting that while overall accuracy was 76%, it varied considerably between recordings and future research is planned to improve it using machine learning of Whisper transcriptions.
- Why unresolved: Current speaker classification relies on expert input, limiting scalability. The paper suggests machine learning approaches but doesn't specify which methods or architectures would be most effective.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing different machine learning approaches (CNNs, transformers, etc.) on the same classroom audio dataset, showing which achieves highest accuracy across varying recording conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal recording distance between speaker and microphone for accurate transcription in preschool classrooms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that transcription results were "relatively accurate but were limited to the teacher or child wearing the recorder," suggesting distance from microphone may be a crucial variable affecting accuracy.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't systematically investigate how transcription accuracy varies with physical distance between speakers and microphones in the classroom environment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental studies manipulating recording distances and measuring corresponding changes in word error rates for both teacher and child speech.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does automated semantic alignment analysis compare to expert semantic alignment analysis in preschool classroom interactions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that lexical alignment analysis showed discrepancies between automated and expert results, and suggests that "more sophisticated analyses of alignment–including semantic alignment based on meaning–are required."
- Why unresolved: Current automated methods rely on word overlap rather than meaning, potentially missing important aspects of semantic alignment that experts might capture.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies where both automated semantic analysis tools and human experts analyze the same classroom interactions, measuring agreement on semantic alignment features.

## Limitations
- 76% speaker classification accuracy and 15% WER still indicate room for improvement in noisy preschool environments
- Alignment process relies heavily on expert intervention, limiting scalability
- Small sample size (110 minutes from 6 speakers) may not capture full variability of preschool classroom dynamics
- Framework does not address handling of overlapping speech, common in preschool settings

## Confidence
- High confidence: Speech feature reliability (intraclass correlations 0.84-0.97)
- Medium confidence: Speaker classification accuracy (76% F1)
- Medium confidence: Transcription accuracy (15% WER)

## Next Checks
1. Test framework scalability by applying to full-day recordings (6+ hours) from multiple classrooms to evaluate performance degradation and computational requirements
2. Validate framework on recordings with overlapping speech to assess handling of simultaneous teacher-child interactions
3. Compare feature extraction reliability across different Whisper model sizes (base, small, medium) to determine if performance gains justify computational costs of large-v2 model
