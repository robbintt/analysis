# Distributed Inference on Mobile Edge and Cloud: A Data-Cartography based Clustering Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.16616
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16616
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: DIMEC-DC achieves over 43% cost reduction while maintaining less than 0.5% accuracy drop compared to cloud-only inference

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of deploying large deep neural networks (DNNs) across mobile, edge, and cloud devices by proposing DIMEC-DC, a distributed inference framework. The key innovation lies in using Data Cartography to assess the computational complexity of incoming samples, enabling intelligent allocation across heterogeneous devices. By classifying samples as easy, moderate, or hard based on confidence and variance across training epochs, DIMEC-DC optimizes resource usage and reduces costs while maintaining accuracy. Experiments on GLUE datasets demonstrate significant cost savings without compromising performance.

## Method Summary
DIMEC-DC leverages Data Cartography to determine sample complexity by analyzing confidence scores and variance during training epochs. Samples are classified into three categories: easy (processed on mobile), moderate (processed on edge), and hard (processed on cloud). This classification guides the allocation of computational tasks across devices, optimizing resource utilization and reducing costs. The framework is evaluated on GLUE datasets, showing over 43% cost reduction with less than 0.5% accuracy drop compared to cloud-only inference. It also demonstrates robustness to cost variations and outperforms baselines like Random, DeeBERT, AdaEE, and I-SplitEE.

## Key Results
- Over 43% cost reduction compared to cloud-only inference
- Less than 0.5% accuracy drop on GLUE datasets
- Outperforms baselines including Random, DeeBERT, AdaEE, and I-SplitEE

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DIMEC-DC works by leveraging Data Cartography to assess sample complexity through confidence and variance analysis across training epochs. This allows for intelligent classification of samples into easy, moderate, and hard categories, which are then allocated to mobile, edge, and cloud devices respectively. By optimizing the distribution of computational tasks based on sample complexity, the framework reduces costs while maintaining accuracy. The approach effectively balances resource utilization across heterogeneous devices.

## Foundational Learning
- Data Cartography: Analyzing training dynamics to assess sample complexity; needed for intelligent task allocation; quick check: verify consistency across different datasets.
- Sample Complexity Classification: Categorizing samples based on computational requirements; needed to optimize resource allocation; quick check: ensure classification accuracy.
- Distributed Inference: Deploying DNNs across multiple devices; needed for scalability and efficiency; quick check: validate latency and accuracy trade-offs.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Samples -> Data Cartography Analysis -> Sample Classification (Easy/Moderate/Hard) -> Device Allocation (Mobile/Edge/Cloud) -> Inference Execution

**Critical Path**: Input Samples → Data Cartography Analysis → Sample Classification → Device Allocation → Inference Execution

**Design Tradeoffs**: Balances cost reduction with accuracy maintenance; prioritizes resource optimization over uniform distribution; trade-off between computational load and latency.

**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent classification due to dataset variability; increased latency from network conditions; reduced accuracy from suboptimal device allocation.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate Data Cartography consistency across different DNN architectures.
2. Test sample classification accuracy under varying training conditions.
3. Evaluate device allocation efficiency in a controlled environment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on Data Cartography assumes consistent training dynamics across datasets and architectures.
- Evaluation confined to GLUE datasets limits generalizability to other domains or larger-scale models.
- Performance in dynamic scenarios with varying network conditions or device failures is not thoroughly explored.

## Confidence
- Cost reduction (43%): High
- Accuracy preservation (<0.5% drop): High
- Robustness to cost variations: Medium
- Superiority over baselines: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test DIMEC-DC on non-NLP datasets and larger-scale models (e.g., vision or multimodal tasks) to assess cross-domain applicability.
2. Conduct stress tests under varying network conditions (latency, bandwidth) and device failures to evaluate robustness in dynamic environments.
3. Perform an ablation study to isolate the contribution of Data Cartography versus other components (e.g., clustering strategy) to the framework's performance.
