# Enabling clustering algorithms to detect clusters of varying densities through scale-invariant data preprocessing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.11402
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11402
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: ARES preprocessing consistently outperforms min-max normalization and rank transformation for clustering varying-density data across different scales

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting clusters with varying densities in real-world datasets where features can be represented in different units or scales. The authors propose ARES (Average Rank over an Ensemble of Sub-samples), a preprocessing method that aggregates ranks computed from multiple data sub-samples. ARES makes clustering algorithms robust to changes in data representation while preserving density variations. Evaluated on seven real-world datasets using KMeans, DBSCAN, and Density Peak clustering algorithms, ARES consistently outperformed standard min-max normalization and traditional rank transformation, achieving better and more consistent F1-measure scores. Notably, ARES produced identical clustering results across different non-linear scalings of data, unlike baseline methods.

## Method Summary
ARES is a preprocessing method that computes rank transformations on multiple subsamples of the data and aggregates these ranks through averaging. For each feature, ARES draws t subsamples of size ψ from the dataset, computes ranks within each subsample, and then averages these ranks across all subsamples. This ensemble approach preserves local density information that might be lost when computing ranks over the entire dataset at once. The method requires O(nt log ψ) time complexity and is designed to be robust to changes in data scales and units while maintaining cluster structure. ARES was evaluated alongside min-max normalization and traditional rank transformation using three clustering algorithms (KMeans, DBSCAN, and Density Peak) on seven real-world datasets.

## Key Results
- ARES consistently outperformed standard min-max normalization and traditional rank transformation in F1-measure scores across all tested datasets
- DP clustering with ARES achieved perfect results on a synthetic dataset under various transformations
- ARES produced identical clustering results across different non-linear scalings of data, unlike baseline methods
- ARES maintained density information better than standard rank transformation by averaging ranks over multiple subsamples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ARES preserves density differences better than standard rank transformation by averaging ranks over multiple subsamples
- Mechanism: By computing ranks in multiple small subsamples and averaging them, ARES maintains relative ordering and density information that would be lost if ranks were computed over the full dataset at once
- Core assumption: Subsampling preserves local density structure while the ensemble average reduces variance and noise
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "ARES consistently outperformed standard min-max normalization and traditional rank transformation", [section] "Unlike using rank transformation in the entire dataset, which may mask existing clusters, aggregating ranks from multiple subsamples helps preserve clusters to some extent"
- Break condition: If subsamples are too small, density information is lost; if too large, the ensemble average provides little benefit over standard rank transformation

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ARES makes clustering results invariant to non-linear data scaling
- Mechanism: Rank-based transformations are inherently invariant to monotonic transformations; ARES extends this by ensuring that the rank aggregation process preserves this invariance across all data representations
- Core assumption: The order of data points is preserved under monotonic transformations, and ARES maintains this order structure
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "ARES produced identical clustering results across different non-linear scalings of data, unlike baseline methods", [section] "Like traditional rank transformation, ARES is robust to changes in scales and units of measurement"
- Break condition: If the data contains non-monotonic transformations or mixed scaling types, the invariance property may not hold

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ARES improves clustering quality by reducing the impact of scale differences across features
- Mechanism: By converting all features to rank space, ARES normalizes the scale differences, allowing clustering algorithms to focus on relative orderings rather than absolute values
- Core assumption: Clustering algorithms benefit from scale-invariant input, as they often assume features are on comparable scales
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "ARES consistently outperformed standard min-max normalization", [section] "Unlike normalisation and standardisation, which are sensitive to changes in data representation, ARES and Rank transformations are robust to such changes"
- Break condition: If features have meaningful absolute differences that should influence clustering, ARES may lose important information

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Rank transformation and its properties
  - Why needed here: Understanding how rank transformation works and its limitations is crucial for grasping why ARES is an improvement
  - Quick check question: What happens to the distribution of data when you apply standard rank transformation?

- Concept: Density-based clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, Density Peak)
  - Why needed here: These algorithms are sensitive to density variations, making them ideal test cases for ARES's ability to preserve density information
  - Quick check question: How does DBSCAN use density information to form clusters?

- Concept: Ensemble methods and their benefits
  - Why needed here: ARES uses an ensemble of subsamples to aggregate ranks, so understanding ensemble methods helps explain why this approach works
  - Quick check question: What are the benefits of using an ensemble approach in machine learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing pipeline -> ARES transformation module -> Clustering algorithm interface -> Evaluation metrics module
- Critical path: 1. Input data normalization (optional) 2. ARES transformation 3. Clustering algorithm execution 4. Result evaluation and comparison
- Design tradeoffs: Subsampling size vs. density preservation, Number of subsamples vs. computational cost, Rank aggregation method (mean vs. median vs. mode)
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent clustering results across different scalings, Loss of density information leading to merged clusters, High computational cost for large datasets
- First 3 experiments: 1. Compare ARES with standard rank transformation on a synthetic dataset with known density variations 2. Test ARES with different subsampling sizes to find the optimal balance between density preservation and computational cost 3. Evaluate ARES's performance on a real-world dataset with known clusters under different scaling transformations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity increases with the number of subsamples and subsample size, potentially limiting scalability for very large datasets
- Performance heavily depends on appropriate selection of subsample parameters (size and number), which may require dataset-specific tuning
- Limited evaluation on high-dimensional datasets, raising questions about effectiveness when features greatly outnumber instances

## Confidence
- ARES's ability to preserve density information: Medium confidence
- ARES's invariance to non-linear scaling: Medium confidence
- ARES's computational efficiency for large datasets: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test ARES on additional real-world datasets with known density variations to verify the invariance property across diverse data distributions
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the optimal subsample size and number for different data characteristics
3. Compare ARES's computational overhead against traditional preprocessing methods on datasets of varying sizes to assess scalability limitations
