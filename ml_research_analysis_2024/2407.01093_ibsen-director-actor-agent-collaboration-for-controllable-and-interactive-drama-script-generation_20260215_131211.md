# IBSEN: Director-Actor Agent Collaboration for Controllable and Interactive Drama Script Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.01093
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01093
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: IBSEN generates drama scripts with F1 score 0.77 for objective checking and storyline scores averaging 2.96-3.63

## Executive Summary
IBSEN introduces a director-actor agent framework for controllable drama script generation, addressing the challenge of maintaining plot coherence in multi-agent interactions. The system uses a hierarchical approach where a director agent generates plot outlines aligned with objectives, then instructs actor agents to role-play characters while maintaining consistency through memory systems. The framework successfully generates complete, diverse drama scripts from rough plot outlines while handling human player involvement through dynamic storyline adaptation.

## Method Summary
IBSEN employs a director-actor agent architecture where the director agent maintains centralized control over plot progression and objectives, while actor agents generate personalized responses based on character profiles and memory systems. The framework uses hierarchical generation, first creating plot outlines that adhere to objectives, then translating these into dialogue scripts. Actor agents utilize structured memory storage (Actor Profile, Memory Database, Character Database) with monologue-based interpretation to maintain character consistency. When human players participate, the director dynamically reschedules the plot to accommodate player actions while ensuring progression toward objectives. The system is prompt-based and implemented using GPT-3.5-turbo-1106 without requiring fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- F1 score of 0.77 for objective checking in drama script generation
- Storyline logicality: 2.96, coherence: 3.63, and character consistency: 2.77 (scale 1-4)
- Framework successfully generates complete drama scripts from rough plot outlines
- Handles human player involvement while maintaining plot progression

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Director agent maintains plot coherence by dynamically generating storylines aligned with predefined objectives
- Mechanism: The director agent uses hierarchical generation, first creating plot outlines that adhere to objectives, then translating these into dialogue scripts with speaking roles, ensuring the plot progresses systematically toward goals
- Core assumption: LLMs can generate coherent, objective-aligned storylines when provided with clear plot objectives and character context
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The director agent writes plot outlines that the user desires to see, instructs the actor agents to role-play their characters, and reschedules the plot when human players participate in the scenario to ensure the plot is progressing towards the objective"
  - [section 3.1.1]: "Director agent first writes a continuation story outline SG that adheres to the current plot objective G, then translates this plot outline SG into script format"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related works focus on script continuation but don't detail objective-based hierarchical generation
- Break condition: If the LLM fails to generate plot outlines that align with objectives, or if character context is insufficient to maintain coherence

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Actor agents generate personalized responses while maintaining character consistency through profile-based memory systems
- Mechanism: Actor agents use Actor Profile, Memory Database, and Character Database to store and retrieve character information, with monologue-based interpretation enhancing role-playing authenticity
- Core assumption: Structured memory systems with first-person narrative interpretation improve character consistency in LLM role-playing
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.1]: "Actor profile stores the basic information of the character... memory database stores the memory documents about the character's past events and perceptions, and character database stores the interpersonal relationships"
  - [section 3.2.1]: "we adopt a first-person narrative approach called 'monologue', allowing the actor agent to interpret the content stored in the document from the perspective and voice of the character"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related works discuss memory systems but not specifically monologue-based interpretation
- Break condition: If the memory retrieval system fails to provide relevant information, or if monologue interpretation doesn't enhance character authenticity

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: IBSEN framework enables human player involvement while maintaining plot progression through dynamic storyline adaptation
- Mechanism: When players act out-of-script, the director agent immediately regenerates storylines to accommodate player actions while attempting to reach plot objectives
- Core assumption: LLMs can dynamically adapt storylines in real-time to incorporate unpredictable human player actions while maintaining plot coherence
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The director agent writes plot outlines that the user desires to see, instructs the actor agents to role-play their characters, and reschedules the plot when human players participate in the scenario to ensure the plot is progressing towards the objective"
  - [section 3.3]: "The director needs to dynamically adjust the plot to accommodate player actions while maintaining the development of the storyline"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related works discuss interactive drama but not specifically dynamic adaptation to human player actions
- Break condition: If the director agent cannot generate coherent storylines quickly enough to maintain plot progression, or if player actions consistently derail plot objectives

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hierarchical story generation
  - Why needed here: IBSEN uses hierarchical generation to maintain plot coherence across multiple objectives, first generating outlines then detailed scripts
  - Quick check question: What are the two main stages of hierarchical generation in IBSEN, and why is this approach beneficial for maintaining plot coherence?

- Concept: Memory systems for LLM agents
  - Why needed here: IBSEN uses structured memory systems (Actor Profile, Memory Database, Character Database) to maintain character consistency across interactions
  - Quick check question: What are the three types of memory storage in IBSEN, and how does each contribute to character consistency?

- Concept: Dynamic plot adaptation
  - Why needed here: IBSEN must adapt to human player actions while maintaining plot progression, requiring real-time storyline regeneration
  - Quick check question: How does IBSEN handle player actions that deviate from the script, and what mechanisms ensure the plot still progresses toward objectives?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Director agent (centralized): generates storylines, instructs actors, checks objectives
  - Actor agents (distributed): generate personalized responses, maintain character profiles and memories
  - Player agent (optional): human-controlled character that can interact with the scene
  - Memory systems: Actor Profile, Memory Database, Character Database

- Critical path: Director generates storyline → translates to script → instructs actor → actor generates response → director checks objective completion

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Centralized vs. distributed control: Director provides control but may limit actor autonomy
  - Script fidelity vs. improvisation: Strict adherence to script may reduce naturalness, while too much freedom may lose coherence
  - Memory complexity vs. retrieval efficiency: More detailed memories improve consistency but may slow retrieval

- Failure signatures:
  - Objective completion failures: Director cannot generate storylines that reach plot objectives
  - Character inconsistency: Actor responses don't match character profiles or memories
  - Plot derailment: Player actions consistently prevent objective completion

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test director agent's ability to generate coherent storylines from plot objectives without actor involvement
  2. Test actor agent's ability to generate character-consistent responses with and without director instructions
  3. Test IBSEN's ability to handle player involvement in simple scenarios before testing with complex drama scripts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the IBSEN framework perform when implemented with different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5) in terms of storyline quality and character consistency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that IBSEN can be implemented on other LLMs besides GPT-3.5 and that different LLMs would influence the style and quality of generated storylines and dialogues. It also notes that on the more capable gpt-4-turbo, IBSEN becomes more chatty and has fewer hallucinations, but problems like being too positive still exist.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides a brief comparison between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4-turbo, but does not conduct a comprehensive evaluation of IBSEN's performance across different LLMs. A more detailed analysis of the impact of various LLMs on IBSEN's performance would provide valuable insights into the framework's versatility and limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic evaluation of IBSEN using multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and other state-of-the-art models, with a focus on storyline quality, character consistency, and other relevant metrics. The evaluation should also consider the impact of different LLM capabilities on the framework's performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the IBSEN framework handle complex moral and ethical dilemmas in the storylines, especially when the characters have conflicting values or interests?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that IBSEN tends to develop the plot with more upright ethical concepts, even when the characters have moral flaws or engage in unethical behavior. This suggests that the framework may have difficulty handling complex moral and ethical dilemmas in the storylines.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how IBSEN handles moral and ethical dilemmas in the storylines. It is unclear whether the framework can effectively represent the complexity of moral conflicts and the nuances of characters' ethical choices.
- What evidence would resolve it: A thorough examination of IBSEN's performance in handling storylines with complex moral and ethical dilemmas, including scenarios where characters have conflicting values or interests. The evaluation should assess the framework's ability to represent the complexity of moral conflicts and the nuances of characters' ethical choices.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the IBSEN framework be extended to handle more dynamic and interactive storylines, where the plot can branch based on the actions and decisions of the characters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the IBSEN framework can be extended to broader application cases, especially agent-based interactive games that contain specialized plot objectives. It also notes that the framework can allow human players to participate in the plot and interact with the characters.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests the potential for IBSEN to handle more dynamic and interactive storylines, it does not provide a detailed discussion of how this can be achieved. It is unclear how the framework can manage the complexity of branching storylines and the impact of characters' actions and decisions on the plot.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the IBSEN framework's capabilities and limitations in handling dynamic and interactive storylines. This should include a discussion of the technical challenges involved in managing branching storylines and the impact of characters' actions and decisions on the plot. The analysis should also propose potential solutions and extensions to the framework to address these challenges.

## Limitations
- Lack of ablation studies to quantify the impact of specific components like monologue interpretation and memory systems
- Limited scope of test scenarios focusing primarily on Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" may not capture generalizability to other dramatic styles
- No runtime performance metrics provided for real-time human interaction scenarios

## Confidence
- **High**: Director-agent collaboration mechanism and hierarchical generation approach
- **Medium**: Evaluation results and storyline quality scores due to limited test scenarios
- **Low**: Scalability analysis for larger casts and more complex plots

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the monologue interpretation and memory system components to quantify their individual contributions to character consistency scores
2. Test IBSEN with human participants in unscripted scenarios to measure real-time adaptation performance and identify failure modes
3. Expand the evaluation to include multiple dramatic genres and complex character relationships to assess generalizability beyond the Hedda Gabler scenario
