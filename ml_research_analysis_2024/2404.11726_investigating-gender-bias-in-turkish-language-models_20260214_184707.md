# Investigating Gender Bias in Turkish Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.11726
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11726
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Monolingual Turkish models exhibit less gender bias than multilingual ones

## Executive Summary
This study investigates gender and ethnic bias in Turkish language models, addressing a significant gap in research focusing on non-English languages. The authors build upon existing bias evaluation frameworks and extend them to Turkish by translating English tests and creating new ones tailored to the Turkish context. They evaluate various Turkish language models, including monolingual and multilingual BERT and mT5 variants, on gender and Kurdish ethnic bias. The study reveals that monolingual models tend to exhibit less bias than multilingual ones, with larger models showing stronger biases. Sentence-level tests generally elicit more biased associations than word-level tests. The authors make their Turkish gender bias dataset publicly available, contributing valuable resources to the research community.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comprehensive approach to evaluate gender and ethnic bias in Turkish language models. The authors first review existing bias evaluation frameworks, particularly those developed for English language models. They then translate these frameworks into Turkish and create additional tests specifically designed for the Turkish context. The evaluation encompasses various Turkish language models, including monolingual and multilingual BERT variants, as well as mT5 models. Bias is assessed at both word and sentence levels, examining gender associations and ethnic bias towards Kurdish people. The study also investigates the impact of model size on bias levels. The authors make their Turkish gender bias dataset publicly available to support further research in this area.

## Key Results
- Monolingual Turkish models exhibit less gender bias than multilingual models
- Larger language models show stronger biases
- Sentence-level bias tests elicit more biased associations than word-level tests

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's approach works by adapting existing bias evaluation frameworks to the Turkish language context. By translating English tests and creating new ones tailored to Turkish culture and linguistics, the authors can effectively measure bias in Turkish language models. The comparison between monolingual and multilingual models, as well as models of different sizes, provides insights into how model architecture and training data influence bias. Sentence-level tests are more effective at eliciting biased associations because they provide richer contextual information, allowing models to make more nuanced associations between words and concepts.

## Foundational Learning
- Bias evaluation frameworks: These are needed to systematically measure and compare bias across different language models. Quick check: Ensure the framework covers various types of bias (gender, ethnic, etc.) and can be adapted to different languages.
- Language model architectures: Understanding BERT and mT5 architectures is crucial for interpreting results and comparing model behaviors. Quick check: Review the key differences between monolingual and multilingual versions of these models.
- Turkish linguistics: Knowledge of Turkish language features and cultural context is essential for creating accurate and relevant bias tests. Quick check: Consult with native Turkish speakers to validate test translations and cultural appropriateness.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Turkish language models (monolingual BERT, multilingual BERT, mT5) -> Bias evaluation framework (translated English tests + Turkish-specific tests) -> Bias measurement (word-level and sentence-level tests)
Critical path: Pretrained model selection -> Bias test translation/creation -> Model evaluation on bias tests -> Results analysis and comparison
Design tradeoffs: Using translated English tests ensures comparability with existing research but may miss Turkish-specific nuances. Creating new tests addresses this but reduces cross-linguistic comparability.
Failure signatures: If monolingual models show higher bias than multilingual ones, it may indicate issues with test translation or Turkish-specific cultural factors. Unexpectedly low bias in large models could suggest insufficient training data diversity.
First experiments: 1) Evaluate bias in a small monolingual BERT model, 2) Compare bias levels between Turkish and English versions of the same model, 3) Test the impact of sentence complexity on bias elicitation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on translated English tests may not fully capture Turkish linguistic nuances
- Focus on gender and Kurdish ethnic bias may overlook other important bias dimensions
- Limited evaluation to specific Turkish language models may not generalize to all models trained on Turkish data

## Confidence
- Monolingual models exhibit less bias than multilingual ones: High confidence
- Larger models show stronger biases: Medium confidence
- Sentence-level tests elicit more biased associations than word-level tests: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a qualitative analysis of translated test sets with native Turkish speakers to validate cultural and linguistic appropriateness
2. Expand evaluation to include a broader range of Turkish language models trained on different data sources and time periods
3. Develop and test additional bias evaluation frameworks specifically designed for Turkish language and culture
