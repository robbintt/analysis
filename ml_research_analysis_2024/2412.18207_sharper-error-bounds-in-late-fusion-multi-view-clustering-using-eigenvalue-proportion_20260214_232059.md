# Sharper Error Bounds in Late Fusion Multi-view Clustering Using Eigenvalue Proportion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.18207
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18207
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Achieves O(1/n) convergence rate in multiple kernel k-means via local Rademacher complexity and principal eigenvalue proportion

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses multi-view clustering by proposing a novel generalization error bound analysis for multiple kernel k-means using local Rademacher complexity and principal eigenvalue proportions. The theoretical analysis achieves a convergence rate of O(1/n), significantly improving upon existing bounds. Based on this theoretical insight, the authors develop a low-pass graph filtering strategy within a multiple linear k-means framework to mitigate noise and redundancy in base partitions, thereby enhancing the principal eigenvalue proportion and clustering accuracy. Experimental results on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art late fusion multi-view clustering methods across accuracy, normalized mutual information, and adjusted rand index metrics.

## Method Summary
The method employs a three-step alternating optimization procedure to solve for consensus partition Y, kernel weights γ, and graph filter coefficients μ. Base partitions are first generated using kernel k-means for each view, then enhanced through low-pass graph filtering that smooths high-frequency noise while preserving cluster structure. The graph filter is built using neighborhood graphs with learned combination weights, and the final clustering is obtained through multiple linear k-means optimization. The approach leverages the relationship between principal eigenvalue proportion and generalization bounds to achieve both theoretical and practical improvements in clustering performance.

## Key Results
- Achieves convergence rate of O(1/n) compared to existing O(√k/n) bounds
- Outperforms state-of-the-art late fusion methods on ten benchmark datasets
- Successfully demonstrates that graph filtering increases principal eigenvalue proportion, improving clustering accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The convergence rate improves from O(√k/n) to O(1/n) by leveraging local Rademacher complexity with principal eigenvalue proportion (PEP). By bounding the local Rademacher complexity using the ratio of leading eigenvalues to the rest, the effective complexity of the hypothesis space shrinks, tightening the generalization error bound. This assumes the data's kernel matrices exhibit sufficient PEP, meaning most variance is captured by the leading eigenvalues.

### Mechanism 2
Low-pass graph filtering increases PEP by smoothing base partitions and concentrating eigenvalue mass. The graph filter suppresses high-frequency noise in the base partition embeddings, effectively reducing redundancy and enhancing the alignment between leading eigenvectors and cluster structure. This assumes the base partitions contain redundant or noisy features that can be denoised via graph-based smoothing without losing discriminative information.

### Mechanism 3
The alternating optimization guarantees monotonic improvement of the objective and convergence. Each subproblem (Y, γ, μ) is solved optimally while others are fixed, ensuring the objective does not increase in any step, thus converging to a stationary point. This assumes each subproblem has a closed-form or efficiently solvable solution and the objective is lower bounded.

## Foundational Learning

- **Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)**: Needed because MKKM operates in RKHS to handle nonlinear structure via kernel embeddings. Quick check: What property of RKHS allows us to use kernel matrices directly in K-means?
- **Rademacher Complexity**: Needed because it measures the richness of the hypothesis class to bound generalization error. Quick check: How does local Rademacher complexity differ from global in terms of dependence on sample size?
- **Principal Eigenvalue Proportion (PEP)**: Needed because PEP quantifies how much variance is captured by leading eigenvalues, directly affecting generalization bounds. Quick check: What happens to the convergence rate if PEP approaches zero?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Base partition generator (kernel K-means per view) -> Graph filter builder (per view affinity + learned combination) -> Multiple linear K-means optimizer (alternating updates for Y, γ, μ) -> Evaluation pipeline (ACC/NMI/ARI on benchmark datasets)
- **Critical path**: 1. Generate base partitions -> 2. Build and combine graph filters -> 3. Run alternating optimization -> 4. Output discrete labels
- **Design tradeoffs**: Fixed vs. learned graph filter coefficients (flexibility vs. complexity), choice of hop size o in low-pass filter (locality vs. smoothing strength), number of base kernels m (coverage vs. overfitting risk)
- **Failure signatures**: Slow or stalled convergence (check subproblems solvability), degraded clustering after filtering (verify graph structure quality), no improvement over baselines (check PEP increase and bound tightness)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Compare ACC/NMI/ARI with and without graph filtering on JAFFE to verify PEP gain. 2. Sweep the filter order o and observe effect on convergence and clustering quality. 3. Measure eigenvalue distribution before/after filtering to quantify PEP improvement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the theoretical convergence rate of O(1/n) for multiple kernel k-means translate to practical performance gains across diverse real-world datasets with varying cluster structures and noise levels? The paper establishes this convergence rate but does not provide systematic experiments showing how this theoretical improvement manifests across datasets with different characteristics.

### Open Question 2
What is the relationship between the optimal order of the low-pass graph filter (parameter o) and the intrinsic dimensionality or manifold properties of the data in multi-view clustering? The paper fixes the neighborhood size without analyzing how this parameter should be chosen based on data characteristics.

### Open Question 3
How does the graph filter-enhanced approach affect the principal eigenvalue proportion (PEP) across different kernel types and data distributions, and what are the theoretical guarantees for PEP improvement? While the paper suggests graph filtering should improve PEP, it does not establish theoretical bounds on the achievable PEP improvement.

## Limitations
- Core theoretical improvement relies heavily on high principal eigenvalue proportion, which may not hold for all datasets
- Effectiveness of graph filtering depends on quality of base partitions and graph structure
- Implementation details for critical components are partially referenced from external sources

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Alternating optimization convergence proof and basic clustering framework
- **Medium confidence**: Theoretical bound improvement claims (limited corpus support)
- **Low confidence**: Graph filtering mechanism effectiveness (weak corpus evidence)

## Next Checks

1. Verify PEP improvement empirically by measuring eigenvalue distributions before and after graph filtering on multiple datasets.
2. Test convergence rate empirically by comparing learning curves with theoretical O(1/n) prediction across varying sample sizes.
3. Conduct ablation studies removing graph filtering to quantify its specific contribution to clustering performance.
