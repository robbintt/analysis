# From Summary to Action: Enhancing Large Language Models for Complex Tasks with Open World APIs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.18157
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18157
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Sum2Act achieves 70.0% pass rate and 67.8% win rate against ReAct-CoT on ToolBench benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Sum2Act, a novel tool invocation pipeline that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex real-world tasks by enabling them to summarize achieved results and determine the next course of action. The pipeline addresses the challenge of managing lengthy contexts in LLMs by incorporating a state manager that summarizes historical information at each step, maintaining a clear understanding of the task state. Empirical evaluations on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrate significant performance improvements, with Sum2Act outperforming established methods like ReAct and DFSDT.

## Method Summary
Sum2Act introduces a state manager component that continuously summarizes historical information at each step of the task execution process. The framework integrates this summarization capability with API calling mechanisms to enable LLMs to handle complex, long-horizon tasks in open-world environments. The state manager maintains a compressed representation of task progress, allowing the model to make informed decisions about subsequent API calls without being overwhelmed by excessive context. This approach enables more efficient reasoning about what actions have been completed and what remains to be done.

## Key Results
- Achieves 70.0% pass rate on ToolBench benchmark
- Demonstrates 67.8% win rate against ReAct-CoT baseline
- Outperforms established methods like ReAct and DFSDT in tool invocation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by continuously summarizing the task state, which reduces cognitive load on the LLM and prevents context window overflow issues. By maintaining a compressed representation of historical information, the model can focus on immediate decision-making while preserving awareness of the overall task progress. This summarization approach enables better long-term planning and reduces the likelihood of redundant or contradictory API calls, as the model maintains a coherent understanding of what has been accomplished and what remains to be done.

## Foundational Learning
- **State management**: The process of tracking and maintaining task progress information throughout execution. Why needed: Essential for handling long-horizon tasks without losing context. Quick check: Verify the state accurately reflects completed actions and remaining objectives.
- **Context summarization**: Techniques for compressing historical information into concise representations. Why needed: Prevents context window overflow and improves decision efficiency. Quick check: Ensure summaries capture essential information without losing critical details.
- **API calling patterns**: Understanding when and how to invoke external tools or functions. Why needed: Core capability for interacting with real-world systems. Quick check: Validate API calls produce expected outputs and advance task progress.
- **Long-horizon reasoning**: Ability to maintain coherent task understanding across extended sequences of actions. Why needed: Critical for complex multi-step tasks. Quick check: Verify consistency of decisions across the entire task lifecycle.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Task -> State Manager -> LLM Reasoning -> API Call Generator -> API Execution -> Result Processor -> State Update -> Repeat

**Critical Path:** State Manager -> LLM Reasoning -> API Call Generation -> API Execution

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades some precision in historical detail for improved reasoning efficiency and reduced computational overhead. The summarization approach may occasionally lose nuanced context, but this is offset by the ability to handle significantly longer tasks without context window limitations.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation when summaries fail to capture critical dependencies between API calls, leading to redundant or contradictory actions. The system may struggle with tasks requiring detailed recall of earlier steps where the summarization loses important contextual information.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Compare pass rates on simple sequential tasks with and without the state manager to quantify its impact on basic functionality
2. Test performance on tasks with varying API call depths to evaluate scaling properties
3. Evaluate robustness by introducing API failures and measuring recovery capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focused on a single benchmark (ToolBench), raising generalizability concerns
- Absence of ablation studies to isolate the state manager's specific contribution
- Reliance on effective summarization quality introduces uncertainty in edge cases with subtle or complex context

## Confidence
- High confidence: The general approach of using summarization to manage context is sound and technically feasible
- Medium confidence: Performance improvements on ToolBench are demonstrated but may not translate directly to other domains
- Medium confidence: The state manager effectively reduces context length while maintaining task coherence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing Sum2Act with and without the state manager component to quantify its specific contribution to performance gains
2. Test the framework across multiple benchmarks with varying API complexities and failure scenarios to assess generalizability
3. Evaluate performance on tasks requiring nuanced understanding of API call relationships and implicit dependencies beyond simple sequential reasoning
