# Generalist Multimodal AI: A Review of Architectures, Challenges and Opportunities

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.05496
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05496
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces a novel taxonomy for Generalist Multimodal Models (GMMs) based on Unifiability, Modularity, and Adaptability

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive review and taxonomy of Generalist Multimodal Models (GMMs), which aim to unify learning across multiple data modalities using a single architecture. The authors introduce a novel classification system based on three key factors: Unifiability, Modularity, and Adaptability. Unifiability focuses on encoding inputs and outputs in a common representation space, Modularity involves building models with interchangeable components, and Adaptability is achieved through effective training objectives, instruction tuning, and scaling. The paper highlights critical challenges including data deficiency in novel modalities, weak multimodal evaluation, and the need for better uncertainty quantification, while identifying future opportunities such as expanding modalities, multimodal prompting, and leveraging human-model interaction.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic review of existing GMMs, analyzing their architectures, training configurations, and capabilities. The authors select and analyze a set of GMMs that work beyond text and vision modalities, classifying them according to the proposed taxonomy of Unifiability, Modularity, and Adaptability. The review synthesizes findings to identify common patterns, unique design choices, and critical challenges in GMM development, while proposing future research directions for advancing the field.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Unifiability improves generalization across modalities by forcing all inputs and outputs into a shared discrete token space, enabling joint training without task-specific heads.
- **Mechanism**: By representing every modality as sequences of discrete tokens, the model learns a common semantic space. This shared space allows cross-modal attention and transfer learning, as the model treats all modalities uniformly during pretraining.
- **Core assumption**: A single encoder/decoder architecture can effectively map heterogeneous data types into a coherent discrete vocabulary without catastrophic loss of modality-specific nuance.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "Unifiability focuses on encoding inputs and outputs in a common representation space, achieved through strategies like Input-Output sequencing and Homogenized encoding." [section] "Unifiability eliminates the gap due to task-specific formulations and encourages better collaborative learning between various tasks and modalities."
- **Break condition**: If discrete tokenization loses too much modality-specific information, the unified model's performance will degrade compared to modality-specific baselines.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Modularity enables flexible adaptation to new modalities and tasks by allowing independent development and swapping of encoder, backbone, and decoder modules without retraining the entire system.
- **Mechanism**: Separate, interchangeable components can be mixed and matched. Training configurations can be varied (frozen vs. trainable components) to optimize for new use cases.
- **Core assumption**: The interfaces between modules are stable and well-defined, so that swapping one component does not break the integration with the universal backbone or decoder.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section] "Modularity refers to the principle of building multicomponent model architectures designed for diverse functionality... Each module is designed to perform a specific function or task and can be combined with other modules in several ways to create different configurations or functionalities." [section] "This idea is primarily introduced by MPLUG-2 [93], which employs shared universal modules... and modality-specific components to tackle the problem of modality/task entanglement."
- **Break condition**: If module interfaces are not sufficiently standardized, swapping components can introduce subtle mismatches in data representation or loss functions, leading to degraded performance or training instability.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Adaptability through instruction tuning and scaling allows GMMs to generalize to unseen tasks and modalities with minimal additional data, leveraging large-scale pretraining and instruction-based task specification.
- **Mechanism**: Models are pretrained on broad, diverse datasets with general objectives. Instruction tuning then teaches the model to interpret and execute new tasks specified via natural language, while scaling up parameters and data improves zero-shot and few-shot performance.
- **Core assumption**: The model's pretraining objective and architecture are sufficiently general that fine-tuning on a small set of instruction-annotated examples can bridge the gap to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "Adaptability is achieved through effective training objectives, instruction tuning, and scaling to enhance the model's ability to generalize to new tasks." [section] "OFA [84] is a classic example where instruction-based learning is used for enhancing adaptability... The model is provided with a set of instructions during fine-tuning that guide its behavior and decision-making process."
- **Break condition**: If the model is too specialized during pretraining, instruction tuning may not be sufficient to generalize to truly novel tasks or modalities, especially those far outside the pretraining distribution.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Discrete tokenization of multimodal inputs
  - **Why needed here**: GMMs require a unified input representation space; tokenization converts heterogeneous data into a common discrete format the model can process.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you describe how an image patch sequence is converted into discrete tokens in CLIP, and how that differs from tokenizing text?

- **Concept**: Cross-modal attention mechanisms
  - **Why needed here**: GMMs must reason across modalities; cross-modal attention allows the model to attend to relevant parts of one modality conditioned on another.
  - **Quick check question**: How does cross-attention in a transformer decoder differ from self-attention in terms of modality interaction?

- **Concept**: Instruction-based task specification
  - **Why needed here**: Adaptability relies on the model understanding new tasks via natural language; instruction tuning teaches the model to map instructions to task execution without task-specific architectural changes.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the difference between handcrafted instructions and learnable prompts in fine-tuning GMMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw multimodal data → tokenization → unified embedding → shared transformer backbone → task-specific output
- **Critical path**: Raw multimodal data → tokenization → unified embedding → shared transformer backbone → task-specific output
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Unifiability vs. modality fidelity: Forcing all modalities into one token space may lose modality-specific nuance
  - Modularity vs. integration complexity: More modules increase flexibility but require stable interfaces and increase engineering overhead
  - Adaptability vs. pretraining cost: Broader pretraining improves generalization but is expensive; instruction tuning is cheaper but may not suffice for highly novel tasks
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor cross-modal retrieval or alignment → check tokenization and projection modules
  - Degraded performance on specific modalities → check encoder specialization and loss weighting
  - Inability to generalize to new tasks → check instruction tuning data quality and task specification clarity
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Cross-modal retrieval baseline**: Implement a simple CLIP-style model to verify tokenization and alignment work before adding universal backbone
  2. **Modality swap test**: Replace one encoder (e.g., vision) with a different pretrained one to test modularity and interface stability
  3. **Instruction generalization probe**: Fine-tune on a small set of instruction-annotated examples for a new task and evaluate zero-shot performance on related tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can the performance of generalist multimodal models be improved when scaling up to handle larger numbers of modalities and tasks?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper mentions that most GMMs have not been studied under large scale and suggests this prevents exploiting emerging abilities.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide concrete experimental evidence or specific architectural changes needed to improve performance at scale.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Empirical studies comparing performance of GMMs as they scale to larger numbers of modalities and tasks, identifying bottlenecks and potential solutions.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What are the most effective methods for aligning embeddings from modality-specific encoders to a common representation space in generalist multimodal models?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenge of misaligned modality encodings and the need for better alignment mechanisms.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide a definitive answer on the best alignment methods, only mentioning some approaches like ImageBind.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative studies evaluating different alignment techniques on multiple modalities and tasks, identifying the most effective approaches.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How can uncertainty quantification be effectively implemented in generalist multimodal models to ensure trustworthiness in safety-critical applications?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper highlights the absence of multimodal trust frameworks and the need for uncertainty quantification tools.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide specific solutions or frameworks for uncertainty quantification in GMMs beyond mentioning the need for such tools.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Development and evaluation of uncertainty quantification methods specifically designed for GMMs, demonstrating their effectiveness in safety-critical applications.

## Limitations
- Claims are primarily conceptual rather than empirically validated, with limited direct citations supporting specific claims
- Analysis lacks quantitative evidence or case studies of failures, remaining somewhat generic
- Does not address critical issues such as computational efficiency, energy consumption, or privacy implications of GMMs

## Confidence
- Unifiability mechanism claims: **Medium** - well-reasoned but lacks empirical validation
- Modularity claims: **Medium** - conceptually sound but limited real-world examples
- Adaptability claims: **Medium** - supported by general literature but not GMM-specific evidence

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-modal alignment experiment**: Implement a simple GMM with discrete tokenization and measure cross-modal retrieval performance across multiple modality pairs to validate unifiability claims
2. **Modularity stress test**: Create two GMM variants with different encoder combinations and quantify performance changes to assess module interface stability
3. **Instruction generalization benchmark**: Fine-tune a GMM on instruction-annotated data and evaluate zero-shot performance on a diverse set of novel tasks to test adaptability limits
