# RIME: Robust Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Noisy Preferences

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2402.17257
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17257
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** RIME introduces a denoising discriminator with dynamic filtering and warm-start mechanism, achieving superior robustness in PbRL under high noise levels (up to 30%), especially in high-noise regimes.

## Executive Summary
RIME (Robust Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Noisy Preferences) addresses the challenge of preference noise in PbRL by introducing a denoising discriminator that dynamically filters corrupted preferences using a KL divergence threshold with an uncertainty term. The method also employs a warm-start mechanism that initializes the reward model with intrinsic rewards to reduce accumulated errors during online training. Extensive experiments demonstrate RIME's superior performance over state-of-the-art PbRL methods across various robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks, particularly under high noise conditions (up to 30% error rates).

## Method Summary
RIME tackles the robustness issue in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) under noisy preference feedback through two key innovations. First, it introduces a denoising discriminator that dynamically filters corrupted preferences using a KL divergence threshold, augmented with an uncertainty term to handle distribution shifts. Second, it implements a warm-start mechanism that initializes the reward model with intrinsic rewards to bridge the pre-training-to-online-training gap and reduce accumulated errors. The method combines these components to maintain stable learning performance even under significant preference noise, with the KL divergence threshold dynamically adjusted based on the discriminator's uncertainty about preference predictions.

## Key Results
- RIME significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PbRL methods under varying error rates, with the strongest gains in high-noise regimes (up to 30% noise)
- The method demonstrates robust performance across different teacher types and with real non-expert human feedback
- Ablation studies confirm that both the denoising discriminator and warm start mechanisms are critical to RIME's performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RIME works by addressing the fundamental challenge of noisy preferences in reinforcement learning through dynamic filtering and robust initialization. The denoising discriminator acts as a quality gate, using KL divergence to measure the difference between current and historical preference distributions, while the uncertainty term accounts for potential distribution shifts. This allows the system to adaptively filter out corrupted preferences rather than treating all feedback equally. The warm-start mechanism provides a stable initial reward signal that reduces the impact of early-stage noise and helps the system recover more quickly from corrupted preferences during online learning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL):** Learning from pairwise comparisons rather than explicit reward signals. Needed to understand the problem domain where explicit reward functions are unavailable. Quick check: Can the agent learn from "A is better than B" feedback.
- **Denoising Techniques:** Methods to filter corrupted or noisy data during learning. Needed to handle the core challenge of noisy preference feedback. Quick check: Can the system identify and downweight corrupted preferences.
- **KL Divergence:** A measure of difference between probability distributions. Needed to quantify the discrepancy between expected and observed preference distributions. Quick check: Does KL divergence effectively capture preference distribution shifts.
- **Warm-start Initialization:** Starting learning from a pre-trained or heuristic-based model. Needed to provide stable initial conditions and reduce error accumulation. Quick check: Does initialization improve early learning stability.
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Methods to estimate confidence in model predictions. Needed to handle distribution shifts and adapt filtering thresholds. Quick check: Can the system estimate when its preference predictions are unreliable.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Environment -> Preference Generator -> Denoising Discriminator -> Reward Model -> Agent -> Experience Buffer

**Critical Path:** The core learning loop flows from preference feedback through the denoising discriminator, which filters and weights preferences before updating the reward model. The reward model then guides the agent's policy updates. The warm-start mechanism initializes the reward model before online learning begins.

**Design Tradeoffs:** RIME trades computational overhead (running KL divergence calculations and uncertainty estimation) for improved robustness to noise. The dynamic threshold adjustment balances between being too permissive (accepting corrupted preferences) and too restrictive (discarding useful feedback).

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation occurs when noise levels exceed the discriminator's filtering capacity, when the KL divergence threshold is poorly calibrated, or when the warm-start initialization is insufficient for the task complexity.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test baseline PbRL performance under varying noise levels without denoising. 2) Evaluate the denoising discriminator's ability to filter known corrupted preferences. 3) Compare warm-start versus random initialization under noisy conditions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the limitations section suggests areas for future work including testing under non-Gaussian noise distributions and evaluating with a broader range of teacher behaviors.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes Gaussian noise on preference labels, which may not capture all real-world noise patterns
- Performance gap between RIME and baselines narrows in low-noise settings (e.g., 10% error rate)
- Evaluation is limited to a finite set of noise models and teacher behaviors

## Confidence

**High confidence in:**
- Empirical results and performance claims under tested noise conditions
- The effectiveness of both denoising discriminator and warm-start mechanisms

**Medium confidence in:**
- Theoretical guarantees given noise assumptions
- Generalization claims across teacher types based on current evaluation scope

## Next Checks
1. Test RIME's performance under non-Gaussian noise distributions (e.g., adversarial, bursty noise) to validate robustness beyond the assumed noise model
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of KL divergence threshold versus uncertainty term in the denoising discriminator
3. Evaluate RIME with a broader range of teacher behaviors, including teachers with systematic biases or varying expertise levels, to further validate generalization claims
