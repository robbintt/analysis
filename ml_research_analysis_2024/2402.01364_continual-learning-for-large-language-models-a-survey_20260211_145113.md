# Continual Learning for Large Language Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.01364
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01364
- Reference count: 8
- This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of continual learning for large language models (LLMs), focusing on the unique multi-stage training paradigm of LLMs.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first comprehensive overview of continual learning techniques specifically designed for large language models. It introduces a novel three-stage taxonomy encompassing continual pretraining (CPT), continual instruction tuning (CIT), and continual alignment (CA), each addressing different aspects of LLM adaptation. The work highlights the unique challenges posed by LLMs' multi-stage training paradigm and introduces metrics to evaluate cross-stage forgetting, a critical concern in this domain.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing continual learning methods for LLMs by categorizing them into three distinct stages based on their position in the LLM training pipeline. For each stage, the survey identifies specific challenges and corresponding methodological approaches. The authors introduce novel evaluation metrics including Forward Transfer Rate, Backward Transfer Rate, and Safety Delta to assess model performance across stages. They also discuss relevant benchmarks such as TemporalWiki, CITB, and COPF that can be used to evaluate continual learning methods.

## Key Results
- Introduces first comprehensive taxonomy of continual learning methods for LLMs across three stages: CPT, CIT, and CA
- Proposes novel metrics (Forward Transfer Rate, Backward Transfer Rate, Safety Delta) to evaluate cross-stage forgetting
- Identifies cross-stage forgetting as a critical challenge requiring multi-stage adaptation strategies
- Discusses importance of balancing computational efficiency with model performance
- Highlights future directions including controllable forgetting, social responsibility, and automatic continual learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by systematically organizing the rapidly evolving field of continual learning for LLMs into a coherent framework. By recognizing that LLMs follow a multi-stage training paradigm distinct from traditional models, the authors create a taxonomy that captures the unique challenges and opportunities in this domain. The proposed metrics provide a standardized way to evaluate a critical concern—cross-stage forgetting—that emerges from this multi-stage training approach.

## Foundational Learning

**Catastrophic Forgetting**: The tendency of neural networks to rapidly forget previously learned information when trained on new tasks. Why needed: Fundamental challenge that continual learning methods aim to address. Quick check: Compare performance on old vs new tasks after sequential training.

**Multi-stage Training Paradigm**: The sequential process of pretraining, instruction tuning, and alignment that characterizes modern LLM development. Why needed: Provides context for why continual learning approaches differ from traditional settings. Quick check: Trace knowledge flow across training stages.

**Cross-stage Forgetting**: The phenomenon where knowledge acquired in one training stage is lost during subsequent stages. Why needed: Unique challenge in LLMs that existing continual learning metrics may not capture. Quick check: Measure knowledge retention across stage transitions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: CPT (Pretraining) -> CIT (Instruction Tuning) -> CA (Alignment) represents the standard LLM training pipeline where continual learning methods can be applied.

**Critical Path**: The progression from general knowledge acquisition (CPT) through task-specific capabilities (CIT) to value alignment (CA) forms the critical path where forgetting can occur between stages.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Computational efficiency vs. performance retention, knowledge preservation vs. adaptation speed, and safety considerations vs. capability enhancement represent key tradeoffs in continual learning design.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation on previously learned tasks, increased hallucinations or confabulations, and misalignment with original training objectives indicate potential forgetting or catastrophic forgetting events.

**First Experiments**:
1. Measure Forward Transfer Rate when applying CPT methods across different domains
2. Evaluate Backward Transfer Rate when implementing CIT methods on previously trained models
3. Assess Safety Delta when applying CA techniques to aligned models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Proposed taxonomy and metrics lack empirical validation across diverse LLM architectures
- Discussion of cross-stage forgetting is conceptual rather than empirically demonstrated
- Survey may have selection bias in included methods and benchmarks
- Claims about method effectiveness lack quantitative comparisons
- Future directions are speculative without systematic analysis of current limitations

## Confidence

**High**: The categorization of continual learning techniques into CPT, CIT, and CA stages is well-founded and aligns with established LLM training paradigms

**Medium**: The proposed metrics (Forward Transfer Rate, Backward Transfer Rate, Safety Delta) are theoretically sound but require empirical validation

**Medium**: The discussion of cross-stage forgetting challenges is conceptually valid but lacks quantitative evidence

**Low**: Specific claims about method effectiveness and comparative performance are not empirically supported

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies comparing the proposed metrics (Forward Transfer Rate, Backward Transfer Rate, Safety Delta) across multiple LLM architectures and continual learning methods to validate their effectiveness and reliability

2. Design experiments specifically targeting cross-stage forgetting by training models through multiple stages and measuring knowledge retention and transfer across stages

3. Perform a systematic literature review update to identify and include any significant continual learning approaches for LLMs published after the survey's primary research cutoff, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the field's current state
