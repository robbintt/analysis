# Advanced Academic Team Worker Recommendation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.16876
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16876
- Reference count: 30
- One-line primary result: CQBG-R model recommends balanced academic teams (prime professor, assistant professor, student) based on citation network topology and query context

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel task of academic team worker recommendation, proposing the Citation-Query Blended Graph-Ranking (CQBG-R) model. The model addresses the challenge of recommending balanced academic teams by combining citation network topology with query context to form a blended graph that targets research interests and specific tasks. Using the DBLP dataset, the authors demonstrate that their approach effectively recommends academic teams for various queries involving different researcher roles and research interests, with BM25-based scoring showing superior performance over TF-IDF.

## Method Summary
The CQBG-R model recommends academic teams by constructing a blended graph that combines citation network topology with query context. The approach involves building a citation graph based on collaboration between researchers, calculating paper scores using BM25 or TF-IDF, and implementing a ranking model that combines average edge weight and inverse shortest path length. The model classifies researchers into hierarchical roles (prime professor, assistant professor, student) based on publication count, citations, and collaboration degree, then recommends top team members for each role based on their scores.

## Key Results
- CQBG-R model effectively recommends balanced academic teams (prime professor, assistant professor, student)
- BM25-based scoring outperforms TF-IDF in recommending relevant team members
- Model successfully handles queries involving different researcher roles and research interests

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The CQBG-R model effectively combines citation network topology with query context to recommend balanced academic teams.
- Mechanism: By blending the citation graph (measuring collaboration and reputation) with the query graph (measuring relevance to research task), the model captures both the academic standing of potential team members and their topical fit for the given research interest.
- Core assumption: The combination of citation-based reputation scores and BM25-based query relevance scores provides a more holistic view of candidate suitability than either measure alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "combine the context of the query and the papers with the graph topology to form a new graph(CQBG)"
  - [section 4.2]: "we propose the Citation-Query Blended Graph"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers focus on general recommendation systems but do not directly address blended graph approaches for academic team formation.
- Break condition: If either the citation network or query context becomes sparse or noisy, the blended graph loses its effectiveness, leading to poor recommendations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The hierarchical tree classification of researchers by publication count, citations, and collaboration degree ensures appropriate role assignment in academic teams.
- Mechanism: By setting thresholds for academic level (e.g., prime professor, assistant professor, student), the model ensures that recommended team members have the appropriate expertise and experience for their assigned roles.
- Core assumption: Simple quantitative metrics like publication count, citation count, and collaboration degree are sufficient proxies for academic level and role suitability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3]: "We provide three criteria to estimate the academic level for each author"
  - [section 4.3]: "In this paper, we used the Criteria 1 to classify all the nodes"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in related papers about role-based team formation using these specific metrics.
- Break condition: If the thresholds do not accurately reflect the academic hierarchy or if researchers have atypical publication/citation patterns, the classification may be incorrect, leading to mismatched team roles.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The scoring function that combines average edge weight and inverse shortest path length effectively ranks potential team members by both relevance and communication cost.
- Mechanism: The model uses a combination of average edge weight (measuring reputation and task relevance) and inverse shortest path length (measuring collaboration proximity) to rank candidates, ensuring both high-quality and easily integrable team members.
- Core assumption: Candidates with higher average edge weights and shorter paths to the target researcher are better suited for team collaboration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4]: "we design our first model based on two intuitions: (1) the recommended author should have good reputation and correlation with the query... (2) the recommended author should be closed to ... in order to have low communication cost."
  - [section 4.4]: "Given ... eventually, we design our model /u1D439score for each /u1D45B/u1D457"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers do not discuss this specific combination of reputation and proximity in the context of team recommendation.
- Break condition: If the graph structure does not accurately reflect collaboration patterns or if the edge weights are not well-calibrated, the ranking may prioritize less suitable candidates.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Citation network analysis
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to build and analyze citation networks is crucial for constructing the CQBG and measuring academic reputation.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a co-authorship graph and a citation graph, and how are they constructed from bibliographic data?

- Concept: Information retrieval and BM25 scoring
  - Why needed here: BM25 scoring is used to measure the relevance of papers and researchers to the query task, which is essential for building the query graph.
  - Quick check question: How does BM25 differ from TF-IDF, and why might BM25 be more effective for this task?

- Concept: Graph neural networks and network embedding
  - Why needed here: Network embedding techniques like Node2Vec and GCN are used in the CQBG-NE-R model to learn vector representations of researchers for more sophisticated ranking.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between random walk-based methods (e.g., Node2Vec) and graph convolutional networks (e.g., GCN) for network embedding?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data Ingestion -> Citation Graph Construction -> Query Graph Construction -> CQBG Construction -> Hierarchical Classification -> Ranking Model (CQBG-R) -> Ranking Model (CQBG-NE-R) -> Evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Parse DBLP dataset to extract paper metadata, authors, and citations
  2. Construct citation graph with edge weights based on citation counts
  3. Construct query graph using BM25 or TF-IDF to measure relevance
  4. Blend citation and query graphs into CQBG
  5. Classify researchers into roles based on publication count, citations, and collaboration degree
  6. Score and rank candidates using CQBG-R or CQBG-NE-R model
  7. Evaluate the quality of recommended teams

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using citation count vs. collaboration count for edge weights: Citation count may better reflect reputation, but collaboration count may better reflect active engagement
  - BM25 vs. TF-IDF for query relevance: BM25 is generally more effective for information retrieval, but TF-IDF is simpler and may be sufficient for some tasks
  - Random walk-based vs. graph convolutional methods for network embedding: Random walk methods are more scalable but may not capture as much structural information as GCN

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor recommendations: If the recommended team members do not have the appropriate expertise or do not work well together, it may indicate issues with the graph construction or ranking model
  - Imbalanced teams: If the model consistently recommends teams with too many or too few members of a particular role, it may indicate issues with the hierarchical classification thresholds
  - Slow performance: If the model takes too long to construct the CQBG or rank candidates, it may indicate issues with scalability or optimization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Construct a small-scale CQBG using a subset of the DBLP dataset and manually verify that the graph structure accurately reflects collaboration patterns and research interests
  2. Compare the performance of BM25 and TF-IDF for query relevance scoring using a held-out test set of queries and relevance judgments
  3. Evaluate the impact of different network embedding techniques (e.g., Node2Vec, GCN, LINE) on the quality of team recommendations using a held-out test set of researcher queries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces the CQBG-R model and presents experimental results comparing it to other models within the study, but does not provide a comprehensive comparison with all existing state-of-the-art models.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a novel task of academic team worker recommendation and introduces a new model for this task. However, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with all existing state-of-the-art models in the field, leaving the relative performance of the CQBG-R model unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive experimental comparison of the CQBG-R model with other state-of-the-art academic team recommendation models, using standard datasets and evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the CQBG-R model change when using different network embedding methods, such as those based on deep learning techniques?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the CQBG-NE-R model uses various network embedding models, including randomwalk based methods (RandomWalk, Node2vec, LINE) and GNN based methods (GCN, PAGNN), but does not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of different embedding methods on the model's performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces the CQBG-NE-R model and mentions the use of different network embedding methods, but does not provide a detailed analysis of how these methods affect the model's performance. This leaves the question of which embedding method is most suitable for the CQBG-R model unanswered.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the CQBG-R model handle cold start problems, where there is limited information about the target researcher or potential team members?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not explicitly address the issue of cold start problems, but given the nature of the academic team recommendation task, it is likely that the model would face challenges when there is limited information about the target researcher or potential team members.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any information on how the CQBG-R model handles cold start problems, which are common in recommendation systems. This leaves the question of the model's performance in such scenarios unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experimental evaluation of the CQBG-R model's performance on cold start problems, using datasets with varying levels of information about the target researcher and potential team members, and comparing it to other models that explicitly address cold start issues.

## Limitations

- Limited ablation studies: The paper does not provide comprehensive ablation studies on the blended graph construction itself, making it difficult to isolate the contribution of the CQBG approach
- Threshold validation: The hierarchical classification thresholds for academic roles are described but not empirically validated, raising concerns about their generalizability across different research domains and institutions
- Scalability concerns: The model's performance on diverse query types and its scalability to larger datasets remain unclear

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The basic premise that citation networks contain useful information for academic team recommendation
- **Medium confidence**: The specific claim that BM25 outperforms TF-IDF for this task, based on experimental results
- **Low confidence**: The effectiveness of the blended graph approach compared to using citation or query graphs alone, as no direct comparison is provided

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study**: Compare CQBG-R performance against baseline models using only citation graphs, only query graphs, or simple combinations without blending, to isolate the contribution of the blended approach
2. **Threshold sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the classification thresholds for academic roles and measure impact on recommendation quality across different research domains
3. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the model on multiple academic datasets (not just DBLP) to evaluate generalizability and robustness to different citation patterns and research fields
