# Effects of Exponential Gaussian Distribution on (Double Sampling) Randomized Smoothing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.02309
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02309
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Exponential General Gaussian (EGG) distributions significantly improve Double Sampling Randomized Smoothing (DSRS) certification, with certified accuracy increases up to 6.4% on ImageNet, while Exponential Standard Gaussian (ESG) provides nearly identical certification to Gaussian smoothing regardless of exponent η.

## Executive Summary
This work systematically studies Exponential Standard Gaussian (ESG) and Exponential General Gaussian (EGG) distributions in the context of Randomized Smoothing (RS) and Double Sampling Randomized Smoothing (DSRS). The authors derive analytic formulas showing ESG certification converges to standard Gaussian in high dimensions regardless of exponent η, while EGG provides tighter lower bounds for ℓ₂ certified radius under concentration assumptions. Experimental validation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet confirms these theoretical findings, demonstrating that EGG with larger η values provides better certification on real classifiers than traditional approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces Exponential Standard Gaussian (ESG) and Exponential General Gaussian (EGG) distributions that generalize Gaussian smoothing by replacing the exponent 2 with any positive real number η. For ESG, they derive an analytic formula for certified radius that converges to Cohen et al.'s Gaussian formula in high dimensions. For EGG in DSRS, they prove tighter constant factors for Ω(√d) lower bounds under a concentration property assumption. Experiments use base classifiers trained with General Gaussian noise (η = 2.0) on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, testing ESG with η ∈ {1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0} and EGG with η ∈ {0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0} against Gaussian baselines.

## Key Results
- ESG certification is nearly unaffected by exponent η for both RS and DSRS, confirmed by experiments on real-world datasets
- EGG provides tighter constant factors than DSRS for Ω(√d) lower bounds of ℓ₂ certified radius under concentration property assumptions
- EGG with larger η values (e.g., 8.0) significantly improves DSRS certification on real classifiers, with certified accuracy increases up to 6.4% on ImageNet
- The improvement mechanism depends on whether base classifiers satisfy the concentration property

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
ESG distributions provide nearly identical certification to Gaussian smoothing in high dimensions regardless of exponent η because ESG generalizes Gaussian by replacing the exponent 2 with any positive real number η. The derived analytic formula for ESG's certified radius converges to the standard Gaussian formula as dimension d increases, making certification effectively independent of η in high-dimensional settings.

### Mechanism 2
EGG distributions tighten lower bounds for ℓ₂ certified radius compared to General Gaussian in DSRS when the base classifier satisfies a concentration property. EGG generalizes General Gaussian by adjusting the exponent η, and when the base classifier satisfies the (σ, p, η)-concentration property, EGG with η ∈ (0, 2) provides tighter constant factors for Ω(√d) lower bounds.

### Mechanism 3
In practice, EGG with larger η values (e.g., η = 8.0) provides better certified accuracy on real classifiers than EGG with smaller η values, even when the concentration property is not perfectly satisfied. For real classifiers that don't perfectly satisfy the concentration property, EGG with larger η values offer both higher sampling accuracy and better probability utilization.

## Foundational Learning

- **Randomized Smoothing and certification framework**: Understanding the original RS framework is essential for grasping modifications. Quick check: What is the fundamental difference between the Neyman-Pearson lemma approach used in standard RS and the double sampling approach in DSRS?

- **Concentration properties of probability distributions**: Both theoretical analyses rely heavily on concentration properties of beta and gamma distributions. Quick check: How does the unilateral concentration of the gamma distribution help establish the Ω(√d) lower bound for EGG?

- **Gamma and beta distribution relationships**: The proofs extensively use properties of gamma and beta distributions. Quick check: What is the relationship between the random variable 1 + x₁/σg(2u)^(1/η) and the Beta distribution as stated in Lemma I.23 of Yang et al. (2020)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: ESG analysis for standard RS -> EGG analysis for DSRS -> experimental validation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
- **Critical path**: For ESG results, follow Theorem 5.1 through Assumptions 5.3 and 5.5 to Equation (14). For EGG results, trace Lemma D.3 to Theorem 6.2 through the concentration property.
- **Design tradeoffs**: ESG offers η-independence and simpler computation vs EGG's potential for tighter bounds when concentration holds. Computational complexity increases with EGG due to additional gamma function terms.
- **Failure signatures**: If dimension is not sufficiently large, ESG approximation breaks down. If classifier doesn't satisfy concentration property, EGG advantages don't materialize. Poor experimental results indicate implementation errors.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Verify ESG certification independence from η by computing certified radii for different η values on a Gaussian-smoothed classifier
  2. Test the EGG concentration property assumption by measuring classifier accuracy on perturbed examples with ∥z∥₂ ≤ T
  3. Compare certified accuracy gains from DSRS versus NP certification across different σ values

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Under what precise conditions do EGG distributions with η < 2 consistently outperform General Gaussian (η = 2) in randomized smoothing certification? The paper proves EGG with η ∈ (0, 2) provides tighter constant factors under the (σ, p, 2)-concentration property, but experimental results show EGG with larger η (e.g., 8.0) performs better on real-world classifiers.

### Open Question 2
Is there a theoretical upper bound on the certified accuracy improvements that EGG distributions can provide over General Gaussian in randomized smoothing? The paper observes diminishing returns with increasing η but lacks theoretical analysis of convergence behavior or potential limits.

### Open Question 3
How does the computational complexity of certification methods scale with increasing dimensionality when using EGG distributions compared to traditional Gaussian distributions? The paper mentions computational challenges but doesn't provide complexity analysis comparing different distributions across varying dimensions.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies heavily on high-dimensional approximations that may not hold in practical low-dimensional settings
- Concentration property assumption for EGG improvements is difficult to verify empirically and may not hold for many real classifiers
- ESG certification independence from η is only asymptotic, with finite-dimensional effects potentially significant in practical applications

## Confidence

- **ESG certification independence**: High - well-supported by both theoretical derivation and experimental validation across multiple datasets and classifiers
- **EGG concentration property improvements**: Medium - strong theoretical foundation but limited empirical verification; the assumption is difficult to test comprehensively
- **Real classifier η-performance relationship**: Medium - experimental results are clear, but the underlying mechanism is not fully explained theoretically

## Next Checks

1. Test ESG certification across dimensions: Systematically vary the problem dimension d in synthetic experiments to empirically verify the convergence rate of ESG certification to Gaussian smoothing.

2. Quantify concentration property violation: For real classifiers used in experiments, measure the actual accuracy degradation when perturbing examples with ∥z∥₂ ≤ T and compare against theoretical predictions.

3. Cross-validate with alternative smoothing methods: Implement and test ESG/EGG smoothing on additional randomized smoothing variants (e.g., calibrated smoothing, multi-radius smoothing) to determine if improvements generalize beyond tested methods.
