# Are EEG Sequences Time Series? EEG Classification with Time Series Models and Joint Subject Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.06966
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06966
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Subject-conditional time series models with subject embeddings, trained jointly on all subjects, are competitive with dedicated EEG models in 2 out of 3 datasets, even outperforming them on one dataset

## Executive Summary
EEG data analysis traditionally relies on specialized models and separate training for each subject, limiting scalability and generalizability. This paper proposes treating EEG sequences as time series with static subject attributes, enabling the use of generic time series classification models. Three model setups are explored: subject-specific, subject-agnostic, and subject-conditional. Experiments on three datasets (MI, SSVEP, ERN) demonstrate that off-the-shelf time series models trained per subject perform close to EEG-specific models. Furthermore, subject-conditional models with subject embeddings, trained jointly on all subjects, are competitive with dedicated EEG models in 2 out of 3 datasets, even outperforming them on one dataset. This approach opens avenues for integrating EEG analysis into broader deep learning domains.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes treating EEG sequences as time series with static subject attributes. Three model setups are explored: subject-specific models trained on individual subjects, subject-agnostic models trained on all subjects without subject information, and subject-conditional models that incorporate subject embeddings. The subject-conditional models use a shared backbone network with subject embeddings that modulate the feature space, allowing joint training across all subjects. Time series classification models from the TSC library are adapted for EEG data, with subject information integrated through embedding layers. The approach is evaluated on three EEG datasets representing different paradigms: motor imagery (MI), steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), and error-related negativity (ERN).

## Key Results
- Off-the-shelf time series models trained per subject perform close to EEG-specific models
- Subject-conditional models with subject embeddings, trained jointly on all subjects, are competitive with dedicated EEG models in 2 out of 3 datasets
- Subject-conditional models outperform dedicated EEG models on the SSVEP dataset
- Dataset-dependent performance suggests limitations in universal applicability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the temporal structure inherent in EEG signals while incorporating subject-specific characteristics through embeddings. By treating EEG as time series data with static subject attributes, the models can learn generalizable temporal patterns while adapting to individual subject variations. The subject embeddings allow the model to condition its predictions on individual characteristics, effectively learning a shared representation space that can be modulated based on subject identity. This enables joint training across subjects while maintaining the ability to capture subject-specific nuances, bridging the gap between subject-specific performance and cross-subject generalization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time series classification fundamentals**: Understanding how to model sequential data with temporal dependencies is essential for applying TSC models to EEG data
- **Subject-specific vs. subject-invariant features**: EEG signals contain both task-related information and subject-specific characteristics that must be disentangled for effective cross-subject learning
- **Embedding-based conditioning**: Using learned embeddings to modulate model behavior allows for subject-specific adaptation while maintaining a shared knowledge base
- **Transfer learning across subjects**: The ability to transfer knowledge between subjects through joint training while preserving individual characteristics is crucial for scalable EEG analysis
- **Model architecture selection**: Choosing appropriate TSC architectures that can handle the temporal and spectral characteristics of EEG signals is critical for performance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input EEG time series -> Temporal encoder (TSC model) -> Subject embedding layer -> Feature fusion -> Classification head -> Output predictions

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from raw EEG sequences through the temporal encoder, where subject embeddings are integrated at the feature level before classification. The subject embeddings act as conditioning variables that modulate the feature space, enabling subject-specific adaptation within a shared model framework.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- **Joint vs. separate training**: Joint training enables knowledge transfer but may require more sophisticated regularization to prevent negative transfer between subjects
- **Embedding dimensionality**: Higher-dimensional embeddings can capture more subject-specific information but increase model complexity and risk overfitting
- **Temporal resolution**: Balancing sequence length against computational efficiency while maintaining sufficient temporal context for classification
- **Model complexity vs. generalization**: More complex TSC architectures may capture intricate patterns but risk overfitting on limited subject data

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor cross-subject generalization indicates insufficient subject-invariant feature learning
- Overfitting to individual subjects suggests inadequate regularization or overly complex subject embeddings
- Degraded performance on certain datasets may indicate mismatch between TSC model assumptions and EEG signal characteristics
- Instability during joint training could signal negative transfer between subjects with dissimilar EEG patterns

**First Experiments**
1. Train subject-specific TSC models on individual subjects and compare against specialized EEG models
2. Implement subject-conditional models with varying embedding dimensions to assess impact on cross-subject performance
3. Conduct ablation studies removing subject embeddings to quantify their contribution to model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset-dependent performance suggests the approach may not generalize uniformly across all EEG paradigms
- Results are based on relatively small sample sizes (9-54 subjects) across datasets
- The study focuses on specific task-based EEG paradigms and may not generalize to spontaneous or clinical EEG recordings
- The paper does not address temporal dependencies beyond standard time series modeling or explore interpretability of learned subject embeddings

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: EEG sequences can be effectively modeled as time series with static subject attributes
- **Medium confidence**: Subject-conditional time series models generalize across subjects with competitive accuracy
- **Low confidence**: The approach's effectiveness extends uniformly across all EEG paradigms and clinical applications

## Next Checks
1. Test the subject-conditional models on larger, more diverse EEG datasets including clinical populations and spontaneous recordings
2. Evaluate model performance across different temporal scales and frequency bands to assess sensitivity to signal characteristics
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the contribution of subject embeddings versus temporal modeling components
