# Applications of Explainable artificial intelligence in Earth system science

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.11882
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11882
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: This review systematically introduces XAI to the ESS community, presenting it as a solution to make AI models more transparent and interpretable for Earth system science applications.

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive review introduces explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to the Earth system science (ESS) community, addressing the critical challenge of AI's black-box nature in environmental modeling. The paper systematically covers XAI's definition, approaches, and methods while summarizing its applications in ESS. The review identifies three primary functionalities of XAI in ESS: communicating model decisions, diagnosing and improving models, and providing scientific insights. It concludes that an interpretable hybrid approach integrating AI with domain-specific knowledge appears most promising for enhancing AI's utility in ESS applications.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic review of XAI approaches and their applications in Earth system science. It categorizes XAI methods, examines their functionality in ESS contexts, and identifies challenges specific to the domain. The review synthesizes existing literature on how XAI can make AI models more transparent and interpretable for Earth scientists, while also outlining four significant challenges that XAI faces within ESS contexts.

## Key Results
- XAI addresses the black-box nature of AI models in ESS by providing transparency and interpretability
- Three primary XAI functionalities in ESS: communicating model decisions, diagnosing/improving models, and providing scientific insights
- Four significant challenges identified: technical issues (faithfulness, robustness), compatibility problems with ESS models, and human-centered design needs
- Interpretable hybrid approach integrating AI with domain-specific knowledge shows promise for ESS applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
XAI works in ESS by translating complex AI decision-making processes into interpretable forms that domain experts can understand and trust. The mechanism involves post-hoc explanation methods that analyze trained models to reveal which features influenced predictions and how. This transparency enables scientists to validate AI outputs against physical understanding, identify model errors, and gain new scientific insights from data patterns that might otherwise remain hidden in black-box models.

## Foundational Learning

### Post-hoc Explanation Methods
- **Why needed**: ESS models are often complex and opaque, making it difficult for scientists to trust or validate their outputs
- **Quick check**: Verify that explanation methods can be applied after model training without requiring architectural changes

### Model Diagnostics and Improvement
- **Why needed**: Understanding model behavior is crucial for improving ESS predictions and ensuring physical consistency
- **Quick check**: Confirm that XAI methods can identify systematic errors or biases in model predictions

### Scientific Insight Generation
- **Why needed**: XAI can reveal unexpected patterns in Earth system data that lead to new scientific hypotheses
- **Quick check**: Assess whether explanations align with or challenge existing scientific understanding

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
ESS Models -> XAI Methods -> Explanation Outputs -> Domain Expert Validation

### Critical Path
1. Train ESS AI model
2. Apply XAI method to generate explanations
3. Domain experts evaluate explanation quality and relevance
4. Iterate based on feedback for model improvement

### Design Tradeoffs
- Local vs. global explanations: detailed instance-specific vs. general model behavior
- Accuracy vs. interpretability: more interpretable models may sacrifice prediction performance
- Computational cost vs. explanation quality: more sophisticated methods require more resources

### Failure Signatures
- Explanations that contradict known physical principles
- Methods that are computationally prohibitive for large-scale ESS applications
- XAI outputs that domain experts find unactionable or misleading

### First Experiments
1. Apply feature importance methods to a trained ESS climate model and compare with known physical drivers
2. Test local explanation methods on specific weather prediction cases against expert meteorological knowledge
3. Evaluate global explanation methods on a vegetation model to identify key environmental controls
