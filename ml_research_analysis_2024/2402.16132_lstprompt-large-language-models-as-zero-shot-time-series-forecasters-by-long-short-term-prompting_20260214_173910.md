core_contribution: LSTPrompt addresses the problem of using large language models
  (LLMs) for zero-shot time series forecasting (TSF). It proposes a novel approach
  called LSTPrompt that decomposes TSF into short-term and long-term forecasting sub-tasks
  and tailors prompts to each.

# LSTPrompt: Large Language Models as Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters by Long-Short-Term Prompting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.16132
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16132
- **Reference count**: 28
- **Primary result**: Introduces LSTPrompt, achieving best zero-shot performance on 8/12 benchmark datasets and outperforming supervised methods on some datasets (74.6% lower MAE on MilkProduction)

## Executive Summary
LSTPrompt addresses the challenge of using large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot time series forecasting by decomposing the task into short-term and long-term forecasting sub-tasks. The method introduces tailored prompts for each component and incorporates TimeBreath, a mechanism that encourages LLMs to regularly reassess their forecasting approach to enhance adaptability. The approach demonstrates competitive performance against both existing prompting methods and foundation TSF models, with particularly strong results on benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
LSTPrompt leverages the capabilities of large language models by transforming time series forecasting into a prompt-based task. The method decomposes TSF into short-term and long-term components, each with specialized prompts that guide the LLM's reasoning. The TimeBreath mechanism introduces periodic reassessment points during the forecasting process, allowing the model to adapt its approach based on evolving context. This decomposition strategy aims to address the limitations of treating TSF as a monolithic task when using LLMs, which are primarily designed for natural language processing.

## Key Results
- LSTPrompt achieves the best performance among zero-shot methods on 8 out of 12 benchmark datasets
- Outperforms the best supervised results on certain datasets (74.6% lower MAE on MilkProduction)
- Consistently outperforms existing prompting methods for time series forecasting
- Demonstrates competitive results compared to foundation TSF models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of LSTPrompt stems from its decomposition strategy that aligns with the inherent capabilities of LLMs. By breaking down time series forecasting into short-term and long-term components, the method allows LLMs to focus on specific temporal patterns and relationships more effectively. The TimeBreath mechanism enhances this by enabling periodic reassessment, which helps the model adapt to changing patterns and avoid error accumulation over longer forecasting horizons. This approach effectively bridges the gap between LLMs' language processing strengths and the numerical, sequential nature of time series data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time series decomposition**: Breaking time series into components (trend, seasonality, residuals) - needed to understand why separating short-term and long-term forecasting is beneficial; quick check: verify if decomposed components show distinct patterns
- **Prompt engineering for LLMs**: Crafting inputs to elicit desired responses from language models - essential for guiding LLM reasoning in numerical forecasting tasks; quick check: test different prompt formulations for effectiveness
- **Zero-shot learning**: Enabling models to perform tasks without task-specific training - fundamental to the paper's approach of using LLMs without fine-tuning; quick check: verify performance degradation when removing zero-shot constraints
- **Long-short-term memory networks**: Understanding the distinction between short and long-term dependencies in sequential data - provides context for why decomposition improves performance; quick check: analyze error patterns at different forecasting horizons

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input Time Series -> Short-Term Decomposition -> Long-Term Decomposition -> TimeBreath Reassessment -> Final Forecast

**Critical path**: The core workflow involves decomposing the time series into short-term and long-term components, generating predictions for each through specialized prompts, applying TimeBreath reassessment at regular intervals, and combining the results for the final forecast.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades computational efficiency (multiple LLM calls for decomposition and reassessment) for improved forecasting accuracy and adaptability. The decomposition approach may introduce complexity in prompt design and requires careful calibration of reassessment frequency.

**Failure signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when: time series patterns are highly non-stationary with frequent regime changes, the decomposition into short/long-term components doesn't align with natural data patterns, or reassessment intervals are poorly calibrated leading to either excessive computation or insufficient adaptation.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test LSTPrompt on a synthetic dataset with known short and long-term patterns to verify decomposition effectiveness
2. Compare performance with and without TimeBreath reassessment to quantify its contribution
3. Evaluate the impact of different reassessment frequencies on forecasting accuracy and computational cost

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness may depend heavily on prompt quality and specific formulations used
- TimeBreath mechanism lacks detailed analysis of when and why it improves performance across different dataset characteristics
- Claims of outperforming supervised results may be dataset-specific and require verification across broader domains

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: LSTPrompt's general framework and methodology are sound and well-described
- **Medium confidence**: The comparative results against baseline zero-shot methods are reproducible based on the provided information
- **Medium confidence**: The TimeBreath mechanism contributes to performance improvements, though the exact mechanism requires further investigation

## Next Checks
1. Test LSTPrompt's performance on noisy or non-stationary time series data to evaluate robustness claims
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the short-term/long-term decomposition and TimeBreath mechanisms
3. Evaluate LSTPrompt on time series datasets from domains not represented in the current benchmarks to assess generalizability
