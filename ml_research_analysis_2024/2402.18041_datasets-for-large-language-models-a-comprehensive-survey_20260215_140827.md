# Datasets for Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.18041
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18041
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First comprehensive survey systematically categorizing 444 LLM datasets across 8 languages and 32 domains, quantifying 774.5 TB of pre-training text and 700M+ instances

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive survey dedicated to datasets for large language models (LLMs). The authors systematically categorize LLM datasets into five core perspectives: pre-training corpora, instruction fine-tuning datasets, preference datasets, evaluation datasets, and traditional NLP datasets. Through extensive data collection, they analyze 444 datasets spanning 8 language categories and 32 domains, quantifying over 774.5 TB of pre-training text and more than 700 million instances across other dataset types. The survey provides detailed statistics on dataset growth trends, licensing, construction methods, and domain distributions, while also synthesizing current challenges and future research directions in each dataset category.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted extensive data collection from papers, repositories (e.g., GitHub), and online sources to gather metadata for 444 datasets across 20 dimensions including release time, size, license, language, construction method, and domain. They systematically categorized each dataset using a predefined taxonomy into five main categories: pre-training corpora, instruction fine-tuning datasets, preference datasets, evaluation datasets, and traditional NLP datasets. The methodology involved aggregating statistics, generating distribution plots, and cross-referencing sample tables to ensure consistency. The comprehensive approach aimed to provide a definitive reference consolidating the fragmented LLM dataset landscape.

## Key Results
- Identified 444 datasets across 8 languages and 32 domains, with 774.5 TB of pre-training text and 700M+ non-pre-training instances
- Categorized datasets into 5 main perspectives with detailed subcategory distributions (e.g., 59 pre-training corpora, 103 instruction fine-tuning datasets)
- Analyzed dataset growth trends, licensing patterns, construction methods, and domain distributions with comprehensive statistical visualizations
- Identified key challenges including data selection, quality assessment, and evaluation gaps, while outlining future research directions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's effectiveness stems from its systematic categorization approach and comprehensive data collection methodology. By establishing clear taxonomies for dataset classification and collecting metadata across 20 dimensions, the authors created a structured framework for understanding the LLM dataset landscape. The five-perspective categorization (pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, preference, evaluation, traditional NLP) captures the complete lifecycle of LLM development, from initial training to final evaluation. This comprehensive approach enables both high-level trend analysis and granular insights into specific dataset characteristics, making it valuable for researchers and practitioners.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dataset Categorization**: Understanding the five main dataset perspectives is crucial for navigating LLM development pipelines. Quick check: Can you explain how each category contributes to different stages of LLM training and evaluation?
- **Metadata Collection**: The 20-dimensional metadata framework provides a standardized way to describe datasets. Quick check: Can you list at least 5 key metadata dimensions and explain their importance?
- **Statistical Analysis**: The ability to aggregate and visualize dataset statistics enables trend identification. Quick check: Can you interpret the significance of dataset growth trends and distribution patterns?
- **Licensing Awareness**: Understanding dataset licenses is critical for legal and ethical compliance. Quick check: Can you identify common license types and their implications for dataset usage?
- **Construction Methods**: Knowledge of how datasets are constructed helps in quality assessment. Quick check: Can you differentiate between various construction methods (e.g., web scraping, manual curation)?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Dataset Collection -> Metadata Extraction -> Categorization -> Statistical Analysis -> Visualization

**Critical Path:** The survey's critical path flows from dataset collection through metadata extraction, where the quality and completeness of collected metadata directly impacts the accuracy of categorization and subsequent statistical analysis.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The authors balanced comprehensiveness with practicality by focusing on publicly available datasets while acknowledging potential blind spots in proprietary data. This approach maximizes reproducibility but may underrepresent commercial LLM development.

**Failure Signatures:** Inconsistencies between reported statistics and sample tables indicate potential data collection gaps or categorization errors. Mismatches in dataset counts per category suggest incomplete collection or misclassification.

**First Experiments:**
1. Reconstruct the complete dataset list from GitHub and supplemental materials to verify the 444 dataset count
2. Cross-validate metadata extraction by sampling 10% of datasets and comparing against original sources
3. Recompute statistical distributions (e.g., domain, language, license) to confirm reported percentages

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The survey's comprehensiveness is constrained by the availability and accessibility of dataset metadata, potentially missing proprietary or private datasets
- Dataset categorization may be ambiguous when datasets span multiple categories, creating classification challenges
- Reported statistics depend on accurate metadata extraction, which may be incomplete or inconsistent across diverse sources

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The five-category taxonomy and general statistics about dataset growth and distribution trends; methodology is clearly described
- **Medium Confidence**: Specific counts per subcategory and detailed licensing/construction method statistics; depends on completeness of data collection
- **Low Confidence**: Precise rankings of datasets by size/popularity and potential absence of datasets with limited public documentation

## Next Checks
1. Cross-reference the GitHub repository and supplemental materials with additional sources (e.g., ArXiv, Hugging Face datasets) to verify all 444 datasets are accounted for
2. Validate dataset categorization by manually checking a random sample (e.g., 10% of datasets) against the paper's definitions
3. Recompute key statistics (total pre-training size, instance counts, domain distributions) from raw metadata to confirm reported values within ±5% margin of error
