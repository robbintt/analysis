# ALERT: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Assessing Large Language Models' Safety through Red Teaming

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08676
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08676
- Reference count: 13
- Key outcome: ALERT is a comprehensive benchmark with 45,000+ prompts across 32 risk categories that reveals many popular LLMs still generate harmful content over 10% of the time

## Executive Summary
ALERT is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of large language models through red teaming methodologies. It features a novel fine-grained risk taxonomy with 6 macro and 32 micro categories, enabling detailed assessment of model vulnerabilities across diverse safety domains. The benchmark employs automated prompt generation combined with four adversarial strategies to systematically test model responses, then uses an auxiliary LLM (Llama Guard) to classify outputs as safe or unsafe. Experiments on 10 popular open- and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that while some models achieve high safety scores, many still struggle with safety, particularly when faced with adversarial attacks.

## Method Summary
ALERT consists of three main components: (1) prompt generation using template-based strategies and keyword matching to create 45,000+ safety-relevant prompts categorized across 32 risk micro-categories, (2) adversarial augmentation applying four strategies (suffix injection, prefix injection, token manipulation, and jailbreaking) to systematically explore model vulnerabilities, and (3) safety assessment using an auxiliary LLM to classify responses as safe or unsafe. The benchmark computes overall and category-wise safety scores based on the percentage of safe responses, with lower attack success rates (ASR) indicating better safety performance. Additionally, ALERT constructs a DPO dataset by pairing safe and unsafe responses to enable iterative safety improvements through preference optimization.

## Key Results
- Many popular LLMs, including some closed-source models, generate harmful content over 10% of the time when subjected to ALERT's adversarial testing
- The fine-grained taxonomy reveals heterogeneous safety failures across different risk categories, with models showing varying vulnerabilities to different types of harmful content
- Adversarial attacks significantly reduce model safety performance, with ASR values demonstrating that almost every evaluated model is vulnerable to at least one attack strategy
- The DPO dataset enables safety tuning, allowing models to be aligned to the safety levels of the best-performing models under evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The fine-grained taxonomy enables precise identification of LLM vulnerabilities across multiple risk categories
- Mechanism: ALERT's 32 micro categories provide detailed categorization of prompts and responses, allowing detection of specific weaknesses that broader taxonomies miss. This granularity reveals model failures in targeted domains (e.g., substance_cannabis vs. substance_drug)
- Core assumption: Safety failures in LLMs are heterogeneous and domain-specific rather than uniform across all risk categories
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The fine-grained taxonomy enables in-depth evaluation and assessment of alignment with various policies"
  - [section 3] "it provides us with a framework to carefully categorize model weaknesses and vulnerabilities"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus mentions related works but doesn't directly validate taxonomy granularity

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Automated red teaming with adversarial augmentation achieves comprehensive safety coverage
- Mechanism: ALERT combines template-based prompt generation with four adversarial strategies (suffix injection, prefix injection, token manipulation, jailbreaking) to systematically explore model vulnerabilities. This automation scales beyond human-in-the-loop approaches while maintaining coverage
- Core assumption: Adversarial strategies can reliably elicit harmful responses from LLMs when applied to safety-relevant prompts
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "We include the following key strategies in our benchmark" with specific adversarial techniques
  - [section 5] "almost every model is vulnerable to adversarial attacks" with quantitative ASR results
  - [corpus] Moderate - corpus contains similar automated red teaming approaches but doesn't validate the specific combination used

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The DPO dataset construction enables iterative safety improvements through preference optimization
- Mechanism: ALERT pairs safe and unsafe responses for each prompt, creating preference data that can be used for direct optimization. This creates a closed-loop system where evaluation data directly feeds into model improvement
- Core assumption: Preference pairs derived from real model outputs can effectively guide safety tuning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "we pair safe and unsafe model responses to facilitate and incentivize the development of safe LLMs"
  - [section 5] "With this dataset, each model can be aligned to the safety levels of the best models under evaluation"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus mentions DPO but doesn't validate its effectiveness for safety specifically

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Red teaming methodology
  - Why needed here: Understanding how adversarial testing works is crucial for comprehending ALERT's evaluation approach and interpreting results
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes red teaming from standard LLM evaluation?

- Concept: Prompt injection and adversarial attacks
  - Why needed here: The adversarial augmentation component relies on understanding how prompt manipulation can bypass safety measures
  - Quick check question: How do suffix injection and jailbreaking differ in their approach to circumventing LLM safety?

- Concept: Safety taxonomy design principles
  - Why needed here: The effectiveness of ALERT depends on having a comprehensive and balanced taxonomy that captures relevant risks
  - Quick check question: What considerations determine the granularity level of a safety taxonomy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt generation (keyword matching + zero-shot classification) -> Adversarial augmentation (4 strategies) -> LLM evaluation -> Auxiliary classification (Llama Guard) -> Safety scoring
- Critical path: Prompt → LLM evaluation → Auxiliary classification → Safety scoring. The auxiliary LLM classification is the bottleneck as it must process all generated responses
- Design tradeoffs: Fine granularity provides detailed insights but increases complexity and evaluation time. Automated approaches scale better but may miss nuanced human-generated attacks. The choice of auxiliary LLM affects results (Llama Guard bias concern)
- Failure signatures: High refusal rates indicating over-caution, low variation in unsafe responses suggesting limited attack effectiveness, inconsistent scores across similar categories indicating classification instability
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run ALERT on a known safe model (Llama 2) to verify baseline functionality and check for false positives
  2. Test a single adversarial strategy (e.g., suffix injection) on multiple models to validate attack effectiveness
  3. Substitute the auxiliary LLM (Llama Guard) with Perspective API to verify score consistency across classification systems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the fine-grained safety risk taxonomy compare to existing coarser-grained taxonomies when evaluating LLMs for safety compliance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces a novel fine-grained safety risk taxonomy with 32 micro categories and compares it to existing taxonomies like those proposed by Inan et al. (2023) and Wang et al. (2023a), stating that the existing taxonomies are "too general and do not enable detailed evaluations"
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison of the performance of the fine-grained taxonomy versus coarser-grained taxonomies in terms of safety compliance evaluation. While the paper argues for the benefits of the fine-grained approach, it does not empirically demonstrate how it performs compared to existing methods
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating LLMs using both the fine-grained taxonomy proposed in the paper and existing coarser-grained taxonomies, measuring metrics such as detection accuracy, false positive/negative rates, and granularity of insights provided

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the safety scores of LLMs change when using different auxiliary classification models (e.g., Llama Guard vs. Google's Perspective API) for assessing prompt-response pairs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using Llama Guard as the auxiliary LLM for classifying responses as safe or unsafe, but also notes that using Google's Perspective API for Llama 2 resulted in a perfect safety score, emphasizing the validity of the reported results
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of safety scores obtained using different auxiliary classification models across all evaluated LLMs. It only mentions the results for Llama 2 with Perspective API
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic evaluation of all LLMs using multiple auxiliary classification models (e.g., Llama Guard, Perspective API, and potentially others) and comparing the resulting safety scores to assess the impact of the choice of auxiliary model on the evaluation outcomes

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the safety performance of LLMs vary across different languages, and what challenges arise in extending the ALERT benchmark to multilingual scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the approach for creating the benchmark allows for easy integration of additional prompts and inclusion of other languages, but does not provide any experimental results or discussion on multilingual safety evaluation
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on English-language prompts and does not explore the performance of LLMs in other languages or the challenges associated with multilingual safety evaluation
- What evidence would resolve it: An extension of the ALERT benchmark to include prompts in multiple languages, followed by an evaluation of the safety performance of LLMs across these languages. Additionally, an analysis of the challenges encountered in translating prompts, ensuring cultural relevance, and handling language-specific safety risks

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the trade-off between safety and helpfulness manifest in LLM outputs, and what strategies can be employed to optimize for both aspects simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the trade-off between safety and helpfulness, noting that evasive responses (e.g., "I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that request.") can reduce helpfulness while ensuring safety. It also mentions the need for a balance between safety and helpfulness in LLM outputs
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a quantitative analysis of the trade-off between safety and helpfulness or propose strategies to optimize for both aspects simultaneously
- What evidence would resolve it: A study measuring the safety and helpfulness scores of LLM outputs, along with an analysis of the relationship between these two metrics. Additionally, an exploration of techniques such as controlled generation, fine-tuning, or post-processing methods that can be used to optimize for both safety and helpfulness in LLM outputs

## Limitations
- The benchmark relies on a single auxiliary LLM (Llama Guard) for safety classification, which may introduce systematic biases in how safety is assessed
- Template-based prompt generation may not fully capture the diversity of real-world adversarial attempts compared to human-generated attacks
- The effectiveness is primarily measured through ASR, which doesn't account for the severity or context of harmful responses

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Benchmark construction methodology is sound with comprehensive prompt coverage and reproducible three-component architecture
- Medium Confidence: Claims about model vulnerabilities and safety scores are supported by experimental results, though auxiliary classifier reliance limits generalizability
- Low Confidence: Claims regarding DPO-based safety tuning effectiveness for real-world improvements lack empirical validation beyond benchmark metrics

## Next Checks
1. Test ALERT's safety classification using multiple auxiliary classifiers (e.g., Perspective API, GPT-4) to assess consistency and identify potential biases in the safety assessment pipeline
2. Evaluate the same models using ALERT and at least one other established safety benchmark (e.g., AdvBench, HarmBench) to validate whether ALERT's fine-grained taxonomy captures unique vulnerabilities or simply reclassifies existing safety issues
3. Conduct a controlled study where models are fine-tuned using ALERT's DPO dataset, then test these models on real-world safety incidents or human-generated adversarial prompts to verify that benchmark improvements translate to practical safety gains
