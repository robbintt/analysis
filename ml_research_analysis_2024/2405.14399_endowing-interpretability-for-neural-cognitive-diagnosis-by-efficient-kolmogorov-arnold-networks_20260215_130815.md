# Endowing Interpretability for Neural Cognitive Diagnosis by Efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.14399
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14399
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Key outcome**: KAN2CD achieves better performance than traditional and neural CDMs with improved interpretability through KAN-based architectures

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces KAN2CD, a novel approach to enhance interpretability in neural cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) by leveraging Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Traditional neural CDMs suffer from poor interpretability due to complex multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), despite the monotonicity assumption. KAN2CD addresses this by replacing MLPs with KANs in two ways: directly substituting MLPs in existing neural CDMs, and designing a new aggregation framework using KANs at two levels to process student, exercise, and concept embeddings. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that KAN2CD achieves better performance than traditional and neural CDMs, with improved interpretability. The learned structures of KANs provide clear insights into how the model makes predictions, enhancing trust and understanding for users. The modified implementation of KANs ensures competitive training efficiency, making KAN2CD a promising solution for interpretable cognitive diagnosis.

## Method Summary
The KAN2CD approach enhances interpretability in neural cognitive diagnosis models by replacing multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The method is implemented in two ways: KA2NCD-native directly substitutes MLPs in existing neural CDMs (NCD, KaNCD, KSCD, RCD) with KANs, while KA2NCD-e/kan introduces a novel aggregation framework with KANs at two levels to process student, exercise, and concept embeddings. The modified KAN implementation ensures competitive training efficiency. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with cross-entropy loss and evaluated on four real-world datasets (ASSISTments, SLP, JunYi, FrcSub) using AUC and ACC metrics.

## Key Results
- KAN2CD outperforms traditional CDMs (IRT, MIRT, DINA, MF) and neural CDMs (NCD, KaNCD, KSCD, RCD) on all four datasets in terms of AUC and ACC
- The learned KAN structures provide clear interpretability, revealing how the model makes predictions
- Modified KAN implementation achieves competitive training efficiency compared to MLPs
- Both implementation manners (KA2NCD-native and KA2NCD-e/kan) show consistent performance improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper doesn't explicitly detail the mechanism, but the core insight is that KANs replace black-box MLPs with interpretable piecewise-linear functions. By using learnable activation functions along the edges rather than in the nodes, KANs can capture complex relationships while maintaining interpretability. The two-level aggregation framework in KA2NCD-e/kan processes embeddings at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both individual and collective patterns in student responses.

## Foundational Learning
- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)**: Replace MLP nodes with learnable activation functions along edges, providing interpretability while maintaining performance. Needed to overcome the black-box nature of traditional neural CDMs. Quick check: Verify that KANs use edge-based learnable functions instead of node-based activations.
- **Cognitive Diagnosis Models (CDMs)**: Predict student responses based on latent knowledge concepts using Q-matrix. Needed as the target application domain. Quick check: Confirm that CDMs use Q-matrix to relate exercises to knowledge concepts.
- **Two-level Aggregation Framework**: Processes student, exercise, and concept embeddings at different levels of granularity. Needed to capture both individual and collective patterns in response data. Quick check: Ensure the framework has separate processing stages for different embedding types.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Student Embeddings -> KAN Layer 1 -> Exercise Embeddings -> KAN Layer 2 -> Concept Embeddings -> Output Layer

**Critical Path:**
The critical path flows through both KAN layers in the KA2NCD-e/kan implementation, where student and exercise embeddings are processed separately before being combined with concept embeddings for the final prediction.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- KANs vs MLPs: KANs provide interpretability but may require more careful initialization and tuning
- Single vs Two-level Aggregation: Two-level provides better granularity but increases model complexity
- Native vs Novel Implementation: Native is simpler to implement but may miss some interpretability benefits

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor performance: Incorrect implementation of KAN edge functions or improper handling of the Q-matrix
- Slow training: Not using the modified KAN implementation for efficiency
- Loss of interpretability: Overly complex KAN structures or insufficient visualization of learned functions

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Implement KA2NCD-native by replacing MLPs in NCD with KANs and compare performance on ASSISTments dataset
2. Implement KA2NCD-e/kan with two-level aggregation and evaluate on SLP dataset
3. Conduct ablation study by removing KAN layers to quantify their contribution to performance and interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The paper does not provide sufficient detail on the specific implementation of KANs, including the number of learnable activation functions per KAN layer and the exact structure of the modified implementation for training efficiency
- Baseline model hyperparameters are not fully specified, which could affect performance comparisons
- The two-level aggregation framework for KA2NCD-e/kan is conceptually described but lacks detailed implementation guidance
- No ablation studies are presented to quantify the contribution of KANs versus other architectural components

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The overall methodology of replacing MLPs with KANs to improve interpretability is well-founded and the performance improvements are clearly demonstrated
- **Medium confidence**: The specific implementation details of the modified KAN training procedure and the exact structure of the two-level aggregation framework
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that KANs provide better interpretability, as this is primarily based on qualitative visualizations rather than quantitative interpretability metrics

## Next Checks
1. Implement and compare both KAN implementation manners (KA2NCD-native and KA2NCD-e/kan) on the same datasets to verify the reported performance improvements
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of KANs versus other architectural components in the model
3. Develop quantitative metrics for interpretability and compare KAN-based models against traditional neural CDMs using these metrics
