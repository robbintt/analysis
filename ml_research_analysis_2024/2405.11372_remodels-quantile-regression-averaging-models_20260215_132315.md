# ReModels: Quantile Regression Averaging models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.11372
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11372
- Reference count: 33
- ReModels is a Python package implementing Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) and its variants for probabilistic electricity price forecasting

## Executive Summary
ReModels is a Python package that provides a comprehensive implementation of Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) and its variants for probabilistic electricity price forecasting. It addresses the reproducibility challenge in energy price forecasting by offering transparent data acquisition, method evaluation, and result analysis. The package includes modules for dataset acquisition, data preparation, point and probabilistic forecast generation, and forecast evaluation. It implements nine QRA variants and provides metrics such as Average Empirical Coverage (AEC) and Aggregate Pinball Score (APS) for evaluating forecast accuracy.

## Method Summary
ReModels implements Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) and nine variants including QRA, QRM, LQRA, FQRA, sFQRA, and SQRA. The package follows a six-module pipeline: Dataset acquisition from ENTSO-E API, Data preparation with variance stabilizing transformations, Point forecast generation using linear regression, Point forecast evaluation, Probabilistic forecast generation using QRA variants, and Probabilistic forecast evaluation using AEC and APS metrics. Each QRA variant is implemented as a separate class inheriting from a base QRA class, ensuring consistent interfaces while allowing easy comparison between methods.

## Key Results
- Implements nine QRA variants including QRA, QRM, LQRA, FQRA, sFQRA, and SQRA
- Provides comprehensive data acquisition from ENTSO-E Transparency Platform API
- Includes eight variance stabilizing transformations to handle electricity price volatility
- Implements evaluation metrics AEC and APS for probabilistic forecast assessment
- Enables systematic comparison between QRA variants through unified framework

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Quantile regression averaging (QRA) produces accurate probabilistic forecasts by combining multiple point forecasts through linear quantile regression. The package fits separate quantile regression models for each quantile using a matrix of point predictions as input features. This captures the conditional distribution of electricity prices across different quantiles. The core assumption is that point forecasts contain valuable information about the future price distribution, and quantile regression can effectively learn the mapping from these predictions to true quantiles.

### Mechanism 2
Variance stabilizing transformations (VSTs) improve model performance by addressing the heavy-tailed nature of electricity prices. The package applies transformations like Box-Cox, logistic, or arcsinh to scale electricity prices before modeling, reducing the impact of extreme values on parameter estimation. The core assumption is that electricity prices exhibit heteroscedastic behavior with heavy tails that violate linear regression assumptions, and VSTs can stabilize variance without losing information.

### Mechanism 3
The modular architecture enables systematic experimentation and fair comparison between QRA variants. By implementing each QRA variant as a separate class inheriting from a base QRA class, the package ensures consistent interfaces while allowing easy swapping of methods for comparison. The core assumption is that different QRA variants capture different aspects of the forecasting problem, and a unified framework allows identifying which approaches work best under different conditions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Quantile regression basics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how QRA differs from ordinary least squares regression is fundamental to using the package effectively
  - Quick check question: What cost function does quantile regression minimize, and how does it differ from standard linear regression?

- Concept: Electricity market fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Users need to understand why electricity price forecasting is challenging and why probabilistic forecasts are valuable
  - Quick check question: Why are electricity prices particularly difficult to forecast compared to other commodities?

- Concept: Cross-validation and evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Proper assessment of probabilistic forecasts requires understanding metrics like AEC and APS
  - Quick check question: How does Average Empirical Coverage (AEC) measure the quality of prediction intervals?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset acquisition -> Data preparation -> Point forecasts -> Point forecast evaluation -> Probabilistic forecasts -> Probabilistic forecast evaluation
- Critical path: Data preparation -> PointModel pipeline -> QRA variant selection -> QR Tester evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: The package prioritizes reproducibility and fair comparison over maximum performance. Users can swap components but may sacrifice some optimization opportunities.
- Failure signatures: Poor forecast quality often stems from inadequate point forecasts, inappropriate VST selection, or insufficient calibration window size. Monitor MAE/MAPE for point forecasts and AEC for probabilistic forecasts.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the provided illustrative example to verify installation and basic functionality with German market data
  2. Compare QRA vs QRM variants on the same dataset to understand performance differences
  3. Test different VSTs on the same dataset to observe impact on forecast accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do the performance differences between QRA variants (QRA, QRM, LQRA, FQRA, sFQRA, SQRA) scale across different electricity markets and time periods beyond the German market studied? The paper only provides an illustrative example for the German market, and while it mentions broader applications, it does not present comparative results across multiple markets and time periods.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal calibration window length for QRA variants across different electricity markets and price volatility conditions? The paper shows different calibration windows yield different performance metrics for the German market, suggesting that calibration window length impacts results, but only demonstrates this effect on one market.

### Open Question 3
How does the inclusion of renewable energy source features impact the accuracy of probabilistic price forecasts across different QRA variants? The paper mentions studying this impact but does not provide detailed results or comparisons of how renewable energy features affect different QRA variants.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation across diverse electricity markets beyond the German case study
- Unclear optimal choice of variance stabilizing transformations and their parameters for different market conditions
- Calibration window length and quantile regression solver parameters not thoroughly benchmarked for optimal performance

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The fundamental mechanism of quantile regression averaging and its implementation in the package is sound. The modular architecture design and basic data processing pipeline are well-established.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of specific QRA variants (QRM, LQRA, FQRA) and their comparative advantages across different market conditions. The choice of variance stabilizing transformations for optimal performance.
- **Low confidence**: The package's performance on electricity markets outside the German case study, particularly in markets with different price dynamics or regulatory frameworks.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-market validation**: Test the package on at least two additional electricity markets (e.g., Nord Pool and French market) to assess generalizability and identify market-specific patterns in QRA variant performance.

2. **VST sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary variance stabilizing transformation parameters (λ and c) across their valid ranges and measure impact on AEC and APS metrics to establish robustness guidelines.

3. **Calibration window optimization**: Experiment with different calibration window sizes (from 1 week to 12 months) to determine optimal window length for various QRA variants and market conditions.
