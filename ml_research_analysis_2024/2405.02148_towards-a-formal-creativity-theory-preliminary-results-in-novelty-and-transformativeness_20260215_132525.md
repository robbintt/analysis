# Towards a Formal Creativity Theory: Preliminary results in Novelty and Transformativeness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.02148
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02148
- Reference count: 4
- Formalizes novelty and transformativeness using Formal Learning Theory to establish theorems about their relationship in creative processes

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Formal Creativity Theory (FCT), a theoretical framework that adapts Formal Learning Theory to study creativity concepts. The authors formalize key creativity-related concepts like novelty and transformativeness using FLT's mathematical structures of languages, hypotheses, and texts. Through rigorous logical proofs, they demonstrate that novelty is neither necessary nor sufficient for transformational creativity in general agents, but becomes necessary when considering set-driven agents that disregard experience order and repetition. This work establishes FCT as a new research branch within computational creativity theory, providing a foundation for future theoretical investigations.

## Method Summary
The paper adapts Formal Learning Theory (FLT) concepts to create a new framework for studying creativity. It defines creativity-related concepts like novelty and transformativeness as formal predicates over structured situations, then uses logical proofs to establish theorems about the relationships between these properties under different agent types. The method involves mapping creativity concepts to FLT structures (languages, texts, scientists), proving theorems about property relationships, and applying these results to understand when novelty becomes necessary for transformational creativity. The framework enables rigorous analysis of creativity assumptions through mathematical logic rather than empirical testing.

## Key Results
- Proves novelty is neither necessary nor sufficient for transformational creativity in general agents
- Shows novelty becomes necessary for transformational creativity when considering set-driven agents
- Establishes Formal Creativity Theory as a new theoretical framework for studying creativity concepts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Novelty is neither necessary nor sufficient for transformational creativity in general
- Mechanism: The paper establishes that under the general class of all scientists, novelty and transformativeness are logically independent properties - you can have transformative artifacts that are not novel, and novel artifacts that are not transformative
- Core assumption: The formal definitions of novelty (VN) and transformativeness (VT r) as predicates parameterized by situation s = (M, σ) are correct and capture the intended creative concepts
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we argue that, while novelty is neither necessary nor sufficient for transformational creativity in general"
  - [section] Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 prove both directions - novelty not sufficient (constant scientists) and novelty not necessary (ever-changing scientists)
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations found, but the mathematical logic framework aligns with computational creativity theory
- Break condition: If the definitions of novelty or transformativeness don't accurately capture creative concepts, or if the formal logic proofs contain errors

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: For set-driven scientists, novelty becomes necessary for transformational creativity
- Mechanism: Set-driven scientists ignore order and repetition, so the only way to trigger a hypothesis change is by introducing a novel artifact not in the current inspiring set
- Core assumption: Set-driven constraint (Condition 1) properly models scientists that disregard experience order and repetition
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "when using an inspiring set, rather than a sequence of experiences, an agent actually requires novelty for transformational creativity to occur"
  - [section] Theorem 3 proves that set-driven scientists require novelty for transformativeness through logical contrapositive argument
  - [corpus] Weak - limited corpus coverage, but the theoretical framework aligns with formal learning theory
- Break condition: If set-driven constraint doesn't accurately model real creative agents, or if the logical proof has flaws

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The formal framework enables rigorous analysis of creativity concepts by providing precise definitions
- Mechanism: By mapping creativity concepts to formal learning theory structures (languages, texts, scientists), the paper enables mathematical proofs about relationships between properties
- Core assumption: The mapping between creativity concepts and formal learning theory structures is valid and meaningful
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This formalisation marks the beginning of a research branch we call Formal Creativity Theory"
  - [section] The paper systematically defines creativity-related terms using FLT structures and proves theorems about them
  - [corpus] Moderate - aligns with computational creativity theory efforts but corpus evidence is limited
- Break condition: If the mapping between creativity and FLT structures is inappropriate or the resulting theorems don't provide meaningful insights

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Recursive enumerable sets (r.e. sets)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses r.e. sets to formalize conceptual spaces and languages, which are foundational to the formal learning theory framework
  - Quick check question: Can you explain what it means for a set to be recursively enumerable and why this property matters for modeling conceptual spaces?

- Concept: Turing machines and computability
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on computability theory to define what constitutes a valid hypothesis and what can be learned, which is essential for the theoretical results
  - Quick check question: How does the Church-Turing thesis relate to the definition of scientists as functions from experience sequences to hypotheses?

- Concept: Formal learning theory concepts (texts, prefixes, identification)
  - Why needed here: The paper adapts FLT concepts to creativity, so understanding these foundational concepts is necessary to follow the formal definitions and proofs
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a text and a prefix in the formal learning theory framework, and how does this distinction enable the modeling of learning processes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Formal definitions (novelty VN, transformativeness VT r) -> Theoretical framework (FLT-based FCT) -> Proof mechanisms (theorems about property relationships)
- Critical path: Define formal properties → Map to FLT structures → Prove theorems about property relationships → Apply to creativity concepts
- Design tradeoffs: The formalism trades off practical implementability for theoretical rigor and generality; simpler definitions enable proofs but may miss nuances of real creativity
- Failure signatures: Incorrect proofs would invalidate theorems; definitions that don't capture creative concepts would make results meaningless; overly abstract framework might not apply to real systems
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement constant scientist (DVA) to verify Theorem 1 - check that novel artifacts don't trigger transformation
  2. Implement set-driven scientist to verify Theorem 3 - check that only novel artifacts trigger transformation
  3. Test alternative scientist types to find counterexamples to novelty-transformativeness relationship assumptions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do set-driven agents model human creativity when real humans appear sensitive to order and repetition in experiences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that set-driven scientists "might be disregarding some of the characteristics that make human creativity interesting, such as the fact that the same artifact can actually change one's mind more than once."
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes that novelty is necessary for transformational creativity in set-driven agents, but doesn't explore whether this assumption aligns with empirical observations of human creative behavior or what mechanisms humans use to handle repeated or ordered experiences.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of human and set-driven agent responses to repeated/ordered stimuli, or theoretical analysis of how to incorporate experience order/repetition into FCT models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the FCT framework be extended to model schemas beyond simple predicates (e.g., fuzzy sets or semi-orders)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention this as future work: "Additionally, we also aim to uncover new insights through the formal modeling of other assumptions... Another avenue involves considering schemas parameterized by various components, such as fates... or moving beyond predicates to embrace alternative schema representations like fuzzy sets or semi-orders."
- Why unresolved: The paper only implements schemas as simple dichotomic predicates for simplicity, but acknowledges this may not capture the full complexity of creative evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful proofs of theorems about novelty/transformativeness using alternative schema models, or demonstration that key results from the paper fail under more complex schema definitions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the practical implications of the finding that novelty is neither necessary nor sufficient for transformational creativity in general agents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors prove that "novel artefacts are neither necessary nor sufficient for transformational creativity when we consider the wide range of possible behaviours over a sequence of artefacts."
- Why unresolved: While the theoretical result is established, the paper doesn't explore how this finding should influence the design of computational creativity systems or what alternative strategies might be more effective.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing creativity systems designed around novelty versus those designed around other principles, or theoretical work identifying alternative properties that better characterize transformational creativity.

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework relies on formal learning theory abstractions that may not fully capture human creativity complexity
- Definitions of novelty and transformativeness are mathematically precise but their correspondence to real creative behavior requires further validation
- Practical applicability to real-world computational creativity systems remains speculative without empirical testing

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The logical proofs for Theorems 1-3 are mathematically sound given the stated definitions and assumptions. The distinction between general and set-driven agents is clearly articulated.

**Medium confidence**: The definitions of novelty and transformativeness as predicates over formal structures capture meaningful aspects of creative behavior, though their correspondence to human creativity concepts requires further validation.

**Low confidence**: The practical applicability of these formal results to real-world computational creativity systems remains speculative without empirical testing.

## Next Checks

1. Implement concrete examples of constant, ever-changing, and set-driven scientists to verify the theorem proofs produce expected outcomes
2. Test the framework with simple conceptual spaces and artifact generation processes to evaluate whether the formal properties align with intuitive notions of creativity
3. Conduct a case study applying the framework to analyze a specific creative domain (e.g., musical composition or visual art) to assess practical utility
