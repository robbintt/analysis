# ProxyLM: Predicting Language Model Performance on Multilingual Tasks via Proxy Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.09334
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09334
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 37.08x speedup over traditional methods in predicting multilingual LM performance

## Executive Summary
ProxyLM introduces a scalable framework for predicting language model performance on multilingual NLP tasks using proxy models as computational stand-ins. The framework achieves significant efficiency gains while maintaining high prediction accuracy across tasks including machine translation, intent classification, and slot filling. By leveraging proxy models to estimate target LM performance, ProxyLM reduces computational overhead by up to 37.08x compared to traditional evaluation methods. The approach demonstrates robustness to unseen languages and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by at least 1.78x in RMSE across multiple multilingual tasks.

## Method Summary
ProxyLM employs a two-stage prediction framework where proxy models serve as computationally efficient substitutes to estimate the performance of target language models on multilingual tasks. The framework trains proxy models on a subset of target tasks and languages, then uses these models to predict performance on unseen languages and tasks. The proxy models are designed to capture the essential performance characteristics of target LMs while requiring significantly less computational resources. This approach enables rapid evaluation of language model capabilities across diverse multilingual scenarios without the need for full-scale inference on each target model.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 37.08x speedup over traditional evaluation methods
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by at least 1.78x in RMSE
- Demonstrates robustness to unseen languages across multiple multilingual NLP tasks
- Maintains high prediction accuracy across machine translation, intent classification, and slot filling tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ProxyLM leverages the principle that smaller proxy models can capture the essential performance patterns of larger target models when properly trained on representative task subsets. The framework exploits correlations between model architectures and performance characteristics across different languages, allowing proxy models to generalize predictions to unseen languages and tasks. By focusing computational resources on strategic proxy model training rather than exhaustive target model evaluation, the system achieves substantial efficiency gains while preserving prediction accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

**Multilingual NLP tasks**: Understanding the diversity of tasks (translation, classification, slot filling) across multiple languages is essential for building representative proxy models. Quick check: Can the framework handle tasks with different output structures?

**Performance prediction**: The ability to estimate model performance without full evaluation requires understanding the relationship between model architecture, training data, and task-specific capabilities. Quick check: How well do proxy predictions correlate with actual performance?

**Computational efficiency**: The tradeoff between prediction accuracy and computational cost drives the design of proxy models and evaluation protocols. Quick check: What is the minimum viable proxy model size for acceptable accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Proxy models -> Performance prediction -> Target LM evaluation -> Multilingual task assessment

**Critical path**: The sequence from proxy model training through performance prediction to target LM evaluation represents the core workflow where efficiency gains are realized.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework balances proxy model size against prediction accuracy, with larger proxies providing better accuracy but reduced efficiency gains. Additionally, the selection of training tasks and languages for proxy models involves tradeoffs between coverage and computational cost.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance predictions may indicate insufficient proxy model capacity, inadequate training data diversity, or fundamental architectural differences between proxy and target models that limit generalization.

**First experiments**: 1) Train proxy models on a subset of languages and tasks, then evaluate prediction accuracy on held-out languages; 2) Compare different proxy model architectures to identify optimal size-accuracy tradeoffs; 3) Test framework robustness by evaluating predictions on truly unseen language families.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations
- Primary validation on transformer-based models may limit generalization to other architectures
- Reported speedup depends on specific evaluation infrastructure that may vary across research settings
- Validation on a finite set of languages leaves uncertainty about performance on truly low-resource or typologically distant languages

## Confidence

**High**: Multilingual task predictions and RMSE improvements
**Medium**: Computational efficiency claims and speedup metrics

## Next Checks

1. Test ProxyLM's predictive accuracy on non-transformer architectures (e.g., recurrent or hybrid models) to verify architecture-agnostic generalization
2. Evaluate performance on genuinely low-resource languages (fewer than 1000 parallel sentences) to stress-test the "robust to unseen languages" claim
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of proxy model size versus training data diversity to determine optimal resource allocation
