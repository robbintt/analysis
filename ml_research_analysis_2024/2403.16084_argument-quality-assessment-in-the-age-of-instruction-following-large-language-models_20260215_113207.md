- Primary result: Instruction-following LLMs can address longstanding challenges in argument quality assessment by leveraging knowledge across contexts

## Executive Summary
This position paper explores how instruction-following large language models (LLMs) can transform argument quality assessment in computational argumentation research. The authors identify three key research directions: conceptual notions of quality, influence factors, and computational models. They argue that LLMs' ability to leverage knowledge across contexts through instruction-following enables more reliable quality assessment than traditional supervised learning approaches. The paper proposes a systematic fine-tuning approach that combines argumentation theories, scenarios, and problem-solving methods to create more effective assessment models.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a blueprint for systematically fine-tuning instruction-following LLMs for argument quality assessment. This involves creating argumentation-specific instruction datasets from existing research, applying instruction fine-tuning techniques (potentially using reinforcement learning with human feedback), and evaluating performance on both absolute and relative assessment tasks. The method emphasizes the need to address diversity in quality notions and subjectivity in perception through carefully designed instructions.

## Key Results
- Identified 83 recent papers on argument quality assessment, highlighting the need for new approaches to handle subjectivity and diverse quality notions
- Proposed instruction fine-tuning as a solution to overcome the separation between input and output spaces in traditional supervised learning
- Outlined opportunities for real-world applications including debating technologies, argument search, and discussion moderation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Instruction-following LLMs overcome the separation between input and output spaces that plagues traditional supervised learning for argument quality assessment
- Mechanism: By representing tasks, inputs, and outputs in a shared natural language space, LLMs can leverage knowledge across contexts and tasks that traditional models cannot access
- Core assumption: The knowledge needed to assess argument quality (quality notions, influence factors, ethical constraints) has already been processed during LLM pretraining
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "instruction-following large language models (LLMs) to leverage knowledge across contexts enable a much more reliable assessment"
  - [section]: "Fine-tuning LLMs on general-purpose instruction data... will help them solve language modeling tasks in principle"
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers, including "Are Large Language Models Reliable Argument Quality Annotators?" suggesting this is an active research question
- Break condition: If the knowledge needed for argument quality assessment was not processed during pretraining, or if the LLM cannot effectively access this knowledge through instructions

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Systematic instruction fine-tuning can address the subjectivity and diversity challenges in argument quality assessment
- Mechanism: By providing explicit instructions about quality dimensions, audience context, and assessment goals, LLMs can produce more consistent and context-appropriate assessments than human annotators
- Core assumption: The subjectivity in argument quality assessment comes primarily from inconsistent application of quality notions rather than inherent subjectivity in the concepts themselves
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "identify the diversity of quality notions and the subjectiveness of their perception as the main hurdles"
  - [section]: "We expect that most knowledge about quality notions and their interdependencies... has already been processed by leading LLMs"
  - [corpus]: "Large Language Models in Argument Mining: A Survey" suggests active research in this area
- Break condition: If the inherent subjectivity of argument quality cannot be meaningfully reduced through instruction fine-tuning, or if instructions cannot capture the necessary context

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs can handle both absolute and relative assessment modes through instruction fine-tuning
- Mechanism: Instructions can specify whether assessment should be absolute (e.g., does this argument have acceptable premises?) or relative (e.g., are these premises more acceptable than alternatives?), allowing the same model to handle both modes
- Core assumption: The distinction between absolute and relative assessment can be clearly operationalized through instructions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We see a mix of absolute and relative assessment as best approximating how humans assess quality"
  - [section]: "Instruction fine-tuning should prepare an LLM for dealing with both parts"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence found, but the question of "Are Large Language Models Reliable Argument Quality Annotators?" suggests this is being explored
- Break condition: If the operationalization of absolute vs relative assessment proves too complex for instruction-following, or if the modes require fundamentally different architectures

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Argument quality dimensions (logical, rhetorical, dialectical)
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on a taxonomy of 15 quality dimensions from Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), and understanding these is crucial for designing appropriate instructions
  - Quick check question: What are the three main categories of argument quality dimensions mentioned in the paper?

- Concept: Instruction fine-tuning vs traditional fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The paper argues that instruction fine-tuning is superior to traditional fine-tuning for argument quality assessment because it allows knowledge sharing across contexts
  - Quick check question: How does instruction fine-tuning differ from traditional transformer fine-tuning according to the paper?

- Concept: Subjectivity in argument quality assessment
  - Why needed here: The paper identifies subjectivity as a key challenge, and understanding its sources is crucial for designing instruction fine-tuning approaches
  - Quick check question: According to the paper, what are the two main sources of subjectivity in argument quality assessment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base LLM (e.g., Alpaca, GPT-4) -> Instruction fine-tuning pipeline -> Prompt design system -> Fact-checking module (optional) -> Evaluation framework

- Critical path: Acquire base instruction-following LLM -> Create argumentation-specific instruction dataset -> Apply instruction fine-tuning -> Design systematic prompts for specific tasks -> Evaluate on mixed absolute/relative benchmarks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Size vs speed: Larger models may perform better but be slower and more expensive
  - Instruction specificity vs generalization: More specific instructions may work better for specific tasks but reduce generalizability
  - Fact-checking vs hallucination: Adding fact-checking can reduce hallucinations but may slow down the system

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent assessments across similar arguments
  - Failure to follow specific instructions in prompts
  - Hallucinations of argument-specific facts
  - Over-reliance on length or other spurious correlations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare instruction-following LLM vs traditional fine-tuned model on a standard argument quality dataset
  2. Test instruction-following LLM with different instruction styles (detailed vs minimal)
  3. Evaluate same model on both absolute and relative assessment tasks to test mode-switching

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can instruction-following LLMs be systematically fine-tuned to assess argument quality across diverse quality notions and subjective perceptions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes a blueprint for systematically fine-tuning LLMs with argumentation theories, scenarios, and problem-solving methods to address the challenges of diverse quality notions and subjectivity.
- Why unresolved: While the paper outlines a blueprint, the specific methods for systematically fine-tuning LLMs with diverse quality notions and subjective perceptions are not fully developed or tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed fine-tuning methods in accurately assessing argument quality across various quality notions and subjective perceptions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the ethical implications of using LLMs for argument quality assessment, particularly in sensitive applications like digital education and opinion formation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses ethical concerns related to the use of LLMs for argument quality assessment, including factual errors, social biases, and privacy implications.
- Why unresolved: The paper raises ethical concerns but does not provide concrete solutions or guidelines for addressing these issues in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or frameworks that demonstrate how to mitigate ethical risks when using LLMs for argument quality assessment in sensitive applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can instruction-following LLMs be used to improve the quality of arguments, and what are the limitations of such improvements?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential of LLMs to improve argument quality through targeted hints and feedback, but acknowledges limitations such as the need for careful operationalization and the potential for biases.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests potential improvements, the specific methods and limitations of using LLMs to improve argument quality are not fully explored or validated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the quality of arguments improved by LLMs with those improved by human experts, along with an analysis of the limitations and biases of LLM-based improvements.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical evidence that LLMs can reliably access and apply argumentation-specific knowledge through instructions alone
- The proposed systematic instruction fine-tuning approach lacks detailed specifications for creating effective instruction datasets
- The paper does not provide concrete validation results to support its central claims about instruction-following LLMs' superiority

## Confidence

- High confidence: The identification of key challenges in argument quality assessment (diversity of quality notions, subjectivity of perception)
- Medium confidence: The claim that instruction-following LLMs can leverage knowledge across contexts more effectively than traditional models
- Low confidence: The assertion that systematic instruction fine-tuning will produce reliable and consistent argument quality assessments without significant bias or hallucination issues

## Next Checks

1. Test whether instruction-following LLMs can distinguish between logical, rhetorical, and dialectical quality dimensions with accuracy comparable to human experts across diverse argument types
2. Evaluate the same LLM's performance on both absolute (e.g., "does this argument have acceptable premises?") and relative (e.g., "are these premises more acceptable than alternatives?") assessment modes to verify the claimed flexibility
3. Measure hallucination rates when LLMs assess fact-dependent quality dimensions, comparing instruction-following approaches against traditional fine-tuning methods
