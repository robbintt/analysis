# HeCiX: Integrating Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models for Biomedical Research

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.14030
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14030
- Authors: Prerana Sanjay Kulkarni; Muskaan Jain; Disha Sheshanarayana; Srinivasan Parthiban
- Reference count: 15
- One-line primary result: HeCiX-KG integrates ClinicalTrials.gov and Hetionet data to enable natural language querying of biomedical knowledge, achieving high RAGAS scores for clinical trial-related queries.

## Executive Summary
HeCiX introduces HeCiX-KG, a knowledge graph integrating ClinicalTrials.gov and Hetionet data, to address the high failure rate of clinical trials by providing comprehensive biomedical research resources. The system leverages GPT-4 and LangChain to enable natural language querying of the knowledge graph, making it accessible to clinical researchers. Evaluation using RAGAS metrics demonstrates promising performance, with high scores in faithfulness, answer relevance, and context precision, though context recall is lower.

## Method Summary
HeCiX constructs HeCiX-KG by integrating data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Hetionet, using the Disease node as the primary connector. The system then uses LangChain's GraphCypherQAChain to translate natural language queries into Cypher queries, which are executed on HeCiX-KG and interpreted by GPT-4. The evaluation employs the RAGAS framework to assess performance across four metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context precision, and context recall. The method is tested on six specific diseases and compared against GPT-4 and Claude 3 Sonnet in zero-shot scenarios.

## Key Results
- HeCiX-KG successfully integrates ClinicalTrials.gov and Hetionet data using the Disease node as a connector
- The system achieves RAGAS scores of 0.8572 (faithfulness), 0.9340 (answer relevance), 0.9202 (context precision), and 0.6654 (context recall)
- HeCiX outperforms GPT-4 and Claude 3 Sonnet in zero-shot scenarios for clinical trial-related queries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: HeCiX integrates heterogeneous biomedical data sources to overcome data fragmentation in drug discovery.
- Mechanism: Constructs HeCiX-KG by extracting disease-relevant subgraphs from Hetionet and ClinicalTrials.gov records, merging them through shared Disease nodes.
- Core assumption: Clinical trial outcomes and biological knowledge are complementary and can be meaningfully linked through shared disease entities.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "HeCiX-KG combines data on previously conducted clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov, and domain expertise on diseases and genes from Hetionet." [section 3] "HeCiX-KG is constructed from two primary sources of data, Hetionet and ClinicalTrials.gov... connecting biological knowledge with clinical trial data."
- Break condition: If the Disease node cannot serve as a reliable anchor for merging disparate data types.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LangChain + GPT-4 enables natural language querying of the knowledge graph, improving accessibility for biomedical researchers.
- Mechanism: Uses LangChain's GraphCypherQAChain to translate user natural language queries into Cypher queries, execute them on HeCiX-KG, and return results through GPT-4 interpretation.
- Core assumption: LLMs can reliably generate valid Cypher queries from natural language prompts and interpret graph query results meaningfully.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.2] "HeCiX translates natural language queries into CQL (Cypher Query Language) queries, which makes it possible to efficiently retrieve relevant context from the knowledge graph."
- Break condition: If GPT-4 generates syntactically incorrect Cypher queries or misinterprets graph query results.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Evaluation using RAGAS metrics demonstrates that HeCiX provides faithful and relevant answers to clinical research queries.
- Mechanism: Evaluates the system on faithfulness (0.8572), answer relevance (0.9340), context precision (0.9202), and context recall (0.6654) using RAGAS framework.
- Core assumption: RAGAS metrics accurately capture the quality of answers generated from knowledge graph retrieval.
- Evidence anchors: [section 6.1] "We utilized the RAGAS framework to evaluate our model's performance. The framework calculates several key metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context precision, and context recall."
- Break condition: If RAGAS metrics do not align with actual user needs or if the evaluation dataset is not representative of real clinical research queries.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Construction and Schema Design
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to integrate heterogeneous data sources into a unified schema is crucial for building HeCiX-KG.
  - Quick check question: What role does the Disease node play in connecting Hetionet and ClinicalTrials.gov data in HeCiX-KG?

- Concept: Natural Language Processing and Query Generation
  - Why needed here: Converting natural language queries into structured Cypher queries is central to HeCiX's usability.
  - Quick check question: How does LangChain's GraphCypherQAChain component facilitate the translation between natural language and Cypher queries?

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Evaluation
  - Why needed here: RAGAS metrics are used to evaluate the system's performance in retrieving and generating relevant answers.
  - Quick check question: What does the context recall metric measure in the context of HeCiX's evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ClinicalTrials.gov data -> HeCiX-KG (knowledge graph) -> LangChain processing -> GPT-4 query generation and interpretation -> User response
- Critical path: User query → LangChain processing → GPT-4 Cypher generation → HeCiX-KG query → GPT-4 result interpretation → User response
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing comprehensiveness of HeCiX-KG (larger graph = more data but slower queries) vs. query response time; relying on GPT-4 API vs. self-hosting for cost and latency.
- Failure signatures: Incorrect Cypher queries from GPT-4, incomplete data integration leading to missing connections, low RAGAS scores indicating poor retrieval or generation quality.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test Cypher query generation with simple natural language queries to verify GPT-4's accuracy.
  2. Validate knowledge graph integration by checking if disease-gene-treatment relationships are correctly represented.
  3. Run RAGAS evaluation on a small set of queries to ensure the evaluation pipeline is working correctly.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of HeCiX scale with an increase in the number of diseases and clinical trials included in the knowledge graph?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions "Uncertainty of the model's performance as the knowledge graph expands" as a limitation.
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation only covers six specific diseases. The impact of expanding the knowledge graph to include more diseases and clinical trials on the system's performance is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with progressively larger knowledge graphs covering a wider range of diseases and clinical trials, and evaluating the system's performance metrics at each stage.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does HeCiX's performance compare to domain-specific biomedical knowledge bases and LLMs when answering questions that require both clinical trial data and biological knowledge?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that HeCiX "outperforms GPT-4 and Claude 3 Sonnet in zero-shot scenarios for clinical trial-related queries" and discusses the system's ability to combine clinical trial data with biological knowledge from Hetionet.
- Why unresolved: While the paper compares HeCiX to general LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Sonnet, it doesn't compare its performance to other domain-specific biomedical knowledge bases or LLMs that might be better suited for answering such questions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comprehensive comparison of HeCiX's performance against other biomedical knowledge bases and domain-specific LLMs on a standardized set of questions that require both clinical trial data and biological knowledge.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of incorporating SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms) into HeCiX-KG on the system's ability to standardize clinical terms and improve query results?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion mentions "The scope of future enhancements for HeCiX could include adding SNOMED CT to the knowledge graph for better clinical term standardization."
- Why unresolved: The current HeCiX-KG does not include SNOMED CT, and the potential benefits of incorporating it are not yet quantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing SNOMED CT in the knowledge graph and evaluating the system's performance on term standardization and query accuracy before and after its incorporation.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies heavily on automated RAGAS metrics without direct human expert validation
- System performance tested only on six specific diseases, limiting generalizability
- No error analysis for Cypher query generation failures or handling of ambiguous/out-of-distribution queries

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Knowledge graph integration mechanism is well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: LangChain + GPT-4 querying mechanism is described but lacks detailed error handling or performance metrics for query generation accuracy
- **Low confidence**: Clinical utility claims are supported primarily by automated metrics rather than validation from domain experts or real-world usage scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human evaluation study where biomedical researchers assess the clinical relevance and accuracy of HeCiX responses compared to manual literature review
2. Perform stress testing with adversarial queries (e.g., ambiguous disease names, compound queries, queries about diseases not in the knowledge graph) to evaluate system robustness
3. Compare HeCiX performance against specialized biomedical search tools (e.g., PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov advanced search) using identical query sets to establish practical utility
