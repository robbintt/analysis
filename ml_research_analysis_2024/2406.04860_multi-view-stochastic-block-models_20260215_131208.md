# Multi-View Stochastic Block Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.04860
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04860
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Exponentially better sample complexity (O(log k) vs O(k²)) for multi-view graph clustering using late fusion approach

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces multi-view stochastic block models (MV-SBM) to address clustering in settings with multiple graph views of the same underlying community structure. The key insight is that naively combining graphs via early fusion leads to suboptimal results. The authors propose a late fusion approach that first clusters each view separately using a novel pair-wise weak recovery algorithm, then merges the results. This method provably requires only O(log k) observations per view to achieve weak recovery, exponentially better than the O(k²) needed for early fusion. Information-theoretic lower bounds confirm this gap is inherent to the model.

## Method Summary
The proposed method operates in two phases: first, it applies a pair-wise weak recovery algorithm to each individual graph view to obtain edge-level correlation estimates. Then, it constructs a directed graph where each vertex points to its top n/k neighbors based on aggregated correlation scores across views. Finally, a second moment rounding algorithm is applied to this directed graph's adjacency matrix to produce the final community assignments. This late fusion approach exploits the fact that individual views provide complementary information about pairwise relationships, which can be combined more efficiently than combining the raw graphs themselves.

## Key Results
- Late fusion approach requires only O(log k) observations per view for weak recovery
- Exponential improvement over early fusion which requires O(k²) observations
- Information-theoretic lower bounds confirm the sample complexity gap is inherent
- Experiments validate superiority of late fusion over early fusion on synthetic data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The late fusion approach works by first extracting pairwise relationship information from each graph view separately, then combining these estimates. Each view provides noisy but complementary information about which vertices belong to the same community. By first clustering each view individually (using pair-wise weak recovery), the method extracts the maximum possible signal from each graph. The subsequent fusion step then combines these estimates in a way that amplifies true community structure while averaging out noise. This is fundamentally more efficient than early fusion, which tries to combine raw graphs before clustering and thus requires quadratically more samples to achieve the same recovery quality.

## Foundational Learning

**Stochastic Block Models (SBM)**: Random graph models where vertices are partitioned into communities with edge probabilities depending on community membership. Why needed: Forms the theoretical foundation for modeling community structure in graphs. Quick check: Can implement basic SBM generator and verify edge densities match theoretical expectations.

**Weak Recovery**: The task of outputting a labeling that has non-trivial correlation with the true community labels. Why needed: Provides the right notion of success for community detection when exact recovery is impossible. Quick check: Can measure weak recovery quality using normalized mutual information or accuracy metrics.

**Pair-wise Weak Recovery**: Estimating whether two specific vertices belong to the same community. Why needed: Forms the basic building block for the late fusion approach. Quick check: Can verify pair-wise recovery accuracy on synthetic SBMs with known communities.

**Second Moment Method**: A technique for proving existence of objects by analyzing the variance of a random variable. Why needed: Used in the rounding algorithm to convert pairwise estimates into final community assignments. Quick check: Can implement basic second moment rounding on a synthetic correlation matrix.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Pair-wise weak recovery (per view) -> Directed graph construction -> Second moment rounding -> Community assignments

**Critical Path**: The most critical components are the pair-wise weak recovery algorithm and the second moment rounding step. The pair-wise weak recovery must achieve sufficient correlation guarantees for each view, while the rounding step must successfully translate the aggregated pairwise information into coherent community assignments.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades off computational complexity (running multiple recovery algorithms) for sample efficiency. An alternative would be to use a single global algorithm, but this would require quadratically more samples. The design prioritizes sample efficiency over computational simplicity.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- If pair-wise weak recovery fails to achieve required correlation, community assignments will be essentially random
- If too few views are available relative to log k / C², many vertices will be misclassified
- If the second moment rounding fails, the final output may not respect community structure

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify pair-wise weak recovery algorithm achieves claimed correlation guarantees on synthetic SBMs
2. Test late fusion approach with varying numbers of views to confirm O(log k) scaling
3. Compare late vs early fusion performance across different k values to verify exponential gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: What is the exact phase transition threshold for weak recovery in the multi-view SBM model, as a function of the number of views, edge densities, and biases? The paper provides an algorithm achieving weak recovery with O(log k) views under certain conditions, and an information-theoretic lower bound showing at least Ω(log k / CT) views are needed, but does not characterize the precise threshold for all parameter regimes.

**Open Question 2**: Can the results be generalized to multi-view models where each view may have 2 ≤ kℓ ≤ k communities, rather than exactly 2 communities per view? The paper notes that while the ideas "translate in principle" to these settings, the correctness appears difficult to prove.

**Open Question 3**: Are the guarantees of Theorem 3.1 (pair-wise weak recovery for unbalanced 2-community SBMs) necessary for achieving Theorem 1.2, or are they only sufficient? The paper conjectures that "other estimators provide the guarantees of Theorem 3.1" but uses these specific guarantees as a black-box.

## Limitations

- Theoretical results rely on sophisticated robust algorithms whose implementation details are not fully specified
- Theoretical guarantees assume specific bounds on the number of views that may not hold in practice
- Experiments are limited to synthetic data without validation on real-world multi-view graphs

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The exponential gap between late and early fusion sample complexity (O(log k) vs O(k²)) under the MV-SBM model.

**Medium confidence**: The general applicability of the late fusion framework to practical multi-view clustering problems.

**Low confidence**: The scalability of the proposed algorithms to large graphs and many views.

## Next Checks

1. Implement the pair-wise weak recovery algorithm (Theorem 3.1) and verify it achieves the claimed correlation guarantees on synthetic SBMs.

2. Test the late fusion approach on real-world multi-view graph datasets to assess practical performance and robustness to noise.

3. Analyze the computational complexity and scalability of the algorithm as the number of views t and graph size n grow.
