# P3LS: Partial Least Squares under Privacy Preservation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2401.14884
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14884
- **Reference count**: 28
- **Primary result**: Novel federated learning approach for privacy-preserving cross-organizational process modeling using encrypted SVD-based PLS

## Executive Summary
P3LS introduces a federated learning framework for collaborative Partial Least Squares modeling that preserves data privacy across organizational boundaries. The method uses orthogonal encryption masks generated by a trusted authority to allow multiple companies to jointly train PLS models without exposing raw data. By leveraging properties of SVD under orthogonal transformations, P3LS maintains numerical equivalence to centralized PLS while ensuring that a central service provider cannot recover the original data. The framework also includes an incentive mechanism based on variance explained to quantify participant contributions and motivate data sharing.

## Method Summary
P3LS operates through a trusted authority that generates random orthogonal masks for data encryption. Each participant encrypts their local data blocks using these masks before sending to a central service provider. The CSP aggregates the encrypted data and performs SVD-based PLS decomposition, producing encrypted model components. Participants then collaboratively decrypt only the components relevant to their contribution using shared and private keys. The method ensures that the PLS decomposition results are mathematically equivalent to those from centralized data while maintaining privacy through the orthogonal encryption transformations.

## Key Results
- P3LS maintains numerical equivalence to centralized PLS through orthogonal transformation properties
- The method successfully prevents the CSP from recovering raw data from encrypted inputs and outputs
- Experimental results on synthetic datasets show P3LS outperforms local models and matches centralized PLS in prediction accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: P3LS enables collaborative PLS training across organizations without exposing raw data
- Mechanism: Data holders encrypt their local data blocks using orthogonal masks (H_i, G) generated by a trusted authority. The CSP aggregates encrypted data and performs SVD-based PLS, producing encrypted model components. Data holders then collaboratively decrypt only the components relevant to their contribution using shared and private keys.
- Core assumption: The encryption is lossless and the CSP cannot reverse-engineer raw data from the aggregated encrypted data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "P3LS leverages federated singular value decomposition to allow multiple companies to collaboratively train a PLS model without sharing raw data"
  - [section] "According to Equation 1, the results of performing SVD on S and S′ are convertible" and "it has been proved that the CSP cannot recover the original data"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly relevant papers found in corpus
- Break condition: If any participant colludes with the TA or CSP by sharing encryption keys, or if the orthogonal masks are not truly random and independent

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: P3LS maintains numerical equivalence to centralized PLS while preserving privacy
- Mechanism: The orthogonal encryption transformations preserve the singular values and allow conversion between encrypted and original singular vectors through linear transformations. This ensures that the PLS decomposition results (T, P, Q, R, B) are mathematically equivalent to those obtained from centralized data.
- Core assumption: Orthogonal transformations preserve the PLS decomposition properties
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The method ensures numerical equivalence to centralized PLS while preserving confidentiality"
  - [section] "the relationships between the PLS and P3LS model components are: T = A⊤T′, W = HW′, P = H P′, Q = GQ′, R = HR′, B = HB′G⊤"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly relevant papers found in corpus
- Break condition: If the orthogonal matrices are not properly generated or if numerical precision errors accumulate during the transformation process

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: P3LS provides an incentive mechanism based on variance explained to quantify participant contributions
- Mechanism: Each participant's contribution is quantified by R²_XiY, which measures how much variance in the target variable Y can be explained by their local data X_i using their local regression coefficients. This metric is calculated securely without revealing raw data through masked aggregation and SVD.
- Core assumption: Variance explained is a valid proxy for data contribution quality and relevance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we propose a mechanism for determining the relevance of the contributed data to the problem being addressed, thus creating a basis for quantifying the contribution of participants"
  - [section] "The explained variance, represented as R²_i, quantifies the amount of variance present in the data block X_i that can be described by the latent variables T within the P3LS model"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly relevant papers found in corpus
- Break condition: If the relationship between local features and target variables is non-linear or if important interactions exist that variance explained cannot capture

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - Why needed here: P3LS is built on SVD-based PLS, and the federated version relies on properties of SVD under orthogonal transformations
  - Quick check question: What properties of SVD make it suitable for privacy-preserving federated learning?

- Concept: Federated Learning (FL) and Vertical Federated Learning (VFL)
  - Why needed here: P3LS is a VFL approach where different parties hold different feature blocks of the same samples
  - Quick check question: How does VFL differ from Horizontal FL, and why is VFL more appropriate for cross-organizational process modeling?

- Concept: Orthogonal Matrix Transformations
  - Why needed here: The privacy mechanism relies on multiplying data by random orthogonal matrices that preserve certain mathematical properties while making data unrecoverable
  - Quick check question: What properties do orthogonal matrices preserve, and why are these properties important for maintaining numerical equivalence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: TA -> FCs + LC -> CSP -> FCs + LC -> TA
- Critical path:
  1. TA generates keys and distributes to participants
  2. Each participant encrypts their local data and sends to CSP
  3. CSP aggregates encrypted data and performs SVD-based PLS
  4. CSP distributes encrypted model components
  5. Participants collaboratively decrypt relevant components
  6. Participants calculate their contribution metrics
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Security vs. Performance: Additional encryption/decryption steps add computational overhead
  - Privacy vs. Insight: Withholding certain model components (like local rotation matrices) enhances security but limits local insights
  - Centralization vs. Distribution: CSP performs heavy computation but doesn't see raw data
- Failure signatures:
  - Numerical precision errors in orthogonal transformations
  - Inconsistent model component recovery due to communication failures
  - Security breaches from key sharing or collusion
  - Performance degradation compared to centralized approach
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify numerical equivalence: Compare model components from P3LS and centralized PLS on synthetic data
  2. Test privacy preservation: Attempt to recover raw data from encrypted inputs/outputs at CSP
  3. Evaluate contribution metrics: Validate R²_XiY calculations across different data quality scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can P3LS be extended to handle multiple label contributors across different stages of the value chain?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly mentions this as a future research direction, stating "Another extension of P3LS that will be investigated is handling scenarios where there are multiple label contributors."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation assumes only one label contributor, and extending it to multiple contributors requires changes in key generation and encrypted data aggregation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A working implementation demonstrating secure data aggregation and model training with multiple label contributors, along with validation of prediction accuracy and privacy guarantees.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the performance implications of P3LS in real-world manufacturing datasets compared to synthetic data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge that "we aim to validate the effectiveness of P3LS in real-life datasets, which tend to be more intricate" and note that their current evaluation is on synthetic data.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates P3LS on simulated datasets, and real-world data may have different characteristics such as noise levels, missing values, and data distribution patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing P3LS performance on real manufacturing datasets against centralized PLS and local models, including metrics like prediction accuracy, computation time, and scalability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can P3LS be optimized for online batch process monitoring where data arrives incrementally?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses this as a future extension, stating "we aim to investigate the scenarios where there are multiple label contributors" and mentions the challenge of handling incomplete data in online mode.
- Why unresolved: The current P3LS implementation assumes complete batch data is available upfront, but online monitoring requires handling partial data streams and updating models in real-time.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified P3LS algorithm that can handle incremental data updates, along with experimental validation showing comparable performance to offline methods while maintaining privacy guarantees.

## Limitations
- The security guarantees rely entirely on the trusted authority model, creating a single point of trust that could compromise the entire system if breached
- No formal cryptographic proofs are provided for the privacy guarantees, only empirical demonstrations
- The orthogonal mask generation assumes perfect randomness and independence, which may not hold in practice
- The contribution metric (R²_XiY) may not capture complex feature interactions or non-linear relationships

## Confidence
- Numerical equivalence claim: High confidence - Supported by mathematical derivations and orthogonal transformation properties
- Privacy preservation claim: Medium confidence - Relies on orthogonal encryption but lacks formal security proofs
- Incentive mechanism validity: Medium confidence - Variance explained is a reasonable metric but may not capture all aspects of data contribution quality

## Next Checks
1. Conduct formal cryptographic security analysis to verify that encrypted data cannot be reverse-engineered from aggregated outputs
2. Test system robustness under realistic adversarial scenarios including collusion between participants and the CSP
3. Evaluate the incentive mechanism across diverse real-world datasets to verify that R²_XiY accurately reflects data contribution quality and motivates participation
