- One-line primary result: AdaptIoT achieves 98.33% accuracy in adaptive worker-machine interaction detection using interactive causality-enabled self-labeling

## Executive Summary
AdaptIoT is a cyber manufacturing IoT platform that enables adaptive machine learning deployment in small and medium manufacturing environments through interactive causality-enabled self-labeling. The system addresses the challenge of model adaptation to local data distribution shifts without manual intervention, using causal knowledge graphs to coordinate task models, effect state detectors, and interaction time models for continuous learning. A field demonstration in a university makerspace validated the system's reliability, achieving up to 98.33% accuracy in worker-machine interaction detection while maintaining real-time performance.

## Method Summary
AdaptIoT implements a containerized microservice architecture with a Kafka-based streaming pipeline to deploy adaptive ML models across manufacturing environments. The system uses a self-labeling service that leverages causal knowledge graphs to automatically extract labeled data from sensor streams by coordinating task models, effect state detectors, and interaction time models. The architecture integrates edge sensors, data streaming, ML services, and a frontend through standard interfaces, enabling scalable deployment and model retraining without manual data labeling.

## Key Results
- Achieves 98.33% accuracy in worker-machine interaction detection in field demonstration
- Supports up to 388k messages/second throughput with 1-second latency
- Theoretical capacity for 13.2k time-series edge services using standard configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Self-labeling improves adaptive ML model accuracy without manual data labeling
- Mechanism: Causal KG identifies cause-effect pairs, ESD detects effect transitions, ITM predicts interaction time, enabling automatic extraction of labeled cause data
- Core assumption: Cause-effect relationships remain stable despite data distribution shifts
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "automatically adapting and personalizing ML models after deployment to counter data distribution shifts"
  - [section II] "Self-labeling begins with selecting two causally connected nodes within a dynamic causal knowledge graph (KG)"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers discuss causality and adaptive ML but don't specifically validate this mechanism
- Break condition: If cause-effect relationships themselves shift or if interaction time predictions become unreliable

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Microservice architecture enables scalable, portable ML deployment for SMMs
- Mechanism: Containerized services provide modular, horizontally scalable components that can be easily deployed across heterogeneous hardware
- Core assumption: Docker containers and standard interfaces can abstract away hardware differences
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AdaptIoT employs a containerized microservice architecture to deliver a scalable and portable solution for small and medium-sized manufacturers"
  - [section III] "AdaptIoT employs a containerized microservice architecture that can easily integrate future capabilities"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers mention IoT and microservices but don't specifically address this architecture pattern
- Break condition: If container orchestration overhead becomes prohibitive or if hardware-specific optimizations are needed

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Real-time streaming pipeline enables low-latency adaptive learning
- Mechanism: Kafka message queue routes high-throughput sensor data to ML services with sub-second latency, enabling near real-time model updates
- Core assumption: Message queue throughput can handle sensor data rates without becoming bottleneck
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV.C] "The maximum throughput of a single consumer is 388k msg/s, which is equivalent to 92.5 MB/s"
  - [section IV.D] "theoretically, using 1 Gbit, the system can support about 60 cameras simultaneously"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers mention streaming and IoT but don't provide specific performance benchmarks
- Break condition: If data generation rate exceeds processing capacity or if network bandwidth becomes constrained

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal Knowledge Graphs and domain knowledge representation
  - Why needed here: Enables identification of cause-effect relationships for self-labeling workflow
  - Quick check question: How would you represent a causal relationship between "worker gesture" and "machine power consumption" in a KG?

- Concept: Interactive causality and temporal state machines
  - Why needed here: Allows modeling of dynamic cause-effect relationships with time-varying interaction delays
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between a static causal graph and the dynamic state machine approach used here?

- Concept: Microservice architecture and containerization
  - Why needed here: Enables scalable, portable deployment of heterogeneous ML services across manufacturing environments
  - Quick check question: How does the unit service model abstract different types of services into a common interface?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Edge Services (sensors, PLCs, external apps) → Data Streaming Manager (Kafka) → Storage (InfluxDB, MongoDB) → ML Services (Task Models, ESDs, ITMs) → Interactive Causality Engine (Neo4j KG, SLB Service, SLB Trainer) → Frontend
- Critical path: Sensor data → Kafka → ML service inference → SLB workflow (ESD → ITM → cause state mapping) → Model retraining
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Kafka partitions vs. consumer groups for scalability
  - Real-time vs. batch processing for self-labeled data
  - Centralized KG vs. distributed causality knowledge
- Failure signatures:
  - Kafka lag increasing indicates data ingestion bottleneck
  - SLB service timeout suggests causality resolution issues
  - ML service errors point to model deployment problems
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Deploy single sensor node streaming to Kafka, verify end-to-end latency < 1s
  2. Implement and test basic ESD service with mock data, verify state transition detection
  3. Set up self-labeling workflow with two mock services, verify automatic label propagation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does temporal random shift as data augmentation impact the performance of self-labeling in adaptive ML, particularly when interaction time inference introduces inaccuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that temporal random shift as data augmentation adversely affects the self-labeling accuracy and references [38] for a qualitative explanation involving motion smoothness and interaction time deviation.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions the hypothesis that inaccuracy from interaction time inference is equivalent to temporal random shift but notes that this requires deeper research in the future.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing self-labeling performance with and without temporal random shift across various interaction time deviations and motion smoothness levels.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the maximum scalability limit of the AdaptIoT system in terms of the number of supported edge services, and how does this scale with varying data rates and system configurations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides baseline characterization results, including a theoretical maximum of 13.2k time-series edge services based on system configuration, but acknowledges that higher performance can be achieved with proper scaling.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides theoretical and realistic system capability tests but does not explore the upper limits or scalability under different configurations and data rates.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic scalability testing with increasing numbers of edge services and varying data rates to identify bottlenecks and performance degradation points.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the AdaptIoT system handle data distribution shifts in real-world manufacturing environments, and what mechanisms are in place to ensure model robustness under such shifts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that self-labeling is particularly beneficial in scenarios with data distribution shifts but does not provide detailed mechanisms or results for handling such shifts in real-world scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the system's efficacy in a controlled experiment but lacks comprehensive testing under varying real-world conditions with data distribution shifts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Deployment and evaluation of the AdaptIoT system in diverse manufacturing environments with varying data distribution shifts, including monitoring and adapting model performance over time.

## Limitations
- System performance validated only through single field demonstration in university makerspace
- Causal knowledge graph construction and maintenance process not fully detailed
- Limited testing across diverse manufacturing scenarios and equipment types

## Confidence
- High confidence: The microservice architecture design and streaming pipeline implementation details
- Medium confidence: The self-labeling workflow mechanism and its integration with causal knowledge graphs
- Medium confidence: The field demonstration results showing 98.33% accuracy in worker-machine interaction detection

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Equipment Validation**: Deploy AdaptIoT with the same causal KG and self-labeling workflow across at least three different types of manufacturing equipment (e.g., CNC machine, robotic arm, conveyor system) to assess generalizability and identify domain-specific limitations.

2. **Scalability Stress Test**: Conduct controlled experiments to determine the maximum sustainable data ingestion rate and model update frequency under varying sensor counts, data modalities, and network conditions to identify potential bottlenecks in the Kafka streaming pipeline and ML service coordination.

3. **Long-term Adaptation Study**: Implement a longitudinal deployment (minimum 3 months) tracking model performance drift, self-labeling accuracy degradation, and manual intervention requirements to quantify the system's ability to maintain accuracy without human oversight over extended periods.
