# Low-resource speech recognition and dialect identification of Irish in a multi-task framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.01293
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01293
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Hybrid CTC/Attention model with Intermediate CTC achieved 81.5% dialect accuracy and 15.7% WER on Irish speech recognition

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of low-resource Irish speech recognition and dialect identification using a hybrid CTC/Attention encoder-decoder architecture with Intermediate CTC (InterCTC). The authors explore multi-task learning where dialect identification and automatic speech recognition objectives are jointly optimized through auxiliary CTC losses applied to intermediate encoder layers. The best configuration assigns dialect and ASR objectives to encoder layers 3, 6, and 9, achieving 81.5% dialect accuracy and 15.7% WER. An E-branchformer encoder and multi-task LM shallow fusion further improved results, with the InterCTC model surpassing ECAPA-TDNN baseline by 10.8% in dialect accuracy.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a hybrid CTC/Attention encoder-decoder model with Intermediate CTC regularization. The model employs XLS-R 300M as a front-end for feature extraction, followed by either a Conformer or E-branchformer encoder with 12 layers. InterCTC applies CTC loss to intermediate encoder layers (specifically layers 3, 6, and 9 in the optimal configuration) as auxiliary training objectives. A multi-task fine-tuning approach is used for language model shallow fusion, where a transformer LM is trained on dialect-tagged text corpora. The system is evaluated on 290 hours of Irish speech data with separate validation and test sets.

## Key Results
- Achieved 81.5% dialect identification accuracy and 15.7% WER on test set
- Outperformed ECAPA-TDNN baseline by 10.8% in dialect accuracy
- Approached TDNN-HMM ASR performance while adding dialect identification capability
- E-branchformer encoder with multi-task LM shallow fusion provided additional improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Intermediate CTC regularization improves deep encoder performance by providing auxiliary gradient signals that stabilize training.
- Mechanism: InterCTC applies CTC loss to intermediate encoder layers, creating auxiliary training objectives that guide the learning of deeper layers and prevent vanishing gradients.
- Core assumption: The intermediate layer outputs contain sufficient phonetic/dialect information to serve as valid targets for auxiliary CTC loss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Intermediate CTC (InterCTC) was originally proposed as a regularization technique for deep encoders by incorporating the CTC loss of the intermediate layers as part of a multi-task objective"
  - [section] "Intermediate CTC (InterCTC) [18] was introduced as a regularization technique for deep encoder networks and to facilitate multi-task learning [6, 20]"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence about intermediate layer content quality
- Break condition: If intermediate layers fail to capture meaningful phonetic or dialect features, the auxiliary loss becomes counterproductive noise.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-task learning of ASR and dialect identification leverages shared acoustic representations to improve both tasks.
- Mechanism: The model learns a joint representation space where phonetic features relevant to ASR also encode dialect-specific acoustic patterns.
- Core assumption: Phonetic and dialect features share overlapping acoustic characteristics that can be learned simultaneously.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Multi-task training is a promising strategy that uses shared knowledge across related tasks"
  - [section] "Recognizing its potential to enhance model adaptability, this paper explores Intermediate CTC, which has been used for multilingual speech recognition [6], for multi-task Irish speech recognition and dialect identification"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence about feature overlap
- Break condition: If dialect identification requires features that conflict with ASR optimization, the multi-task approach degrades both tasks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Shallow fusion with dialect-tagged language models improves ASR performance by incorporating dialect-specific language patterns.
- Mechanism: The pre-trained LM provides dialect-aware language modeling that biases the decoder toward dialect-appropriate word sequences.
- Core assumption: Dialect-specific language patterns are captured in the fine-tuned LM and improve recognition accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A multi-task fine-tuning approach is adopted for language model (LM) shallow fusion"
  - [section] "The transformer language model used in the shallow-fusion experiment is trained in two stages. Firstly, the model is trained with text-only data, and then it is fine-tuned with corpora containing dialect information"
  - [corpus] Moderate - explicit mention of dialect-tagged corpora for LM fine-tuning
- Break condition: If the dialect-tagged LM introduces too much bias or the shallow fusion weights are poorly tuned, performance degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function
  - Why needed here: CTC enables sequence-to-sequence learning without requiring frame-level alignment, crucial for low-resource scenarios
  - Quick check question: How does CTC handle variable-length input-output sequences differently from traditional cross-entropy?

- Concept: Transformer attention mechanisms and self-supervised learning
  - Why needed here: The XLS-R front-end provides strong acoustic representations that compensate for limited Irish training data
  - Quick check question: What architectural differences between Conformer and E-branchformer impact their ability to capture dialect features?

- Concept: Multi-task learning objectives and loss weighting
  - Why needed here: Proper balancing of ASR and DID objectives prevents one task from dominating training
  - Quick check question: How would you determine optimal weights for multiple CTC losses in an InterCTC setup?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: XLS-R front-end -> Conformer/E-branchformer encoder -> Intermediate CTC modules (layers 3, 6, 9) -> Transformer decoder -> Dialect-tagged LM (shallow fusion)
- Critical path: Feature extraction → Encoder processing → Intermediate CTC regularization → Decoder prediction → Shallow fusion integration
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Larger encoders improve accuracy but increase training complexity
  - More InterCTC layers provide better regularization but risk overfitting
  - Dialect-specific LMs improve accuracy but require more training data
- Failure signatures:
  - High WER with low DID accuracy suggests encoder not capturing dialect features
  - Low WER but poor DID suggests tasks are not well-integrated
  - Degraded performance with InterCTC suggests poor layer assignment
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train baseline Conformer without InterCTC to establish performance floor
  2. Add InterCTC to layer 3 only, compare to baseline
  3. Test multi-task setup with DID and ASR objectives on layers 3, 6, 9

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would incorporating more diverse dialect-tagged text corpora affect the multi-task shallow fusion approach for Irish ASR and DID?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that with more available dialect-tagged text corpora, the approach could garner further improvement, particularly for DID accuracy.
- Why unresolved: The paper used a limited dialect-tagged text corpus for fine-tuning the LM, suggesting that more data could potentially improve results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with significantly larger and more diverse dialect-tagged text corpora and comparing the results to the current model's performance would provide insights into the impact of data diversity on DID accuracy and overall model performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would using a different self-supervised learning model (SSL) as the front-end module, trained on a multilingual dataset including Irish, improve ASR and DID performance compared to XLS-R 300M?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors chose XLS-R 300M as the front-end module despite Irish not being included in the training set, indicating that other models might be more appropriate for Irish speech recognition and dialect disambiguation.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not explore the use of other SSL models that include Irish in their training data, leaving the potential impact of such models on performance unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating the ASR and DID models using different SSL models that include Irish in their training data, and comparing the results to the current model's performance, would determine if a different SSL model could improve results.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would the performance of the hybrid CTC/Attention-based encoder-decoder model compare to the TDNN-HMM model if both were trained on the same amount of data and with similar computational resources?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that while the E2E models do not outperform the modular TDNN-HMM model, the gap between the two approaches is reduced, suggesting that with equal resources, the E2E model might perform better.
- Why unresolved: The comparison between the two models was not conducted under equal conditions, making it unclear if the TDNN-HMM model's superior performance is due to its architecture or the resources used for training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training both the hybrid CTC/Attention-based encoder-decoder model and the TDNN-HMM model on the same amount of data and with similar computational resources, and then comparing their performance, would provide a fair comparison of their effectiveness.

## Limitations

- The optimal InterCTC layer assignment (3, 6, 9) was determined empirically without extensive ablation studies to understand why these specific layers perform best
- Dialect identification accuracy improvements are measured on a balanced test set that may not reflect real-world deployment scenarios with skewed dialect distributions
- The E-branchformer architecture improvements are demonstrated but the specific architectural elements that enable better dialect capture are not thoroughly analyzed

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The baseline comparison methodology and the general improvement trends from multi-task learning are well-established in the literature
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific numerical improvements (10.8% dialect accuracy gain, 15.7% WER) are credible given the methodology but depend on particular hyperparameter choices
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that E-branchformer specifically captures dialect features better than Conformer is weakly supported without analysis of what architectural elements drive this improvement

## Next Checks

1. **Layer Importance Analysis**: Conduct an ablation study removing individual InterCTC objectives to quantify each layer's contribution and verify the 3-6-9 combination is truly optimal

2. **Domain Transfer Validation**: Apply the InterCTC multi-task framework to a different low-resource language with dialectal variation to test whether the layer assignment strategy generalizes

3. **Feature Attribution Study**: Use gradient-based interpretability methods to visualize which encoder layers contribute most to dialect identification vs. ASR, and whether InterCTC objectives create distinct feature subspaces for each task or promote shared representations
