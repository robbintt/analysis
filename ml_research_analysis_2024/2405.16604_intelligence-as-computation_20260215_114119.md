core_contribution: The paper addresses the problem of inconsistent and ambiguous definitions
  of various forms of intelligence (e.g., computational, physical, neural, embodied,
  morphological, mechanical) in the literature. These definitions are often influenced
  by remnants of dualism and do not provide a clear conceptual foundation for intelligence

# Intelligence as Computation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.16604
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16604
- Reference count: 12
- The paper proposes a unified conceptualization of intelligence as computation, resolving inconsistencies in existing definitions by viewing different forms of intelligence as different computational paradigms.

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses the persistent problem of inconsistent and ambiguous definitions of intelligence across various domains (computational, physical, neural, embodied, morphological, mechanical). These definitions are often influenced by remnants of dualism that artificially separate mind and body. The author proposes a new conceptual framework that unifies these different forms of intelligence by viewing them as different computational paradigms (digital, analog, mechanical, morphological, neural, quantum). Intelligence is defined as computation that satisfies certain properties, with speculation about potential properties including leveraging multiple computational paradigms and exhibiting diverse, active component interactions. This unified view removes the dualistic distinction between brain and body and provides a framework for understanding how different computational paradigms contribute to intelligent behavior.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes intelligence as computation. The method involves reviewing existing conceptualizations of intelligence across disciplines, analyzing different computational paradigms and their unique properties, and proposing a unified view where intelligence emerges from computation across multiple paradigms. The framework suggests identifying properties of intelligent computation, developing methods for combining different computational paradigms, and understanding which paradigm is best suited for particular problem categories. The approach is fundamentally theoretical, drawing on examples from biology and robotics to support the argument rather than presenting empirical validation of the framework itself.

## Key Results
- Existing definitions of intelligence across domains are inconsistent and often influenced by dualistic thinking
- Intelligence can be unified under a computational framework that views different forms (computational, physical, neural, etc.) as different computational paradigms
- A multi-paradigmatic approach to computation may be necessary for intelligent behavior, with properties like leveraging multiple paradigms and diverse component interactions being potentially characteristic of intelligent systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by removing the artificial distinction between "intelligence" and "computation" that has plagued previous definitions. By recognizing that different forms of intelligence (neural, morphological, mechanical, etc.) are actually different computational paradigms with unique properties, the framework provides a unified conceptual foundation. The mechanism relies on the insight that intelligent behavior emerges from the interaction of multiple computational paradigms, each bringing its own strengths to problem-solving. This multi-paradigmatic approach allows for a more complete understanding of intelligence that encompasses both the abstract computational aspects and the physical embodiment of cognitive processes.

## Foundational Learning
- Computational Paradigms: Different ways of performing computation (digital, analog, mechanical, morphological, neural, quantum)
  *Why needed:* Understanding that intelligence can manifest through various computational mechanisms beyond just digital computation
  *Quick check:* Can you explain how a mechanical computer differs from a digital one in terms of computational paradigm?

- Embodied Computation: The idea that physical form and structure contribute to computational processes
  *Why needed:* Recognizing that intelligence isn't just in the "brain" but distributed across physical systems
  *Quick check:* How does morphological computation in a soft robot demonstrate embodied intelligence?

- Multi-paradigmatic Systems: Systems that leverage multiple computational paradigms simultaneously
  *Why needed:* Understanding that intelligent behavior may require combining different computational approaches
  *Quick check:* Can you identify examples where biological systems use multiple computational paradigms?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Computational Paradigms -> Intelligent Properties -> Combined Systems -> Problem-Solving Capabilities

Critical Path: Identify computational paradigms → Characterize their properties → Determine which properties are intelligent → Combine paradigms → Create intelligent systems

Design Tradeoffs: Specialized single-paradigm systems offer efficiency but limited flexibility, while multi-paradigmatic systems offer versatility but increased complexity and potential inefficiency

Failure Signatures: Over-reliance on single paradigm leads to brittleness; ignoring physical embodiment misses crucial computational contributions; failure to identify proper intelligent properties results in systems that compute but don't exhibit intelligent behavior

First Experiments:
1. Implement a simple problem using both digital and analog computational paradigms, then compare performance and identify which paradigm is better suited
2. Design a hybrid system that combines mechanical and digital computation for a physical task, analyzing how the paradigms complement each other
3. Analyze a biological system (like a plant or simple animal) to identify multiple computational paradigms at work and their contributions to intelligent behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- The specific properties that characterize intelligent computation remain largely speculative and require further research to identify
- The framework is primarily theoretical with limited empirical validation, making practical application uncertain
- Methods for effectively combining different computational paradigms into coherent intelligent systems are not fully developed

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Existing definitions of intelligence are inconsistent and influenced by dualistic thinking
- Different computational paradigms exist and have unique properties
- A unified conceptual framework for intelligence research has value

**Medium Confidence:**
- Intelligence can be meaningfully conceptualized as computation
- Multi-paradigmatic computation may be necessary for intelligent behavior
- The proposed properties of intelligent computation are plausible

**Low Confidence:**
- Specific computational principles that characterize intelligent computation
- Exact methods for combining computational paradigms
- Practical implications for building intelligent systems

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a systematic review of existing literature to identify and categorize all proposed computational principles of intelligence, then evaluate which principles have empirical support

2. Design and execute computational experiments that explicitly compare problem-solving performance across different computational paradigms for specific categories of problems

3. Develop a preliminary taxonomy of problems and their optimal computational paradigms, testing the hypothesis that different problem types benefit from different combinations of computational approaches
