# Towards Equitable Agile Research and Development of AI and Robotics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.08242
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08242
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Framework adapts Scrum agile methodology with equity-focused additions including participant-led governance, ethical decision logs, and participant-led assessment scorecards

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a framework for adapting agile research and development (R&D) methodologies to foster more equitable outcomes in AI and robotics projects. The framework integrates evidence-based best practices and organizational equity capabilities into the project lifecycle, emphasizing inclusion of diverse perspectives from marginalized groups throughout development. By modifying the widely-used Scrum agile methodology, the framework introduces elements like continuing education, ethical and equity decision logs, participant-led project assessment scorecards, and a participant-led governance model to address limitations of current R&D processes that often overlook equity concerns.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes adapting the Scrum agile methodology to incorporate equitable practices through a detailed framework with specific steps for meetings, artifacts, and project phases. The approach involves integrating diverse perspectives from affected communities from the outset, implementing iterative feedback loops through sprint retrospectives and participant-led scorecards, and building organizational equity capability through continuing education and recognition of diverse contributions. The framework provides a structured approach to project identification, sprint development, pilot testing, controlled evaluation, and deployment with ongoing assessment and participant governance.

## Key Results
- Framework adapts Scrum agile methodology with equity-focused additions including participant-led governance and ethical decision logs
- Introduces participant-led project assessment scorecards for ongoing evaluation of equity outcomes
- Provides detailed breakdown of project phases, meetings, artifacts, and steps to operationalize equitable practices in AI/Robotics R&D

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Early integration of diverse perspectives prevents harmful assumptions from propagating through the AI lifecycle
- Mechanism: The framework mandates participation from affected communities from the outset, ensuring lived experiences inform design, data collection, and testing phases
- Core assumption: Including affected populations from the beginning meaningfully changes the trajectory of a project toward more equitable outcomes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "integrate evidence-based best practices and organizational equity capabilities into the project lifecycle"
  - [section 1] "examine how ethical technology R&D principles can be operationalized"
- Break condition: If the included voices are tokenized or lack real decision-making power, the mechanism fails

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Iterative feedback loops detect and correct equity issues before deployment
- Mechanism: The Agile sprint structure with retrospective meetings and participant-led scorecards creates regular opportunities to identify and address emerging biases
- Core assumption: Frequent, structured feedback from diverse stakeholders leads to earlier identification of equity problems
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "detect and address rights-based fairness, equity, accountability, and ethical problems as early as possible"
  - [section 4.3] "periodically evaluate project performance over time"
- Break condition: If feedback channels are ineffective or ignored by those in power, problems go undetected

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Building organizational equity capability reduces systemic bias in development processes
- Mechanism: Continuing education time blocks and credit for traditionally uncredited labor develop team competence in equity issues and recognize diverse contributions
- Core assumption: Ongoing education and recognition of diverse labor types improve team capacity to address equity concerns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "build organizational equity capabilities"
  - [section 4.5] "continuing education component for the purpose of developing the necessary capabilities"
- Break condition: If education is superficial or credit allocation is inequitable, capability building is ineffective

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Nothing About Us Without Us principle
  - Why needed here: Ensures that those most affected by AI systems have direct input in development
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why excluding affected communities might lead to harmful AI outcomes?

- Concept: Intersectionality in AI development
  - Why needed here: Recognizes that individuals may face multiple, compounding forms of bias
  - Quick check question: How might a facial recognition system fail differently for a Black woman compared to a white man?

- Concept: Agile sprint retrospectives
  - Why needed here: Provides structured opportunities to reflect on and improve equity practices
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of a sprint retrospective in Agile development?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Framework adapts Agile Scrum methodology with equity-focused additions: participant-led governance, ethical decision logs, accessibility guidelines, environmental impact tracking, and participant-led assessment scorecards
- Critical path: Project identification → sprint development → pilot testing → controlled evaluation → deployment with ongoing assessment and participant governance
- Design tradeoffs: More inclusive processes require additional time and resources but reduce risk of harmful outcomes and rework
- Failure signatures: Projects proceed without meaningful community input, equity concerns are raised but not addressed, governance model is tokenistic
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply participant-led scorecards to an existing project to identify equity gaps
  2. Implement a single sprint with enhanced retrospective focusing on equity concerns
  3. Conduct a small pilot with community representatives in decision-making roles

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed framework handle conflicts between different stakeholder groups' priorities and needs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred]
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses including diverse perspectives but doesn't detail mechanisms for resolving conflicts between groups with potentially competing interests
- What evidence would resolve it: Examples of conflict resolution processes or case studies showing how the framework handles disagreements between stakeholders

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific metrics or indicators are used to measure the effectiveness of the framework in achieving equitable outcomes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit]
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions "Diversity & Inclusion Metrics" and "Participant-led Project Assessment Scorecards", it doesn't provide concrete examples of what these metrics might measure
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed list of specific, measurable indicators that could be used to assess the framework's success in promoting equity

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the framework address the challenge of maintaining participant engagement and representation over the long term?
- Basis in paper: [inferred]
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes mechanisms for initial inclusion but doesn't detail strategies for sustaining diverse participation throughout a project's lifecycle
- What evidence would resolve it: Long-term case studies or data showing how the framework maintains diverse engagement across multiple project phases or iterations

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the resource requirements (time, personnel, budget) for implementing the framework in organizations of different sizes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit]
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions scalability but doesn't provide concrete estimates of resource needs for small vs. large organizations
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed resource allocation plans or case studies showing implementation costs and resource needs across organization sizes

### Open Question 5
- Question: How does the framework adapt to different cultural contexts and legal frameworks across countries?
- Basis in paper: [inferred]
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions global variation in values systems, it doesn't detail how the framework accommodates different cultural and legal environments
- What evidence would resolve it: Examples of the framework being successfully implemented in diverse cultural and legal contexts, or a detailed guide for adapting it to different regions

## Limitations

- No empirical evidence demonstrating that the proposed framework produces measurably more equitable outcomes compared to standard Agile practices
- Unclear how to handle situations where community representatives disagree or when there are multiple affected groups with conflicting needs
- No guidance on resource requirements or how to maintain equity practices in fast-paced development environments

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the theoretical value of including affected communities in development processes
- **Medium confidence** in the specific implementation details and their practical effectiveness
- **Low confidence** in scalability and organizational adoption challenges

## Next Checks

1. Pilot the participant-led scorecards on an existing project and compare identified equity gaps with those found through traditional assessment methods
2. Conduct a controlled experiment measuring time and resource impacts of implementing the framework versus standard Agile practices
3. Interview teams who have attempted similar equity-focused adaptations to identify common implementation challenges and failure modes not addressed in the paper
