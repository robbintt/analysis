# Let's Get It Started: Fostering the Discoverability of New Releases on Deezer

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.02827
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02827
- Reference count: 27
- New music releases get personalized through embedding models

## Executive Summary
Deezer transitioned from editorial to personalized recommendations for new music releases using a neural embedding model called CF-Cold-Start. This model predicts cold-start item representations for new albums without requiring extensive usage data. The approach successfully increased user engagement with new releases while maintaining recommendation quality. A contextual bandit variant (TS-CF-Cold-Start) was also explored for dynamic ranking, though it showed performance parity with the base model.

## Method Summary
The authors developed CF-Cold-Start, a neural embedding model that predicts cold-start item representations for new music albums. The model leverages existing user and item embeddings to generate initial representations for new releases, enabling personalized recommendations from day one. They also implemented TS-CF-Cold-Start, a contextual bandit approach that dynamically adjusts rankings based on real-time user interactions. Both approaches were evaluated through online A/B testing, measuring display-to-click rates and user engagement with new releases.

## Key Results
- CF-Cold-Start improved display-to-click rates by 6% compared to editorial recommendations
- Tripled the number of new albums displayed and clicked by users
- TS-CF-Cold-Start added dynamism but showed performance parity with CF-Cold-Start

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CF-Cold-Start model works by leveraging existing user and item embeddings to predict representations for new music releases. Instead of waiting for usage data to accumulate, the model uses similarity patterns from known items to generate initial cold-start representations. This allows personalized recommendations from day one, significantly improving discoverability of new releases compared to traditional editorial approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cold-start recommendation**: Needed because new items lack interaction data; quick check is whether recommendations can start before usage accumulates
- **Neural embedding models**: Transform items and users into dense vector representations; verify through similarity preservation
- **Contextual bandits**: Balance exploration and exploitation in real-time recommendations; validate through dynamic performance tracking
- **Display-to-click rate**: Key metric for recommendation quality; monitor conversion from impression to engagement

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Embeddings -> CF-Cold-Start Model -> Album Recommendations -> User Interaction Tracking
**Critical Path**: New album release -> CF-Cold-Start prediction -> Ranking generation -> Display to user -> Click measurement
**Design Tradeoffs**: Personalization vs. exploration balance; real-time computation vs. precomputed embeddings
**Failure Signatures**: Low click-through rates on new releases; increased popularity bias; reduced diversity in recommendations
**First Experiments**:
1. Compare CF-Cold-Start vs editorial recommendations on small user subset
2. Test embedding similarity preservation for new items
3. Measure cold-start prediction accuracy vs ground truth after sufficient data accumulates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Contextual bandit approach showed performance parity rather than clear superiority
- Focus on album-level recommendations without examining track-level impacts
- Limited metrics to click behavior without assessing long-term user satisfaction or music diversity

## Confidence
- CF-Cold-Start effectiveness: High
- TS-CF-Cold-Start methodology: High
- Generalization to other platforms: Low
- Long-term user satisfaction impacts: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a longitudinal study measuring user satisfaction and music diversity over 6-12 months of CF-Cold-Start deployment
2. Implement and test a hybrid approach combining TS-CF-Cold-Start exploration with CF-Cold-Start exploitation
3. Evaluate track-level cold-start recommendations to assess granularity effects on user engagement and artist exposure
