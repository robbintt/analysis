core_contribution: This study introduces a novel automated method for detecting shared
  lemmatised constructions in face-to-face dialogue, enabling scalable analysis of
  linguistic alignment in referential communication. By applying this method to a
  corpus of 66 dialogue pairs interacting with novel objects, the authors demonstrate
  that shared constructions emerge pervasively during interaction and are strongly
  associated with post-interaction naming convergence.

# Analysing Cross-Speaker Convergence in Face-to-Face Dialogue through the Lens of Automatically Detected Shared Linguistic Constructions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.08546
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08546
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Shared constructions strongly predict naming convergence after face-to-face interaction

## Executive Summary
This study introduces an automated method for detecting shared lemmatised constructions in face-to-face dialogue, enabling scalable analysis of linguistic alignment during referential communication. Applied to 66 dialogue pairs interacting with novel objects, the method revealed pervasive emergence of shared constructions, with usage frequency and diversity strongly predicting post-interaction naming convergence. The findings demonstrate that shared linguistic patterns are a key mechanism in how speakers collaboratively establish and conventionalise new referents.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed an automated approach to detect shared lemmatised constructions in face-to-face dialogue transcripts. Participants worked in pairs to interact with novel objects and establish names for them. The automated method identified recurring construction patterns across speakers and measured their frequency and diversity. Post-interaction naming data was collected to assess convergence, and pseudo-pairs (non-interacting speakers) were used as controls to isolate social effects.

## Key Results
- Participants used an average of 4 shared construction types per referent
- Higher frequency and fewer types of shared constructions correlated with greater naming similarity (ρ = 0.28, p ≪ 0.001)
- Pseudo-pairs showed no alignment effects, confirming social nature of convergence
- Shared constructions emerged pervasively across all 66 dialogue pairs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism operates through collaborative negotiation during face-to-face interaction, where speakers iteratively align their linguistic choices around novel referents. Shared constructions emerge as speakers coordinate their utterances, creating a scaffold for establishing common ground. The automated detection captures these patterns at scale, revealing how linguistic convergence facilitates successful reference negotiation and subsequent naming conventions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Lemmatisation**: why needed - reduces morphological variants to base forms for pattern matching; quick check - verify that "running" and "ran" both reduce to "run"
- **Construction grammar**: why needed - captures recurring patterns beyond individual words; quick check - identify if "the X over there" functions as a unit
- **Spearman's correlation**: why needed - measures monotonic relationships without assuming linearity; quick check - plot ranked vs actual values to verify monotonic relationship
- **Pseudo-pair controls**: why needed - isolates social effects from mere exposure to stimuli; quick check - ensure control group has no interaction history
- **Automated pattern matching**: why needed - enables scalability across large dialogue datasets; quick check - cross-validate with small manually annotated sample

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** 
Dialogue transcripts -> Automated lemmatisation -> Pattern matching -> Shared construction detection -> Usage frequency analysis -> Naming convergence correlation

**Critical path:** The sequence from pattern matching through to naming convergence correlation represents the core analytical pipeline, with each step building on the previous one to establish the relationship between shared constructions and naming outcomes.

**Design tradeoffs:** The automated approach sacrifices some linguistic nuance for scalability, potentially missing non-lexical alignment patterns. The focus on lemmatised constructions provides computational efficiency but may overlook sub-word or supra-lexical alignment mechanisms.

**Failure signatures:** Poor pattern matching would manifest as low detection rates of shared constructions despite apparent convergence in post-interaction naming. False positives could occur if the algorithm over-generalises construction patterns across different referents.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Test automated detection against human annotation on a subset of transcripts
2. Validate construction patterns across different interaction contexts
3. Compare detection accuracy with varying levels of morphological complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Automated detection may miss non-lexical alignment patterns including prosody and gesture
- Novel object paradigm may not generalise to natural dialogue contexts with existing conventions
- Moderate sample size (66 pairs) may limit generalisability across populations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Pervasive emergence of shared constructions during face-to-face interaction
- **Medium confidence**: Association between shared construction usage and post-interaction naming convergence
- **Medium confidence**: Social nature of alignment effects demonstrated through pseudo-pair comparison

## Next Checks
1. Replicate findings with naturally occurring referents and existing lexical items rather than invented object names
2. Test whether shared construction effects persist when controlling for additional conversational variables
3. Validate automated construction detection against human annotation to assess reliability
