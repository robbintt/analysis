# A Novel Bi-LSTM And Transformer Architecture For Generating Tabla Music

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.05765
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05765
- Authors: Roopa Mayya; Vivekanand Venkataraman; Anwesh P R; Narayana Darapaneni
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Bi-LSTM with attention achieves MSE 4.042 and MAE 1.0814 for tabla music generation

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a novel approach to generating classical Indian tabla music using deep learning architectures. The authors develop a Bi-LSTM with attention mechanism and a transformer model trained on waveform data extracted using the librosa library. The Bi-LSTM model achieves a mean squared error of 4.042 and MAE of 1.0814, producing tabla sequences comparable to human performance. The work addresses the scarcity of machine-encoded Indian classical music data by processing raw audio files, expanding beyond Western music generation research.

## Method Summary
The research employs two deep learning architectures: a Bi-LSTM with attention mechanism and a transformer model. Audio data from the Tabla taala dataset (561 .wav files of tabla loops) is pre-processed using librosa to extract features including mel-spectrograms, MFCCs, spectral contrast, chroma features, and tonal centroid. The Bi-LSTM model consists of two bidirectional LSTM layers, an attention layer, two LSTM layers, and a dense output layer. The transformer model incorporates multi-head attention, dropout, dense and layer normalization layers. Both models are trained to predict tabla sequences, with the Bi-LSTM trained for 300 epochs and the transformer for 180 epochs.

## Key Results
- Bi-LSTM model achieves MSE 4.042 and MAE 1.0814 for tabla music generation
- Transformer model achieves loss 55.9278 and MAE 3.5173, showing less effectiveness for tabla music
- Generated tabla music demonstrates fusion of novelty and familiarity, advancing AI capabilities in Indian classical music composition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bi-LSTM with attention captures long-term temporal dependencies in tabla rhythms better than simple LSTM.
- Mechanism: The bidirectional processing allows the model to understand context from both past and future time steps, while attention dynamically weights the importance of different time steps during prediction.
- Core assumption: Tabla rhythms have both local patterns and longer-range dependencies that benefit from bidirectional context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A novel Bi-LSTM with an Attention approach and a transformer model are trained on the extracted features and labels."
  - [section] "The Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) consists of two LSTM layers that handle input sequences in both forward and backward directions."
- Break condition: If the dataset is too short or lacks temporal structure, bidirectional processing provides minimal benefit and may add unnecessary complexity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Transformer architecture's self-attention mechanism can learn complex rhythmic patterns despite lower performance on tabla music.
- Mechanism: Multi-head attention allows the model to capture different types of rhythmic relationships simultaneously, even though the fixed positional encoding may not perfectly match tabla's cyclical patterns.
- Core assumption: Tabla music has hierarchical rhythmic structures that can be decomposed into multiple attention heads.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "With the transformer model, a loss of 55.9278 and MAE of 3.5173 are obtained for tabla music generation."
  - [section] "The transformer architecture, introduced in the 2017 paper 'Attention is all you need' by Vaswani et al., incorporates the self-attention mechanism as its core component."
- Break condition: If tabla patterns are primarily sequential rather than hierarchical, the transformer's parallel processing may not capture the necessary temporal ordering.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Processing raw waveform data rather than MIDI enables authentic tabla music generation.
- Mechanism: Direct waveform processing preserves microtonal variations and timbral characteristics unique to tabla, which MIDI cannot represent.
- Core assumption: The acoustic properties of tabla strokes contain information critical for generating realistic tabla music.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The work addresses the scarcity of machine-encoded Indian classical music data by processing raw audio files"
  - [section] "Due to these challenges, good and abundant sources of classical Indian music are scarce and there is limited research on generating classical Indian music."
- Break condition: If the dataset quality is poor or if the model cannot effectively extract relevant features from raw audio, waveform processing may introduce more noise than benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Time-series feature extraction using librosa
  - Why needed here: Tabla music exists as raw waveform data that must be converted to meaningful features before model training
  - Quick check question: What librosa functions would you use to extract MFCCs from a tabla audio file?

- Concept: Sequence modeling with recurrent networks
  - Why needed here: Tabla rhythms are inherently sequential, requiring models that can maintain state across time steps
  - Quick check question: How does an LSTM gate mechanism help prevent vanishing gradients in long tabla sequences?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms in neural networks
  - Why needed here: Tabla compositions have varying importance across time steps, requiring dynamic weighting of temporal information
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical difference between additive attention and multiplicative attention?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw audio → librosa feature extraction → normalization → Bi-LSTM/Transformer model → dense output → sequence generation → audio synthesis
- Critical path: Raw audio → feature extraction → model training → sequence generation → audio synthesis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Bi-LSTM vs Transformer: Bi-LSTM better for sequential dependencies, Transformer better for parallel processing but requires careful positional encoding
  - Waveform vs MIDI: Waveform preserves authentic timbre but requires more data and computational resources
  - Attention mechanism: Improves performance but increases parameter count and training time
- Failure signatures:
  - High MSE/MAE: Model not capturing rhythmic patterns, check feature extraction quality
  - Noisy mel-spectrograms: Feature normalization issues or insufficient training data
  - Repetitive output: Overfitting or insufficient model capacity, try data augmentation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train Bi-LSTM model on subset of tabla data (50 samples) for 10 epochs, check loss curve and generate sample output
  2. Compare different feature extraction methods (MFCCs vs mel-spectrogram) on same model architecture
  3. Test different attention mechanisms (Bahdanau vs Luong) in Bi-LSTM model to measure impact on tabla generation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the transformer model's performance change with increased training data and computational resources for tabla music generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that the transformer model's performance for tabla music (loss 55.9278, MAE 3.5173) was inferior to the Bi-LSTM model, but suggest that refining the architecture and additional training could improve results.
- Why unresolved: The study did not explore scaling the transformer model with larger datasets or extended training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative results of transformer performance with increased data size and training duration, alongside ablation studies on model architecture modifications.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed Bi-LSTM + Attention + LSTM architecture be adapted to generate multi-instrumental Indo-Western fusion music?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors suggest exploring multi-instrumental music generation as future work, noting the potential for fusing elements of Indo-Western styles.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses solely on tabla music generation without exploring cross-instrumental applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Generated examples of Indo-Western fusion music using the proposed architecture, along with quantitative metrics comparing style blending effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the proposed models be extended to generate human vocal music with lyrics, melody, and emotional expression?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify creating a system that mimics human vocal music generation as an "ambitious endeavour" requiring extensive data and computational resources.
- Why unresolved: The study does not address vocal music generation or incorporate text/lyrics processing.
- What evidence would resolve it: A system architecture that integrates vocal synthesis, text processing, and the proposed neural models, along with generated vocal music samples demonstrating controlled emotional expression.

## Limitations
- Limited quantitative evaluation beyond MSE and MAE metrics, lacking perceptual assessment of musical quality
- Implementation details missing for key architectural parameters such as learning rates and batch sizes
- Dataset scale concerns with no reported train/validation/test splits or discussion of dataset diversity

## Confidence
- High confidence: The general approach of using Bi-LSTM with attention for tabla music generation is technically sound
- Medium confidence: The reported MSE and MAE values are likely accurate for the described methodology
- Low confidence: Claims about the transformer model's ability to capture rhythmic patterns are not strongly supported by poor performance metrics

## Next Checks
1. Implement perceptual evaluation with classical Indian music experts to assess whether generated sequences maintain authentic tabla rhythmic patterns beyond numerical metrics
2. Compare against baseline LSTM models without attention mechanisms to determine whether added complexity provides measurable musical benefits
3. Test cross-taala generalization to evaluate whether models can generalize beyond specific patterns in the training data
