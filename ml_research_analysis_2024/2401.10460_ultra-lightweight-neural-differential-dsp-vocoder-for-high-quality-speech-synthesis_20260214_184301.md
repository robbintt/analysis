# Ultra-lightweight Neural Differential DSP Vocoder For High Quality Speech Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.10460
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10460
- Reference count: 0
- This paper introduces an ultra-lightweight differential DSP (DDSP) vocoder that achieves high-quality speech synthesis with only 15 MFLOPS and 0.003 RTF on a 2GHz Intel Xeon CPU

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an ultra-lightweight differential DSP (DDSP) vocoder that combines a simple DSP vocoder with an end-to-end optimized acoustic model. The approach jointly trains the acoustic model and DSP vocoder using true audio waveform as the optimization target, eliminating the need for engineered spectral features. The resulting system achieves high-quality speech synthesis with an average MOS of 4.36, comparable to state-of-the-art neural vocoders while being significantly more efficient.

The DDSP vocoder is highly efficient, requiring only 15 MFLOPS and achieving a vocoder-only RTF of 0.003 on a 2GHz Intel Xeon CPU, which is 340 times more efficient than MB-MelGAN in terms of FLOPS. The key innovation is the joint optimization of the acoustic model and DSP vocoder, allowing the system to learn optimal spectral features directly from audio waveform rather than relying on hand-engineered features.

## Method Summary
The DDSP vocoder approach combines a simple DSP vocoder with an end-to-end optimized acoustic model. The system jointly trains both components using true audio waveform as the optimization target, eliminating the need for engineered spectral features. The acoustic model predicts parameters for the DSP vocoder, which generates the final audio waveform. This joint optimization allows the system to learn optimal spectral features directly from audio rather than relying on hand-engineered features, while maintaining the computational efficiency of traditional DSP approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieved MOS score of 4.36, comparable to state-of-the-art neural vocoders
- Requires only 15 MFLOPS for inference, 340x more efficient than MB-MelGAN
- Achieved vocoder-only RTF of 0.003 on a 2GHz Intel Xeon CPU
- Eliminated need for engineered spectral features through end-to-end optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The DDSP vocoder works by leveraging the efficiency of traditional DSP algorithms while incorporating neural network optimization to learn optimal spectral features directly from data. By jointly training the acoustic model and DSP vocoder using waveform as the target, the system can optimize both components simultaneously rather than treating them as separate stages. This end-to-end approach allows the neural network to learn the most effective way to parameterize the DSP vocoder for the specific speech synthesis task, resulting in high quality while maintaining low computational complexity.
