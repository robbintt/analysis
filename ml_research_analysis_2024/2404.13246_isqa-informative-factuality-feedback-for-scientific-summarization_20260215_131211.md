# ISQA: Informative Factuality Feedback for Scientific Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.13246
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13246
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 6.6% improvement on QAGS and 4.3% on QuestEval metrics for scientific summarization factuality

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Iterative Factuality Refining on Informative Scientific Question-Answering (ISQA) feedback, a novel method that uses model-generated feedback containing both positive and negative information to iteratively refine scientific summaries and enhance their factuality. The approach employs a Question-Answering mechanism to distinguish between factual and non-factual content in generated summaries, using high-quality scientific questions to probe the underlying rationale of statements. Through extensive experimentation on scientific document datasets, ISQA significantly improves the factuality of various open-source large language models for summarization.

The key innovation lies in the dual feedback mechanism that provides both positive reinforcement for correct facts and corrective guidance for inaccuracies, creating an iterative refinement loop. Notably, the approach demonstrates that a fine-tuned compact language model with 7 billion parameters can provide high-quality feedback comparable to GPT-3.5, ensuring cost-efficiency and reproducibility while maintaining strong performance improvements.

## Method Summary
ISQA employs an iterative refinement process that leverages informative feedback to improve summary factuality. The method begins with an initial summary generated by a base language model, which is then evaluated using a Question-Answering mechanism that probes the content with high-quality scientific questions. These questions are designed to test both the presence of correct factual information (positive feedback) and the identification of factual errors or hallucinations (negative feedback). The model then iteratively refines the summary based on this feedback, incorporating both types of information to enhance factual accuracy. A key contribution is the use of a fine-tuned 7-billion parameter model to provide feedback quality comparable to GPT-3.5, making the approach more cost-effective and reproducible.

## Key Results
- Achieves 6.6% average improvement on QAGS factuality metric
- Achieves 4.3% average improvement on QuestEval metric
- Demonstrates that a fine-tuned 7B parameter model provides feedback quality comparable to GPT-3.5

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ISQA works by creating a feedback loop that continuously refines summaries through iterative questioning and correction. The mechanism leverages the power of targeted questioning to probe the factual content of summaries, identifying both correct information that should be preserved and inaccuracies that need correction. By providing both positive and negative feedback, the system guides the language model toward more factually accurate outputs while maintaining the core information from the source document. The iterative nature allows for gradual improvement, with each cycle building upon the previous refinements.

## Foundational Learning
- **Scientific QA Mechanisms**: Needed to validate factual claims against source material; quick check: ensure questions target specific factual elements rather than general comprehension
- **Iterative Refinement Loops**: Required for progressive improvement of generated content; quick check: verify convergence criteria and maximum iteration limits
- **Factuality Metrics (QAGS/QuestEval)**: Essential for quantifying improvements in factual accuracy; quick check: validate metric consistency across different scientific domains
- **Compact Model Fine-tuning**: Critical for cost-effective feedback generation; quick check: compare fine-tuned model performance against baseline and larger models
- **Positive/Negative Feedback Balance**: Important for guiding model behavior without introducing new errors; quick check: analyze feedback distribution and impact on refinement quality
- **Scientific Document Processing**: Necessary for handling domain-specific terminology and structures; quick check: test on multiple scientific disciplines to ensure generalizability

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Base LLM -> QA Feedback Generator -> Iterative Refiner -> Factuality Evaluator
**Critical Path**: Initial summary generation → QA-based factuality assessment → Feedback generation → Summary refinement → Factuality evaluation → (repeat if needed)
**Design Tradeoffs**: Model size vs. feedback quality, iteration count vs. computational cost, question quality vs. coverage
**Failure Signatures**: Feedback loop stagnation, introduction of new errors during refinement, domain-specific knowledge gaps
**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison without iterative refinement
2. Single-iteration refinement performance
3. Multiple-iteration convergence analysis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on high-quality scientific questions raises concerns about question quality maintenance across different domains
- Factuality improvements may not fully capture nuanced accuracy requirements in specialized scientific fields
- Limited comparison of cost-efficiency across different model architectures and sizes

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Experimental methodology is clearly described and results on established metrics are verifiable
**Medium Confidence**: Cost-efficiency claims based on limited comparisons, need more extensive model architecture analysis
**Low Confidence**: Generalizability across scientific domains not thoroughly validated, question quality impact not empirically established

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain evaluation on diverse scientific fields (medicine, physics, computer science) to assess robustness
2. Perform ablation study on question quality to quantify its impact on factuality improvements
3. Implement longitudinal study tracking factuality improvements over multiple refinement iterations
