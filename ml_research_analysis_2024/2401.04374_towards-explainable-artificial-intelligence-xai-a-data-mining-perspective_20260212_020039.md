# Towards Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): A Data Mining Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.04374
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04374
- Reference count: 40
- Presents comprehensive survey of XAI from data mining perspective

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a systematic survey of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques from a data mining perspective, proposing a novel taxonomy that organizes methods by their purposes (interpretations, influences, insights) and their alignment with data mining stages (acquisition, preparation, modeling, visualization). The paper examines how data collection, processing, and analysis contribute to explainability across different modalities including images, text, and tabular data. By mapping XAI techniques to both their functional purposes and their position in the data lifecycle, the authors create a structured framework that reveals the relationships between different explainability approaches and their practical applications.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a PRISMA systematic review approach, conducting comprehensive database searches using multiple keyword combinations related to explainable AI and data science. Papers were screened by title/abstract and then assessed against inclusion criteria focusing on XAI algorithms with data processing, modeling, and analysis components. The final collection was selected through mutual agreement among authors, with metadata extracted and quality assessed for each study. Findings were categorized by recurring themes and organized according to the proposed three-fold taxonomy and four-stage data mining framework, with discussions of major findings, limitations, and future research directions.

## Key Results
- Proposes three-fold taxonomy categorizing XAI methods by purpose: interpretations of deep models, influences of training data, and insights of domain knowledge
- Maps XAI techniques to four stages of data mining: acquisition, preparation, modeling, and visualization
- Identifies key limitations including evaluation framework gaps, computational scalability issues, and challenges with non-differentiable models
- Highlights future directions focusing on improved data quality, scalable algorithms, and comprehensive evaluation frameworks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The paper's three-fold taxonomy (interpretations, influences, insights) effectively organizes XAI methods by purpose and data mining stage.
- Mechanism: By mapping each XAI technique to both its purpose (why it's used) and its stage in the data mining process (when it's applied), the taxonomy creates a structured framework that captures the lifecycle of explainability.
- Core assumption: Different XAI methods serve distinct purposes and align naturally with specific data mining stages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "categorize existing work into three categories subject to their purposes: interpretations of deep models, influences of training data, and insights of domain knowledge"
  - [section]: "distill XAI methodologies into data mining operations on training and testing data across modalities"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus neighbors about this specific three-fold taxonomy approach
- Break condition: If an XAI method cannot be clearly mapped to a purpose and stage, the taxonomy breaks down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The data-centric perspective reveals how data collection, processing, and analysis contribute to explainability.
- Mechanism: By focusing on data operations rather than just model architecture, the paper shows how XAI techniques work with different data types (images, text, tabular) and data states (training logs, checkpoints, behavior descriptors).
- Core assumption: Data is the common thread that connects different XAI techniques across modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "takes a 'data-centric' view, examining how data collection, processing, and analysis contribute to explainable AI"
  - [section]: "distill XAI methodologies into data mining operations on training and testing data across modalities"
  - [corpus]: Moderate - the "Transparent Adaptive Learning via Data-Centric Multimodal Explainable AI" neighbor paper supports the data-centric approach
- Break condition: If XAI techniques operate independently of data characteristics, the data-centric view loses explanatory power.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The four-stage data mining process (acquisition, preparation, modeling, visualization) provides a systematic framework for understanding XAI methods.
- Mechanism: Each XAI technique can be positioned within this process, showing how data flows from collection through transformation to analysis and presentation.
- Core assumption: XAI techniques follow a logical progression similar to traditional data mining.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "distill XAI methodologies into data mining operations on training and testing data across modalities"
  - [section]: "four integral steps are outlined below" followed by the four stages
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in corpus neighbors about this specific four-stage framework
- Break condition: If XAI techniques don't follow this progression or require different stages, the framework becomes incomplete.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Feature attribution methods (LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients)
  - Why needed here: These are fundamental techniques for interpreting model decisions at the input level
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between perturbation-based methods like LIME and gradient-based methods like Integrated Gradients?

- Concept: Shapley values and game theory in data valuation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to measure the contribution of individual training samples requires game-theoretic foundations
  - Quick check question: How do Shapley values differ from simple leave-one-out methods in evaluating training data influence?

- Concept: Counterfactual reasoning and causal inference
  - Why needed here: These techniques help understand model behavior by exploring "what-if" scenarios and causal relationships
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes counterfactual examples from adversarial examples in terms of their purpose and method?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data sources (training data, logs, checkpoints) -> Transformation modules (feature extraction, perturbation, visualization) -> Analysis engines (attribution, valuation, anomaly detection) -> Presentation layers (heatmaps, rankings, explanations)
- Critical path: Data acquisition -> preprocessing -> model analysis -> result visualization -> interpretation
- Design tradeoffs: Global vs. local interpretability, computational efficiency vs. accuracy, model-agnostic vs. model-specific approaches
- Failure signatures: Poor data quality leading to misleading explanations, computational bottlenecks in gradient calculations, overfitting in surrogate models
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement LIME on a simple image classification task to verify local interpretability
  2. Apply SHAP values to a tabular dataset to test global feature importance
  3. Use influence functions on a small NLP model to measure training data impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can XAI techniques be adapted to handle non-differentiable models while maintaining interpretability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses gradient-based methods for XAI, which rely on differentiability of models, but notes limitations with non-differentiable ensemble learners [81].
- Why unresolved: Current XAI methods like TracIn and influence functions depend on gradient computations, which are not applicable to non-differentiable models like certain ensemble methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of XAI techniques that do not rely on gradient information for non-differentiable models, with empirical comparisons to existing methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What evaluation frameworks can comprehensively assess the quality and utility of XAI methods across diverse applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights limitations in current evaluation frameworks that may not fully capture the spectrum of XAI methods [175].
- Why unresolved: Existing frameworks often focus on specific aspects like faithfulness or human interpretability, lacking holistic assessment of XAI utility across different domains and use cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Creation and validation of multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks that assess XAI methods on criteria like faithfulness, usability, computational efficiency, and domain-specific utility.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can XAI techniques be scaled to provide explanations for extremely large language models while maintaining accuracy and interpretability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses limitations of current XAI approaches when applied to large language models like GPT-4, noting the need for scalable strategies [84].
- Why unresolved: Large language models have billions of parameters, making traditional XAI techniques computationally infeasible and potentially losing interpretability at such scale.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of approximation techniques or sampling methods that enable XAI on large language models with provable bounds on explanation quality, validated through empirical studies.

## Limitations
- Potential selection bias in surveyed literature may affect completeness of taxonomy
- Challenge of evaluating explainability across diverse modalities using unified framework
- Some XAI methods may not fit neatly into proposed three-fold categorization structure

## Confidence
- Taxonomy effectiveness: Medium - provides useful structure but may oversimplify complex relationships
- Data-centric perspective: Medium - valuable but may not encompass all explainability approaches
- Framework comprehensiveness: Medium - covers many techniques but may have gaps in coverage

## Next Checks
1. Test the three-fold categorization by attempting to classify XAI methods not included in the original survey and document classification resistance
2. Explicitly map 5-10 XAI techniques to the four data mining stages and identify any techniques that cannot be meaningfully placed
3. Apply the framework to explainability methods from three different domains (computer vision, NLP, tabular data) to assess domain-specific modifications needed
