# MLAN: Language-Based Instruction Tuning Preserves and Transfers Knowledge in Multimodal Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.10557
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10557
- Reference count: 26
- This work introduces MLAN, a novel multimodal instruction tuning approach that prioritizes language data to improve zero-shot generalization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MLAN (Multimodal Language-based Instruction Tuning), a novel approach that challenges the conventional wisdom of vision-heavy multimodal instruction tuning. The key hypothesis is that language-only instruction following capabilities can effectively transfer across modalities, enabling strong multimodal performance without extensive vision-language supervision. By prioritizing language data (75% of training tokens) while maintaining multimodal capabilities, MLAN achieves comparable or better performance on both language and vision benchmarks compared to traditional approaches that use more vision-language data.

The method is evaluated on two pretrained multimodal models (Llama-3.2-3B and Llama-3.1-8B) using a controlled training budget, demonstrating that language serves as an effective foundation for multimodal reasoning. Results show that MLAN matches the best scores on vision tasks while significantly improving language performance and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This work provides empirical evidence that language-first instruction tuning offers a more efficient and generalizable approach to developing multimodal capabilities.

## Method Summary
MLAN introduces a language-first instruction tuning paradigm that challenges traditional vision-heavy approaches. The method prioritizes diverse text-only instruction data (75% of training tokens) while maintaining multimodal capabilities through carefully curated vision-language data. The approach is built on the hypothesis that instruction-following abilities acquired through language tasks can transfer across modalities, reducing the need for extensive vision-language supervision.

The training process involves a controlled composition of data types, where text-only instruction data forms the majority while vision-language data provides multimodal grounding. This controlled training budget ensures fair comparison with traditional approaches. The method is evaluated on two pretrained multimodal models (Llama-3.2-3B and Llama-3.1-8B), demonstrating that language serves as an effective foundation for multimodal reasoning and achieving comparable or better performance on both language and vision benchmarks.

## Key Results
- MLAN achieves comparable or better performance on both language and vision benchmarks compared to traditional vision-heavy approaches
- Uses less than half the number of training tokens while matching the best scores on vision tasks
- Significantly improves language performance and mitigates catastrophic forgetting compared to vision-first approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MLAN works by leveraging the transferability of instruction-following capabilities from language to vision tasks. The mechanism relies on the hypothesis that diverse text-only instruction tuning creates generalizable reasoning patterns that can be applied to multimodal scenarios. By establishing strong language instruction following as a foundation, the model can more efficiently learn to apply these capabilities to vision tasks without requiring extensive vision-language supervision.

The language-first approach allows the model to develop robust instruction understanding and reasoning patterns in a domain where supervision is abundant and diverse. When vision-language data is introduced, these established capabilities can be transferred and adapted rather than learned from scratch. This creates a more efficient learning pathway where language instruction following serves as a scaffold for multimodal understanding, resulting in better performance with fewer training tokens and reduced risk of catastrophic forgetting.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Instruction Tuning**: Training models to follow instructions across text and vision inputs; needed to evaluate MLAN's effectiveness in creating truly multimodal capabilities; quick check: compare zero-shot performance on vision benchmarks
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: The tendency of neural networks to forget previously learned tasks when trained on new ones; critical for understanding why language-first approaches may be superior; quick check: measure performance drop on language tasks during vision training
- **Zero-shot Generalization**: Model's ability to perform tasks without task-specific training; key evaluation metric for MLAN's effectiveness; quick check: benchmark performance on unseen vision tasks
- **Instruction Following**: The ability to understand and execute natural language instructions; foundational capability that MLAN aims to preserve and transfer; quick check: evaluate performance on complex language reasoning tasks
- **Transfer Learning**: Applying knowledge learned in one domain to another; central to MLAN's hypothesis about language-to-vision capability transfer; quick check: ablate vision-language data to measure transfer effectiveness

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Pretrained Multimodal Model -> Language-First Instruction Tuning (75% text-only) -> Controlled Multimodal Fine-tuning (25% vision-language) -> Evaluated on Language and Vision Benchmarks
- **Critical Path**: Text-only instruction data ingestion → Language capability preservation → Multimodal reasoning transfer → Zero-shot vision task performance
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Higher language data proportion improves language performance but requires careful balance to maintain vision capabilities; controlled training budget ensures fair comparison but may not reflect real-world constraints
- **Failure Signatures**: Catastrophic forgetting of language capabilities when vision data dominates; poor zero-shot vision performance if language foundation is insufficient; overfitting to text-only patterns that don't transfer to vision
- **3 First Experiments**:
  1. Ablation study varying text-only vs. vision-language data proportions to identify optimal composition
  2. Evaluation of catastrophic forgetting by tracking language performance during vision-focused training
  3. Transfer efficiency test by measuring vision performance relative to vision-language training tokens used

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Controlled training budget approach may not reflect real-world dataset availability and constraints
- Evaluation primarily focuses on zero-shot generalization, leaving few-shot and fine-tuning scenarios unexplored
- Specific quality and diversity of the text-only data composition is not fully characterized

## Confidence
- High confidence in MLAN's ability to preserve language capabilities while improving vision performance
- Medium confidence in the efficiency claims due to potential variations in dataset quality and preprocessing
- Medium confidence in the generalizability of results across different model architectures and scales

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MLAN's performance on few-shot learning tasks and fine-tuning scenarios to assess its versatility beyond zero-shot generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of different proportions of text-only vs. vision-language data on final performance
3. Test MLAN on additional multimodal models beyond Llama-3.2-3B and Llama-3.1-8B to verify scalability and architecture independence
