# Estimating the Level of Dialectness Predicts Interannotator Agreement in Multi-dialect Arabic Datasets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.11282
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11282
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Routing high-ALDi Arabic samples to native dialect speakers improves annotation quality while maintaining efficiency

## Executive Summary
This paper analyzes how the Arabic Level of Dialectness (ALDi) score correlates with inter-annotator agreement across 15 Arabic datasets covering various classification tasks. The study finds that for non-dialect identification tasks, higher ALDi scores correlate with lower annotator agreement, while for dialect identification tasks, higher ALDi scores correlate with higher agreement. Based on these findings, the authors propose a routing strategy that assigns high-ALDi samples to native speakers of the appropriate dialect, improving annotation quality without sacrificing efficiency for low-ALDi samples.

## Method Summary
The study computes ALDi scores for samples in 15 Arabic datasets using the Sentence-ALDi model, then bins samples by ALDi score and calculates the percentage of samples with full annotator agreement in each bin. Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression slopes are computed between ALDi scores and agreement percentages. The analysis covers tasks including offensive text classification, hate speech detection, sarcasm detection, sentiment analysis, speech act detection, stance detection, and dialect identification. Datasets with individual annotator labels were used to enable this granular analysis.

## Key Results
- For 8 out of 12 non-dialect identification tasks, higher ALDi scores correlated with lower annotator agreement
- For dialect identification tasks, higher ALDi scores correlated with higher agreement
- Routing high-ALDi samples to native dialect speakers can improve annotation quality while maintaining efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Higher ALDi scores correlate with lower annotator agreement for non-dialect identification tasks.
- Mechanism: As sentences diverge more from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), they become harder to understand for speakers of other dialects, leading to disagreement on labels.
- Core assumption: Annotators who do not speak the dialect of a high-ALDi sentence will struggle to accurately interpret and label it.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "for 8 out of 12 non-dialect identification tasks, higher ALDi scores correlated with lower annotator agreement"
  - [section] "both the trends (quantified by the slope m) and the correlation coefficients for most of the tasks indicate that the percentage of samples for which all the annotators assign the same label decreases as the ALDi scores increase"
- Break condition: If ALDi does not accurately measure dialectness, or if annotators are fluent in multiple dialects.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Higher ALDi scores correlate with higher annotator agreement for dialect identification tasks.
- Mechanism: Sentences with more dialectal features are easier to identify as belonging to a specific dialect, leading to higher agreement.
- Core assumption: The presence of distinctive dialectal features makes it easier for annotators to agree on the dialect label.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "for dialect identification tasks, higher ALDi scores correlated with higher agreement"
  - [section] "by definition, MSA sentences have an ALDi of 0, and normally the ALDi estimation model assigns them very low scores"
- Break condition: If ALDi does not accurately measure dialectness, or if annotators are not familiar with the dialects present in the dataset.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Routing high-ALDi samples to native speakers of the appropriate dialect improves annotation quality while maintaining efficiency.
- Mechanism: By prioritizing routing samples with high ALDi scores to native speakers of the dialect, the accuracy of annotation can be improved without sacrificing efficiency for low-ALDi samples.
- Core assumption: Native speakers of a dialect are more accurate in annotating sentences in their dialect, and routing only high-ALDi samples reduces the need for dialect-specific annotators.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "routing samples with high ALDi scores to native speakers of the appropriate dialect, whose dialect can be identified more accurately due to the presence of more dialectal features, can improve annotation quality while maintaining efficiency"
  - [section] "annotation can be made more efficient while maintaining accuracy, by routing samples with low ALDi scores to speakers of any dialect. Only high-ALDi samples need to be routed to native speakers of the appropriate dialect."
- Break condition: If the cost of identifying the dialect of high-ALDi samples is too high, or if native speakers of certain dialects are unavailable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Arabic Level of Dialectness (ALDi)
  - Why needed here: ALDi is a quantitative measure of how much a sentence diverges from MSA, which is used to analyze the impact of dialectness on annotator agreement.
  - Quick check question: What is the range of ALDi scores, and what do the extreme values represent?

- Concept: Interannotator agreement
  - Why needed here: Interannotator agreement is a measure of how much annotators agree on the labels assigned to samples, which is used to assess the quality of annotation.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between full annotator agreement and weighted agreement?

- Concept: Dialect identification (DI)
  - Why needed here: DI is the task of identifying the dialect of a sentence, which is used to analyze the impact of dialectness on annotator agreement for this specific task.
  - Quick check question: What are some challenges in automatically identifying the dialect of a sentence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ALDi scoring -> Routing logic -> Annotation interface
- Critical path: ALDi scoring → Routing logic → Annotation interface
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. efficiency: Routing high-ALDi samples to native speakers improves accuracy but may reduce efficiency if dialect-specific annotators are scarce.
  - Cost vs. quality: Investing in automatic dialect identification may improve routing accuracy but adds to the cost of the annotation process.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low agreement on high-ALDi samples: Indicates that the routing logic is not effectively prioritizing native speakers for high-ALDi samples.
  - High disagreement on low-ALDi samples: Suggests that the ALDi scoring may not be accurately capturing the dialectness of sentences.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Analyze the distribution of ALDi scores in the dataset and the correlation with annotator agreement.
  2. Compare the accuracy of annotation when routing high-ALDi samples to native speakers vs. random assignment.
  3. Evaluate the impact of automatic dialect identification on the accuracy of routing high-ALDi samples.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does annotator agreement vary across different Arabic dialects when labeling dialectal text?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses routing samples to native speakers of the appropriate dialect but does not analyze how agreement varies by dialect.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on overall agreement trends rather than dialect-specific analysis. Demographic information about annotators was not available.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment re-annotating the datasets with annotator demographic information, comparing agreement rates across dialect pairs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of ALDi on token-level annotation tasks for Arabic text?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that token-level datasets are typically annotated by carefully selecting samples and recruiting native speakers, but does not analyze ALDi's effect on token-level agreement.
- Why unresolved: No multi-dialect token-level datasets with individual annotations were available for analysis. A new model for token-level ALDi estimation would be needed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of a multi-dialect token-level dataset with individual annotations, using a token-level ALDi model to measure correlation with agreement rates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the usage of specific dialectal words as cues affect annotation accuracy for positive classes in Arabic text classification tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how specific words might be strong cues for positive class labels (e.g., Sarcastic, Positive/Negative, Obscene/Offensive) but does not analyze the accuracy of cue-based annotation.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on agreement rates rather than accuracy. It is unclear whether annotators rely on cues and if this leads to correct labels.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment comparing annotation accuracy with and without cue-based annotation, using expert evaluations to determine correct labels.

## Limitations
- The assumption that ALDi accurately captures dialectness across all Arabic varieties and tasks may not hold in all contexts
- The study relies on datasets with varying annotation schemes and sample sizes, introducing heterogeneity in agreement measurements
- The routing strategy assumes dialect identification is reliable and cost-effective, but implementation costs are not quantified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The correlation between ALDi scores and inter-annotator agreement for dialect identification tasks (Mechanism 2)
- **Medium confidence**: The negative correlation between ALDi and agreement for non-dialect identification tasks (Mechanism 1)
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed routing strategy (Mechanism 3)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dialect validation**: Test whether annotators familiar with one dialect (e.g., Egyptian) show higher agreement on high-ALDi samples from related dialects (e.g., Levantine) compared to unrelated dialects.
2. **Cost-benefit analysis**: Measure the actual improvement in annotation quality when implementing the routing strategy versus the additional cost of dialect identification and managing dialect-specific annotators.
3. **Task-specific ALDi calibration**: Evaluate whether ALDi scores need adjustment for different classification tasks, as dialectal features relevant for sentiment may differ from those for hate speech detection.
