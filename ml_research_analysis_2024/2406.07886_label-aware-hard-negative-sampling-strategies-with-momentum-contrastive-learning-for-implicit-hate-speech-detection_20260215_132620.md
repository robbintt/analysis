# Label-aware Hard Negative Sampling Strategies with Momentum Contrastive Learning for Implicit Hate Speech Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.07886
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07886
- **Reference count**: 13
- **Primary result**: LAHN outperforms existing methods in implicit hate speech detection using label-aware hard negative sampling with momentum contrastive learning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Label-aware Hard Negative sampling strategies (LAHN) to address the challenge of detecting implicit hate speech in text. The core idea is to improve contrastive learning by focusing on hard negative samples—those semantically similar to the anchor but from a different class—rather than randomly sampled negatives. LAHN integrates a momentum queue and a label-aware weighting mechanism to identify and prioritize these hard negatives, enhancing the model's ability to learn subtle distinctions between hate and non-hate speech. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that LAHN outperforms existing methods in both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, achieving higher macro F1-scores without requiring external knowledge or additional computational costs. The method is particularly effective when external knowledge is unavailable, demonstrating robustness and generalizability. Qualitative analysis and ablation studies further validate the approach, highlighting its ability to form sharper decision boundaries and improve representation learning.

## Method Summary
LAHN improves implicit hate speech detection through a momentum contrastive learning framework that prioritizes hard negative samples. The method constructs a label-aware queue by maintaining negative samples from different classes, with weighting determined by semantic similarity to the anchor. A momentum encoder updates more slowly than the main encoder, stabilizing training. The label-aware weighting mechanism assigns higher weights to negatives that are semantically close but from different classes, making the learning process more focused on challenging distinctions. This approach eliminates the need for external knowledge bases while maintaining computational efficiency during inference.

## Key Results
- LAHN achieves 7-9% higher macro F1-scores on W16 dataset compared to baseline methods
- Maintains strong performance across four benchmark datasets without requiring external knowledge
- Demonstrates superior cross-dataset generalization capabilities
- Outperforms existing methods in both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LAHN addresses the fundamental challenge in implicit hate speech detection: distinguishing between subtly different semantic content where traditional random negative sampling fails. By identifying and prioritizing hard negatives—samples that are semantically similar to the anchor but from different classes—the model learns more discriminative representations. The momentum queue provides stability during training, preventing catastrophic forgetting of useful negative examples. The label-aware weighting ensures the model focuses computational resources on the most informative negative samples, creating sharper decision boundaries between hate and non-hate speech classes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning**: Learning representations by comparing similar (positive) and dissimilar (negative) pairs - needed to create meaningful embeddings for hate speech detection; quick check: verify cosine similarity between anchor and positive pairs is higher than with negatives
- **Momentum Contrastive Learning**: Using a slowly-updating momentum encoder to stabilize training - needed to prevent representation collapse and maintain consistency; quick check: compare update frequency of momentum encoder vs main encoder
- **Hard Negative Mining**: Identifying negative samples that are semantically close to the anchor - needed because random negatives are too easy and don't challenge the model sufficiently; quick check: measure semantic similarity between anchor and hard negatives
- **Label-aware Weighting**: Assigning importance scores based on semantic similarity and class membership - needed to prioritize the most informative negative samples; quick check: verify higher weights correlate with lower class distinction confidence
- **Representation Learning**: Learning dense vector representations that capture semantic meaning - needed as foundation for all downstream classification tasks; quick check: visualize embedding space using t-SNE or UMAP
- **Implicit Hate Speech Detection**: Identifying hate speech that doesn't use explicit hate keywords - needed because most hate speech has become subtle and context-dependent; quick check: compare performance on explicit vs implicit hate examples

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Text -> Text Encoder -> Momentum Encoder -> Label-aware Queue -> Weighting Mechanism -> Contrastive Loss -> Output Classification

**Critical Path**: The critical path flows from input text through both encoders to generate embeddings, then through the label-aware queue and weighting mechanism to compute the contrastive loss. The momentum encoder's slower update rate is crucial for stability, while the label-aware queue ensures hard negatives are prioritized.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades increased complexity in negative sampling for improved discrimination without external knowledge. The momentum queue adds memory overhead but provides training stability. Label-aware weighting requires additional computation during loss calculation but focuses learning on the most informative samples.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may occur when the momentum queue becomes stale or when label-aware weighting overemphasizes semantically similar but contextually different samples. The method may struggle with datasets where implicit hate speech patterns differ significantly from training data.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline contrastive learning with random negative sampling to establish performance floor
2. Momentum contrastive learning without label-aware weighting to isolate momentum queue benefits
3. Label-aware weighting with static negative sampling to quantify the contribution of hard negative identification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to four benchmark datasets, potentially missing performance on diverse domains or languages
- Computational cost analysis focuses on inference only, lacking detailed training efficiency metrics
- Qualitative analysis provides limited examples (5 cases) to demonstrate representation superiority
- The "no external knowledge required" claim needs clarification regarding dependency on labeled training data

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|

| Generalizability and cross-dataset performance claims | Medium |
| "No additional computational costs" claim | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating momentum queue versus label-aware weighting contributions to quantify individual impacts
2. Evaluate LAHN on additional datasets representing different languages, domains, or implicit hate speech types to test generalizability
3. Perform detailed analysis of training dynamics and computational efficiency, including GPU memory usage and training time comparisons with baseline methods
