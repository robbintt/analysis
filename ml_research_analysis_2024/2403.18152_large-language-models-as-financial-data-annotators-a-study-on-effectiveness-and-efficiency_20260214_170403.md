# Large Language Models as Financial Data Annotators: A Study on Effectiveness and Efficiency

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.18152
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18152
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: GPT-4 and PaLM 2 outperformed non-expert crowdworkers by up to 29% in financial relation extraction, with LLMs replacing non-experts for ~65% of samples

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates large language models as annotators for financial relation extraction tasks, comparing their performance against non-expert crowdworkers. The authors demonstrate that GPT-4 and PaLM 2 achieve significantly higher accuracy (up to 29% improvement) while being more time and cost-efficient. They introduce the LLM-RelIndex, a reliability metric to identify trustworthy LLM annotations, finding that LLMs can replace non-expert annotators for approximately 65% of the dataset. Despite these promising results, the study confirms that expert involvement remains essential for high-quality annotations, particularly in complex financial cases.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a comparative evaluation of GPT-4 and PaLM 2 against non-expert crowdworkers on financial relation extraction tasks. They developed the LLM-RelIndex to assess annotation reliability and determine when LLM outputs can be trusted. The study involved annotating financial documents containing corporate actions and relationships, measuring accuracy, time efficiency, and cost-effectiveness across all annotator types. The reliability index was used to identify subsets of the data where LLMs could safely replace human annotators.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 and PaLM 2 achieved up to 29% higher accuracy than non-expert crowdworkers in financial relation extraction
- LLMs demonstrated superior time and cost efficiency compared to human annotators
- The LLM-RelIndex successfully identified trustworthy samples, enabling LLMs to replace non-experts for approximately 65% of the dataset
- Expert annotators remain necessary for ensuring quality in complex financial cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superior performance of LLMs in financial annotation tasks stems from their ability to process large amounts of training data containing financial terminology and relationships, allowing them to recognize patterns and extract relationships more consistently than non-expert humans. The models' contextual understanding and ability to maintain coherence across longer financial documents gives them an advantage over crowdworkers who may lack domain expertise. The LLM-RelIndex works by quantifying the confidence and consistency of LLM outputs, providing a systematic way to identify when the model's predictions are reliable enough to stand alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Financial Relation Extraction**: The task of identifying and categorizing relationships between entities in financial texts; needed because accurate extraction is crucial for downstream financial analysis, quick check: can the model distinguish between different types of corporate relationships
- **Reliability Index (LLM-RelIndex)**: A metric that quantifies the trustworthiness of LLM annotations; needed to systematically determine when LLM outputs can replace human judgment, quick check: does the index correlate with actual annotation accuracy
- **Domain Adaptation**: The process of fine-tuning general LLMs on financial-specific data; needed to ensure models understand specialized terminology and context, quick check: does performance improve after domain-specific fine-tuning
- **Crowdworker Quality Variance**: The inherent variability in annotation quality when using non-expert human annotators; needed to understand the baseline against which LLMs are compared, quick check: what is the standard deviation of crowdworker accuracy
- **Cost-Time-Quality Tradeoff**: The relationship between annotation cost, time investment, and output quality; needed to evaluate the practical utility of different annotation approaches, quick check: what is the cost per accurate annotation for each method
- **Complex Case Identification**: The ability to recognize when financial texts require expert interpretation; needed to determine the limitations of automated annotation, quick check: what percentage of samples require expert review

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Financial Document Corpus -> Pre-processing Pipeline -> Annotation Interface -> LLM Model (GPT-4/PaLM 2) -> LLM-RelIndex Scoring -> Reliability Threshold -> Output Decision (Accept/Reject/Expert Review)

**Critical Path:**
Document preprocessing -> LLM annotation generation -> Reliability index computation -> Threshold comparison -> Final annotation acceptance

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The study balances automation benefits against accuracy requirements, choosing to retain expert oversight for complex cases rather than pursuing full automation. This conservative approach prioritizes quality over complete cost reduction, accepting that 35% of cases still require expert attention.

**Failure Signatures:**
LLM annotations may fail on novel financial instruments, ambiguous relationships, or documents with unusual formatting. The LLM-RelIndex may produce false positives when the model is confidently wrong, particularly in cases involving emerging financial terminology not well-represented in training data.

**First Experiments:**
1. Measure baseline accuracy of non-expert crowdworkers on a held-out test set
2. Compute LLM-RelIndex scores across all annotations to establish reliability thresholds
3. Conduct error analysis on cases where LLMs were rejected to identify common failure patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation conducted on a single financial domain, limiting generalizability to other financial subdomains
- LLM-RelIndex performance not extensively validated across different financial contexts
- Potential biases in LLM outputs not systematically addressed
- Model performance degradation with increasingly complex or ambiguous financial texts not evaluated

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: LLMs significantly outperform non-expert annotators in accuracy and efficiency
- **Medium confidence**: LLMs can replace non-expert annotators for approximately 65% of samples
- **Medium confidence**: Expert involvement remains necessary for complex cases

## Next Checks
1. Test the LLM-RelIndex approach across multiple financial subdomains (earnings reports, M&A announcements, regulatory filings) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct a longitudinal study to evaluate how LLM annotation quality evolves as financial terminology and market contexts change over time
3. Implement a systematic bias analysis to identify systematic errors in LLM annotations, particularly around culturally-specific financial practices or emerging financial instruments
