# A Trainable Feature Extractor Module for Deep Neural Networks and Scanpath Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.12493
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12493
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Novel trainable feature extraction module achieves state-of-the-art performance on scanpath classification tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a trainable feature extraction module for deep neural networks designed for scanpath classification. The module transforms scanpaths into feature vectors by evaluating sequences of angles and angle ranges, producing histograms that serve as input to a classification network. What makes this approach novel is the integration of the angle and angle range method into the backpropagation algorithm, enabling joint training with the classifier. The method was evaluated on three public eye-tracking datasets (Gaze, WherePeopleLook, and DOVES) and compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that the proposed module performs at least as well as random ferns and often outperforms other methods, with accuracy scores reaching up to 91% on certain tasks.

## Method Summary
The method involves a custom module that transforms scanpaths into histogram-based feature vectors using angle and angle range evaluation. In the forward pass, the module computes inter-sample angles and checks them against predefined angle ranges to select histogram indices. These histograms are then normalized and passed to a ResNet-12 classifier. The backward pass propagates gradients from the classifier to each histogram bin, adjusting angle ranges based on gradient signs. The module uses multiple angle sets of varying sequence lengths to capture temporal dependencies at different scales. The entire system is trained end-to-end using SGD with momentum, with a learning rate of 1e-3 reduced to 1e-4 after 50 epochs over 100 total epochs.

## Key Results
- The proposed module performs at least as well as random ferns on all tested datasets
- Outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on stimulus classification tasks, achieving up to 91% accuracy
- Demonstrates effectiveness of angle-based features in scanpath classification
- Shows the potential of jointly trainable feature extraction layers for deep learning models in this domain

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The trainable feature extraction module transforms scanpaths into histogram-based feature vectors that are directly usable by deep neural networks.
- Mechanism: The module evaluates sequences of angles and angle ranges, producing histograms that serve as input to the classification network. By integrating this process into the backpropagation algorithm, the module adapts its parameters to improve classification performance.
- Core assumption: Angle and angle range sequences contain discriminative information for scanpath classification that can be effectively learned through backpropagation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The module transforms scanpaths into feature vectors by evaluating sequences of angles and angle ranges, producing histograms that serve as input to a classification network."
  - [section]: "In the forward pass, our layer gets the entire sequence and checks a series of inter-sample angles and angle ranges. Based on these checks, a histogram index is selected and increased."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct corpus papers address angle-based scanpath features specifically.
- Break condition: If angle sequences do not contain discriminative information, or if the histogram representation fails to capture meaningful patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Joint training of the feature extraction module with the classifier network enables end-to-end optimization.
- Mechanism: The backward pass propagates gradients from the classifier to each histogram bin, adjusting angle ranges based on the sign of the gradient (increase if positive, decrease if negative).
- Core assumption: The gradient signal from the classifier can effectively guide the adjustment of angle ranges to improve feature extraction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "What makes this approach novel is the integration of the angle and angle range method into the backpropagation algorithm, enabling joint training with the classifier."
  - [section]: "In the backward pass, we propagate the gradient back to each histogram bin. Based on the sign of the gradient, we either increase or decrease the angle range."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - while related papers discuss trainable feature extractors, none specifically address angle-range backpropagation for scanpaths.
- Break condition: If the gradient signal becomes too noisy or fails to provide meaningful direction for angle range adjustments.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The angle and angle range approach captures sequential dependencies in scanpaths that are important for classification.
- Mechanism: By evaluating multiple angle sets of varying sequence lengths, the module can detect patterns at different temporal scales within the scanpath data.
- Core assumption: Different scanpath classification tasks benefit from features at multiple temporal scales.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We evaluated our module on three public datasets and compared it to the state of the art approaches."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - while related papers discuss scanpath classification, none specifically address multi-scale angle analysis.
- Break condition: If single temporal scale features are sufficient, or if the multi-scale approach introduces unnecessary complexity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Backpropagation algorithm
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding how gradients flow from the classifier to adjust the feature extraction module parameters.
  - Quick check question: What determines whether an angle range increases or decreases during backpropagation?

- Concept: Histogram-based feature representation
  - Why needed here: The core output format of the feature extraction module, which must be understood to interpret results.
  - Quick check question: How are the final histogram values normalized before being passed to the classifier?

- Concept: Angle and angle range computation in 2D space
  - Why needed here: Fundamental to understanding how the module evaluates scanpath sequences.
  - Quick check question: What geometric information is captured by comparing consecutive angles in a scanpath?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input scanpath → Angle/angle range evaluation → Histogram generation → ResNet-12 classifier → Output classification
- Critical path: Forward pass (angle evaluation → histogram indexing → normalization) → Classifier prediction → Backward pass (gradient propagation → angle range adjustment)
- Design tradeoffs: Joint training vs. pre-trained feature extractor, angle set complexity vs. computational efficiency
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on datasets with different characteristics, overfitting on training data, unstable training due to gradient issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test with synthetic scanpath data where ground truth classification is known based on angle patterns
  2. Compare performance with varying numbers of angle sets (e.g., 2^10, 2^11, 2^12) on the Gaze dataset
  3. Evaluate the effect of different sequence lengths (set sizes) on classification accuracy across all three datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed trainable feature extraction module perform on long-term eye-tracking recordings in real-world settings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge that long-term recordings with many subjects and sequences are not publicly available, which prevented evaluation on such datasets.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation was limited to short recording lengths due to data availability constraints, leaving performance on longer recordings unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the module on publicly available long-term eye-tracking datasets or collecting such data for evaluation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the base angle itself be learned as part of the trainable feature extraction module?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention future work should investigate if it is possible to learn the base angle itself.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation does not include learning the base angle, and this aspect was not explored in the evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modifying the module to include learning the base angle and comparing its performance to the current implementation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed module compare to other deep learning architectures, such as generative adversarial networks, for generating human visual behavior?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that future work could explore using the module in generative adversarial networks to generate human visual behavior.
- Why unresolved: The potential application of the module in generative adversarial networks was not explored in the current study.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the module in a generative adversarial network and evaluating its ability to generate realistic human visual behavior.

## Limitations

- Limited evaluation on datasets with varying sequence lengths, preventing assessment on long-term recordings
- No ablation studies comparing the trainable feature extraction module against fixed angle range baselines
- Implementation details for the backward pass angle range updates are not fully specified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The basic mechanism of angle-based histogram generation and its integration with backpropagation is well-described
- **Medium confidence**: The performance claims are supported by experiments on three datasets, but the methodology lacks some critical implementation details
- **Medium confidence**: The novelty claim is reasonable given the literature search, though the search scope appears limited

## Next Checks

1. Implement synthetic scanpath datasets with known angle-based patterns to verify that the module can learn to distinguish these patterns
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing the full model with (a) a fixed angle range version, (b) a classifier-only baseline, and (c) random fern baselines on identical data splits
3. Test the model's robustness by evaluating performance on datasets with varying levels of noise and occlusion in the scanpath data
