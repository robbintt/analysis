core_contribution: This paper proposes a categorical framework for analyzing the interpretability
  of AI models by representing them as compositional models using string diagrams.
  The authors define a compositional model as a functor between a structure category
  (syntax) and a semantics category (implementation), allowing for deterministic,
  probabilistic, and quantum models to be compared uniformly.

# Towards Compositional Interpretability for XAI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.17583
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17583
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Presents a categorical framework for analyzing AI interpretability through compositional models using string diagrams, unifying deterministic, probabilistic, and quantum models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel categorical framework for compositional interpretability in explainable AI (XAI) that represents AI models as functors between structure (syntax) and semantics (implementation) categories. The framework introduces compositionally-interpretable (CI) models, which generalize intrinsically interpretable models by incorporating rich compositional structure. Using string diagrams, the authors provide three types of diagrammatic explanations: no-influence arguments, diagram surgery, and rewrite explanations using graphical equations.

The approach offers a unified mathematical language for analyzing interpretability across different model types and clarifies common themes in XAI literature. The framework demonstrates that models like causal models, conceptual space models, and DisCoCirc models in NLP qualify as CI models, potentially offering interpretability advantages over black-box architectures. However, the framework's practical applicability to modern deep learning systems remains to be demonstrated.

## Method Summary
The authors define compositional models as functors between a category representing model structure (syntax) and a category representing implementation (semantics). This categorical approach unifies deterministic, probabilistic, and quantum models under a common mathematical framework. Compositional-interpretable models are defined as those containing rich interpretable compositional structure, extending beyond simple transparency. The framework uses string diagrams as a visual language to represent model components and their interactions, enabling three types of explanations: no-inference arguments showing independence between components, diagram surgery for modifying explanations, and rewrite explanations using graphical equations to transform representations.

## Key Results
- Introduces a categorical framework that unifies deterministic, probabilistic, and quantum models under compositional interpretability
- Defines compositionally-interpretable models as those with rich compositional structure, generalizing intrinsically interpretable models
- Demonstrates that causal models, conceptual space models, and DisCoCirc models qualify as CI models
- Provides three diagrammatic explanation types: no-influence arguments, diagram surgery, and rewrite explanations using graphical equations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging category theory to formalize the compositional structure of interpretable models. By representing models as functors between syntax and semantics categories, it captures how high-level concepts decompose into lower-level components while maintaining interpretability. The string diagram formalism provides an intuitive visual language that makes complex compositional relationships explicit and manipulable, enabling explanations that trace how information flows through the model's compositional structure.

## Foundational Learning
- **Category Theory**: Provides the mathematical foundation for representing models as compositional structures. Why needed: Enables rigorous formalization of how components combine and interact. Quick check: Can you identify objects and morphisms in a simple compositional model?
- **String Diagrams**: Visual language for representing categorical compositions. Why needed: Makes complex compositional relationships intuitive and manipulable. Quick check: Can you translate a simple categorical composition into a string diagram?
- **Functor**: Maps structure (syntax) to implementation (semantics) while preserving compositional relationships. Why needed: Formalizes how interpretable models maintain structure during implementation. Quick check: Can you identify what structure is preserved when mapping syntax to semantics?
- **No-influence Arguments**: Explain independence between model components. Why needed: Demonstrates that certain components don't affect others, crucial for interpretability. Quick check: Can you identify which components are independent in a given model?
- **Diagram Surgery**: Technique for modifying explanations by altering model structure. Why needed: Enables targeted explanations and interventions. Quick check: Can you perform a simple diagram surgery operation?
- **Rewrite Rules**: Graphical equations for transforming model representations. Why needed: Provides systematic ways to simplify or restructure explanations. Quick check: Can you apply a rewrite rule to simplify a diagram?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Structure Category (Syntax) -> Functor -> Semantics Category (Implementation) -> String Diagram Representation -> Explanations (No-influence, Surgery, Rewrite)

**Critical Path**: The framework's core flow moves from defining the compositional structure of a model, representing it categorically as a functor, visualizing it as string diagrams, and then extracting interpretable explanations through the three diagrammatic techniques.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes mathematical elegance and unification across model types over immediate practical applicability. This creates a tradeoff between theoretical generality and the complexity of applying the framework to real-world deep learning architectures.

**Failure Signatures**: The framework may fail to provide interpretable explanations when compositional structure is weak or when the functor mapping from syntax to semantics loses important information. Models that are inherently non-compositional or have highly entangled representations may not benefit from this approach.

**First Experiments**:
1. Apply the framework to a simple decision tree to demonstrate how compositional interpretability captures the tree's structure.
2. Use the framework to analyze a Bayesian network and show how no-influence arguments explain conditional independence.
3. Implement diagram surgery on a simple causal model to demonstrate how interventions affect explanations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the source material.

## Limitations
- The abstract categorical foundation may limit accessibility to researchers outside category theory
- Practical applicability to modern deep learning architectures needs demonstration
- Limited empirical validation beyond conceptual space models, causal models, and DisCoCirc models

## Next Checks

1. Apply the framework to analyze a standard transformer-based model and demonstrate how compositional interpretability provides novel insights beyond existing XAI methods.

2. Conduct user studies comparing understanding and trust in explanations generated through the proposed compositional approach versus traditional feature attribution methods.

3. Develop concrete metrics for measuring "compositional interpretability" that can be quantitatively evaluated across different model architectures.
