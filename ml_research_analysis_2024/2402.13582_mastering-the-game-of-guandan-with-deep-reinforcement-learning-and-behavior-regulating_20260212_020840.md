# Mastering the Game of Guandan with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Behavior Regulating

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.13582
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13582
- Reference count: 38
- GuanZero achieves 82-99% win rates against various opponents in the complex card game Guandan

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of building an AI agent to master the complex card game Guandan, which involves imperfect information, a large state space, and strategic cooperation between teammates. The authors propose GuanZero, a deep reinforcement learning framework that combines Monte Carlo methods with a carefully designed neural network encoding scheme to regulate agents' behavior. GuanZero uses distributed learning with multiple actors and a learner process to efficiently train the agents. The key innovation is the encoding of state features and one-hot vectors to encourage cooperative behaviors like cooperating, dwarfing, and assisting between teammates. Experimental results show that GuanZero agents achieve high win rates against various opponents, demonstrating effective learning of strategic cooperation and game play.

## Method Summary
GuanZero is a deep reinforcement learning framework that addresses the challenges of building AI agents for the complex card game Guandan. The framework uses a neural network with carefully designed encoding schemes for state features and one-hot vectors to encourage cooperative behaviors between teammates. The network takes in the encoded state and outputs action probabilities. GuanZero employs distributed learning with multiple actors and a learner process to efficiently train the agents. The key innovation lies in the behavior regulating scheme, which guides the agents to adopt cooperative strategies like cooperating, dwarfing, and assisting their teammates. This is achieved through the encoding of state features and one-hot vectors that capture the game state and encourage specific behaviors.

## Key Results
- GuanZero agents achieve 82-99% win rates against various opponents, including random agents, rule-based agents, and agents based on the DouZero framework.
- The behavior regulating scheme proves effective in improving the agents' performance by encouraging cooperative behaviors between teammates.
- GuanZero demonstrates the potential of deep reinforcement learning for mastering complex card games with imperfect information and strategic cooperation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The GuanZero framework works by combining Monte Carlo methods with a carefully designed neural network encoding scheme. The encoding of state features and one-hot vectors allows the agents to effectively capture the game state and encourage cooperative behaviors. The distributed learning setup with multiple actors and a learner process enables efficient training of the agents. By regulating the agents' behavior through the encoding scheme, GuanZero guides them to adopt strategies that promote cooperation between teammates, such as cooperating, dwarfing, and assisting. This behavior regulation is key to the agents' success in the complex card game Guandan.

## Foundational Learning
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: GuanZero utilizes deep reinforcement learning to train agents for the complex card game Guandan. This approach allows the agents to learn optimal strategies through trial and error interactions with the game environment.
  - Why needed: Guandan involves imperfect information and a large state space, making it challenging to hand-craft effective strategies.
  - Quick check: Evaluate the agents' performance against various opponents to assess the effectiveness of the learned strategies.

- **Monte Carlo Methods**: GuanZero combines Monte Carlo methods with deep reinforcement learning to estimate the value of game states and guide the agents' decision-making.
  - Why needed: Monte Carlo methods provide a way to estimate the value of states in complex games without the need for an explicit model of the game dynamics.
  - Quick check: Analyze the agents' decision-making process and the role of Monte Carlo methods in shaping their strategies.

- **Behavior Regulation**: GuanZero employs a behavior regulating scheme through the encoding of state features and one-hot vectors to encourage cooperative behaviors between teammates.
  - Why needed: Guandan requires strategic cooperation between teammates, and behavior regulation helps guide the agents towards cooperative strategies.
  - Quick check: Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of the behavior regulating scheme on agent performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Neural Network (State Features Encoding + One-hot Vectors) -> Distributed Learning (Actors + Learner) -> GuanZero Agents

Critical path:
State encoding -> Neural network processing -> Action selection -> Game environment interaction -> Reward feedback -> Parameter updates

Design tradeoffs:
- Balancing the complexity of the neural network architecture with the computational resources available for training.
- Choosing the appropriate encoding scheme for state features and one-hot vectors to encourage desired behaviors.
- Determining the optimal number of actors and learner processes for efficient distributed learning.

Failure signatures:
- Agents failing to learn effective strategies or showing poor performance against opponents.
- Lack of cooperation between teammates, leading to suboptimal team performance.
- Overfitting to specific opponents or game scenarios, resulting in poor generalization.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate GuanZero agents against random agents to assess their basic gameplay capabilities.
2. Compare GuanZero agents' performance with rule-based agents to measure their strategic superiority.
3. Analyze the learned strategies and decision-making processes of GuanZero agents to gain insights into their cooperative behaviors.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The paper does not provide detailed information on the computational resources required for training the distributed GuanZero agents.
- The performance scaling with larger numbers of actors or longer training times is unclear.
- The evaluation focuses on win rates against specific opponents but lacks analysis of the learned strategies or comparison to human expert play.

## Confidence
- The GuanZero framework demonstrates impressive win rates against various opponents, suggesting effective learning of strategic cooperation and game play. (High)
- The behavior regulating scheme and the cooperative behaviors learned by the agents should be viewed with medium confidence until additional ablation studies or human evaluations are conducted. (Medium)
- The claims about the effectiveness of the encoding scheme and the generalization of the learned strategies require further validation. (Medium)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of the behavior regulating scheme on agent performance.
2. Evaluate GuanZero agents against human expert players to assess their strategic capabilities and identify potential weaknesses.
3. Analyze the learned strategies and decision-making processes of the GuanZero agents to gain insights into their cooperative behaviors and game play patterns.
