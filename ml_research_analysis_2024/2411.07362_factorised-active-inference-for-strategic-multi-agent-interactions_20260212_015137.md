core_contribution: This paper integrates Active Inference (AIF) with game theory to
  model strategic decision-making in multi-agent interactions. It proposes a factorised
  generative model where each agent maintains explicit beliefs about the internal
  states of others and uses them for strategic planning in a joint context.

# Factorised Active Inference for Strategic Multi-Agent Interactions

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07362
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Integrates Active Inference with game theory for multi-agent strategic decision-making using factorised generative models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework that combines Active Inference (AIF) with game theory to model strategic decision-making in multi-agent interactions. The approach uses a factorised generative model where each agent maintains explicit beliefs about the internal states of others and employs these for strategic planning within a joint context. The framework is applied to iterated general-sum games with two and three players, incorporating non-stationarity through game transitions where agents' preferences change over time. The study provides dynamical analysis of variational free energy (VFE) and expected free energy (EFE), revealing that ensemble-level EFE characterises basins of attraction in games with multiple Nash equilibria and is not necessarily minimised at the aggregate level.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a factorised Active Inference framework for multi-agent strategic interactions by extending the standard AIF formulation to include explicit beliefs about other agents' internal states. Each agent maintains a generative model that factorises across agents, allowing for strategic reasoning about others' beliefs and preferences. The model incorporates game-theoretic elements by treating strategic interactions as partially observable Markov decision processes where agents optimize expected free energy. Non-stationarity is introduced through game transitions that modify agents' preferences over time, creating a dynamic environment for strategic planning. The framework is implemented using variational inference techniques to approximate posterior beliefs about states and policies.

## Key Results
- Ensemble-level expected free energy (EFE) characterises basins of attraction in games with multiple Nash equilibria
- EFE is not necessarily minimised at the aggregate level, challenging conventional optimisation assumptions
- The framework successfully models strategic decision-making in iterated general-sum games with changing preferences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by enabling agents to maintain sophisticated beliefs about other agents' internal states while planning strategically. By factorising the generative model across agents, each agent can reason about others' beliefs and preferences without requiring complete knowledge of their decision processes. The integration of Active Inference principles ensures that agents balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining coherence with their generative models. The non-stationarity through game transitions allows the framework to capture dynamic strategic environments where preferences evolve over time, making it more realistic for modelling real-world interactions.

## Foundational Learning

**Active Inference**: A theoretical framework combining Bayesian inference with decision-making under uncertainty, needed for modelling how agents update beliefs and make choices based on expected free energy. Quick check: Understanding the free energy principle and its application to decision-making.

**Game Theory**: Mathematical framework for analysing strategic interactions between rational agents, needed to model competitive and cooperative scenarios. Quick check: Familiarity with Nash equilibria and general-sum games.

**Generative Models**: Probabilistic models that describe how data is generated, needed for representing agents' beliefs about states and other agents. Quick check: Understanding of Bayesian networks and belief propagation.

**Variational Inference**: Approximate Bayesian inference method using optimisation, needed to compute posterior beliefs efficiently. Quick check: Knowledge of KL divergence and evidence lower bound.

**Expected Free Energy**: Decision-making objective that balances epistemic and pragmatic value, needed for planning under uncertainty. Quick check: Understanding of exploration-exploitation tradeoffs.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Agent beliefs -> Generative model -> Variational inference -> Policy selection -> Game interaction -> Preference transitions

Critical path: Each agent forms beliefs about states and other agents -> Computes expected free energy for policies -> Selects optimal policy through variational inference -> Executes actions in game environment -> Preferences change through game transitions -> Cycle repeats

Design tradeoffs: Factorised vs. centralised models (scalability vs. computational efficiency), explicit vs. implicit belief modelling (interpretability vs. complexity), static vs. dynamic preference modelling (simplicity vs. realism)

Failure signatures: Convergence to suboptimal equilibria, divergence in belief updates, computational intractability with larger agent populations, sensitivity to initial conditions

First experiments:
1. Implement the framework on a simple two-player iterated Prisoner's Dilemma to verify basic functionality
2. Test the model on a three-player game with known multiple equilibria to observe EFE behaviour
3. Apply the framework to a non-stationary environment with gradually changing preferences to assess adaptation capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Tested only on iterated general-sum games with two and three players, limiting scalability assessment
- Non-stationarity implemented through simplified game transitions rather than continuous dynamic environments
- Analysis focuses on computational VFE and EFE dynamics without extensive empirical validation against real-world interactions

## Confidence
High confidence in theoretical integration of Active Inference with game theory and mathematical formulation of factorised generative models. Medium confidence in interpretation of ensemble-level EFE behaviour and its relationship to aggregate-level optimisation. Lower confidence in broader claims about bridging individual cognition and collective dynamics, which require more extensive empirical validation.

## Next Checks
1. Test the factorised Active Inference framework on larger-scale multi-agent games with more than three players and varying game complexities
2. Conduct empirical studies comparing the model's performance against standard multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms in both stationary and non-stationary environments
3. Implement the framework in real-world strategic scenarios, such as automated negotiation systems or cooperative robotics, to assess practical applicability and scalability
