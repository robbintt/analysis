# Rectified Gaussian kernel multi-view k-means clustering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.05619
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05619
- Authors: Kristina P. Sinaga
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Two new multi-view k-means clustering algorithms (MVKM-ED and GKMVKM) using Gaussian-kernel-based distances achieve superior clustering performance compared to existing methods across five real-world datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two new multi-view k-means clustering algorithms that use Gaussian kernel-based distances to improve clustering performance on multi-view data. The methods, MVKM-ED and GKMVKM, optimize objective functions by simultaneously aligning stabilizer parameters and kernel coefficients to reduce sensitivity to noise and outliers. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that these approaches achieve superior clustering performance compared to existing multi-view k-means algorithms across multiple evaluation metrics.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two algorithms: Multi-view k-means with exponent distance (MVKM-ED) and Gaussian-kernel multi-view k-means (GKMVKM). Both methods use Gaussian kernel similarity functions to transform raw Euclidean distances into smoother similarity measures. MVKM-ED employs an exponent parameter α to control the influence of each view, while GKMVKM introduces a stabilizer parameter p to control sensitivity to intra-cluster variations. The algorithms iteratively update cluster centers, view weights, kernel coefficients, and membership assignments until convergence.

## Key Results
- MVKM-ED and GKMVKM achieve superior clustering performance compared to existing multi-view k-means algorithms across five real-world datasets
- The methods demonstrate robustness to noise and outliers through Gaussian kernel smoothing and parameter optimization
- Experimental results show significant improvements in normalized mutual information, adjusted rand index, accuracy, recall, precision, and F-score

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The exponent Gaussian-kernel-based distance in MVKM-ED improves clustering by transforming raw Euclidean distances into smooth similarity measures that reduce the impact of noise and outliers.
- Mechanism: The Gaussian kernel exp(-βh||x_i^h - a_k^h||²) compresses large distances more aggressively than linear metrics, making dissimilar points even more separated while keeping similar points close. The exponent parameter α controls the influence of each view, allowing the algorithm to balance contributions dynamically.
- Core assumption: Gaussian kernel smoothing preserves cluster structure while suppressing noise, and the distance metric remains effective under exponentiation.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "calculating similarity using Euclidean norm in the space of Gaussian-kernel" [section] "we present new Euclidean norm-based-distances to ensure the representations of similar samples to be close and dissimilar samples to be distant"
- Break condition: If βh is poorly estimated or α is too small, the kernel smoothing becomes ineffective and distances collapse into near-uniform similarity, destroying cluster separation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The stabilizer parameter p in GKMVKM provides explicit control over the sensitivity of the kernel-based distance to intra-cluster variations, enabling robustness to noise.
- Mechanism: Raising the kernel similarity (exp(-βh||x_i^h - a_k^h||²))^p to a power p amplifies the contrast between close and distant points. When p > 1, small distances shrink further and large distances grow, tightening clusters and pushing noise points outward.
- Core assumption: The exponential kernel shape is maintained under exponentiation, so raising to p preserves monotonicity and the effective distance ordering.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "To penalize the effects of p, a new condition in the weighted distance ... is regularized as (exp(-βh||x_i^h - a_k^h||²))^p" [section] "these parameters of βh and p are extensively playing major roles and should be carefully tuned"
- Break condition: If p is set too high, the kernel becomes extremely peaked and numerically unstable, causing clusters to fragment or memberships to become binary.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Simultaneous estimation of view weights vh and kernel coefficients βh in MVKM-ED allows the algorithm to adapt to varying quality and relevance of each view, improving overall clustering accuracy.
- Mechanism: View weights are updated based on the current reconstruction error per view, so informative views with low error get higher weights. Kernel coefficients βh are estimated from data statistics (e.g., distance to cluster centers) so each view's kernel scale matches its inherent variability.
- Core assumption: The view importance is reflected in reconstruction error and can be captured by a simple ratio-based weight update rule.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "by simultaneously aligning the stabilizer parameter p and kernel coefficients βh, the compression of Gaussian-kernel based weighted distance ... reduce the sensitivity" [section] "α is an exponent parameter to control the behavior of one data view during the clustering process"
- Break condition: If βh estimates are noisy or if view weights become too skewed, some views may dominate or be ignored entirely, reducing multi-view benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian kernel similarity function
  - Why needed here: Forms the basis of the distance metric that replaces raw Euclidean distance, enabling nonlinear separation of clusters.
  - Quick check question: How does the Gaussian kernel transform a Euclidean distance d into a similarity s?

- Concept: Exponentiation of kernel similarities
  - Why needed here: Controls the "sharpness" of the similarity decay, allowing fine-tuning of cluster tightness.
  - Quick check question: What happens to the similarity ranking between two pairs of points when you raise their kernel values to a power p > 1?

- Concept: View-weighted multi-view clustering
  - Why needed here: Enables the algorithm to combine heterogeneous data sources where some views are more informative than others.
  - Quick check question: Why do we need to update view weights vh during clustering instead of fixing them a priori?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data → Kernel distance computation → Weighted distance aggregation → Cluster assignment → Parameter update (βh, p, vh) → Convergence check → Labels
- Critical path: Kernel coefficient estimation → Kernel distance calculation → Membership update → View weight update → Cluster center update
- Design tradeoffs: Using exponentiation (p) increases robustness but risks numerical instability; adaptive βh estimation improves quality but adds computational overhead
- Failure signatures: If NMI/ARI stagnate or oscillate, suspect poor βh initialization; if one view dominates weights, suspect incorrect α scaling
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Synthetic 3-view, 4-cluster data: test sensitivity of p and βh estimation on known structure
  2. NUS-WIDE object data: measure scalability with large n and compare to baseline MVKM
  3. UW A3D activity data: evaluate robustness to noise and view imbalance with varying α

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the stabilizer parameter p and kernel coefficients βh in GKMVKM interact, and what is the optimal way to jointly tune them for different types of multi-view datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "in GKMVKM, these parameters of βh and p are extensively playing major roles and should be carefully tuned to the problem at hand" but doesn't provide a systematic approach for joint tuning.
- Why unresolved: The paper only suggests a user-defined approach for p and mentions an expensive peak mountain function approach for estimation, without comparing their effectiveness or providing guidance on when to use each.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study comparing different tuning strategies (grid search, Bayesian optimization, etc.) across various multi-view datasets, including analysis of how p and βh values affect clustering performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed MVKM-ED algorithm compare in computational efficiency to existing multi-view k-means variants, especially on large-scale datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims the algorithms are "robust and efficient" but doesn't provide computational complexity analysis or runtime comparisons with competing methods.
- Why unresolved: No empirical runtime measurements or theoretical complexity analysis are provided to support the efficiency claims.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark experiments measuring execution time across datasets of varying sizes, along with theoretical analysis of the algorithm's time and space complexity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical justification for using Gaussian kernel distance in multi-view clustering, and how does it relate to the underlying data distribution assumptions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces Gaussian-kernel-based distances but doesn't provide theoretical justification for this choice or analyze its relationship to data distribution properties.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the method as heuristic without connecting it to established theoretical frameworks or proving convergence properties.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis showing conditions under which Gaussian kernel distance improves clustering quality, or empirical evidence demonstrating its advantages over other distance measures for specific data distributions.

## Limitations
- The paper provides limited details on initialization methods for cluster centers and memberships, which are critical for fair comparison with baseline methods
- Specific code implementation details for the MVKM-ED and GKMVKM algorithms, such as handling of convergence criteria and parameter tuning, are not fully specified
- The exact impact of the stabilizer parameter p and kernel coefficients βh on clustering performance is not fully elucidated, as their effects may be interdependent and dataset-specific

## Confidence
- High: The overall effectiveness of the Gaussian-kernel-based distance in improving clustering performance is supported by experimental results on multiple real-world datasets
- Medium: The robustness of the proposed methods to noise and outliers is demonstrated, but the extent of this robustness may depend on specific parameter settings and dataset characteristics
- Low: The exact impact of the stabilizer parameter p and kernel coefficients βh on clustering performance is not fully elucidated, as their effects may be interdependent and dataset-specific

## Next Checks
1. Conduct sensitivity analysis of the MVKM-ED and GKMVKM algorithms with respect to the stabilizer parameter p and kernel coefficients βh on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets to better understand their individual and combined effects
2. Compare the performance of the proposed methods with additional baseline algorithms that employ different distance metrics or kernel functions to isolate the contribution of the Gaussian-kernel-based approach
3. Investigate the scalability of the MVKM-ED and GKMVKM algorithms on large-scale multi-view datasets with high dimensionality and a large number of views to assess their practical applicability in real-world scenarios
