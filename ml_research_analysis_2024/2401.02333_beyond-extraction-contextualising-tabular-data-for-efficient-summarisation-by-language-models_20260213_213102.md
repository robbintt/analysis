# Beyond Extraction: Contextualising Tabular Data for Efficient Summarisation by Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2401.02333
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02333
- **Reference count**: 9
- **Key outcome**: 66% overall accuracy (vs 54% baseline) for complex table queries using RAG with enriched tabular data

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of retrieving information from complex tabular structures in PDF documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. The authors propose a method that separately extracts tables from PDFs, enriches them by concatenating headers with corresponding values, and then augments the data using the ChatGPT 3.5 API. The enriched data is then fed into the RAG system alongside the original PDFs. Experimental results show that this approach significantly improves the accuracy of complex table queries, achieving an overall accuracy of 66% compared to 54% with the baseline method.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach involves extracting tables from PDFs using the Camelot library, enriching them by concatenating column headers with corresponding row values, and augmenting the enriched data using ChatGPT 3.5 API through a one-shot prompt. A fine-tuned Llama-2-chat model is then used for summarization within the RAG architecture. The enriched tables and original PDFs are stored in a retrieval database, which is used to process queries and generate responses.

## Key Results
- 66% overall accuracy for complex table queries (vs 54% baseline)
- 93.3% accuracy for text queries (vs 86.6% baseline)
- Significant improvement in table query handling through context enrichment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Context enrichment through concatenation of headers and corresponding values improves table comprehension.
- **Mechanism**: By combining column headers with their respective row values, the tabular data becomes more semantically connected, preserving contextual relationships within complex rows.
- **Core assumption**: Language models can better interpret tabular data when headers are explicitly linked to their values in the text.
- **Evidence anchors**: 
  - [abstract]: "The enrichment process involves combining the headers and their corresponding values within the tables of PDF documents."
  - [section]: "To catalyse context enrichment, we embarked on a journey of amalgamation, deftly concatenating column headings with corresponding row values, thereby bestowing upon the extracted tables a deeper and more nuanced contextual essence."
- **Break condition**: If headers and values are ambiguous or if the table structure is too complex for simple concatenation to capture relationships.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Fine-tuned Llama-2 model specialized for summarization enhances understanding of enriched tabular data.
- **Mechanism**: The fine-tuned Llama-2 model, trained on summarization tasks, can effectively distill key information from the enriched tabular context, improving query response accuracy.
- **Core assumption**: A model fine-tuned for summarization will be better at extracting relevant information from structured data compared to a general-purpose model.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the enriched data, we employ a fine-tuned version of the Llama-2-chat language model for summarisation within the RAG architecture."
  - [section]: "Its role was not merely perfunctory; rather, it served as the discerning arbiter of summarisation tasks, illuminating the tabular data with a refined understanding."
- **Break condition**: If the fine-tuning data does not adequately represent the types of tables in the target documents.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: ChatGPT 3.5 API augmentation adds contextual sense to enriched tabular data.
- **Mechanism**: The one-shot prompt to ChatGPT 3.5 API further processes the enriched tabular data, adding semantic understanding and improving the data's interpretability for the summarization model.
- **Core assumption**: ChatGPT 3.5 API can effectively augment tabular data with additional context that improves downstream task performance.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Furthermore, we augment the tabular data with contextual sense using the ChatGPT 3.5 API through a one-shot prompt."
  - [section]: "To further enhance contextual comprehension, the enriched tabular data undergoes an additional stratum of augmentation through the ChatGPT 3.5 API."
- **Break condition**: If the one-shot prompt is not sufficient to capture the necessary context or if the API's interpretation diverges from the intended meaning.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Tabular data extraction and representation
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding how to extract and represent tabular data is crucial for effective context enrichment and subsequent processing.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the challenges in extracting tables from PDF documents, and how does the Camelot library address them?

- **Concept**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture
  - **Why needed here**: The study leverages RAG to integrate retrieved information with generative capabilities for improved table query handling.
  - **Quick check question**: How does the RAG architecture differ from traditional retrieval or generation approaches, and what advantages does it offer for complex table queries?

- **Concept**: Fine-tuning language models for specific tasks
  - **Why needed here**: The Llama-2 model is fine-tuned for summarization to better handle the enriched tabular data, highlighting the importance of task-specific model adaptation.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the key considerations when fine-tuning a large language model, and how does it impact the model's performance on specialized tasks like table summarization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: PDF storage in retrieval database -> Tabular data extraction (Camelot library) -> Context enrichment (header-value concatenation) -> Llama-2 fine-tuned summarization model -> ChatGPT 3.5 API augmentation -> Enriched data storage in retrieval database

- **Critical path**: PDF → Table extraction → Context enrichment → Llama-2 summarization → ChatGPT augmentation → Storage → Query processing

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Separate storage of PDFs and enriched tables vs. integrated storage
  - Fine-tuning Llama-2 vs. using a pre-trained model
  - One-shot prompt vs. multi-turn conversation with ChatGPT API

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low accuracy in table queries despite high text query accuracy (indicates issues with table extraction or context enrichment)
  - Degradation in performance when scaling to more complex table structures (suggests limitations in the fine-tuning approach)
  - Inconsistencies between ChatGPT augmentation and original table semantics (points to issues with the one-shot prompt or API interpretation)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare accuracy of text-only queries using baseline vs. enriched data approach
  2. Evaluate the impact of context enrichment on table query accuracy by testing with and without header-value concatenation
  3. Assess the contribution of ChatGPT augmentation by comparing results with and without the one-shot prompt step

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the proposed approach perform on tabular data from diverse document formats beyond PDFs, such as spreadsheets or HTML tables?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The study focuses on PDF documents and does not explore performance on other tabular data formats.
- **Why unresolved**: The experiments and methodology are tailored to PDF extraction and may not directly translate to other formats with different table structures and extraction challenges.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments using the same approach on tabular data from diverse formats (e.g., spreadsheets, HTML tables) and comparing the results to the PDF-based performance.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What is the impact of table complexity (e.g., number of columns, nested tables, merged cells) on the accuracy of the proposed approach?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The study mentions "complex table queries" but does not provide a detailed analysis of how different aspects of table complexity affect performance.
- **Why unresolved**: The experiments use a mix of complex and simpler table queries but do not isolate the impact of specific complexity factors on accuracy.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Designing experiments that systematically vary table complexity factors (e.g., number of columns, presence of nested tables, merged cells) and measuring the impact on query accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does the proposed approach compare to other state-of-the-art methods for table question answering and information retrieval?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The study does not compare the proposed approach to other methods in the literature.
- **Why unresolved**: Without a comparison to other methods, it is difficult to assess the relative performance and novelty of the proposed approach.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments that compare the proposed approach to other state-of-the-art methods for table question answering and information retrieval, using the same dataset and evaluation metrics.

## Limitations
- Reliance on ChatGPT 3.5 API for contextual augmentation introduces potential variability and dependency on external services.
- Fine-tuning process for Llama-2-chat lacks detailed specification, making it difficult to assess reproducibility.
- Experimental setup uses a relatively small dataset (200 queries), which may not capture the full complexity of real-world tabular data scenarios.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mechanism of context enrichment through header-value concatenation is well-supported by the experimental results, showing clear improvements in both table and text query accuracy.
- **Medium confidence**: The contribution of Llama-2 fine-tuning to summarization performance is supported but could benefit from more detailed ablation studies to isolate its specific impact.
- **Low confidence**: The effectiveness of ChatGPT 3.5 API augmentation is asserted but lacks detailed analysis of how the one-shot prompt specifically improves performance or what alternative approaches might yield similar results.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on context enrichment**: Conduct experiments removing the header-value concatenation step to quantify its isolated contribution to accuracy improvements across different table complexity levels.

2. **Fine-tuning parameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary key hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, training epochs) during Llama-2 fine-tuning to identify optimal settings and robustness boundaries.

3. **API augmentation alternative comparison**: Replace ChatGPT 3.5 API augmentation with simpler rule-based or template-based approaches to determine if the observed improvements are due to the API's capabilities or the augmentation process itself.
