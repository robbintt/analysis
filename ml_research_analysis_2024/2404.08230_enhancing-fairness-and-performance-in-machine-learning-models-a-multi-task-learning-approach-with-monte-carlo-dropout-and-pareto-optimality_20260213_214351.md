# Enhancing Fairness and Performance in Machine Learning Models: A Multi-Task Learning Approach with Monte-Carlo Dropout and Pareto Optimality

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08230
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08230
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-task learning with Monte Carlo Dropout and Pareto optimality improves fairness metrics with minimal performance loss across multiple domains

## Executive Summary
This study presents a bias mitigation framework that combines multi-task learning (MTL), Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, and Pareto optimality to enhance fairness in machine learning models. The approach predicts both target and protected labels while quantifying uncertainty, enabling identification of biased regions in the feature space. By using non-dominated sorting to identify Pareto optimal solutions, the method balances fairness and performance without requiring arbitrary trade-off weights. Experiments on ADULT, MIMIC-III, and SNAPSHOT datasets demonstrate significant improvements in demographic parity (DIR scores) while maintaining competitive performance levels.

## Method Summary
The methodology integrates multi-task learning with MC Dropout to simultaneously predict target and protected labels while estimating prediction uncertainty. MC Dropout is applied during inference to approximate Bayesian posterior uncertainty through multiple stochastic forward passes. The MTL framework uses shared encoder layers with task-specific heads for each prediction objective. Model weights are saved at each epoch, and single-task models are trained from these weights. Non-dominated sorting identifies Pareto optimal models that balance fairness and performance metrics, allowing domain-specific selection from the Pareto front. The approach also provides enhanced model explainability through uncertainty-aware saliency maps.

## Key Results
- Significant improvements in fairness metrics (DIR scores) across ADULT, MIMIC-III, and SNAPSHOT datasets
- Minimal impact on primary task performance when implementing fairness improvements
- Enhanced model explainability through uncertainty-aware saliency maps
- Successful balancing of competing objectives using Pareto optimality instead of weighted trade-offs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
MC Dropout provides Bayesian uncertainty approximation by simulating posterior weight distribution during inference through multiple stochastic forward passes with different dropout masks.

### Mechanism 2
Multi-task learning reduces overfitting and improves fairness by sharing representations across correlated tasks, preventing over-reliance on spurious correlations tied to privileged groups.

### Mechanism 3
Pareto-optimal model selection balances fairness and performance by explicitly trading off competing objectives rather than using weighted sum optimization.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Bayesian uncertainty estimation via Monte Carlo sampling
  - Why needed here: MC Dropout approximates posterior over model weights and quantifies epistemic uncertainty for identifying biased regions
  - Quick check question: How does MC Dropout approximate a Bayesian posterior without explicitly computing it?

- **Concept**: Multi-task learning and shared representations
  - Why needed here: MTL jointly learns target and protected labels, enabling uncertainty estimation for both and forcing generalization across subgroups
  - Quick check question: What happens to feature sharing if the tasks are unrelated?

- **Concept**: Pareto optimality in multi-objective optimization
  - Why needed here: Fairness-performance tradeoff is framed as multi-objective problem, with Pareto-optimal models representing best achievable tradeoffs
  - Quick check question: Why is Pareto optimality preferred over weighted-sum scalarization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input → Shared Encoder (MTL backbone) → Task-specific heads (target & protected label predictors) → MC Dropout wrapper → Non-dominated sorting module → Pareto front selection

- **Critical path**: MTL training → MC Dropout uncertainty sampling → Single-task model training → Fairness & performance evaluation → Pareto front selection → Final model choice

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - MC Dropout increases inference time but improves uncertainty calibration; dropout rate and forward passes require tuning
  - MTL task weight balancing is critical—overweighting protected label task can hurt primary task performance
  - Pareto selection allows flexibility but requires domain judgment for final model choice

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High uncertainty variance but no bias mitigation → Dropout mask configuration ineffective
  - Pareto-optimal models cluster near one axis → Objective conflict not properly captured
  - Single-task models underperform → Weight saving/reloading pipeline broken

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train MTL model on ADULT dataset with target=income, protected=sex; apply MC Dropout; verify uncertainty scores differ between privileged/unprivileged groups
  2. Generate Pareto front from single-task models; confirm no model dominates others in both accuracy and DIR
  3. Apply reweighing baseline on same dataset; compare fairness gains and performance loss to proposed method

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How do different Pareto optimal solutions impact fairness and performance in different application domains?
- **Open Question 2**: Can the proposed method be extended to handle multi-class classification tasks?
- **Open Question 3**: How does the choice of protected labels affect the performance and fairness of the model?

## Limitations
- Limited corpus evidence supporting MC Dropout's effectiveness for fairness in bias mitigation contexts
- No direct evidence demonstrating MTL's fairness improvements through shared representations for protected attributes
- Pareto optimality claims lack corpus support, relying only on internal citations

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The basic MTL + MC Dropout architecture can be implemented as described
- **Medium Confidence**: Uncertainty estimation works in practice for the studied datasets
- **Low Confidence**: Theoretical mechanisms connecting uncertainty to fairness improvements are well-established

## Next Checks
1. Test whether uncertainty estimates from MC Dropout actually differ systematically between privileged and unprivileged groups in controlled synthetic data
2. Evaluate whether training MTL models without MC Dropout achieves similar fairness improvements
3. Verify that Pareto-optimal models selected actually represent meaningful tradeoffs by testing if forcing weighted-sum optimization yields different selections
