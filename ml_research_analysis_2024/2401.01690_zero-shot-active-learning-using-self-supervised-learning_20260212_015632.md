# Zero-shot Active Learning Using Self Supervised Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.01690
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01690
- Authors: Abhishek Sinha; Shreya Singh
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: Proposed method performs comparably or slightly worse than Core-Set baseline but offers non-iterative, model-agnostic advantages

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses active learning in deep learning by proposing a novel approach that uses self-supervised learning features to select the most informative data points for annotation. The method leverages pre-trained self-supervised models like MoCo-v2 and SimCLR to extract features from CIFAR-10 without requiring labels, then applies k-centre greedy selection to identify diverse subsets for annotation. The approach is model-agnostic and non-iterative, making it scalable and efficient. Experiments show the method performs comparably to state-of-the-art baselines while offering computational advantages through pre-computed features.

## Method Summary
The proposed method extracts self-supervised features from CIFAR-10 using MoCo-v2 or SimCLR, then applies a k-centre greedy algorithm to select diverse data points for annotation based on feature-space distances. Unlike iterative approaches, features are pre-computed once and remain fixed throughout the active learning process, enabling non-iterative selection. The selected subset is then used to train a WideResNet classifier, with performance evaluated on test accuracy. The method assumes that self-supervised features capture sufficient semantic structure to enable effective diversity-based selection without requiring model retraining.

## Key Results
- Proposed method performs comparably or slightly worse than Core-Set baseline on CIFAR-10
- Selected data points exhibit similar class frequency patterns as Core-Set baseline
- Method offers non-iterative, model-agnostic advantages over iterative approaches
- Approach is scalable and efficient due to pre-computed feature extraction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Self-supervised features provide useful representations for active learning without requiring model retraining. Pre-trained models like MoCo-v2 and SimCLR generate embeddings that capture semantic structure, enabling k-centre greedy selection based on feature-space diversity. Core assumption: self-supervised features encode enough class-discriminative information to approximate supervised embeddings. Break condition: if features fail to separate classes sufficiently, selection degrades below random sampling.

### Mechanism 2
k-centre greedy selection based on self-supervised features yields a diverse and informative subset for annotation. The algorithm iteratively picks points maximally distant from existing cluster centers, ensuring coverage of the feature manifold. Core assumption: distance in feature space correlates with semantic diversity useful for downstream classification. Break condition: if feature space distances don't reflect true data diversity, selected subset will be redundant.

### Mechanism 3
Fixed pre-computed features enable non-iterative, model-agnostic active learning. Self-supervised embeddings are computed once and don't depend on downstream models, allowing reuse across different architectures without recomputing. Core assumption: feature extractor is fixed and embeddings remain stable for the given dataset. Break condition: if feature quality degrades with different model choices or embeddings shift significantly, non-iterative advantage vanishes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning (contrastive methods like MoCo-v2, SimCLR)
  - Why needed here: Provides label-free feature representations that capture semantic structure for active learning
  - Quick check question: How do MoCo-v2 and SimCLR differ in their contrastive objective and memory queue usage?

- Concept: Active learning (uncertainty vs diversity strategies)
  - Why needed here: Guides selection of informative samples under fixed annotation budget
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between uncertainty sampling and diversity-based sampling in active learning?

- Concept: k-centre greedy algorithm
  - Why needed here: Ensures maximal coverage of feature space by iteratively selecting farthest points from existing centers
  - Quick check question: How does the k-centre greedy algorithm guarantee a bounded approximation ratio for the optimal k-center solution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Self-supervised encoder -> Feature extractor -> k-centre greedy selector -> Annotation budget controller -> WideResNet trainer -> Evaluation pipeline
- Critical path: Feature extraction → k-centre selection → annotation → training → evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed vs. iterative feature extraction: Fixed saves computation but may sacrifice adaptive relevance
  - Self-supervised vs. supervised features: Self-supervised is model-agnostic but may be less discriminative
  - Batch vs. one-by-one selection: Batch is faster but may miss optimal ordering
- Failure signatures:
  - If accuracy plateaus early, feature quality may be insufficient
  - If class imbalance appears in selected subsets, distance metric may be biased
  - If runtime is high, feature extraction may be inefficient or k-centre implementation suboptimal
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare random sampling vs. k-centre selection on CIFAR-10 with MoCo-v2 features at 5k budget
  2. Swap MoCo-v2 for SimCLR features and measure impact on selection quality and final accuracy
  3. Replace k-centre with random k-medoid initialization to test sensitivity to initialization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of zero-shot active learning using self-supervised features compare to iterative active learning methods on larger, more complex datasets like ImageNet? The current study only uses CIFAR-10, which is relatively small and simple compared to ImageNet. The performance on larger, more complex datasets is unknown.

### Open Question 2
Can the performance of zero-shot active learning using self-supervised features be improved by using more advanced self-supervised learning techniques or architectures? The current study uses MoCo-v2 and SimCLR, but there may be more advanced techniques that could yield better features for active learning.

### Open Question 3
How does the class distribution in the selected data points affect the performance of the model, and can this be optimized? The paper observes class frequency patterns but doesn't investigate the impact of class distribution on model performance or explore ways to optimize selection for balanced class distribution.

## Limitations
- Performance comparison limited to Core-Set baseline without comprehensive evaluation against modern active learning methods
- No ablation studies examining the impact of different self-supervised models or distance metrics on selection quality
- Theoretical non-iterative advantage not validated with runtime comparisons or scalability experiments beyond CIFAR-10

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The mechanism of using pre-computed self-supervised features for non-iterative selection is technically sound and well-explained
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that this approach performs "comparably or slightly worse" than Core-Set is supported by experimental results, though evaluation lacks comprehensive baselines
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that the method is "scalable and efficient" is not substantiated with runtime comparisons or scalability experiments

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark against modern active learning methods: Implement and compare against state-of-the-art approaches like BADGE, VAAL, or recent self-supervised active learning methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 to establish relative performance.

2. Ablation study on feature quality: Systematically compare performance when using supervised features, MoCo-v2 features, SimCLR features, and random features to quantify the contribution of self-supervised learning to selection quality.

3. Runtime and scalability analysis: Measure wall-clock time for feature extraction, selection, and full training pipeline across different dataset sizes (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN) and annotation budgets to validate claimed efficiency advantages.
