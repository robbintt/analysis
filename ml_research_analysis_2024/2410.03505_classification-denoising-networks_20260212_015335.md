# Classification-Denoising Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.03505
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03505
- Authors: Louis Thiry; Florentin Guth
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: Introduces a joint modeling framework for image classification and denoising using a single network that parameterizes the joint log-probability of noisy images and class labels.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel framework for joint image classification and denoising using a single neural network that models the joint log-probability of noisy images and class labels. The approach leverages the Tweedie-Miyasawa formula to compute denoising functions through marginalization and backpropagation, enabling both tasks to be performed with a unified architecture. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate competitive performance compared to specialized baselines while offering improved adversarial robustness and computational efficiency over previous joint approaches.

## Method Summary
The classification-denoising network framework jointly models image classification and denoising tasks by parameterizing the joint log-probability of noisy images and class labels. The method uses the Tweedie-Miyasawa formula to compute denoising functions through marginalization and backpropagation, training with a combined cross-entropy and denoising score matching loss. This unified approach allows the network to perform both classification and denoising tasks simultaneously, with the denoising component conditioned on the classification output.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates competitive performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet compared to specialized baselines
- Shows improved adversarial robustness through the unified framework
- Achieves computational efficiency gains over previous joint approaches while maintaining performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the Tweedie-Miyasawa formula to establish a theoretical connection between classification and denoising tasks. By parameterizing the joint log-probability of noisy images and class labels, the network can compute denoising functions through marginalization, effectively using classification information to guide the denoising process. The combined training objective ensures that both tasks reinforce each other, with the denoising component providing regularization that improves classification robustness.

## Foundational Learning

**Tweedie-Miyasawa Formula**
- Why needed: Provides the mathematical foundation for computing denoising functions through marginalization of the joint distribution
- Quick check: Verify the formula's validity for different noise distributions and image types

**Score Matching Loss**
- Why needed: Enables training of the denoising component without requiring explicit denoising targets
- Quick check: Compare performance with and without score matching components in the loss function

**Joint Log-Probability Parameterization**
- Why needed: Allows unified modeling of both classification and denoising tasks in a single network
- Quick check: Analyze the impact of joint vs. separate probability modeling on task performance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Classification head -> Joint probability network -> Denoising head -> Output (class + denoised image)

**Critical Path**
Input noisy image → Classification head → Joint probability network → Denoising head → Final outputs

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Single network vs. specialized networks: Reduced computational overhead but potentially lower specialization
- Joint training vs. sequential training: Better task coordination but more complex optimization
- Score matching vs. explicit denoising targets: No need for clean image pairs but potentially slower convergence

**Failure Signatures**
- Degraded performance on either task when noise levels exceed training distribution
- Mode collapse in the joint probability space leading to poor generalization
- Instability in the marginalization process when classification confidence is low

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Evaluate classification accuracy on clean images to establish baseline performance
2. Test denoising performance on synthetic noise with known characteristics
3. Measure adversarial robustness against gradient-based attacks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Assumes availability of high-quality clean images for training, which may not be practical in all scenarios
- Computational complexity remains higher than specialized single-purpose networks despite improvements
- Tweedie-Miyasawa formula assumptions may not hold for all noise types or image domains

## Confidence

**Major Claim Clusters Confidence:**
- Theoretical framework and mathematical derivations: **High** - The use of Tweedie-Miyasawa formula and score matching loss is well-established in the literature
- Empirical performance improvements: **Medium** - Results show competitive performance but direct comparisons with specialized state-of-the-art methods are limited
- Adversarial robustness claims: **Medium** - The theoretical interpretation is sound, but empirical validation across diverse attack scenarios needs expansion

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework's performance on datasets with varying noise levels and types (Gaussian, Poisson, real-world noise) to evaluate generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (classification loss, denoising loss, joint training) to overall performance
3. Evaluate computational efficiency on resource-constrained devices to validate practical deployment potential beyond standard GPU benchmarks
