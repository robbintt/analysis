# LLMs Meet Multimodal Generation and Editing: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.19334
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19334
- Reference count: 40
- This survey comprehensively reviews recent advancements in multimodal generation and editing techniques that leverage large language models (LLMs)

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines the intersection of large language models and multimodal generation across four key domains: image, video, 3D, and audio. The authors categorize approaches into LLM-based and CLIP/T5-based methods, providing a comprehensive overview of how LLMs are transforming multimodal content creation. The work covers technical components, datasets, and emerging applications while addressing critical safety concerns in generative AI systems.

The survey highlights the versatility of LLMs in multimodal generation, exploring their roles as planners, evaluators, layout generators, and unified backbones for multimodal systems. It also examines tool-augmented multimodal agents that enable interactive human-computer interaction across modalities, demonstrating the practical applications of these technologies.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a comprehensive literature review methodology, examining recent advancements in multimodal generation and editing techniques. It systematically categorizes methods based on their underlying architecture (LLM-based versus CLIP/T5-based) and analyzes their applications across four key modalities. The authors evaluate the various roles LLMs play in multimodal systems, from planning and evaluation to serving as unified backbones for cross-modal generation tasks.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive categorization of multimodal generation approaches into LLM-based and CLIP/T5-based methods
- Identification of multiple roles for LLMs in multimodal generation including planners, evaluators, and layout generators
- Discussion of tool-augmented multimodal agents enabling interactive human-computer interaction
- Coverage of safety concerns in generative AI systems across all examined modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of LLMs in multimodal generation stems from their ability to understand and generate natural language instructions while integrating with various visual, auditory, and spatial representations. By serving as planners, evaluators, and unified backbones, LLMs can coordinate complex multimodal tasks that would be difficult to achieve with specialized models alone. The survey demonstrates how LLMs bridge the gap between human intent and multimodal content creation through their strong language understanding and generation capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Multimodal Generation Fundamentals**
   - Why needed: Understanding how different modalities (image, video, 3D, audio) can be generated from textual descriptions
   - Quick check: Can the model generate coherent content across multiple modalities from the same prompt?

2. **LLM-Visual Model Integration**
   - Why needed: Connecting language understanding with visual representation for coherent multimodal outputs
   - Quick check: Does the integration preserve semantic consistency between text and visual elements?

3. **Evaluation Metrics for Multimodal Systems**
   - Why needed: Assessing quality and coherence across different modalities and generation tasks
   - Quick check: Are the evaluation metrics appropriate for the specific multimodal generation task?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text Input -> LLM Processor -> Modality-Specific Generator -> Output Filter -> Final Output

**Critical Path**: User prompt → LLM planning/evaluation → Modality generator → Quality assessment → Final output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The survey highlights the tradeoff between unified multimodal systems (LLMs as backbones) versus specialized approaches for each modality, with unified systems offering better coordination but potentially lower quality than specialized models.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include inconsistent semantic alignment between modalities, poor quality in less-supported modalities, and safety issues when generating inappropriate content.

**First Experiments**:
1. Text-to-image generation using LLM planner with diffusion model
2. Multimodal content evaluation using LLM as judge
3. Tool-augmented agent testing for interactive multimodal generation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- The rapid pace of development in this field means some techniques may already be outdated, particularly in the 3D and video domains
- The categorization into LLM-based versus CLIP/T5-based methods may oversimplify the increasingly hybrid nature of modern multimodal systems
- The discussion of safety concerns, while important, is relatively brief compared to technical aspects

## Confidence

**Technical categorization of methods**: High
- The survey provides clear, well-organized categorization of multimodal generation approaches

**Overview of LLM roles in multimodal generation**: Medium
- While comprehensive, the survey may not capture the full diversity of emerging applications

**Analysis of safety concerns**: Low
- Safety discussion is relatively brief and may underestimate the complexity of these issues

## Next Checks

1. Verify the currency of all cited works, particularly in fast-moving domains like 3D generation and video editing
2. Cross-check the categorization of methods with independent benchmarks or systematic reviews
3. Evaluate the completeness of safety discussion by comparing against recent specialized surveys on AI safety in generative models
