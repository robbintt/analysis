# iSign: A Benchmark for Indian Sign Language Processing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.05404
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05404
- Reference count: 40
- Large-scale dataset created with 118K ISL-English video-sentence pairs

## Executive Summary
iSign is a comprehensive benchmark for Indian Sign Language (ISL) processing designed to address the scarcity of resources for this under-resourced language. The benchmark introduces a large-scale dataset of 118K ISL-English video-sentence pairs covering diverse topics. Five key tasks are proposed: ISL-to-English Translation, English-to-ISL Pose Generation, Word/Gloss Recognition, Word Presence Prediction, and Semantic Similarity Prediction. Baseline models are developed and evaluated for each task, revealing significant performance gaps that highlight the need for sign-language-specific neural architectures. The benchmark also provides valuable linguistic insights into ISL structure, emphasizing differences from spoken languages, the importance of non-manual markers, and spatial usage patterns.

## Method Summary
The iSign benchmark was developed through systematic collection and curation of ISL video data paired with English translations. The dataset encompasses diverse topics to ensure comprehensive language coverage. Five distinct tasks were formulated to evaluate different aspects of ISL processing, ranging from translation to semantic analysis. Baseline models were implemented for each task using standard approaches adapted from related domains. The evaluation methodology established standardized metrics for comparing model performance across all tasks. The linguistic analysis component drew from existing literature to characterize ISL's unique structural properties and usage patterns.

## Key Results
- iSign dataset contains 118K ISL-English video-sentence pairs
- Baseline models show poor performance across all five proposed tasks
- Results indicate strong need for sign-language-specific neural architectures
- Linguistic analysis reveals structural differences between ISL and spoken languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
iSign addresses the fundamental challenge of under-resourced sign languages by creating standardized evaluation frameworks. The benchmark works by providing a consistent dataset and task definitions that enable researchers to compare different approaches systematically. The five-task structure captures different dimensions of sign language understanding, from basic recognition to complex semantic relationships. By establishing baseline performance, iSign creates clear targets for improvement and highlights specific areas where current methods fall short. The combination of practical benchmarks and linguistic insights provides both immediate research directions and long-term understanding of ISL structure.

## Foundational Learning

**Sign Language Processing**: Understanding video-based language data requires specialized techniques for handling temporal-spatial information
- Why needed: Standard NLP approaches don't account for visual-manual modality
- Quick check: Can baseline models handle temporal dependencies in sign videos?

**Non-manual Markers**: Facial expressions and body postures that convey grammatical information in sign languages
- Why needed: Critical components of meaning often missed by traditional models
- Quick check: Are non-manual features explicitly modeled in baseline architectures?

**Spatial Grammar**: Use of signing space to represent relationships between entities
- Why needed: Fundamental to ISL structure but challenging for conventional NLP
- Quick check: Does the dataset capture spatial relationships adequately?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Collection -> Dataset Curation -> Task Definition -> Baseline Model Development -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Dataset creation → Task formulation → Model implementation → Performance evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Balanced coverage vs. dataset size, task complexity vs. model feasibility
- Failure signatures: Poor generalization across signers, inability to capture non-manual markers
- First experiments: 1) Evaluate translation accuracy across different ISL dialects, 2) Test pose generation consistency across vocabulary, 3) Assess semantic similarity predictions for complex phrases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Dataset size (118K pairs) remains modest compared to high-resource sign language benchmarks
- Video quality and recording conditions are not thoroughly documented
- Benchmark focuses on vocabulary-level tasks without addressing complex syntactic structures
- Limited coverage of regional ISL dialect variations

## Confidence

**High**: Dataset creation methodology, benchmark design, task formulation
**Medium**: Linguistic insights about ISL structure (primarily literature-based)
**Low**: Claims about poor performance of existing models (limited baseline testing)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-validation with diverse ISL dialects and regional variations to assess dataset representativeness
2. Test state-of-the-art sign language models (e.g., SLT-specific architectures) to establish more robust baseline performance
3. Evaluate model robustness across varying video qualities and recording conditions to ensure practical applicability
