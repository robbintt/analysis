# Anti-Byzantine Attacks Enabled Vehicle Selection for Asynchronous Federated Learning in Vehicular Edge Computing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08444
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08444
- Reference count: 40
- The paper proposes a DRL-based vehicle selection scheme to improve the accuracy and safety of global models in AFL for VEC by addressing Byzantine attacks and other factors.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving global model accuracy and safety in asynchronous federated learning (AFL) for vehicular edge computing (VEC) under Byzantine attacks and dynamic vehicle conditions. The proposed solution uses Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to select vehicles for AFL participation based on factors like mobility, channel conditions, computational resources, and data amounts. The scheme also employs threshold filtering to exclude vehicles affected by Byzantine attacks before AFL aggregation, focusing on high-performing vehicles to enhance the global model's precision and security.

## Method Summary
The method employs a DDPG-based vehicle selection scheme for AFL in VEC, considering vehicle mobility, channel conditions, computational resources, data amounts, and Byzantine attacks. Vehicles are selected based on their transmission rate, computational resources, data quantity, and position, with those having higher probabilities chosen for AFL participation. Weighted local models are calculated based on local training and transmission delays, and threshold screening is used to identify and exclude vehicles affected by Byzantine attacks before global model aggregation.

## Key Results
- The proposed DRL-based vehicle selection scheme effectively improves global model accuracy and safety compared to traditional FL and AFL methods.
- The test error rate under Byzantine attacks is lower than the scheme without considering Byzantine attacks.
- The scheme considers vehicle mobility, channel conditions, computational resources, data amount, transmission channel status, and Byzantine attacks to enhance global model performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Selecting vehicles based on DDPG reduces the impact of Byzantine attacks and poor-performing nodes on the global model.
- Mechanism: The DDPG algorithm continuously evaluates vehicles based on transmission rate, computational resources, data quantity, and position, selecting those with higher probabilities for AFL participation. This dynamic selection process filters out vehicles with poor performance or those affected by Byzantine attacks.
- Core assumption: The state representation (transmission rate, computational resources, position, previous action) captures the key factors affecting vehicle performance and Byzantine attack susceptibility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we can consider these factors comprehensively to eliminate vehicles with poor performance as much as possible and exclude vehicles that have suffered Byzantine attacks before AFL."
  - [section] "we employ DRL to solve the problem of initial vehicle selection in our AFL"
- Break condition: If the state representation fails to capture important factors affecting vehicle performance or Byzantine attack susceptibility, the DDPG algorithm may not effectively filter out poor-performing or attacked vehicles.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Considering vehicle mobility, data size, and computational capability during AFL aggregation improves global model accuracy.
- Mechanism: The scheme calculates weighted local models based on local training delay and transmission delay, giving more influence to vehicles with better performance. This weighted aggregation improves the overall quality of the global model.
- Core assumption: The weights (β1,k and β2,k) accurately reflect the contribution of each vehicle's local model to the global model's accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we can consider these factors comprehensively to eliminate vehicles with poor performance as much as possible and exclude vehicles that have suffered Byzantine attacks before AFL. At the same time, when aggregating AFL, we can focus on those vehicles with better performance to improve the accuracy and safety of the system."
  - [section] "we consider the effect of the latency in local training and transmission to calculate weighted local model"
- Break condition: If the weight calculation does not accurately reflect vehicle performance, the global model may be dominated by poor-performing vehicles, reducing accuracy.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Threshold filtering based on local model loss prevents Byzantine attacks from affecting the global model.
- Mechanism: The RSU compares each vehicle's local model loss to its own, using a threshold (βR) to identify and exclude vehicles affected by Byzantine attacks. This prevents the corrupted models from degrading the global model.
- Core assumption: Byzantine attacks significantly increase the local model loss compared to clean models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "set threshold to identify and select vehicles to prevent the attack from affecting global model’s precision."
  - [section] "we propose a threshold screening method to further select vehicles against Byzantine attack"
- Break condition: If Byzantine attacks do not significantly increase local model loss, or if clean models have high loss due to other factors, the threshold filtering may incorrectly exclude good vehicles or include attacked vehicles.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
  - Why needed here: DDPG is used to select vehicles for AFL based on continuous state and action spaces, which is necessary due to the dynamic nature of vehicle performance and Byzantine attack susceptibility.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between DDPG and DQN, and why is DDPG more suitable for this application?

- Concept: Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL)
  - Why needed here: AFL allows vehicles to upload their local models independently, reducing global aggregation latency and improving scalability in the vehicular edge computing environment.
  - Quick check question: How does AFL differ from traditional synchronous federated learning, and what are the advantages of AFL in this context?

- Concept: Byzantine Attacks
  - Why needed here: Byzantine attacks can compromise the integrity of local models, leading to reduced global model accuracy. Understanding these attacks is crucial for developing effective defense mechanisms.
  - Quick check question: What are the two types of Byzantine attacks considered in this paper, and how do they affect the local models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) Environment: Vehicles, RSU, communication channels
  - Vehicle Selection Module: DDPG algorithm, state representation, action selection
  - AFL Training Module: Local model training, weighted aggregation, global model update
  - Byzantine Attack Defense Module: Threshold filtering, trusted dataset

- Critical path:
  1. Vehicle Selection: DDPG evaluates vehicles and selects those with higher probabilities for AFL participation
  2. Local Model Training: Selected vehicles train their local models using CNN and SGD
  3. Weighted Aggregation: Vehicles upload their weighted local models, which are aggregated to update the global model
  4. Byzantine Attack Defense: Threshold filtering identifies and excludes vehicles affected by Byzantine attacks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - State representation complexity vs. DDPG performance
  - Weight calculation accuracy vs. computational overhead
  - Threshold strictness vs. false positives/negatives in Byzantine attack detection

- Failure signatures:
  - Global model accuracy degradation despite DDPG selection
  - Increased variance in global model updates due to Byzantine attacks
  - Poor performance of selected vehicles during AFL training

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test DDPG vehicle selection with varying vehicle mobility and channel conditions to assess robustness
  2. Evaluate the impact of different weight calculation methods on global model accuracy
  3. Analyze the effectiveness of threshold filtering under different Byzantine attack scenarios and dataset characteristics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
