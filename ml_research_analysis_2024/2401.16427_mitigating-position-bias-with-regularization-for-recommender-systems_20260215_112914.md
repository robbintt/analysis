core_contribution: The paper addresses the problem of position bias in recommender
  systems, where items at the top of a recommendation list are more likely to be clicked
  than those at the bottom. The proposed solution uses a regularization technique
  with a specially designed penalty term to reduce this bias.

# Mitigating Position Bias with Regularization for Recommender Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.16427
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16427
- Authors: Hao Wang
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Proposed regularization technique reduces position bias while maintaining competitive accuracy on MovieLens 1M and LDOS-CoMoDa datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses position bias in recommender systems where items at the top of recommendation lists receive disproportionately more clicks than lower-ranked items. The proposed solution adds a regularization term to the matrix factorization loss function that penalizes large predicted ratings for top-ranked items based on an assumed Zipf distribution of clicks. Experiments on MovieLens 1M and LDOS-CoMoDa datasets show the method achieves competitive accuracy while reducing position bias metrics compared to standard matrix factorization approaches.

## Method Summary
The method modifies standard matrix factorization by adding a regularization term to the loss function that penalizes position bias. The penalty term is based on the assumption that click behavior follows a Zipf distribution, where top items receive disproportionately more clicks. The regularized loss function is optimized using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with the penalty term incorporated into the gradient updates for both user and item latent factor matrices. The method introduces a single hyperparameter β that controls the trade-off between prediction accuracy and position bias reduction.

## Key Results
- The proposed algorithm achieves competitive Mean Absolute Error (MAE) scores compared to modern recommender system algorithms
- Position bias metrics show significant reduction when using the regularization approach
- The method demonstrates effectiveness on both MovieLens 1M and LDOS-CoMoDa datasets
- Results show a clear trade-off between accuracy and position bias reduction as β varies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The regularization penalty based on position reduces position bias by penalizing large user-item ratings that contribute more to top-list bias. The penalty term is proportional to 1/position, so higher-ranked items (small position numbers) contribute more to the penalty when their ratings are large. This creates an incentive to lower the predicted scores for top-ranked items relative to lower-ranked ones, reducing the bias.

### Mechanism 2
The regularization term penalizes the deviation of item click probabilities from uniform distribution. The penalty term computes the squared difference between the normalized rating matrix and a uniform matrix, where uniform click probability is 1/m for m items. This discourages the model from assigning disproportionately high predicted scores to top items.

### Mechanism 3
The SGD update rules incorporate the position bias penalty into gradient descent, allowing joint optimization of accuracy and fairness. The partial derivatives show that the penalty term contributes to the gradients for both U and V matrices, scaled by β and the position-based terms. This allows the model to trade off between minimizing prediction error and reducing position bias.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User-item rating matrix R -> Latent factor matrices U, V -> Loss function (MF + position bias penalty) -> SGD optimizer -> Predicted rating matrix

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize U and V matrices
  2. For each iteration:
     - Compute predictions UT_i · V_j
     - Calculate loss with regularization term
     - Compute gradients for U and V
     - Update U and V using SGD
  3. Output final U and V for predictions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. fairness: Higher β reduces bias but may hurt accuracy
  - Computational cost: Additional penalty term increases computation per iteration
  - Model complexity: Only adds one hyperparameter (β) to standard MF

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy drops significantly with position bias reduction
  - Model fails to converge due to improper β tuning
  - Position bias metrics show minimal improvement

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run standard matrix factorization on MovieLens 1M and compare MAE
  2. Apply position bias regularization with increasing β values and measure trade-off
  3. Compare position bias metrics (your penalty term) against other algorithms on both datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the paper.

## Limitations
- Strong assumptions about position bias following Zipf distribution and uniform click distribution are not empirically validated
- Evaluation metrics are somewhat self-referential, as the proposed Position Bias Metric is directly tied to the penalty term being optimized
- Method only addresses position bias at training time without considering different recommendation list generation strategies

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (Zipf-based penalty): Medium - The mathematical formulation is clear but the Zipf assumption needs validation
- Mechanism 2 (Uniform distribution baseline): Low - This assumption is particularly weak and lacks empirical support
- Mechanism 3 (SGD optimization): High - Standard optimization procedure, though convergence with this specific penalty is not proven

## Next Checks
1. Verify the Zipf distribution assumption by analyzing actual click distributions in the test datasets before and after position bias mitigation
2. Implement and compare against alternative position bias reduction methods (e.g., inverse propensity scoring) to establish relative effectiveness
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the sensitivity of results to the β parameter and validate the trade-off between accuracy and bias reduction
