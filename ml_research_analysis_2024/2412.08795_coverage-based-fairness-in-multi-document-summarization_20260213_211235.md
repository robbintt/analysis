## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two novel fairness measures for multi-document summarization (MDS) that address critical limitations in existing evaluation approaches. The proposed Equal Coverage measure evaluates summary-level fairness by considering document coverage across different social attribute values while accounting for redundancy in input documents. The Coverage Parity measure detects corpus-level unfairness by examining whether documents with different social attribute values have equal representation across multiple summaries. Human evaluation demonstrates these measures align better with fairness definitions than previous approaches.

The study applies these measures to 13 different LLMs across news, tweets, and reviews domains, finding that Claude3-sonnet achieves the best overall fairness performance. The analysis reveals that most LLMs tend to overrepresent certain social attribute values, suggesting users should calibrate their perception when using LLM-generated summaries. This work provides essential tools for evaluating and improving fairness in MDS systems, particularly in scenarios where summarization decisions can impact social representation and equity.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two coverage-based fairness measures for multi-document summarization. Equal Coverage evaluates summary-level fairness by calculating the proportion of documents from different social attribute value groups that appear in summaries, while accounting for redundancy in input documents. Coverage Parity measures corpus-level unfairness by examining whether documents with different social attribute values have equal chances of being over- or under-represented across a collection of summaries. The authors validate these measures through human evaluation and apply them to analyze 13 different LLMs across three domains: news, tweets, and reviews. The study examines fairness across gender and race/ethnicity attributes, revealing systematic biases in how different LLMs represent social groups in their summaries.

## Key Results
- Equal Coverage and Coverage Parity measures show better alignment with human fairness perceptions than existing approaches
- Claude3-sonnet is identified as the fairest model overall across tested domains
- Most LLMs demonstrate systematic overrepresentation of certain social attribute values
- Coverage-based metrics successfully detect both summary-level and corpus-level fairness issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

The coverage-based approach works by directly measuring the representation of documents from different social groups in generated summaries. Unlike traditional fairness metrics that focus on individual sentence or token-level biases, these measures capture whether entire documents representing different social attributes receive appropriate attention in the summarization process. The Equal Coverage metric ensures that summaries provide balanced coverage across document groups by considering the actual proportion of documents from each social attribute value that appear in the final output. The Coverage Parity metric extends this to corpus-level analysis by examining whether the same groups consistently receive more or less representation across multiple summaries, revealing systematic patterns of bias that might not be apparent in single-summary evaluations.

## Foundational Learning

**Document Redundancy Detection**: Why needed - To avoid counting the same content multiple times when calculating coverage. Quick check - Verify that documents with high textual similarity receive appropriate redundancy penalties.

**Social Attribute Classification**: Why needed - To group documents by demographic characteristics for fairness analysis. Quick check - Confirm classification accuracy on a held-out validation set with ground truth labels.

**Corpus-level Statistical Analysis**: Why needed - To identify systematic bias patterns across multiple summaries. Quick check - Test whether the distribution of covered documents follows expected uniform patterns.

**Coverage Measurement**: Why needed - To quantify how well different document groups are represented in summaries. Quick check - Validate coverage scores against human judgment of representation balance.

**Multi-document Redundancy Handling**: Why needed - To prevent redundant content from artificially inflating coverage scores. Quick check - Ensure that duplicate information from multiple documents is properly discounted.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Document Input -> Social Attribute Classification -> Redundancy Detection -> Coverage Calculation -> Fairness Scoring

**Critical Path**: Input documents are first classified by social attributes, then redundancy is detected and removed, coverage is calculated for each attribute group, and finally fairness scores are computed at both summary and corpus levels.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The coverage-based approach trades computational complexity for more accurate fairness measurement, requiring analysis of document relationships and attribute distributions rather than simple token-level bias detection. This provides more meaningful fairness insights but requires more sophisticated processing.

**Failure Signatures**: Models may appear fair at the summary level but show systematic corpus-level bias, or vice versa. High redundancy in input documents can mask underrepresentation of certain groups if not properly handled. Classification errors in social attributes can lead to incorrect fairness assessments.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test Equal Coverage metric on a synthetic dataset with known bias patterns to verify detection accuracy
2. Compare Coverage Parity scores across different corpus sizes to determine statistical significance thresholds
3. Evaluate redundancy detection performance by measuring how well it identifies and discounts duplicate content

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Limited to English-language content and three specific domains (news, tweets, reviews)
- Focus on gender and race/ethnicity attributes without exploring intersectional effects or additional demographic dimensions
- Proposed measures have not been validated against real-world outcomes or downstream applications

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Equal Coverage and Coverage Parity measures align better with human fairness perceptions | Medium |
| Claude3-sonnet is the fairest model overall | Medium |
| Most LLMs systematically overrepresent certain social attribute values | Medium |
| Coverage-based metrics can detect both summary-level and corpus-level fairness issues | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-domain validation by testing the coverage-based fairness measures on non-news domains such as academic literature, legal documents, or technical manuals to assess generalizability across content types.

2. Perform intersectional analysis by examining how combinations of social attributes (e.g., gender × race) affect coverage and representation, as current measures treat attributes independently.

3. Implement longitudinal monitoring by tracking fairness metrics across multiple model versions and training updates to determine whether observed biases persist, improve, or change in unexpected ways over time.
