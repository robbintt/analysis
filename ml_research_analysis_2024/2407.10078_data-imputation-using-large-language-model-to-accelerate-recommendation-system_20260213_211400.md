# Data Imputation using Large Language Model to Accelerate Recommendation System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.10078
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10078
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: LLM-based imputation outperforms traditional methods like mean imputation and KNN imputation in recommendation system tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of missing data in recommendation systems by proposing a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for data imputation. The method fine-tunes an LLM on complete data using LoRA adapters and uses it to predict missing values, which are then used to improve recommendation system performance. Experiments on AdClick and MovieLens datasets demonstrate significant improvements across multiple classification, multi-classification, and regression tasks compared to traditional imputation methods.

## Method Summary
The approach involves fine-tuning a distilled GPT-2 model using LoRA on complete data subsets, then using the fine-tuned LLM to impute missing values through prompt engineering. The imputed data is subsequently used to train a Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM). The method is evaluated against traditional baselines including case-wise deletion, zero imputation, mean imputation, KNN imputation, and multivariate imputation across three recommendation tasks.

## Key Results
- LLM-based imputation achieved superior precision, recall, and F1-score in single classification tasks on the AdClick dataset.
- The method demonstrated clear advantages in multi-classification tasks on the MovieLens dataset with richer metadata.
- Regression tasks for predicting user ratings showed improved MAE, MSE, and RMSE compared to traditional imputation methods.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-based imputation leverages semantic understanding of complex relationships within the data.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning the LLM on complete data enables it to learn intricate patterns and contextual relationships, allowing it to generate imputed values that are both statistically sound and semantically meaningful.
- Core assumption: The LLM can effectively capture the complex relationships and context within the data from its pre-training and fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLM, trained on vast amounts of text, is able to understand complex relationships among data and intelligently fill in missing information."
  - [section 2.2] "LLM is trained on massive amounts of text data, have shown promise due to their ability to capture complex relationships and semantic information within data."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: The corpus neighbors focus on missing data in multimodal recommendation, kernel representation for incomplete data, and flow matching for imputation, but do not directly address LLM-based imputation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LoRA fine-tuning efficiently adapts the LLM to the specific imputation task while preserving its general language knowledge.
- Mechanism: LoRA introduces low-rank adapter parameters that are trained on the task-specific dataset, allowing the LLM to learn task-specific features without updating the entire weight matrices.
- Core assumption: LoRA can effectively adapt the LLM to the imputation task without significant loss of its general language understanding capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "LoRA offers a cost-effective alternative by freezing the pre-trained model weights and introducing a set of trainable low-rank adapter parameters."
  - [section 3.2] "This approach not only speeds up the fine-tuning process but also reduces memory and storage requirements, improving LLM's accuracy on data imputation tasks."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus neighbors.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLM-based imputation improves recommendation system performance by addressing data sparsity and bias issues.
- Mechanism: By imputing missing values with semantically meaningful data, the LLM enriches the dataset, allowing the recommendation system to generate more accurate and personalized suggestions.
- Core assumption: The imputed data by the LLM is of sufficient quality to improve the performance of the recommendation system.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This enriched data is then used by the recommendation system to generate more accurate and personalized suggestions, ultimately enhancing the user experience."
  - [section 4.3] "Table 1 presents the results of multiple classification task. Due to the richer meta-data and intricate relationships within the MovieLens dataset, the LLM-based model demonstrates a clear advantage over other models."
  - [section 4.3] "Table 3 showcases the results, highlighting the superior performance of the LLM-based data imputation approach compared to other models."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: The corpus neighbors discuss the impact of missing data on recommendation systems and various imputation methods, but do not specifically address LLM-based imputation.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Preparation -> LLM Fine-tuning -> Data Imputation -> Recommendation System
- Critical path: Data Preparation → LLM Fine-tuning → Data Imputation → Recommendation System
- Design tradeoffs:
  - LLM choice: Using a distilled version of GPT-2 for accessibility and efficiency vs. a larger, more powerful LLM for potentially better imputation quality.
  - Fine-tuning approach: LoRA for efficient adaptation vs. full fine-tuning for potentially better performance.
  - Imputation strategy: Using LLM to impute one value at a time vs. imputing multiple values simultaneously.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor imputation quality: LLM fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
  - Recommendation system degradation: Imputed data introduces new biases or fails to improve the system's performance.
  - Computational inefficiency: Fine-tuning or imputation process is too slow or resource-intensive.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate LLM-based imputation on a single classification task using the AdClick dataset.
  2. Assess the performance of LLM-based imputation on a multi-classification task using the MovieLens dataset.
  3. Investigate the effectiveness of LLM-based imputation in a regression task for predicting user ratings on the MovieLens dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the LLM-based imputation handle missing data that is not randomly distributed across the dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that missing data can arise from various factors, including user privacy concerns and other reasons, but does not explicitly address non-random missing data patterns.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide details on how the LLM-based imputation method performs when missing data is not randomly distributed, which is a common scenario in real-world datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of LLM-based imputation on datasets with different missing data patterns (e.g., missing at random, missing not at random) would provide insights into its robustness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the size of the fine-tuning dataset on the performance of the LLM-based imputation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using a dataset containing only complete data for fine-tuning but does not explore how the size of this dataset affects the imputation performance.
- Why unresolved: The relationship between the size of the fine-tuning dataset and the quality of the imputed data is not investigated, which is crucial for understanding the scalability and applicability of the method.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the size of the fine-tuning dataset and evaluating the resulting imputation performance would clarify the importance of dataset size.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the LLM-based imputation compare to other advanced imputation methods, such as deep learning-based approaches?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares LLM-based imputation to traditional statistical methods but does not include comparisons with other advanced machine learning or deep learning imputation techniques.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art imputation methods, limiting the understanding of LLM-based imputation's relative performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Including comparisons with advanced imputation methods like deep learning-based approaches in the experiments would provide a clearer picture of LLM-based imputation's strengths and weaknesses.

## Limitations

- Dataset representativeness: Evaluation limited to AdClick and MovieLens datasets with ~5% missing values, unclear performance on higher missing rates or different data types.
- Imputation quality validation: Improved recommendation metrics shown but imputed values' semantic accuracy and distribution preservation not independently verified.
- Computational overhead: LoRA reduces costs but no runtime comparisons provided to validate "acceleration" claims.

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the experimental setup and methodology. The paper clearly describes the pipeline: data splitting, LoRA fine-tuning, prompt-based imputation, and DLRM evaluation. The results are reproducible with the specified datasets and metrics.

**Medium confidence** in the superiority claims. The paper demonstrates consistent improvements across tasks and metrics, but the corpus shows no direct evidence of LLM-based imputation for recommendation systems, making it difficult to assess whether the results are truly state-of-the-art.

**Low confidence** in the generalizability claims. The paper asserts that LLM-based imputation "effectively enhances recommendation system performance by addressing data sparsity and bias issues," but this is only tested on two datasets with specific characteristics.

## Next Checks

1. **Missingness pattern robustness**: Test the approach on datasets with varying missingness rates (1%, 10%, 25%, 50%) and patterns (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) to assess sensitivity to different data corruption scenarios.

2. **Imputation quality audit**: Compare imputed value distributions against ground truth (where available) using statistical tests and qualitative analysis. Generate examples showing LLM vs. traditional imputation outputs to demonstrate semantic quality differences.

3. **Resource efficiency benchmarking**: Measure training/inference time and memory usage for LLM-based imputation versus traditional methods. Include GPU/CPU requirements and wall-clock time comparisons to validate the "acceleration" claims.
