# A Survey of Few-Shot Learning on Graphs: from Meta-Learning to Pre-Training and Prompt Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.01440
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01440
- Reference count: 40
- Presents comprehensive survey of few-shot learning on graphs with two taxonomies

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively reviews few-shot learning approaches for graph data, addressing the critical challenge of data scarcity in graph-centric tasks. The authors organize the field through two taxonomies: problem taxonomy (label scarcity and structure scarcity) and technique taxonomy (meta-learning, pre-training, and hybrid approaches). The work synthesizes recent developments, categorizes existing studies, and compares their strengths and limitations while outlining prospective research directions.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic literature review of few-shot learning on graphs, organizing existing methods into coherent taxonomies. It analyzes research from meta-learning, pre-training, and hybrid approaches, examining how these techniques address different types of data scarcity in graph scenarios. The survey evaluates methodologies across various graph tasks including node classification, link prediction, and graph classification.

## Key Results
- Proposes two taxonomies: problem taxonomy (label scarcity, structure scarcity) and technique taxonomy (meta-learning, pre-training, hybrid)
- Synthesizes recent developments and categorizes existing studies in few-shot graph learning
- Compares strengths and limitations of different approaches while identifying future research directions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey effectively organizes the rapidly evolving field of few-shot learning on graphs by establishing clear taxonomies that help researchers understand the landscape. The dual taxonomy approach (problem vs. technique) provides a comprehensive framework for understanding both the challenges and solutions in this domain. By synthesizing recent developments and comparing methodologies, the survey creates a structured knowledge base that facilitates understanding of complex relationships between different approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- Graph neural networks: Essential for processing graph-structured data and learning node/graph representations
- Meta-learning: Why needed - enables quick adaptation to new tasks with limited data; Quick check - verify ability to learn from few examples
- Pre-training: Why needed - leverages large-scale data to learn general graph representations; Quick check - assess transferability to downstream tasks
- Prompt learning: Why needed - provides flexible adaptation mechanisms for few-shot scenarios; Quick check - evaluate prompt effectiveness
- Graph data scarcity: Why needed - fundamental challenge motivating few-shot approaches; Quick check - measure performance with limited labels

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Meta-learning approaches -> Metric-based methods -> Relation networks
Pre-training approaches -> Self-supervised objectives -> Transfer learning
Hybrid approaches -> Combined strategies -> Multi-task learning

Critical Path:
Problem identification (label/structure scarcity) → Taxonomy selection (meta/pre-training/hybrid) → Method implementation → Evaluation → Application

Design Tradeoffs:
- Meta-learning: High adaptation flexibility vs. computational complexity
- Pre-training: Strong generalization vs. potential task mismatch
- Hybrid approaches: Balanced performance vs. implementation complexity

Failure Signatures:
- Poor generalization when task distribution shifts
- Overfitting with limited training data
- Suboptimal transfer when pre-training and target tasks differ significantly

First Experiments:
1. Compare meta-learning and pre-training on standard few-shot node classification benchmark
2. Evaluate hybrid approach performance across different levels of data scarcity
3. Test prompt learning effectiveness in graph few-shot scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions in few-shot learning on graphs, including the need for more effective hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of meta-learning and pre-training, the development of better evaluation protocols for prompt learning on graphs, and the challenge of handling structure scarcity in addition to label scarcity.

## Limitations
- Coverage of prompt learning techniques may be incomplete due to rapid field evolution
- Classification of hybrid approaches may require refinement as new methods emerge
- Evaluation comparisons may be influenced by benchmark dataset availability

## Confidence
High confidence in taxonomy organization and literature synthesis
Medium confidence in completeness of prompt learning coverage
Medium confidence in evaluation of hybrid approach classification

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic citation analysis to verify inclusion of all seminal and high-impact papers, particularly recent prompt learning developments
2. Implement comparative study using standardized benchmark datasets to empirically validate claimed strengths and limitations
3. Perform longitudinal analysis tracking evolution of few-shot learning on graphs to identify emerging trends and taxonomy gaps
