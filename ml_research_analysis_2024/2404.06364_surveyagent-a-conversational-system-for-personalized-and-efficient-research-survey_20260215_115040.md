# SurveyAgent: A Conversational System for Personalized and Efficient Research Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.06364
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06364
- Authors: Xintao Wang; Jiangjie Chen; Nianqi Li; Lida Chen; Xinfeng Yuan; Wei Shi; Xuyang Ge; Rui Xu; Yanghua Xiao
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: SURVEYAGENT demonstrates high accuracy in understanding and executing both single and multi-step action plans while outperforming traditional methods like arXiv Sanity in paper recommendations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SURVEYAGENT, a conversational system designed to assist researchers in navigating and analyzing academic literature efficiently. The system integrates three key modules—Knowledge Management, Recommendation, and Query Answering—to provide personalized research survey assistance through a conversational interface. Built on LLM agents using the ReAct framework, SURVEYAGENT demonstrates exceptional capabilities in understanding user intent, executing complex action plans, and delivering precise paper recommendations with semantic filtering that outperforms traditional methods.

## Method Summary
SURVEYAGENT employs a LangChain-based agent using the ReAct framework to alternate between reasoning and action steps through explicit thought-action-observation cycles. The system processes NLP conference papers and arXiv cs.CL preprints since 2018, using BM25 for initial retrieval and LLM-based semantic scoring for paper recommendations. For long documents, it implements a chunk-based approach that divides papers into manageable segments, filters irrelevant sections, gathers partial answers, and merges them into complete responses. The architecture features a web interface built with SvelteKit and integrates with arXiv Sanity for term-based recommendations followed by LLM filtering.

## Key Results
- Achieves high accuracy in both single and multi-step action planning execution
- Outperforms traditional methods like arXiv Sanity in paper recommendation performance (HR@10)
- Successfully handles long academic documents through chunk-based approach with maintained context comprehension

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SURVEYAGENT achieves high accuracy in understanding and executing both single and multi-step action plans through its ReAct framework-based architecture.
- Mechanism: The system alternates between reasoning and action steps, using a structured prompt format that guides the LLM through explicit thought-action-observation cycles.
- Core assumption: The LLM can reliably generate valid actions and parameters when prompted with clear examples and tool descriptions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our evaluation demonstrates SurveyAgent's effectiveness in streamlining research activities, showcasing its capability to facilitate how researchers interact with scientific literature."
  - [section] "This system stands out by offering a unified platform that supports researchers through various stages of their literature review process, facilitated by a conversational interface that prioritizes user interaction and personalization."
- Break condition: If the LLM fails to understand the user's intent or generate appropriate actions, the system's effectiveness will be compromised.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SURVEYAGENT's paper recommendation outperforms traditional methods like arXiv Sanity through LLM-based semantic filtering.
- Mechanism: The system first uses arXiv Sanity for term-based recommendations, then applies LLMs to score and rerank papers based on semantic relevance to the user's query.
- Core assumption: LLMs can accurately assess semantic relevance beyond simple keyword matching.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "showcasing an advanced capability in providing precise paper recommendations, outstripping traditional methods like arXiv Sanity"
  - [section] "To refine these results, we incorporate LLMs for an additional layer of filtering. Following gpt-paper-assistant (tatsu lab, 2023), we prompt LLMs to score the relevance between the suggested papers and the search intent."
- Break condition: If LLM-based semantic filtering fails to improve relevance beyond term-based methods, the claimed advantage disappears.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SURVEYAGENT handles long academic documents through a chunk-based approach that maintains context comprehension.
- Mechanism: When document length exceeds LLM context limits, the system divides papers into manageable segments, filters irrelevant segments, gathers partial answers, and merges them into a complete response.
- Core assumption: Segmenting and filtering can preserve the semantic coherence needed for accurate query answering.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Therefore, we propose a chunk-based approach for query_based_on_paper_collection. When the input exceeds the context limit of LLMs, we divide the papers into multiple segments using the Langchain splitter(lan, 2024), controlling the size of each segment adhering to the context limit."
- Break condition: If segmentation breaks the logical flow of arguments or if merging partial answers creates inconsistencies, the approach fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding LLM-based agents and tool use
  - Why needed here: SURVEYAGENT is built on LLM agents that use external tools for knowledge management, recommendation, and query answering.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the ReAct framework and simple prompt chaining?

- Concept: Academic paper structure and NLP research domains
  - Why needed here: The system focuses on NLP research papers and needs to understand paper schemas (title, abstract, authors, etc.) and academic conventions.
  - Quick check question: Why does the system exclude references and subsequent sections when parsing full text?

- Concept: Information retrieval and ranking algorithms
  - Why needed here: The system uses BM25 for initial retrieval and SVM over tf-idf for arXiv Sanity recommendations.
  - Quick check question: How does BM25 differ from simple keyword matching in retrieving relevant papers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User Interface -> Core Agent -> Knowledge Management -> Recommendation Module -> Query Answering -> Paper Processing
- Critical path: User query → Action planning → Tool execution → Result aggregation → Response generation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Precision vs. recall in paper recommendations: LLM filtering improves precision but may miss relevant papers
  - Context length vs. processing time: Chunking approach balances these but adds complexity
  - Open-source vs. proprietary models: System uses both, with open-source for scalability and proprietary for complex reasoning
- Failure signatures:
  - Incorrect action selection: User query misinterpreted, wrong tool called
  - Empty results: Retrieval fails to find relevant papers or content
  - Timeout errors: Long processing times for large document collections
  - Inconsistent responses: Merging segmented answers creates contradictions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test single action planning accuracy with a small set of queries across all action types
  2. Evaluate multi-action planning on simple sequential tasks with clear dependencies
  3. Measure recommendation performance with varying numbers of seed papers (3, 5, 9) to validate HR@10 improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the action planning capability of SURVEYAGENT be further improved to reduce errors in distinguishing between retrieve_from_papers and search_papers actions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that some queries are misclassified between retrieve_from_papers and search_papers due to difficulty in distinguishing between "specific statements" and "keywords".
- Why unresolved: The distinction between "specific statements" and "keywords" is not always clear, leading to errors in action selection.
- What evidence would resolve it: A more robust natural language understanding model that can accurately classify user queries into specific statements or keywords.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the performance of SURVEYAGENT be improved when dealing with long text and large collections of papers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that some samples take too much time during testing due to the length of the text that the model needs to read, leading to failure.
- Why unresolved: Current models struggle with processing and understanding long texts and large collections efficiently.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of more efficient text processing algorithms or models that can handle long contexts without compromising performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can SURVEYAGENT better interpret user intent to avoid errors in action planning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that errors in multi-action planning are caused by the model misinterpreting the user's input.
- Why unresolved: Misinterpretation of user intent leads to incorrect action sequences, affecting the overall performance of the system.
- What evidence would resolve it: Improved dialogue understanding and context modeling to accurately capture user intent and translate it into appropriate actions.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can the recommendation module of SURVEYAGENT be enhanced to provide more accurate and relevant paper recommendations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the use of arXiv Sanity for term-based recommendation followed by semantic filtering via LLMs, but acknowledges limitations in semantic understanding.
- Why unresolved: Current recommendation methods rely on word overlap and may not capture semantic relationships effectively.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of advanced semantic models that can better understand the context and relevance of papers, leading to more accurate recommendations.

### Open Question 5
- Question: How can the query answering module of SURVEYAGENT be improved to handle more complex queries and provide more comprehensive answers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the use of a chunk-based approach for handling long contexts in academic papers, but acknowledges limitations in understanding and reasoning over scientific materials in long contexts.
- Why unresolved: Current models struggle with processing and reasoning over long academic texts, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of models with larger context windows and improved reasoning capabilities for academic content, enabling more comprehensive and accurate answers to complex queries.

## Limitations
- Limited Evaluation Scope: The evaluation focuses primarily on NLP conference papers and arXiv cs.CL preprints, which may not generalize to other scientific domains.
- Context Window Constraints: The effectiveness of the chunking approach depends heavily on the LLM's context window, with unspecified segmentation boundaries that could impact answer quality.
- No User Study Validation: The paper relies on automated metrics rather than user studies to assess real-world effectiveness and claimed personalization benefits.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The technical implementation of the ReAct framework and tool integration is well-detailed and reproducible.
- Medium Confidence: The claim of outperforming arXiv Sanity is supported by automated metrics but lacks ablation studies showing individual component contributions.
- Low Confidence: Claims about "personalization" and "user interaction" are not substantiated with user studies or detailed personalization mechanisms.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain validation**: Test the system with papers from biomedical or social science domains to assess generalization beyond NLP literature.
2. **Ablation study**: Compare recommendation performance with and without LLM filtering to quantify its contribution versus arXiv Sanity alone.
3. **User study**: Conduct a controlled experiment with 10-15 researchers performing literature reviews with and without SurveyAgent to measure real-world time savings and satisfaction.
