# Probing Language Models' Gesture Understanding for Enhanced Human-AI Interaction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.17858
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17858
- Authors: Philipp Wicke
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Proposes investigation into LLMs' ability to comprehend and interpret gestures through Turing Experiments using the VML dataset

## Executive Summary
This research proposes a pioneering investigation into the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and non-verbal communication, specifically gestures. The study aims to assess LLMs' ability to comprehend and interpret gestures by constructing a comprehensive dataset and conducting Turing Experiments. The dataset pairs textual prompts with detailed gesture descriptions, covering diverse regional variations and semantic labels. The experiments evaluate LLMs' performance in simulating human behavior and replicating psycholinguistic studies.

The research seeks to shed light on LLMs' contextual interpretation of non-verbal cues and their potential to associate gestures with various contextual factors. By exploring this novel domain, the study aims to contribute to the development of more inclusive and contextually aware conversational AI systems, with potential applications in human-robot interaction.

## Method Summary
The proposed methodology involves constructing a dataset using the VML as a base, generating Turing Experiments with culturally parameterized prompts, running inference on selected open-source LLM models, and evaluating results against ground truth labels. The approach focuses on text-only models to simplify initial investigation while acknowledging potential limitations compared to multimodal alternatives. The evaluation will compare LLM-identified gestures with dataset descriptions using accuracy measures and analyze correlations between cultural parameters and gesture conceptualisation.

## Key Results
- Proposes novel framework for evaluating LLM gesture understanding through Turing Experiments
- Introduces culturally parameterized prompts to assess contextual interpretation capabilities
- Plans comparative analysis across multiple open-source LLM models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can interpret gestures when provided with textual descriptions because their internal representations encode multimodal associations learned from large-scale training data.
- Mechanism: During pretraining, LLMs are exposed to large corpora containing metaphorical and embodied language. This exposure builds latent representations that capture associations between abstract concepts and bodily expressions, allowing the model to map gesture descriptions to semantic meanings even without explicit gesture training.
- Core assumption: The distributional hypothesis holds such that sufficient co-occurrence of gesture-related language with semantic contexts during pretraining enables meaningful gesture comprehension.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The study proposes to "examine the proficiency of LLMs in deciphering both explicit and implicit non-verbal cues within textual prompts."
  - [section] Wicke (2023) shows that "the degree of embodiment has a positive impact on LLMs ability to do the correct interpretation" of metaphors, suggesting similar mechanisms may apply to gestures.
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: only 1 related paper mentions multimodal models, suggesting limited existing work on LLM gesture understanding.
- Break condition: If the LLM was trained on minimal embodied or gesture-related language, the distributional associations would be too weak for reliable interpretation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cultural context influences gesture interpretation by LLMs because the training corpus contains culturally marked language patterns that the model can leverage.
- Mechanism: The LLM's attention mechanisms and contextual embeddings capture cultural nuances present in the training data. When prompted with culturally specific gesture descriptions, the model retrieves and applies these culturally informed associations to generate appropriate interpretations.
- Core assumption: The pretraining corpus contains sufficient culturally diverse examples of gesture descriptions and their contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The research will "consider cultural dimensions and measure the agreement between LLM-identified gestures and the dataset."
  - [section] The VML dataset includes "diverse regional variations" and "cultural parameters" that can be used to evaluate cultural sensitivity.
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: no corpus papers directly address cultural variations in LLM gesture understanding.
- Break condition: If the training data lacks cultural diversity in gesture descriptions, the model cannot distinguish between culturally appropriate and inappropriate interpretations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs can simulate human behavior in psycholinguistic experiments because they have learned statistical patterns of human language use that approximate cognitive processes.
- Mechanism: Through next-token prediction on vast text corpora, LLMs implicitly learn patterns of human reasoning, decision-making, and response patterns. When prompted to simulate human participants, they generate responses that statistically resemble human behavior in similar contexts.
- Core assumption: Statistical patterns in language use sufficiently approximate cognitive processes for the purposes of gesture interpretation tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The study will "evaluate their ability to simulate human behaviour in order to replicate psycholinguistic experiments."
  - [section] Aher et al. (2023) present the "Turing Experiment (TE)" to "assess the ability of LLMs to simulate various aspects of human behaviour."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: no corpus papers directly validate the assumption that LLM language patterns approximate human cognition.
- Break condition: If the task requires genuine understanding rather than pattern matching, the simulation will fail to capture the true cognitive processes involved in gesture interpretation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Embodied cognition
  - Why needed here: Understanding how physical experiences shape conceptual representations is crucial for interpreting how LLMs might represent gestures without physical embodiment.
  - Quick check question: How might the absence of physical embodiment in LLMs affect their ability to interpret gestures compared to humans?

- Concept: Multimodal learning
  - Why needed here: While LLMs are primarily text-based, understanding how multimodal information is processed and integrated helps in designing experiments that probe gesture understanding.
  - Quick check question: What advantages might multimodal models have over text-only models for gesture interpretation tasks?

- Concept: Cultural linguistics
  - Why needed here: Gestures have culturally specific meanings, so understanding how language encodes cultural information is essential for designing culturally sensitive experiments.
  - Quick check question: How might cultural variations in gesture meanings affect the design of a gesture understanding dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset construction module -> Turing Experiment generation module -> LLM inference engine -> Evaluation module
- Critical path: Dataset → TE generation → LLM inference → Evaluation → Analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Using open-source models ensures reproducibility but may limit model complexity compared to proprietary alternatives; focusing on text-only models simplifies the initial investigation but misses potential multimodal advantages.
- Failure signatures: Low agreement scores across all models suggest the approach may not work; high variance across cultural parameters suggests cultural sensitivity issues; consistent misinterpretation of specific gesture types suggests limitations in pretraining data.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic gesture recognition: Use simple VML items with clear gesture descriptions and measure baseline accuracy.
  2. Test cultural variation: Use VML items with different cultural parameters and measure performance variation across cultures.
  3. Test implicit vs explicit cues: Compare performance on items with explicitly stated gestures versus those requiring inference from context.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do LLMs conceptualize and interpret gestures when presented with textual prompts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] - The paper states, "How do LLMs conceptualize gestures, and can they accurately interpret gestural cues translated into text?"
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes a methodology to investigate this question but has not yet conducted the research, so the actual performance of LLMs in gesture comprehension remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results from the proposed Turing Experiments comparing LLM-identified gestures with the dataset, particularly the Verbal Message List (VML), would provide evidence on LLMs' gesture conceptualization and interpretation accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can LLMs associate gestures with different cultural contexts, and how does this ability vary across different LLM models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] - The paper mentions assessing LLMs' ability to associate gestures with various contextual factors, including cultural dimensions, and comparing the performance of different LLM models.
- Why unresolved: The paper outlines a plan to assess this but has not yet conducted the experiments, so the cultural sensitivity and variability of LLMs' gesture comprehension is yet to be determined.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from the Turing Experiments showing the overlap between LLM-identified gestures and the VML across different cultural parameters would reveal LLMs' cultural context association ability and variability among models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the reliance on open-source models, as opposed to proprietary models like GPT-3, affect the generalizability and complexity of the findings on LLMs' gesture comprehension?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] - The paper discusses the choice of open-source models for transparency and reproducibility but acknowledges that this may introduce limitations in model complexity compared to proprietary models.
- Why unresolved: The paper has not yet conducted the research, so the impact of using open-source models on the findings' generalizability and complexity is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results comparing the performance of open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-2, GPT-NeoX) with proprietary models (e.g., GPT-3) in gesture comprehension tasks would provide insights into the effects of model choice on generalizability and complexity.

## Limitations

- Primary limitation: LLMs are fundamentally text-only systems attempting to interpret non-verbal communication without visual or kinesthetic information
- Dataset constraint: VML dataset limited to 96 items, potentially insufficient for comprehensive gesture coverage
- Cultural bias concern: Unknown bias in training corpus regarding gesture representations could significantly impact results
- Methodology uncertainty: Turing Experiments framework is largely conceptual with limited implementation details

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The fundamental premise that LLMs can process textual information about gestures is well-established, as is the observation that pretraining corpora contain embodied and metaphorical language. The approach of using Turing Experiments to evaluate behavioral simulation is also grounded in established research methodologies.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that cultural context influences LLM gesture interpretation is plausible but depends heavily on the diversity and quality of cultural representation in training data, which remains unverified. The effectiveness of text-only gesture descriptions in capturing true gesture semantics is also uncertain.

**Low Confidence**: The assumption that LLMs can adequately simulate human cognitive processes for gesture interpretation tasks is highly speculative. The ability of LLMs to meaningfully interpret implicit non-verbal cues without visual information is particularly uncertain and may overestimate the models' capabilities.

## Next Checks

1. **Pilot Validation**: Conduct a small-scale pilot study using a subset of the VML dataset with a single, well-documented LLM (e.g., Llama-2-7B) to establish baseline performance metrics and identify potential implementation challenges before full-scale experiments.

2. **Cultural Sensitivity Test**: Design and execute a focused experiment comparing LLM performance on culturally diverse gesture descriptions from different regions, measuring agreement scores and identifying specific cultural parameters where models struggle most.

3. **Implicit vs Explicit Cue Analysis**: Systematically compare LLM performance on gesture descriptions that explicitly state the gesture versus those requiring inference from contextual cues, quantifying the performance gap to assess the models' ability to capture implicit non-verbal information.
