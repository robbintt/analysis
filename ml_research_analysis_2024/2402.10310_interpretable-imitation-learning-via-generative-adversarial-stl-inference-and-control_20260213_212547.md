# Interpretable Imitation Learning via Generative Adversarial STL Inference and Control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.10310
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10310
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: GAN-inspired approach combines STL inference with control synthesis for interpretable imitation learning with out-of-distribution adaptation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an interpretable imitation learning framework that combines Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference with control synthesis using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-inspired approach. The method infers STL formulas describing expert tasks and learns control policies to satisfy these specifications in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional imitation learning, this approach provides explicit task representation through STL formulas, enabling human knowledge integration and out-of-distribution adaptation by formula adjustment. Experiments demonstrate the approach on navigation tasks, MuJoCo environments, and autonomous driving scenarios, showing that learned STL formulas effectively capture task specifications and policies achieve comparable performance to baselines.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a two-phase approach: STL inference using a Template-Free Logic Inference Network (TLINet) and control synthesis using a recurrent neural network (RNN) policy. The TLINet architecture enables template-free learning of diverse STL formula structures without predefined templates. A GAN-inspired training process iteratively refines both the inference and policy networks - the policy generates trajectories (negative samples) that challenge the inference network's ability to distinguish expert from non-expert behavior. To mitigate STL formula degradation as negative samples become more expert-like, a performance score based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity to expert demonstrations selects the final policy regardless of current STL classification performance.

## Key Results
- Learned STL formulas effectively capture task specifications from expert demonstrations
- Control policies achieve comparable performance to baseline imitation learning methods
- System successfully adapts to unseen scenarios through formula modification without requiring new expert data
- Framework balances interpretability with performance, though trade-offs exist for tasks difficult to express with STL

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The GAN-inspired training approach generates informative negative samples that push the STL decision boundary toward expert demonstrations. The policy network (generator) produces trajectories that are classified by the inference network (discriminator). Initially, random trajectories provide weak negative examples. As training progresses, the policy learns to generate more expert-like trajectories, which become harder for the inference network to classify. This iterative refinement forces the STL formula to become more precise in distinguishing expert behavior.

### Mechanism 2
The TLINet architecture enables template-free learning of diverse STL formula structures. TLINet consists of multiple layers with predicate, temporal, and Boolean modules that can be flexibly combined. This allows learning various STL formula structures without being constrained to predefined templates. The network parameters can be decoded into formal STL formulas, providing interpretability.

### Mechanism 3
The performance score based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) selects the most effective policy despite potential STL formula degradation. As negative samples become more expert-like, the STL formula may degrade and misclassify trajectories. The DTW-based performance score evaluates policy similarity to expert demonstrations across multiple initial conditions, selecting the policy with highest score regardless of current STL classification performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Temporal Logic (STL) and its quantitative semantics (robustness)
  - **Why needed here**: STL provides the formal language for representing and inferring task specifications from expert demonstrations. The robustness measure quantifies how well trajectories satisfy specifications.
  - **Quick check question**: What does a positive robustness value indicate about an STL formula's satisfaction?

- **Concept**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their training dynamics
  - **Why needed here**: GAN-inspired training enables iterative refinement of both STL inference and control policy by generating informative negative samples that improve the decision boundary.
  - **Quick check question**: How does the generator-discriminator relationship in GANs translate to the policy-inference network relationship in this framework?

- **Concept**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for control policies with memory
  - **Why needed here**: The control policy must maintain state history to satisfy temporal specifications, requiring memory beyond current state information.
  - **Quick check question**: Why can't a simple feedforward network be used for policies that need to satisfy specifications like "eventually visit region A then region B"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Expert demonstrations → Dataset → TLINet → STL formula → RNN policy → Control actions
- **Critical path**: Initialize networks and dataset → Train inference network → Train policy network → Generate trajectories → Add as negative samples → Retrain inference → Update policy → Repeat until convergence → Select final policy using DTW score
- **Design tradeoffs**: Interpretability vs performance (STL formulas may be conservative), data requirements (more demonstrations needed), expressivity limits (current STL fragment may not capture all task types)
- **Failure signatures**: Policy generates random trajectories (inference network not properly trained), STL formula too conservative (insufficient negative samples), no improvement over iterations (learning rate too low)
- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Train on small dataset with known STL specification (simple navigation) to verify inference accuracy
  2. Compare policy performance with and without adversarial training on same dataset
  3. Test OOD generalization by modifying environment and fine-tuning policy with learned formula

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the performance of the interpretable imitation learning approach scale with the complexity of the STL formula required to express the task? The paper mentions the approach is less suitable for tasks difficult to describe with STL formulas but doesn't provide systematic analysis of how formula complexity affects performance.

- What is the impact of the number of expert demonstrations on the accuracy of the inferred STL formula and the performance of the learned policy? The paper states more demonstrations are required but doesn't quantify how demonstration count affects accuracy and performance.

- How does the performance of the interpretable imitation learning approach compare to other interpretable imitation learning methods? The paper doesn't compare its approach to other interpretable imitation learning methods, making it difficult to assess relative performance.

## Limitations

- Method requires sufficient expert demonstrations, which may be impractical in some real-world scenarios
- Performance trade-off between interpretability and task achievement remains unclear
- Framework's effectiveness is limited for tasks difficult to express with current STL fragment, particularly in complex environments like MuJoCo Swimmer and Walker tasks

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of combining STL inference with control synthesis using a GAN-inspired approach
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of TLINet architecture for template-free STL formula learning
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the framework to highly complex tasks beyond demonstrated examples

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the generative adversarial training component versus the STL inference component
2. Test the framework on additional complex control tasks (e.g., robotic manipulation) to assess scalability and limitations
3. Compare the approach against state-of-the-art interpretable imitation learning methods on standardized benchmarks to quantify performance trade-offs
