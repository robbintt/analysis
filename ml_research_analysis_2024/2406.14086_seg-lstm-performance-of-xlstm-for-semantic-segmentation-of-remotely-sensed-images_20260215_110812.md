# Seg-LSTM: Performance of xLSTM for Semantic Segmentation of Remotely Sensed Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.14086
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14086
- Authors: Qinfeng Zhu; Yuanzhi Cai; Lei Fan
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Seg-LSTM with UperNet decoder achieves mIoU of 75.24% on LoveDA, 62.66% on ISPRS Vaihingen, and 37.80% on ISPRS Potsdam, but generally underperforms compared to ViT-based and Mamba-based methods.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces Seg-LSTM, a framework combining Vision-LSTM with various decoder architectures for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images. The research evaluates Seg-LSTM against state-of-the-art CNN-based, ViT-based, and Mamba-based methods across three benchmark datasets. While achieving competitive results, Seg-LSTM generally underperforms compared to Transformer and Mamba architectures. The study identifies limitations in Vision-LSTM's alternating unidirectional scanning strategy for long-sequence modeling and suggests future research directions including multi-directional scanning, encoder architecture improvements, and transfer learning from ImageNet classification.

## Method Summary
Seg-LSTM employs Vision-LSTM as the backbone encoder, which processes image tokens through alternating forward and backward scans across ViL blocks. The framework integrates various decoder architectures including UperNet, DeepLabV3, DeepLabV3+, APCNet, and ANN. The model is trained with AdamW optimizer using polyLR schedule, 0.0006 learning rate, 16 batch size, and 15000 iterations, with data augmentations including photometric distortion, random resize, random crop, and random flip.

## Key Results
- Seg-LSTM with UperNet decoder achieves mIoU scores of 75.24% (LoveDA), 62.66% (ISPRS Vaihingen), and 37.80% (ISPRS Potsdam)
- Seg-LSTM generally underperforms compared to ViT-based and Mamba-based methods across all three datasets
- UperNet decoder proves most effective among tested decoders, providing stable and outstanding performance across all datasets
- Vision-LSTM's alternating unidirectional scanning strategy limits its global image modeling capabilities for segmentation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Vision-LSTM underperforms in semantic segmentation because its alternating unidirectional scanning limits global image context modeling. The Seg-LSTM framework uses Vision-LSTM as an encoder, which processes image tokens through alternating forward and backward scans across ViL blocks. This strategy reduces computational cost but prevents the model from maintaining consistent long-range dependencies across the full image sequence, which is critical for pixel-level segmentation tasks.

### Mechanism 2
UperNet decoder is the most effective choice for Vision-LSTM backbone in semantic segmentation due to its multi-scale feature fusion capabilities. UperNet uses a Feature Pyramid Network to combine features from different encoder stages with lateral connections, providing rich multi-scale context. When paired with Vision-LSTM, this decoder compensates for the backbone's limited global context by aggregating spatial information across scales.

### Mechanism 3
The staged downsampling approach used in Swin Transformer and VMamba is more effective for semantic segmentation than Vision-LSTM's approach. Both Swin and VMamba employ progressive downsampling across four stages, which allows better extraction of hierarchical features while reducing computational complexity. Vision-LSTM maintains consistent resolution or uses less effective downsampling, limiting its ability to capture abstract patterns needed for segmentation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Image serialization for vision transformers**: Vision-LSTM and related models convert 2D images into 1D sequences of patches for processing by sequential architectures like LSTM. Quick check: How does image serialization affect the spatial relationships between patches in Vision-LSTM?

- **Multi-scale feature fusion in semantic segmentation**: Semantic segmentation requires combining features at different resolutions to accurately classify pixels at various scales. Quick check: What architectural components enable multi-scale feature fusion in UperNet?

- **Long-range dependency modeling in vision tasks**: Understanding how different architectures (Vision-LSTM, ViT, Mamba) handle long-range dependencies is crucial for segmentation performance. Quick check: How does the alternating bidirectional scanning in Vision-LSTM compare to the self-attention mechanism in ViT for capturing long-range dependencies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input image → Stem (patch embedding + position embedding) → Four-stage encoder (ViL blocks with alternating forward/backward scanning) → Multi-level feature extraction → Decoder (UperNet, DeepLabV3, etc.) → Output segmentation map

- **Critical path**: Image serialization → Vision-LSTM encoder processing → Multi-scale feature fusion → Decoder processing → Pixel classification

- **Design tradeoffs**: Alternating unidirectional scanning reduces computational cost but limits global context; maintaining high resolution preserves detail but increases computation; simpler decoders are faster but may lose contextual information

- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on large objects or scenes requiring global context; inconsistent results across different dataset resolutions; failure to capture fine boundaries between classes

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replace Vision-LSTM encoder with Swin Transformer backbone while keeping UperNet decoder to isolate backbone impact
  2. Modify Vision-LSTM to use quad-directional scanning (like VMamba) instead of alternating bidirectional scanning
  3. Implement staged downsampling in Vision-LSTM encoder and compare performance against current architecture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Question**: Does the performance gap between Vision-LSTM and Transformer/Mamba architectures in semantic segmentation tasks stem from the alternating unidirectional scanning strategy or other architectural limitations?
   - Basis: The paper identifies that Vision-LSTM's alternating unidirectional scanning strategy affects its global image modeling capabilities and suggests this may be a key factor in its inferior performance.
   - Why unresolved: The study compared Seg-LSTM against state-of-the-art methods but did not conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of the scanning strategy from other architectural differences.
   - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing Vision-LSTM with multi-directional scanning while keeping other architectural elements constant, measuring performance changes in semantic segmentation tasks.

2. **Question**: Can pretraining Vision-LSTM on ImageNet classification tasks and fine-tuning for semantic segmentation improve its performance relative to other architectures?
   - Basis: The paper explicitly suggests exploring the transferability of pretrained encoders to downstream segmentation tasks as a future research direction, noting Vision-LSTM's strong ImageNet classification performance.
   - Why unresolved: The study used fully supervised training without leveraging pretraining on large-scale classification datasets, leaving the potential benefits of transfer learning unexplored.
   - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing Seg-LSTM performance when initialized from ImageNet-pretrained weights versus random initialization, measuring mIoU improvements across benchmark datasets.

3. **Question**: Would integrating downsampling stages in Vision-LSTM's encoder architecture improve its ability to extract multi-scale features while maintaining computational efficiency?
   - Basis: The paper suggests that staged downsampling in encoders enables better multi-scale feature extraction and could be worth integrating into Vision-LSTM.
   - Why unresolved: The current Seg-LSTM architecture does not employ downsampling in its four feature extraction stages, limiting its ability to capture hierarchical features at different scales.
   - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing Seg-LSTM variants with and without downsampling stages, measuring computational complexity, parameter counts, and semantic segmentation performance.

## Limitations
- Performance gaps between Seg-LSTM and competing methods may be partially attributed to implementation differences rather than inherent architectural limitations
- Lack of direct ablation studies isolating the impact of Vision-LSTM's scanning strategy from other architectural differences
- Limited decoder exploration with only five decoder options tested against the Vision-LSTM backbone

## Confidence
- **Medium**: Overall performance claims have well-specified experimental setup but lack direct comparisons with identical training configurations for baseline models
- **Low**: Mechanism explanations regarding Vision-LSTM's underperformance lack direct ablation studies or empirical evidence
- **Medium**: Decoder selection conclusion shows consistent performance but only tests five options without exploring other popular segmentation architectures

## Next Checks
1. Implement and evaluate Vision-LSTM variants with multi-directional scanning to directly test whether the alternating unidirectional approach is the primary cause of performance limitations
2. Re-implement competing methods using the exact same training setup, data augmentations, and evaluation protocols as Seg-LSTM to isolate architectural differences from implementation variations
3. Test additional decoder architectures including SegFormer-based decoders, Mask2Former, and custom decoders specifically designed for sequential vision backbones to determine if the UperNet advantage is robust or context-dependent
