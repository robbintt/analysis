# Inception: Efficiently Computable Misinformation Attacks on Markov Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.17114
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17114
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Misinformation about rewards can be efficiently computed to manipulate game outcomes by exploiting rationality assumptions

## Executive Summary
This work studies how misinformation about a player's rewards can be used to manipulate game outcomes. The key idea is that if one player knows the other's true rewards but spreads false information about their own, they can exploit the victim's rational assumptions to induce suboptimal behavior. By modeling the victim as optimizing against worst-case scenarios, the attacker can efficiently compute optimal misinformation strategies. The authors show this can be done in polynomial time using linear programming and backward induction, especially when restricting to reward functions with dominant strategies. The main result exposes a security vulnerability: standard rationality assumptions in multi-agent learning make systems susceptible to reward misinformation attacks.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a framework for computing optimal misinformation strategies by exploiting victims' rationality assumptions. They show that when victims assume common-knowledge rationality and restrict their belief sets to equilibrium solutions, attackers can efficiently compute optimal misinformation through polynomial-time algorithms. The approach uses linear programming duality to transform nested maximin problems into maximization problems, solvable via backward induction. The key insight is that by searching over dominant strategies (where only deterministic policies can be dominant), the attacker can efficiently find the optimal fake reward function that maximizes their own outcome while minimizing the victim's performance.

## Key Results
- Reward misinformation attacks can be computed efficiently in polynomial time when victims assume rationality
- The attack exploits victims' belief that attackers will play dominant strategies
- Efficiency relies on restricting to reward functions admitting dominant strategies
- The framework generalizes from normal-form games to Markov games using backward induction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The attacker can efficiently compute optimal misinformation by leveraging the victim's rationality assumptions.
- Mechanism: By exploiting the fact that a rational victim will always best-respond to a perceived attacker dominant strategy, the attacker can reduce the complex bi-level optimization into a polynomial-time computation using backward induction and linear programming.
- Core assumption: The victim assumes common-knowledge rationality and thus restricts its belief set to policies that are part of equilibrium solutions for the perceived game.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Importantly, our methods exploit the universal assumption of rationality to compute attacks efficiently."
  - [section 3.1.2] "This line of argument can be extended to Markov games by replacing (A,B) with the Q-function matrices and using backward induction."
- Break condition: If the victim does not assume rationality or uses a belief set that cannot be finitely generated, the attacker cannot efficiently compute optimal misinformation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The attacker can efficiently compute a worst-case optimal policy for a given fake reward function.
- Mechanism: By dualizing the best-response polytope, the attacker transforms nested maximin problems into maximization problems that can be solved using linear programming on each stage game via backward induction.
- Core assumption: The victim's belief set is finitely generated, meaning it is a per-stage mixture of some finite set of base policies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1.1] "The same reasoning applies if we replace each ej with yj. The inequalities z≤x⊤Ayj for all j then guarantee that x is a best response to the set ∆({y1,...,yK})."
  - [section 3.1.2] "In particular, for each h∈[H], s∈S, the worst-case stage-value functions V∗i,h(s) can be computed from the worst-case Q functions Q∗i,h(s), using Algorithm 1 with (Q∗1,h(s),Q∗2,h(s)) as the normal-form game reward matrix."
- Break condition: If the victim's belief set is not finitely generated or is continuous, the linear programming approach becomes intractable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The attacker can efficiently find the optimal fake reward function by reducing the problem to finding a fake policy.
- Mechanism: Since only deterministic policies can be dominant, the attacker can search over a finite set of policies, compute the worst-case value for each, and then use inverse reward engineering to find a reward function that makes the chosen policy dominant.
- Core assumption: The victim believes that if a policy is strictly dominant for a reward function, then the attacker will play that policy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "If Πb2(R†2) = {π†2}, then by definition Π∗1(R†2) = arg maxπ1∈Π1Vπ1,π†2 1 =:BR(π†2) is just the victim's traditional best response to π†2."
  - [section 3.2] "Lemma 4 states that if the misinformation-induced reward function R†2 is restricted to the set admitting strictly dominant strategies, one can solve the optimal inception attack problem by solving the pure strategy optimization problem."
- Break condition: If the victim does not believe in dominant strategies or considers other types of equilibria, the reduction to policy search may not apply.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Games
  - Why needed here: The paper studies misinformation attacks in the context of two-player Markov games, which are a generalization of Markov decision processes to multiple agents with competing objectives.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between a Markov decision process and a Markov game?

- Concept: Nash Equilibrium
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Nash equilibrium as a solution concept for the games under consideration, and the attacker's goal is to manipulate the victim into playing a strategy that is part of a Nash equilibrium for a fake game.
  - Quick check question: How does a Nash equilibrium differ from a security strategy in a zero-sum game?

- Concept: Linear Programming Duality
  - Why needed here: The paper uses linear programming duality to transform the nested maximin problems into maximization problems that can be solved efficiently, which is key to the polynomial-time algorithms presented.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between a linear program and its dual, and how does this relate to the minimax theorem?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Attacker -> Rational Victim Model -> Game State -> Reward Function -> Policy Search -> Worst-case Policy Computation -> Inverse Reward Engineering
- Critical path: (1) Search over dominant policies, (2) For each policy, compute worst-case optimal policy using LP and backward induction, (3) Use inverse reward engineering to construct fake reward function
- Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between the computational efficiency of the attack (which requires restricting to dominant strategies) and the potential damage of the attack (which may be limited by this restriction)
- Failure signatures: The attack will fail if the victim does not assume rationality, if the victim's belief set is not finitely generated, or if the victim does not believe in dominant strategies
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement Algorithm 1 to compute worst-case optimal policy for a given fake reward function in a normal-form game
  2. Implement Algorithm 2 to extend Algorithm 1 to Markov games using backward induction
  3. Implement Algorithm 3 to search over dominant policies and use inverse reward engineering to construct the optimal fake reward function

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the polynomial-time attack algorithms be extended to handle belief sets that are not finitely generated (Assumption 3)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper explicitly states that efficient computation relies on the victim's belief set being finitely generated (Assumption 3), and asks "To have any hope of efficient solutions, we must restrict the belief set."
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides efficient algorithms for the case where the victim's belief set is finitely generated. Extending these algorithms to handle arbitrary belief sets would require fundamentally different approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof showing whether or not efficient algorithms exist for non-finitely generated belief sets, or an explicit construction of such an algorithm.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the attack algorithms perform in practice on large-scale Markov games with continuous state spaces?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Importantly, our methods exploit the universal assumption of rationality to compute attacks efficiently" but doesn't provide empirical results on real-world game scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on theoretical guarantees and polynomial-time complexity without empirical validation on large-scale problems that are common in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the attack algorithms on benchmark large-scale Markov games, measuring runtime and success rates against various victim models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the fundamental limitations on defending against inception attacks while maintaining standard rationality assumptions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes "Our work highlights that the standard rationality notions produce vulnerabilities when misinformation is present. Thus, new approaches are needed to build multi-agent systems that are robust against misinformation."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the vulnerability but doesn't provide specific defense mechanisms that can maintain standard rationality assumptions while preventing these attacks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof establishing lower bounds on the defender's performance under standard rationality assumptions, or a concrete defense mechanism that provably prevents inception attacks without abandoning rationality.

## Limitations

- The attack requires restricting to reward functions with dominant strategies, which may severely limit the attacker's flexibility in many practical scenarios
- The assumption that victims maintain finitely generated belief sets is strong and may not hold for sophisticated agents
- The paper does not address how victims might detect or defend against such attacks

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The polynomial-time computability results under restricted reward function classes (dominant strategies only)
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of attacks in simple normal-form games with rational victims
- **Low confidence**: Real-world applicability when victim agents employ more complex belief models or when reward functions lack dominant strategies

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical validation**: Implement the attack algorithms in simple Markov game environments (e.g., gridworlds) and measure attack success rates against rational vs. bounded-rational victim agents
2. **Robustness testing**: Evaluate how the attack performance degrades when victim belief sets are continuous or when the victim employs belief updating rather than static beliefs
3. **Extension to general reward functions**: Develop and test approximate methods for computing attacks when dominant strategies are not available, potentially using reinforcement learning to approximate the worst-case policies
