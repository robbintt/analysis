# Adversarial Training: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.15042
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15042
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Comprehensive survey categorizing adversarial training techniques into data enhancement, network design, and training configurations, highlighting effectiveness in improving robustness while addressing challenges like catastrophic overfitting and fairness trade-offs.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of adversarial training (AT) techniques, categorizing them into data enhancement, network design, and training configurations. AT aims to improve model robustness against adversarial attacks by integrating perturbed inputs into the training process. The survey reviews various AT methods, including data augmentation techniques, network architectures, and training configurations such as loss functions and optimization algorithms. Key findings include the effectiveness of AT in improving robustness, the challenges of catastrophic overfitting and fairness, and the trade-offs between robustness and accuracy. The paper also highlights the importance of data diversity, network components, and training configurations in AT performance.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing literature on adversarial training through systematic categorization of methods into three perspectives: data enhancement (source, generic, and adversarial data augmentation), network design (architecture choices and components like activation functions and normalization layers), and training configurations (loss functions, labels, and weight-related strategies). The survey analyzes these techniques through the lens of the min-max optimization framework, examining how different components contribute to adversarial robustness. The methodology involves comprehensive literature review and organization rather than novel empirical experiments.

## Key Results
- AT significantly improves model robustness against adversarial attacks while maintaining reasonable accuracy on clean samples
- Different data enhancement techniques (source DE, generic DE, adversarial DE) provide varying levels of performance improvement through increased data diversity
- Training configurations including loss functions, label modifications, and weight strategies critically impact AT effectiveness and stability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adversarial training improves model robustness by integrating imperceptibly perturbed inputs into the training process.
- Mechanism: The min-max optimization framework minimizes worst-case loss within a specified perturbation set for each training example, effectively training the model to correctly classify both clean and adversarial examples.
- Core assumption: The perturbation set B(x, ϵ) defined by the p-norm constraint contains examples that are imperceptible to humans but significantly degrade model performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Adversarial training (AT) refers to integrating adversarial examples -- inputs altered with imperceptible perturbations that can significantly impact model predictions -- into the training process."
  - [section] "Specifically, AT is typically framed as a min-max optimization problem. The outer minimization adjusts model weights to correctly classify both clean and adversarial examples, while the inner maximization generates adversarial examples by perturbing clean inputs under the fixed model weights."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different data enhancement techniques improve adversarial training performance by increasing data diversity.
- Mechanism: Source data enhancement expands the dataset before training through extra data collection or generation. Generic data enhancement augments data during training through simple replacement operations, data reconstruction, or feature-level enhancement. Adversarial data enhancement generates adversarial training data using various attack strategies.
- Core assumption: The diversity of training data directly correlates with the model's ability to generalize to unseen adversarial examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The survey reviews various AT methods, including data augmentation techniques, network architectures, and training configurations."
  - [section] "Data Perspective: This aspect focuses on increasing data diversity through various data augmentation (DE) techniques, including source DE, generic DE, and adversarial DE."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training configurations such as loss functions, labels, and optimization algorithms significantly impact adversarial training performance.
- Mechanism: The loss function should be adjusted according to the AT task, with common choices including cross-entropy loss, norm-based feature regularization, gradient regularization, and perceptual loss. Labels in loss functions for supervising adversarial examples are often modified using techniques like label smoothing, label interpolation, and label distillation. Weight-related strategies include adversarial weight perturbation, random weight perturbation, weight standardization, and weight selection.
- Core assumption: The choice of loss function, label modification, and weight-related strategies directly influences the model's ability to learn robust features and generalize to unseen adversarial examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The survey reviews various AT methods, including data augmentation techniques, network architectures, and training configurations."
  - [section] "Training Configurations Perspective: In addition to data enhancement and network design, specifying training configurations such as loss functions, labels, and weight settings is essential for AT, e.g., improving AT stability."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Min-max optimization framework
  - Why needed here: This framework is the core of adversarial training, where the outer minimization adjusts model weights to correctly classify both clean and adversarial examples, while the inner maximization generates adversarial examples by perturbing clean inputs under fixed model weights.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the outer minimization and inner maximization in the min-max optimization framework for adversarial training?

- Concept: Perturbation set and p-norm constraint
  - Why needed here: The perturbation set B(x, ϵ) defines the allowed perturbations for generating adversarial examples, with the p-norm constraint quantifying the perturbation size and ensuring that the perturbed inputs remain imperceptible to humans.
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of p-norm (e.g., ℓ∞, ℓ2, ℓ1) affect the generated adversarial examples and the model's robustness against different types of attacks?

- Concept: Data enhancement techniques
  - Why needed here: Different data enhancement techniques, including source DE, generic DE, and adversarial DE, improve adversarial training performance by increasing data diversity and helping the model generalize to unseen adversarial examples.
  - Quick check question: What are the main differences between source DE, generic DE, and adversarial DE, and how do they contribute to improving adversarial training performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data enhancement module: Implements various data augmentation techniques, including source DE, generic DE, and adversarial DE.
  - Network architecture module: Supports different deep learning architectures, such as CNNs, GNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and diffusion models.
  - Training configuration module: Specifies loss functions, labels, and weight-related strategies for adversarial training.
  - Optimization module: Implements various optimization algorithms and learning rate schedules for updating model weights.

- Critical path:
  1. Prepare training data with data enhancement techniques.
  2. Initialize model architecture and training configurations.
  3. Iterate through training epochs:
     a. Generate adversarial examples using the inner maximization.
     b. Update model weights using the outer minimization and optimization algorithms.
  4. Evaluate model performance on clean and adversarial examples.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Data enhancement vs. computational efficiency: More diverse data enhancement techniques may improve robustness but also increase computational overhead.
  - Network architecture vs. adversarial robustness: Different architectures may have varying levels of robustness against adversarial attacks, requiring careful selection based on the specific task and dataset.
  - Training configurations vs. generalization: The choice of loss functions, labels, and weight-related strategies can significantly impact the model's ability to generalize to unseen adversarial examples.

- Failure signatures:
  - Catastrophic overfitting: The model performs well on training data but experiences a sharp decline in accuracy on unknown adversarial examples.
  - Performance trade-off: Enhancing adversarial robustness often compromises the prediction performance for clean samples.
  - Fairness issues: Robustness improvements may vary across different model layers, classes, or samples, leading to fairness concerns.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic adversarial training with PGD attack and evaluate its effectiveness against standard adversarial attacks.
  2. Compare the performance of different data enhancement techniques (e.g., source DE, generic DE, adversarial DE) on adversarial training.
  3. Investigate the impact of different training configurations (e.g., loss functions, labels, weight-related strategies) on adversarial training performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can catastrophic overfitting be leveraged for data copyright protection by designing datasets that induce overfitting when used for non-specified tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests catastrophic overfitting could be used for data copyright protection, ensuring protected datasets are used solely for designated tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions this as a potential direction but does not explore the technical feasibility or provide concrete methods for implementing such protection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a dataset that induces catastrophic overfitting when used outside its intended task, along with evaluation of its effectiveness as a copyright protection mechanism.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the minimum perturbation budget required in adversarial training to guarantee robustness against adversarial attacks bounded by the same budget?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper cites Tao et al. [131] who found that AT with a defense budget of ε is insufficient to guarantee robustness against ε-bounded delusive attacks, suggesting the need for larger perturbation budgets.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a challenge but does not provide specific guidelines or thresholds for determining the minimum required perturbation budget.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the relationship between perturbation budget size and robustness across various attack types, leading to concrete recommendations for minimum budget requirements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can adversarial training be effectively applied to improve the robustness of 3D instance segmentation, 3D super-resolution, and 3D object tracking tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper lists 3D instance segmentation, 3D super-resolution, and 3D object tracking as unexplored areas where the feasibility of integrating AT has not been investigated.
- Why unresolved: These specific 3D computer vision tasks have not been studied in the context of adversarial training, leaving their potential benefits and challenges unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation of AT techniques on these 3D tasks, with quantitative comparisons to non-robust methods demonstrating improved adversarial robustness.

## Limitations
- The survey relies heavily on categorizing existing methods rather than providing novel empirical validation, limiting verification of claimed effectiveness
- Mechanisms described are theoretically sound but lack specific quantitative comparisons between techniques
- The paper acknowledges important challenges like catastrophic overfitting and fairness issues but does not provide detailed solutions or performance trade-offs

## Confidence
- Major claim cluster: Medium
  - The survey accurately synthesizes existing literature but cannot independently verify the relative effectiveness of different adversarial training methods without empirical testing

## Next Checks
1. Implementing and comparing multiple data enhancement techniques on the same dataset to measure their relative impact on robustness
2. Testing different training configurations (loss functions, labels, weight strategies) systematically to identify optimal combinations for specific tasks
3. Conducting ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component (data, network design, training configurations) to overall adversarial robustness
