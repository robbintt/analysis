# Knowledge Distillation Neural Network for Predicting Car-following Behaviour of Human-driven and Autonomous Vehicles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.05618
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05618
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: KDNN achieves RMSE 0.611 in car-following prediction while reducing computational demands and improving safety metrics compared to standalone MLP and Gipps models

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a Knowledge Distillation Neural Network (KDNN) for predicting car-following behavior in mixed traffic environments containing both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The approach distills knowledge from a complex LSTM teacher network into a lightweight MLP student network, achieving comparable predictive accuracy with significantly reduced computational requirements. The model demonstrates superior performance over standalone MLP and traditional Gipps models, with particular emphasis on safety improvements as measured by higher minimum Time-to-Collision values.

## Method Summary
The KDNN architecture employs knowledge distillation where a teacher LSTM network is trained on real-world trajectory data from the Highway 101 dataset. This teacher network, capturing complex temporal dependencies in car-following behavior, transfers its knowledge to a simpler MLP student network. The student network learns not only from ground truth data but also from the teacher's output distributions, enabling it to capture nuanced behavioral patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. The model operates with a fixed prediction horizon and processes relative positions and velocities of leading and following vehicles as input features.

## Key Results
- KDNN achieves RMSE of 0.611 in velocity prediction, significantly outperforming standalone MLP (0.899) and Gipps model baselines
- The distilled model maintains prediction accuracy comparable to the complex LSTM teacher while reducing computational demands
- KDNN demonstrates improved safety metrics with higher minimum Time-to-Collision values compared to baseline models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The KDNN leverages knowledge distillation to transfer complex temporal patterns learned by the LSTM teacher into a computationally efficient student architecture. By training the student network on both ground truth data and the teacher's softened probability distributions, the model captures subtle behavioral nuances that would be difficult for a standalone MLP to learn directly. This approach allows the student network to benefit from the teacher's deep understanding of car-following dynamics while maintaining the lightweight architecture necessary for real-time deployment.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge Distillation: Technique for transferring knowledge from complex models to simpler ones - needed for reducing computational complexity while maintaining accuracy
- LSTM Networks: Recurrent neural networks for capturing temporal dependencies - needed for modeling the sequential nature of car-following behavior
- Time-to-Collision (TTC): Safety metric measuring time until collision if current speeds maintained - needed for evaluating safety implications of predictions
- Car-following Models: Mathematical frameworks describing how vehicles follow one another - needed for understanding baseline approaches and evaluation context
- Multilayer Perceptrons: Feedforward neural networks for function approximation - needed as the lightweight student architecture

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Real-world Trajectory Data -> LSTM Teacher -> Softened Teacher Outputs -> MLP Student -> KDNN Predictions

Critical path: Input features (relative positions/velocities) -> MLP student network -> Velocity predictions with safety constraints

Design tradeoffs: Model complexity vs computational efficiency, prediction accuracy vs safety metrics, training time vs inference speed

Failure signatures: Large prediction errors in high-density traffic, inability to capture complex interaction patterns, safety metric degradation in mixed autonomy scenarios

Three first experiments:
1. Validate KDNN performance on held-out test set with varying traffic densities
2. Compare prediction accuracy across different time horizons (1-5 seconds)
3. Benchmark computational efficiency on embedded hardware representative of autonomous vehicle systems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance validation limited to single highway dataset without testing diverse traffic scenarios
- Fixed prediction horizon prevents assessment of model performance for longer-term predictions
- Gipps model comparison uses standard parameters without dataset-specific optimization

## Confidence
- KDNN predictive accuracy (RMSE 0.611): High confidence
- Improved safety through higher minimum TTC: Medium confidence
- Ideal deployment for autonomous vehicles and resource-constrained environments: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test KDNN performance across multiple highway datasets with varying traffic densities and vehicle mix ratios
2. Implement real-time computational efficiency benchmarking on embedded hardware representative of autonomous vehicle systems
3. Validate model generalization by testing on urban driving scenarios with complex interactions beyond simple car-following
