# Co-Occurring of Object Detection and Identification towards unlabeled object discovery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.17223
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17223
- Authors: Binay Kumar Singh; Niels Da Vitoria Lobo
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: ResNet50 backbone achieves 71.5% AP and 68.3% mAP on multi-label object detection, outperforming MobileNetV3 (65.2% AP, 60.1% mAP)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a two-stage deep learning pipeline for identifying co-occurring objects in multi-label object detection. The method first uses Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 or MobileNetV3 backbones to detect all objects in images, then applies frequency threshold filtering (t=0.5) and association rule mining to discover base classes and their co-occurring objects. The approach is evaluated on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets, demonstrating that ResNet50 provides superior detection performance for the subsequent co-occurrence analysis task.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage pipeline where Faster R-CNN detects objects and labels them, followed by co-occurrence matrix analysis. In the first stage, region-based feature extraction outputs bounding boxes with class probabilities. The second stage aggregates detected labels, builds a frequency table, applies a 50% support threshold to filter infrequent objects, and uses frequent pattern mining (FP-tree) to generate base class ↔ co-occurring class pairs with occurrence counts. The system was tested on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets using both ResNet50 and MobileNetV3 backbones.

## Key Results
- ResNet50 backbone achieves 71.5% average precision (AP) and 68.3% mean average precision (mAP)
- MobileNetV3 backbone achieves 65.2% AP and 60.1% mAP
- The method successfully identifies co-occurring object pairs through frequency-based filtering and association rule mining
- Results demonstrate that detector accuracy directly impacts the quality of co-occurrence pattern discovery

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 backbone detects all object bounding boxes and labels in the first stage, providing accurate multi-label inputs for co-occurrence analysis.
- Mechanism: Region-based feature extraction and classification layers output precise bounding boxes with class probabilities, enabling reliable frequency counting across the dataset.
- Core assumption: The object detector's AP/mAP scores (71.5% AP, 68.3% mAP for ResNet50) are sufficient for robust co-occurrence mining.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In the first stage consists of multilabel multiclass object labelling and classification... we used two state-of-the-art object detectors based on Faster RCNN... In faster RCNN based architecture we used two different backbone networks - ResNet50 and mobilenetv3."
  - [section] "When ResNet50 backbone is used we see that AP and mAP is here than mobilenetv3."
  - [corpus] Weak; no direct mention of detector accuracy or co-occurrence pipeline.
- Break condition: Detector AP drops below ~60%, causing unreliable base class frequency counts and false co-occurrence patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Frequency threshold (t = 0.5) filters out infrequent objects, ensuring only meaningful co-occurrences are retained for pattern mining.
- Mechanism: After collecting all object labels, a binary frequency filter removes objects appearing in fewer than half of the relevant base-class contexts, reducing noise in association rules.
- Core assumption: A 50% support threshold balances recall and precision for co-occurrence discovery without missing rare but meaningful pairs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "the co-occurrence object label prediction [4] takes both base class and frequently occurring at once and set up frequency table, here threshold t = 0.5 is set that filters out infrequently occurring objects."
  - [corpus] Missing; no corpus evidence of threshold choice or its effects.
- Break condition: Too low a threshold introduces spurious associations; too high loses valid rare co-occurrences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Association rule mining on the filtered frequency table generates base class ↔ co-occurring class pairs that reflect real-world contextual relationships.
- Mechanism: Frequent pattern tree (FP-tree) or similar structure builds rules from the thresholded co-occurrence counts, outputting pairs with support counts.
- Core assumption: The dataset's label distribution and contextual correlations are stable enough for mining valid rules without external knowledge.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In the next step we build frequency pattern tree that will build association rules and finally generate frequent patterns."
  - [section] "These frequent patterns contains base class and their corresponding co -occurring class and the number of occurrences of these co-occurring classes in respect to base class."
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence; mentions only generic frequency pattern analysis.
- Break condition: Imbalanced datasets or small sample sizes cause overfitting to noise in the mined rules.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Object detection fundamentals (bounding boxes, class probabilities, AP/mAP metrics)
  - Why needed here: The method depends on accurate detection to build correct co-occurrence statistics.
  - Quick check question: If a detector has 70% AP on a class, what is the probability it will miss that class in a new image?
- Concept: Association rule mining and frequent pattern mining (support, confidence, FP-tree)
  - Why needed here: These algorithms convert raw co-occurrence counts into interpretable base/co-occurring class pairs.
  - Quick check question: With support threshold t = 0.5, how many co-occurrences are kept if a base class appears in 100 images and a partner in 60?
- Concept: Multi-label classification vs multi-class classification
  - Why needed here: The task requires identifying multiple objects per image, not just one dominant class.
  - Quick check question: In a multi-label image with labels {cat, dog, chair}, how many ground-truth labels does it have?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Input preprocessing → Image normalization, resizing (300x300)
  2. Object detector (Faster R-CNN) → Backbone (ResNet50/MobileNetV3), RPN, ROI heads
  3. Label aggregation → Collect all detected boxes and class IDs per image
  4. Frequency table builder → Count occurrences per class across dataset
  5. Threshold filter (t=0.5) → Remove infrequent co-occurrences
  6. FP-tree / association rule miner → Generate base↔co-occurring pairs with support counts
  7. Output table → Base class, co-occurring class, occurrence count

- Critical path: Detector → Label aggregation → Frequency counting → Thresholding → Rule mining → Output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Detector choice: ResNet50 gives higher AP/mAP but slower inference vs MobileNetV3 faster but less accurate.
  - Threshold choice: Higher t reduces noise but may lose rare but valid co-occurrences; lower t increases recall but introduces false positives.
  - Backbone fine-tuning: Retraining improves domain fit but increases compute cost.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low detector AP → Many missing objects → Sparse frequency table → Few/zero co-occurrence rules.
  - Imbalanced dataset → Dominating classes skew frequency counts → Rules biased toward frequent classes.
  - Wrong threshold → Either too many spurious pairs or almost no output.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run Faster R-CNN (ResNet50) on Pascal VOC validation set; record per-class AP and total detected labels.
  2. Build frequency table from validation labels; plot base class distribution and filter with t=0.5; verify count reduction.
  3. Run FP-tree mining on filtered table; output top 10 base↔co-occurring pairs; check if they make intuitive sense (e.g., "person ↔ car").

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed co-occurrence detection method change when applied to datasets with higher levels of occlusion or partially visible objects?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions extending the work to cases where co-occurring objects are unknown or occluded.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates performance on standard Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets without varying occlusion levels.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the model's performance on datasets with controlled occlusion levels or synthetically occluded images.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different minimum support threshold values on the identification of base classes and co-occurring classes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions setting a threshold value for base object class and co-occurring object classes but doesn't explore sensitivity to threshold variations.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a fixed threshold value without analyzing how different thresholds affect the results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the minimum support threshold and analyzing the resulting changes in base and co-occurring class identification.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method compare to other existing techniques for co-occurrence analysis in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents a novel method but doesn't benchmark it against other co-occurrence analysis techniques.
- Why unresolved: No comparative analysis with existing methods for co-occurrence object prediction is provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark experiments comparing the proposed method against state-of-the-art co-occurrence analysis techniques on the same datasets.

## Limitations

- The method's reliability depends entirely on the object detector's accuracy, which is not thoroughly validated for the co-occurrence task.
- The 50% frequency threshold is chosen without empirical justification or sensitivity analysis.
- No qualitative examples of discovered co-occurrence patterns are provided to demonstrate practical utility.
- The work is evaluated only on labeled datasets (Pascal VOC, MS-COCO), leaving the extension to truly unlabeled scenarios unproven.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The two-stage pipeline architecture (detection → co-occurrence analysis) is clearly described and technically sound.
- **Medium confidence**: Detection results (AP/mAP) are reported, but their sufficiency for downstream co-occurrence mining is not validated.
- **Low confidence**: The choice of frequency threshold (t=0.5) and its impact on pattern quality is not substantiated with experiments or corpus evidence.

## Next Checks

1. **Detector performance validation**: Run the trained Faster R-CNN (ResNet50) on a held-out validation set; compute per-class AP and mAP; verify that no class falls below ~60% AP (the break condition identified).
2. **Threshold sensitivity analysis**: Apply the co-occurrence pipeline with thresholds t = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7; compare the number and quality of mined rules; identify the optimal threshold for balancing precision and recall.
3. **Qualitative pattern inspection**: Manually inspect the top 20 base↔co-occurring pairs generated from the validation set; assess whether they reflect real-world contextual relationships (e.g., "person ↔ bicycle" or "car ↔ traffic light").
