# Understanding Deep Learning defenses Against Adversarial Examples Through Visualizations for Dynamic Risk Assessment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.07496
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07496
- Reference count: 34
- This paper explores how three defenses against adversarial examples modify the behavior of a deep neural network model.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a visualization-based approach to understand how different adversarial defenses modify the internal behavior of deep neural networks. By mapping neuron activations to colored graphs, the authors analyze how three defenses—adversarial training, dimensionality reduction via autoencoders, and prediction similarity detection—alter the decision-making process of a VGG16+DNN model on breast histopathology images. The visualizations reveal distinct patterns of change in neuron participation and connectivity across different defense mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The authors use a visualization technique that maps neuron activations to colored graphs, where vertex colors indicate neuron participation levels and edge widths show connection strengths. They analyze a VGG16+DNN model trained on breast histopathology images, examining the original model and three defense implementations: adversarial training of the dense network, dimensionality reduction using autoencoders (initial and middle positions), and prediction similarity detection. The approach focuses on understanding behavioral changes rather than just performance metrics.

## Key Results
- Adversarial training significantly modifies the input layer with downstream changes in hidden layer connectivity
- Dimensionality reduction defenses alter neuron participation in both input and hidden layers
- Prediction similarity defense detects adversarial attack processes without changing model behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adversarial training modifies the input layer significantly, causing downstream changes in hidden layer connectivity.
- Mechanism: By retraining the dense part with adversarial examples, the learned weights in the input layer adapt to suppress adversarial noise, which propagates as altered activation patterns to hidden neurons and ultimately changes the number and strength of connections to the output layer.
- Core assumption: The VGG16 backbone remains unchanged; only the dense part learns new patterns from adversarial data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "adversarial training significantly modifies the input layer"
  - [section] "this defense modifies the input layer significantly, while the effect in hidden layer is less remarkable"
  - [corpus] No direct neighbor paper evidence; this is a novel internal claim.
- Break condition: If adversarial examples are too diverse or novel, the trained input layer may not generalize, and new adversarial patterns can bypass the learned defenses.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dimensionality reduction defenses (autoencoders) alter the effective input representation to the dense part, reducing adversarial perturbation impact.
- Mechanism: Autoencoders act as a preprocessing filter; the initial autoencoder cleans raw input images before CNN feature extraction, while the middle autoencoder cleans CNN outputs before dense processing. This changes the activation space the dense part sees, making it harder for adversarial perturbations to propagate.
- Core assumption: Autoencoders learn a robust reconstruction of clean data that suppresses noise patterns; the dense part weights remain unchanged.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "dimensionality reduction defenses alter neuron participation in both input and hidden layers"
  - [section] "dimensionality reduction defense uses autoencoders to avoid the noise of the data as much as possible"
  - [corpus] No direct neighbor paper evidence; claim relies on internal experimental results.
- Break condition: If autoencoder reconstruction is imperfect, residual noise can still be amplified through the dense network, allowing adversarial success.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prediction similarity defense does not alter model weights but instead monitors input-output patterns to detect adversarial search processes.
- Mechanism: By storing historical inputs, predictions, and derived similarity metrics, the detector can identify suspicious sequences of near-identical inputs with changing predictions—a hallmark of adversarial example generation—without modifying the model's internal behavior.
- Core assumption: Adversarial attacks require multiple similar queries to the model; benign inputs do not exhibit such repetitive similarity patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "prediction similarity does not change the model's behavior but detects the adversarial attack process"
  - [section] "the prediction similarity defense generates a detector... it does not modify the behavior of the original model"
  - [corpus] No direct neighbor paper evidence; claim is based on the authors' own detector design.
- Break condition: If an attacker uses diverse queries or simulates benign input patterns, the similarity detector may fail to distinguish adversarial search from normal usage.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial example generation via gradient-based attacks
  - Why needed here: Understanding how FGSM, BIM, and PGD work is essential to interpret how defenses modify neuron behavior and detect attack processes.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between FGSM and BIM in terms of perturbation application?

- Concept: Autoencoder architecture and reconstruction loss
  - Why needed here: Dimensionality reduction defenses rely on autoencoders to filter noise; knowing how they learn clean representations is critical for interpreting their effect on dense layer inputs.
  - Quick check question: How does an undercomplete autoencoder enforce dimensionality reduction?

- Concept: Graph-based visualization of neural activations
  - Why needed here: The paper's core contribution is mapping neuron activations to colored graphs; understanding this mapping is necessary to read and interpret the behavioral changes shown.
  - Quick check question: In the visualization, what does a blue vertex indicate compared to a red vertex?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input preprocessing (optional initial autoencoder) -> VGG16 CNN backbone (fixed weights) -> Dense neural network (target of visualization and defense retraining) -> Output classification layer
  - During prediction similarity: Input image -> model -> output; detector monitors and acts independently

- Critical path:
  1. Input image → (initial autoencoder) → VGG16 → (middle autoencoder) → DNN → output
  2. During prediction similarity: input image → model → output; detector monitors and acts independently

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Adversarial training: increases robustness to known attacks but reduces accuracy and does not protect against new attacks.
  - Dimensionality reduction: maintains accuracy better (initial autoencoder) but adds computational overhead and may not fully suppress novel attacks.
  - Prediction similarity: no accuracy loss but cannot detect already-known adversarial examples.

- Failure signatures:
  - Adversarial training: high success rate on new adversarial examples despite good performance on known ones.
  - Dimensionality reduction: increased neuron participation in input layer without corresponding robustness gains.
  - Prediction similarity: inability to detect adversarial examples that are already computed before detector training.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate FGSM adversarial examples on the original model and visualize DNN behavior to establish baseline.
  2. Apply adversarial training and repeat FGSM attack; compare DNN activation graphs and connection counts to output layer.
  3. Insert initial autoencoder, generate new adversarial examples, and visualize changes in input vs. hidden layer neuron participation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The visualization technique's quantitative reliability for measuring "significant" changes in neuron participation is not validated against ground truth robustness metrics
- The breast histopathology domain may not generalize to other data types or network architectures
- No ablation studies isolate the contribution of each visualization element to the conclusions

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (Adversarial training layer modification): Medium confidence - supported by direct observations but lacks quantitative comparison with standard robustness metrics
- Mechanism 2 (Autoencoder dimensionality reduction): Medium confidence - visualizations show changes but don't prove causal relationship to adversarial resistance
- Mechanism 3 (Prediction similarity detection): Low confidence - the detector's effectiveness is asserted but not empirically validated against attack scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Compare visualization-based neuron participation metrics with standard adversarial robustness measures (PGD success rate, certified radius)
2. Test whether the observed visualization patterns generalize across different CNN architectures (ResNet, DenseNet) and data domains
3. Conduct controlled experiments varying autoencoder reconstruction quality to establish quantitative thresholds for adversarial defense effectiveness
