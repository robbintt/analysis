# Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning Through Adversarial Attacks and Training : A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.00420
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00420
- Reference count: 17
- One-line primary result: Comprehensive survey of adversarial attacks and training methods for robust Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically categorizes adversarial attacks and training methods for robust Deep Reinforcement Learning, covering observation alterations, dynamics alterations, gradient attacks, derivative-free attacks, and adversarial policies. The paper provides a structured framework for understanding how different attack types affect DRL agents and how various training strategies can improve robustness. It reviews both fixed and continuous adversarial training approaches while discussing the balance between stability, convergence, and robustness. The survey concludes with tools for adversarial reinforcement learning and identifies future research directions in this critical area of DRL security.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a comprehensive survey of adversarial techniques for improving DRL robustness through a min-max optimization framework where adversaries generate perturbations while agents learn to maintain performance. The study categorizes attacks based on their objectives (targeted vs untargeted), operational mechanisms (gradient-based vs derivative-free), and perturbation types (observation vs dynamics alterations). Various adversarial training strategies are reviewed, including fixed training with pre-computed perturbations and continuous training where adversaries evolve alongside agents. The framework emphasizes balancing training stability with convergence to robust policies.

## Key Results
- Systematic categorization of adversarial attacks based on objectives, mechanisms, and perturbation types
- Analysis of gradient-based attacks, derivative-free attacks, and adversarial policies
- Review of adversarial training strategies including fixed and continuous training approaches
- Discussion of tools and future research directions for robust DRL systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey demonstrates that adversarial attacks exploit vulnerabilities in DRL agents by introducing perturbations that maximize performance degradation, while adversarial training improves robustness by exposing agents to these perturbations during learning. The min-max optimization framework allows agents to learn policies that maintain performance across a distribution of adversarial examples. By systematically categorizing attack methods and training strategies, the survey provides a roadmap for developing more robust DRL systems that can withstand various types of perturbations.

## Foundational Learning
- Min-max optimization framework: Essential for understanding how agents and adversaries interact during training; quick check involves verifying that the agent's objective function includes an adversarial term
- Gradient-based attacks: Critical for generating effective perturbations using backpropagation; quick check requires confirming that the attack can compute gradients through the agent's policy network
- Derivative-free attacks: Important for scenarios where gradients are unavailable or unreliable; quick check involves testing the attack's effectiveness without gradient information
- Adversarial policies: Necessary for understanding how opponents can exploit agent weaknesses; quick check requires observing performance degradation against learned adversarial policies
- Observation vs dynamics perturbations: Fundamental distinction affecting attack implementation; quick check involves verifying which type of perturbation the attack generates
- Fixed vs continuous training: Key design choice affecting training stability; quick check requires monitoring training curves for convergence behavior

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Environment -> Agent Policy -> Adversarial Attack -> Perturbation -> Modified Environment -> Agent Reward
Critical path: Agent training loop where adversarial perturbations are applied to observations or dynamics before policy execution
Design tradeoffs: Fixed training offers stability but may overfit to specific attacks, while continuous training provides better generalization but risks training instability
Failure signatures: Training divergence, agent performance degradation, or overfitting to specific adversarial patterns
First experiments:
1. Implement baseline DRL agent (e.g., PPO) on HalfCheetah-v2 environment and train until convergence
2. Apply FGSM attack on observations and measure performance degradation compared to baseline
3. Implement adversarial training with FGSM and compare robustness against original attack

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed implementation specifications for hyperparameters and training procedures
- Missing concrete experimental setups for exact reproduction of results
- Absence of validation metrics for transferring survey concepts to practical implementations
- Limited discussion of specific performance benchmarks across different attack types

## Confidence
The survey provides a comprehensive overview of adversarial attacks and defenses in DRL. Confidence in the general principles is High, but confidence in reproducing specific adversarial training results is Medium due to missing technical details. The theoretical framework is well-established, but practical implementation requires additional experimental validation.

## Next Checks
1. Implement a basic adversarial training pipeline with a single attack method and evaluate its effectiveness against the same attack
2. Test robustness generalization by evaluating trained agents against multiple attack types
3. Compare performance stability between fixed and continuous adversarial training approaches using standardized environments
