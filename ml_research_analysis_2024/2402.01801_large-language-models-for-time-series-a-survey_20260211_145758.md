# Large Language Models for Time Series: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.01801
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01801
- Reference count: 20
- This paper provides a comprehensive survey of large language models (LLMs) for time series analysis, addressing the challenge of applying LLMs, which are originally trained on text, to numerical time series data.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of large language models (LLMs) for time series analysis, addressing the challenge of applying LLMs, which are originally trained on text, to numerical time series data. The survey categorizes methodologies into five groups: direct prompting of LLMs, time series quantization, aligning techniques, vision modality as a bridge, and tool integration. The paper details various representative works in each category, including their mathematical formulations, advantages, and limitations. It also compiles an extensive list of multimodal datasets that combine time series and text data across various domains such as healthcare, IoT, finance, and audio. The survey concludes by discussing future research directions, including theoretical understanding, multimodal and multitask analysis, efficient algorithms, combining domain knowledge, and customization and privacy considerations. The paper provides valuable insights and guidance for researchers and practitioners interested in applying LLMs to time series analysis.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically categorizes existing approaches for applying LLMs to time series data into five distinct methodology groups: direct prompting, quantization, alignment, vision modality bridging, and tool integration. For each category, the paper examines representative works, providing mathematical formulations, advantages, and limitations. The survey also compiles an extensive list of multimodal datasets that combine time series and text data across various domains including healthcare, IoT, finance, and audio. Future research directions are discussed, covering theoretical understanding, multimodal and multitask analysis, efficient algorithms, combining domain knowledge, and customization and privacy considerations.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive categorization of LLM approaches for time series into five methodology groups
- Detailed analysis of representative works including mathematical formulations and limitations
- Compilation of extensive multimodal datasets spanning healthcare, IoT, finance, and audio domains
- Identification of future research directions including theoretical understanding and privacy considerations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper provides a systematic framework for understanding how LLMs can be adapted to handle time series data despite being originally trained on text. By categorizing approaches into five distinct methodology groups, it reveals the underlying mechanisms through which numerical time series can be transformed into formats that LLMs can process effectively. The survey demonstrates that successful adaptation typically involves either transforming the numerical data into a textual format, leveraging additional modalities like vision, or integrating specialized tools that can handle time series operations.

## Foundational Learning
- Time series quantization (why needed: to convert numerical time series into discrete tokens LLMs can process; quick check: verify quantization preserves temporal patterns and relationships)
- Multimodal dataset alignment (why needed: to ensure time series and text are temporally and semantically aligned; quick check: validate alignment accuracy across different domain types)
- Vision-language bridging (why needed: to leverage vision transformers as intermediaries between time series and text; quick check: assess performance when using different vision modalities as bridges)
- Domain knowledge integration (why needed: to incorporate specialized understanding for specific applications; quick check: measure improvement when domain knowledge is incorporated)
- Privacy-preserving techniques (why needed: to protect sensitive information in time series applications; quick check: verify privacy guarantees while maintaining analytical utility)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Time Series Data -> Preprocessing -> [Direct Prompting | Quantization | Alignment | Vision Bridge | Tool Integration] -> LLM Processing -> Output Generation

**Critical Path:**
Preprocessing (format conversion) -> LLM Processing (with appropriate prompting or integration) -> Output Generation (task-specific interpretation)

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Direct prompting offers simplicity but may lack precision for complex time series tasks
- Quantization preserves numerical information but requires careful design of quantization schemes
- Alignment methods enable direct correspondence but may be computationally expensive
- Vision modality bridges offer powerful representation learning but add complexity
- Tool integration provides accuracy for specific tasks but reduces end-to-end flexibility

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor performance on long-range dependencies with direct prompting
- Loss of fine-grained temporal information with aggressive quantization
- Alignment errors when multimodal data is poorly synchronized
- Suboptimal representations when vision modality doesn't capture time series characteristics
- Integration bottlenecks when tools cannot handle real-time processing requirements

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Direct prompting comparison: Evaluate basic LLM performance on time series forecasting using zero-shot prompting versus few-shot examples
2. Quantization sensitivity: Test different quantization granularities on classification accuracy across multiple time series datasets
3. Vision bridge effectiveness: Compare performance when using different vision modalities (images, spectrograms) as intermediaries for the same time series tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open research directions including: theoretical understanding of how LLMs process time series information, development of efficient algorithms for real-time applications, integration of domain-specific knowledge into LLM architectures, customization approaches for specific time series tasks, and privacy-preserving methods for sensitive time series data.

## Limitations
- The categorization framework may oversimplify the complex landscape of approaches and boundaries between categories are sometimes ambiguous
- Many techniques are relatively recent and lack extensive empirical validation across diverse real-world datasets
- The compiled dataset list may not be exhaustive and doesn't fully address dataset quality, annotation consistency, or temporal alignment challenges

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- The general categorization framework and identification of major methodological approaches

**Medium confidence:**
- The comprehensive nature of the dataset compilation and the feasibility of proposed future directions

**Low confidence:**
- The relative effectiveness of different approaches compared to traditional time series methods
- The practical implementation challenges in real-world applications

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic benchmarking studies comparing LLM-based approaches against traditional time series methods across multiple datasets and domains to establish empirical performance baselines

2. Perform error analysis on LLM-based time series predictions in high-stakes applications to quantify reliability and identify failure modes

3. Develop and validate methods for assessing the quality and temporal alignment of multimodal datasets to establish standards for dataset curation in this domain
