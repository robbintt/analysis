# PIORS: Personalized Intelligent Outpatient Reception based on Large Language Model with Multi-Agents Medical Scenario Simulation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.13902
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13902
- Reference count: 26
- Outperforms GPT-4o and other baselines in outpatient reception accuracy, efficiency, and information gathering

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PIORS, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system designed to automate outpatient reception in Chinese hospitals, addressing the heavy workload of receptionist nurses. The system integrates an LLM nurse agent with the hospital information system to provide personalized, efficient patient intake and department guidance services. To enhance LLM performance in real healthcare scenarios, the authors propose a Service Flow aware Medical Scenario Simulation (SFMSS) framework for generating realistic medical conversational data. Evaluations with users and clinical experts demonstrate that PIORS-Nurse significantly outperforms all baselines, including GPT-4o, in accuracy, efficiency, and information-gathering capabilities.

## Method Summary
The method involves fine-tuning a Qwen2-7B-Instruct model on a dataset combining general conversational data with medical conversational data generated by the SFMSS framework. SFMSS simulates realistic patient-nurse interactions using role-playing LLMs with predefined action spaces and supervisor agents to ensure conversation quality. The fine-tuned PIORS-Nurse model is integrated with a Hospital Information System (HIS) through the HospInfo-Assistant module, which retrieves patient records and creates medical documentation. The system is evaluated on 500 test cases using automated metrics and human expert assessment across three dimensions: accuracy (department guidance correctness), efficiency (conversation length), and information gathering ability.

## Key Results
- PIORS-Nurse achieves over 81% win-or-tie rate against the best baseline across all evaluation dimensions
- The system demonstrates 18% improvement in accuracy compared to the Qwen2-7B backbone model
- Clinical experts and users show strong preference for PIORS-Nurse over baseline models in overall performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Service Flow aware Medical Scenario Simulation (SFMSS) framework generates realistic medical conversational data by simulating diverse patient interactions with embedded personality traits and service flow control.
- Mechanism: SFMSS uses real-world data to initialize patient profiles with Big Five personality traits and demographic characteristics. It then employs role-playing LLMs to simulate conversations between a nurse agent and patient agent, guided by predefined action spaces and supervised by a feedback agent to ensure completeness and quality.
- Core assumption: Simulating realistic patient personalities and service flow will produce training data that better prepares the LLM for real-world outpatient reception tasks than generic conversational data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "to enhance the performance of LLMs in real-world healthcare scenarios, we propose a medical conversational data generation framework named Service Flow aware Medical Scenario Simulation (SFMSS)"
  - [section 3.1] "Scenario Preparing: SFMSS utilize LLMs to generate scenario settings and patient profiles for agent initialization based on outpatient records, personality traits, and demographic characteristics."
- Break condition: If the simulated patient behaviors do not align with real patient behaviors, or if the service flow control becomes too rigid and prevents natural conversation flow.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PIORS-Nurse outperforms baselines by integrating service flow awareness through fine-tuning on SFMSS-generated data with predefined action spaces.
- Mechanism: The nurse agent is trained on a dataset combining general conversational data with SFMSS-generated data that includes explicit service flow steps (symptom inquiry, medical history inquiry, department recommendation, etc.). This fine-tuning embeds domain-specific heuristics and workflow awareness.
- Core assumption: Fine-tuning on data that explicitly models the service flow of outpatient reception will produce better performance than prompting general LLMs to follow the same workflow.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "PIORS-Nurse outperforms all baselines, including the current state-of-the-art model GPT-4o, in accuracy, efficiency, and information-gathering capabilities"
  - [section 5.5] "PIORS-Nurse demonstrates a significant improvement in accuracy compared to baselines without fine-tuning, demonstrating an 18% increase relative to the Qwen2-7b backbone"
- Break condition: If the predefined action spaces are too restrictive and prevent the model from handling edge cases or novel patient queries.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The collaboration between PIORS-Nurse and HospInfo-Assistant enables personalized, high-quality service by integrating real-time hospital information system data.
- Mechanism: HospInfo-Assistant acts as a query generation module that extracts structured parameters from natural language instructions and calls APIs to interact with HIS, providing PIORS-Nurse with access to patient archives and administrative information.
- Core assumption: Real-time access to patient records and hospital information will enable the nurse agent to provide more personalized and accurate guidance than systems without this integration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This system integrates an LLM-based reception nurse and a collaboration between LLM and hospital information system (HIS) into real outpatient reception setting"
  - [section 2.1] "HospInfo-Assistant executes the retrieval query, obtains results from HIS, and forwards them to PIORS-Nurse"
- Break condition: If the API calls to HIS are slow or unreliable, or if the information retrieval system cannot handle the variety of queries patients might ask.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Service flow in outpatient reception
  - Why needed here: Understanding the typical sequence of steps in patient intake (greeting, symptom inquiry, department guidance, documentation) is essential for designing both the simulation framework and the evaluation metrics.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main steps in the typical outpatient reception service flow described in the paper?

- Concept: Role-playing simulation with LLMs
  - Why needed here: The SFMSS framework relies on LLMs simulating different roles (nurse, patient, supervisor) to generate training data, so understanding how to prompt LLMs for role-play is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main LLM agents used in the SFMSS framework?

- Concept: Action space definition for agent behavior
  - Why needed here: Both the nurse and patient simulators use predefined action spaces to control their behavior during simulation, which is key to ensuring the generated conversations follow realistic service flows.
  - Quick check question: How many predefined actions are there for the nurse simulator in the first visit scenario?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - PIORS-Nurse: Core interaction module (fine-tuned LLM), query generation module (GPT-4o-mini), summarization module (GPT-4o)
  - HospInfo-Assistant: GPT-4o-turbo based API caller for HIS interaction
  - SFMSS: Framework for generating training data with nurse simulator, patient simulator, and supervisor agent
  - HIS: Hospital Information System providing patient records and administrative data

- Critical path:
  1. Patient initiates conversation with PIORS-Nurse
  2. PIORS-Nurse gathers symptoms and medical history
  3. HospInfo-Assistant retrieves patient records if needed
  4. PIORS-Nurse provides department recommendation
  5. Conversation concludes and HospInfo-Assistant creates medical record

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using fine-tuned Qwen2-7B for core interaction vs. larger general models: Smaller model is more cost-effective but may have limitations on complex reasoning
  - Predefined action spaces vs. open-ended conversation: Ensures service flow compliance but may restrict natural conversation
  - Simulation-based training vs. real-world data: Allows for controlled training but may not capture all real-world edge cases

- Failure signatures:
  - High average turn number and length: Indicates inefficient conversation flow
  - Low accuracy in department guidance: Suggests the model isn't properly learning the triage logic
  - Poor Info Score: Indicates the model isn't effectively gathering necessary patient information

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test PIORS-Nurse on a small set of simulated patient conversations and measure accuracy, efficiency, and Info Score
  2. Compare PIORS-Nurse performance against directly prompted GPT-4o on the same test set
  3. Analyze failure cases where PIORS-Nurse gives incorrect department recommendations to identify patterns in the errors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in a dedicated section.

## Limitations

- Weak corpus support for the SFMSS framework and HIS integration claims, with neighbor papers focusing on general multi-agent reinforcement learning rather than healthcare-specific applications
- Relatively small sample size in evaluations (15 users and 15 clinical experts) for deployment claims
- Does not address potential edge cases in patient conversations or performance with rare medical conditions

## Confidence

- High confidence in the core mechanism of using simulation-based fine-tuning to improve outpatient reception accuracy
- Medium confidence in the scalability and real-world robustness of the system
- Low confidence in the long-term sustainability of the approach without addressing potential model drift and changing hospital workflows

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a longitudinal study over 3-6 months to assess model performance consistency and identify any degradation patterns
2. Test the system with 50+ real patients across different hospital departments to validate generalization beyond the initial 15-user evaluation
3. Perform A/B testing comparing PIORS-Nurse against traditional reception methods in a live hospital setting to measure actual impact on nurse workload and patient satisfaction
