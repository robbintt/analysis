# Online Learning of Temporal Dependencies for Sustainable Foraging Problem

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.01501
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01501
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: LSTM enables single agents to learn sustainable foraging strategies by observing temporal dependencies

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates online learning methods for the sustainable foraging problem, a testbed for exploring agent cognition in social dilemmas where agents must resist individual rewards to achieve collective long-term sustainability. The study compares episodic versus online neuro-evolution and evaluates whether Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can help agents learn sustainable strategies. The research reveals that while online neuro-evolution enables rapid learning within one episode, and LSTM aids individual agents in developing sustainable strategies, neither approach successfully addresses the multi-agent social dilemma. The findings highlight the complexity of achieving collective sustainability in dynamic environments and suggest that temporal awareness is crucial for individual sustainable behavior.

## Method Summary
The study employs a sustainable foraging environment where agents must balance immediate rewards against long-term resource availability. Two main approaches are compared: episodic neuro-evolution and online neuro-evolution, with the latter showing faster convergence to expected strategies within a single episode. Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DRQNs) and LSTM-enhanced neural networks are evaluated for their ability to capture temporal dependencies in agent-environment interactions. The experiments test both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, measuring sustainability through resource depletion rates and agent survival. The methodology includes controlled parameter sweeps and comparative analysis across different learning architectures to isolate the effects of temporal awareness on sustainable strategy development.

## Key Results
- Online neuro-evolution enables agents to learn expected strategies within one episode
- Both DRQN and standard online neuro-evolution fail to find sustainable strategies in single or multi-agent scenarios
- Adding LSTM to neural networks allows single agents to develop sustainable strategies by observing long-term consequences of actions
- Multi-agent scenarios remain unsolvable with current approaches, highlighting the fundamental challenge of social dilemmas

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LSTM networks succeed in enabling sustainable foraging because they can maintain internal states that capture temporal dependencies across multiple time steps. This allows agents to observe the long-term consequences of their actions on resource availability, which is critical for developing sustainable strategies. The mechanism works by preserving information about past harvesting decisions and their impact on future resource states, creating a feedback loop that discourages immediate over-harvesting. In contrast, standard feedforward networks and even DRQNs lack this temporal continuity, causing agents to optimize for short-term rewards without considering long-term sustainability. The failure in multi-agent scenarios suggests that temporal awareness alone cannot overcome the fundamental conflict between individual and collective interests in social dilemmas.

## Foundational Learning
- Neuro-evolution principles: Evolution strategies for neural network optimization; needed for adapting network architectures to specific task requirements; quick check: verify fitness function properly weights long-term sustainability
- LSTM architecture fundamentals: Memory cells and gating mechanisms for temporal information preservation; needed for capturing resource depletion dynamics; quick check: confirm forget gate appropriately balances old and new information
- Reinforcement learning with function approximation: Q-learning extended to neural network function approximators; needed for handling continuous state-action spaces; quick check: ensure exploration-exploitation balance allows discovery of sustainable strategies
- Social dilemma game theory: Conflict between individual rationality and collective welfare; needed for framing sustainable foraging as a cooperation problem; quick check: verify payoff structure creates genuine sustainability tension
- Online vs episodic learning distinctions: Continuous adaptation versus batch updates; needed for understanding learning speed differences; quick check: confirm online updates properly propagate through experience replay

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Environment -> Agent Controller -> LSTM Network -> Action Selection -> Environment Feedback

Critical path: State observation → LSTM memory update → Q-value estimation → Action selection → State transition → Reward calculation → Memory update

Design tradeoffs: The LSTM architecture trades computational complexity for temporal awareness. While standard feedforward networks can process immediate state information quickly, they cannot capture the temporal dependencies crucial for sustainable decision-making. The DRQN approach attempts to address this with recurrent connections but may not sufficiently model long-term resource dynamics. The online neuro-evolution approach sacrifices some convergence guarantees for faster adaptation to changing environmental conditions.

Failure signatures: Single-agent sustainable learning failure manifests as resource depletion despite LSTM capabilities, indicating insufficient temporal memory or poor reward shaping. Multi-agent sustainability failure shows persistent resource exhaustion regardless of individual agent learning, suggesting the social dilemma structure overwhelms individual optimization. Learning speed issues appear as oscillations between sustainable and unsustainable behavior, indicating temporal credit assignment problems.

First experiments: 1) Single-agent LSTM with perfect state information to establish baseline sustainable behavior; 2) Multi-agent LSTM with shared resource pool to test social dilemma dynamics; 3) Ablation study removing LSTM gates to quantify temporal dependency importance

## Limitations
- The controlled experimental setup may not capture all real-world complexities affecting agent behavior in social dilemmas

## Next Checks

1. Test LSTM-based approaches across multiple sustainable foraging environments with varying resource distributions to assess generalization capabilities.

2. Implement hybrid learning approaches combining online neuro-evolution with LSTM networks to determine if temporal awareness enhances collective sustainability.

3. Conduct ablation studies removing temporal dependencies from successful single-agent LSTM solutions to quantify their importance in sustainable strategy development.
