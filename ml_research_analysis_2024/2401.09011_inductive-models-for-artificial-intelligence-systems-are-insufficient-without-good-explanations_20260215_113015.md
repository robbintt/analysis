# Inductive Models for Artificial Intelligence Systems are Insufficient without Good Explanations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.09011
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09011
- Reference count: 17
- One-line primary result: ML models need "good explanations" rather than just accurate predictions to overcome inductive limitations

## Executive Summary
The paper argues that current machine learning models, especially deep neural networks, are fundamentally limited by their reliance on inductive reasoning from historical data. This leads to a lack of transparency and an inability to provide robust explanations for their predictions. The author contends that for AI to progress, it must move beyond inductive methods and seek models that provide deeper insights and explanations, characterized by being precisely defined and "hard to vary."

## Method Summary
This theoretical paper critically examines the philosophical and practical limitations of inductive ML models. It draws on concepts from the philosophy of science, including David Hume's problem of induction, Karl Popper's falsifiability, and David Deutsch's criterion of being "hard to vary." The paper analyzes case studies of ML failures and limitations, and evaluates current "explainable AI" approaches in light of these philosophical arguments. The primary method involves a literature review of key philosophical works and a critical analysis of ML model limitations in the context of induction.

## Key Results
- Inductive ML models fail with out-of-distribution (OOD) examples due to their reliance on past observations rather than explanatory theories.
- Good explanations in AI should be precisely defined, "hard to vary," and capable of extrapolation across distributions.
- The historical shift from seeking good explanations to accepting "good enough" predictions has led to current limitations in AI transparency and interpretability.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Inductive ML models fail when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) examples because they rely on past observations rather than explanatory theories.
- Mechanism: When trained on a limited sample, the model learns statistical correlations that may not hold for unseen data. OOD examples violate these correlations, causing performance to plummet.
- Core assumption: A representative sample is sufficient for future generalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The paper discusses the "problem of induction" where past observations may not predict future events, a challenge ML models face with unseen data.
  - [section] The text states that "all inductive models reserve the possibility of failure should they be presented with an example that, though valid, was unobserved in the training sample."
  - [corpus] The corpus neighbors discuss challenges in trusting opaque systems and the need for robust explanations, aligning with the OOD problem.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Good explanations are characterized by being "hard to vary," precisely defined, and capable of extrapolation across distributions.
- Mechanism: Explanations that are precise and non-vague are less adaptable to contradictory evidence, making them more robust. This precision allows for extrapolation beyond the training data.
- Core assumption: Precisely defined conjectures are more likely to be correct and generalize better.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The paper argues for the importance of providing good explanations, a feature current models often fail to deliver.
  - [section] The text discusses David Deutsch's criterion of being "hard to vary" and how precisely defined conjectures cannot be easily altered to accommodate new evidence.
  - [corpus] The corpus includes papers on explainable AI and the necessity of AI audit standards, supporting the need for precise explanations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The historical shift from seeking good explanations to accepting "good enough" predictions led to the current limitations in AI.
- Mechanism: Early AI research aimed to emulate human intelligence through rule-based systems and symbolic processing. When this proved difficult, the field turned to inductive methods like machine learning, which prioritize prediction over explanation.
- Core assumption: Good explanations are harder to achieve than good predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The paper posits that the predominant challenges in understanding ML models are rooted in the false promise of induction.
  - [section] The text explains how the field of AI shifted from seeking good explanations to accepting good enough approximations due to the difficulty of emulating human intelligence.
  - [corpus] The corpus neighbors discuss the necessity of AI audit standards and the challenges of trusting opaque systems, aligning with the historical shift.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: The problem of induction and its implications for ML
  - Why needed here: Understanding why inductive models fail with OOD data is crucial for grasping the paper's argument.
  - Quick check question: What is the philosophical issue with using past observations to predict future events, and how does it relate to ML models?

- Concept: Falsifiability and the criterion of being "hard to vary" in scientific theories
  - Why needed here: These concepts explain what makes a good explanation and why inductive models fall short.
  - Quick check question: Why is falsifiability important in scientific theories, and how does the "hard to vary" criterion relate to it?

- Concept: Historical development of AI from symbolic processing to inductive methods
  - Why needed here: This context helps understand why AI shifted from seeking explanations to predictions.
  - Quick check question: What led to the shift from rule-based systems to inductive methods in AI, and what were the consequences?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection -> Model training -> Explanation generation -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Collect diverse and representative data -> Train model using inductive methods -> Generate explanations using explainable AI techniques -> Evaluate both predictive performance and explanatory quality
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing model complexity with interpretability, prioritizing accuracy vs. explanation quality, choosing between post-hoc explanations and built-in explainability
- Failure signatures: High accuracy but poor performance on OOD data, inability to provide coherent explanations for predictions, explanations that are too vague or easily adaptable
- First 3 experiments: 1. Test model performance on OOD data to identify inductive limitations. 2. Implement explainable AI techniques and evaluate the quality of generated explanations. 3. Compare models with built-in explainability vs. post-hoc explanations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop machine learning models that provide "good explanations" as defined by Deutsch's criteria of being "hard to vary" and falsifiable?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper argues that current ML models lack explanatory depth and do not provide the "hard to vary" explanations that characterize good scientific theories. It suggests that for AI to progress, we must seek models that offer insights and explanations, not just predictions.
- Why unresolved: Current ML models, especially deep neural networks, are optimized for predictive accuracy but not for explanatory power. They can generate plausible predictions without providing underlying reasons or theories for their outputs. The paper highlights the need for models that can extrapolate across distributions and offer fundamental insights into phenomena, but does not provide a concrete method for achieving this.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evidence would include the development of ML models that can provide precise, non-variable explanations for their predictions, and demonstrate the ability to extrapolate beyond their training data in ways that align with scientific theories.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the scientific method, as refined by Popper, be effectively integrated into machine learning to create models that are not only predictive but also explanatory?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses Popper's refinement of the scientific method, emphasizing falsification and conjecture, and suggests that ML models should adopt similar principles to generate "good explanations" rather than just predictions.
- Why unresolved: While the paper highlights the importance of falsifiability and the iterative process of generating and eliminating conjectures, it does not provide a framework for integrating these principles into ML models. The challenge lies in translating the abstract concepts of scientific theory development into concrete algorithms and model architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evidence would include the creation of ML models that incorporate mechanisms for generating hypotheses, testing them against data, and refining their internal representations based on falsification, similar to the scientific method.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the practical implications of shifting from "good enough predictions" to "good explanations" in AI, particularly in high-stakes decision-making domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper contrasts the utility of good predictions with the need for good explanations, especially in domains like autonomous driving, where understanding the reasoning behind decisions is crucial.
- Why unresolved: While the paper argues for the importance of explanations over mere predictions, it does not address how this shift would impact the development and deployment of AI systems in practical applications. The implications for fields such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and policy-making remain unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evidence would include case studies or experiments demonstrating the benefits of explanatory AI models in real-world applications, showing improved outcomes or decision-making processes compared to traditional predictive models.

## Limitations
- The paper does not provide empirical evidence demonstrating that precisely defined explanations actually lead to better generalization in practice.
- There is uncertainty about the practical applicability of philosophical criteria to real-world ML systems.
- The paper doesn't provide a concrete framework for integrating the scientific method into ML models.

## Confidence
- High confidence in the philosophical arguments about induction's limitations
- Medium confidence in the application of these principles to ML systems
- Low confidence in specific quantitative claims about explanation quality

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing ML models with precise vs. vague explanations on out-of-distribution data
2. Implement a framework to measure explanation "hard-to-vary" quality and test its correlation with model robustness
3. Survey ML practitioners to assess whether current explainable AI methods satisfy the "hard to vary" criterion in practice
