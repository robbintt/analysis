# A FAIR and Free Prompt-based Research Assistant

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.14601
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14601
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: A prompt-based research assistant tool that streamlines six research tasks using AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini while ensuring FAIR compliance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Research Assistant (RA), a free, prompt-based tool designed to streamline six key research tasks using AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini. RA generates FAIR research comparisons by standardizing research tasks through customized prompts, enabling structured knowledge creation. It supports tasks such as ideating research topics, drafting grant applications, writing blogs, aiding peer reviews, and refining literature search queries.

The tool's modular workflow and domain independence are demonstrated across Computer Science, Virology, and Climate Science, producing outputs comparable to domain experts. RA enhances research efficiency, ensures FAIR compliance, and offers post-editing for gold-standard readiness. Its open-source code allows easy customization, positioning RA as a versatile, accessible research assistant.

## Method Summary
The Research Assistant employs a prompt-based approach that standardizes research tasks through customized prompts to ensure Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) compliance. The tool leverages large language models (ChatGPT and Gemini) to automate six key research tasks: ideation of research topics, grant application drafting, blog writing, peer review assistance, literature search query refinement, and research comparison generation. The modular workflow is designed to be domain-independent, allowing application across different research fields. The system produces outputs that undergo post-editing to achieve gold-standard readiness, with open-source code available for customization.

## Key Results
- RA successfully demonstrates domain independence across Computer Science, Virology, and Climate Science
- Outputs are comparable to domain experts in quality and structure
- The tool ensures FAIR compliance while streamlining six key research tasks
- Open-source code enables easy customization and accessibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Research Assistant works by standardizing research tasks through customized prompts that guide AI tools toward structured, FAIR-compliant outputs. By breaking down complex research activities into modular, prompt-driven workflows, RA ensures consistency and reproducibility across different domains. The use of multiple AI models (ChatGPT and Gemini) provides flexibility in handling various research tasks, while the post-editing capability ensures outputs meet gold-standard requirements. The domain independence is achieved through prompt engineering that abstracts task-specific knowledge from domain-specific details.

## Foundational Learning
- Prompt Engineering - Why needed: To create consistent, structured outputs across different AI models and research tasks
  Quick check: Test prompt variations on sample tasks to ensure consistent output quality
- FAIR Principles - Why needed: To ensure research outputs are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable
  Quick check: Verify compliance with FAIR guidelines in generated outputs
- Domain Independence - Why needed: To enable the tool's application across diverse research fields
  Quick check: Test the tool across at least three distinct research domains
- Post-editing Workflow - Why needed: To refine AI-generated outputs to meet gold-standard requirements
  Quick check: Implement a structured post-editing checklist for quality assurance
- Modular Workflow Design - Why needed: To allow flexible customization and task-specific adaptations
  Quick check: Test individual module functionality in isolation

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
User Interface -> Prompt Engine -> AI Model Interface -> Output Processor -> Post-editing Module

Critical Path:
User submits task -> Prompt Engine generates task-specific prompts -> AI Model Interface processes prompts with ChatGPT/Gemini -> Output Processor formats results -> Post-editing Module refines outputs

Design Tradeoffs:
- Single AI model vs. multiple models: Multiple models provide flexibility but increase complexity
- Automated vs. human-in-the-loop: Full automation increases efficiency but may reduce quality control
- Domain-specific vs. domain-independent prompts: Domain independence increases versatility but may sacrifice task-specific optimization

Failure Signatures:
- Inconsistent output quality across different AI models
- Prompts failing to generate FAIR-compliant outputs
- Post-editing requirements exceeding acceptable time thresholds
- Domain-specific nuances lost in translation to domain-independent prompts

First Experiments:
1. Test prompt variations on a simple research task across all three domains
2. Compare output quality between ChatGPT and Gemini for identical prompts
3. Measure post-editing time requirements for achieving gold-standard outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Absence of quantitative performance metrics or controlled comparisons against human experts
- Claims about output quality comparability to domain experts lack empirical validation
- Limited scalability testing across broader research domains beyond the three demonstrated fields

## Confidence
- FAIR compliance claims: Medium - supported by design principles but lack rigorous validation
- Domain independence claims: Medium - demonstrated across three fields but not extensively tested
- Open-source accessibility claims: High - explicitly stated in the paper
- Output quality comparability claims: Low - lacks blind expert review or standardized evaluation metrics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct blind expert reviews comparing RA outputs to human-generated research artifacts across all six tasks
2. Perform systematic benchmarking of RA's performance against established research assistance tools using standardized metrics
3. Test the tool's scalability by applying it to at least 10 additional research domains to verify domain independence claims
