# A Real-Time Rescheduling Algorithm for Multi-robot Plan Execution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.18145

- The paper introduces Switchable-Edge Search (SES) for real-time replanning when unexpected delays occur during multi-robot plan execution.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of real-time replanning for multi-robot plan execution when unexpected delays occur. The authors introduce Switchable-Edge Search (SES), an A*-style algorithm that optimally reschedules agent passing orders at shared locations. SES operates on a Switchable Temporal Plan Graph (STPG) representation that allows dynamic modification of precedence relationships. Two variants are presented: Execution-based SES (ESES) and Graph-based SES (GSES). The algorithm is proven complete and optimal, and experiments show GSES achieves optimal replanning in under 1 second for small- and medium-sized problems, running up to 4 times faster than baselines on large problems.

## Method Summary
The paper presents Switchable-Edge Search (SES), an A*-style algorithm for real-time replanning of multi-robot plan execution. SES operates on a Switchable Temporal Plan Graph (STPG) representation derived from an initial MAPF solution. The algorithm explores STPG space by fixing or reversing switchable edges to find an optimal Temporal Plan Graph (TPG) that minimizes travel times. Two variants are introduced: ESES, which simulates TPG execution, and GSES, which uses graph properties for faster execution. The method is theoretically proven to be complete and optimal.

## Key Results
- GSES achieves optimal replanning in under 1 second for small- and medium-sized problems
- GSES runs up to 4 times faster than k-Robust CBS on large problems
- SES is theoretically proven to be complete and optimal for real-time replanning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Switchable-Edge Search (SES) algorithm optimally reschedules agent passing orders in real-time when delays occur.
- Mechanism: SES operates on a Switchable Temporal Plan Graph (STPG) that allows dynamic modification of precedence relationships. The algorithm uses A*-style search to explore STPG space, fixing or reversing switchable edges to find an optimal TPG with minimal travel times.
- Core assumption: The original MAPF solution provides a valid starting TPG, and all delays can be represented by adding dummy vertices.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose Switchable-Edge Search (SES), an A*-style algorithm designed to find optimal passing orders."
  - [section]: "We propose an A*-style algorithm called Switchable-Edge Search(SES) to find the new TPG based on a given STPG that minimizes the travel times of all agents to reach their goal locations."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no directly relevant papers found in the neighbor search.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Graph-based SES (GSES) variant achieves superior runtime efficiency through early termination.
- Mechanism: GSES uses longest path (lp) values to guide search. When fixing all switchable edges with lp(u) < lp(v) doesn't change the partial cost, GSES can terminate early without exploring all possible edge configurations.
- Core assumption: The longest path values accurately represent the minimal travel times under current precedence constraints.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Since, with X , HEURISTIC can directly compute the partial cost of a given STPG, GSES does not use any g values."
  - [section]: "GSES can have an early termination when fixing all switchable edges does not change any longest paths."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no directly relevant papers found in the neighbor search.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The execution-based SES (ESES) variant maintains correctness by simulating TPG execution.
- Mechanism: ESES simulates TPG execution step-by-step, maintaining auxiliary information about satisfied vertices. When a switchable edge is encountered during simulation, it branches the search, exploring both fixing and reversing that edge.
- Core assumption: The simulation accurately represents TPG execution as defined in Procedure 1.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "In essence, ESES simulates the execution of the STPG and branches when encountering a switchable edge."
  - [section]: "It uses X to record the index of the most recently satisfied vertex for every agent, indicating their current locations."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no directly relevant papers found in the neighbor search.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal Plan Graph (TPG) representation of MAPF solutions
  - Why needed here: SES operates directly on TPGs and STPGs, so understanding this representation is essential for grasping how the algorithm works.
  - Quick check question: How does a TPG encode precedence relationships between agents visiting the same location?

- Concept: A* search algorithm fundamentals
  - Why needed here: SES is described as an "A*-style algorithm," so understanding A* search is crucial for comprehending the search strategy.
  - Quick check question: What are the roles of g-values, h-values, and f-values in A* search?

- Concept: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem definition
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses replanning for MAPF solutions, so understanding the basic MAPF problem is necessary for context.
  - Quick check question: What constitutes a collision in MAPF, and how does the paper's definition differ from standard definitions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: STPG construction -> SES initialization -> A* search with branching -> Cycle detection -> Solution extraction
- Critical path: STPG construction → SES initialization → A* search with branching → Cycle detection → Solution extraction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - ESES vs GSES: ESES is more intuitive but slower; GSES uses graph properties for faster execution
  - Switchable edges: Too many make search intractable; too few limit optimization potential
  - Cycle detection: Adds overhead but prevents invalid solutions

- Failure signatures:
  - Runtime exceeds 90 seconds: Search space is too large or heuristic is ineffective
  - No solution found exception: STPG construction failed or search space exhausted
  - Suboptimal solutions: Heuristic not admissible or search terminated early

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run SES on a simple 2-agent problem with one switchable edge to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare ESES and GSES runtime on a medium-sized problem to observe the performance difference
  3. Test cycle detection by creating a STPG that would form a cycle when reversing a specific edge

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the runtime of GSES scale with the size of the TPG (number of vertices and edges) beyond the tested map configurations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that GSES runs faster than 1 second on small- and medium-sized problems, but does not provide detailed scalability analysis for very large TPGs.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were limited to specific map configurations and agent group sizes. The paper does not explore the behavior of GSES on extremely large or complex TPGs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with TPGs containing a significantly larger number of vertices and edges, beyond the tested scenarios, would provide insights into the scalability of GSES.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can SES be extended to handle more complex delay scenarios, such as variable delay durations or delays affecting multiple agents simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on delays affecting individual agents, but real-world scenarios might involve more complex delay patterns.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation of SES and its modules are designed to handle delays affecting single agents at specific timesteps. Handling more complex delay scenarios would require modifications to the algorithm and its modules.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and testing SES with various delay patterns, including variable durations and simultaneous delays affecting multiple agents, would demonstrate its ability to handle more complex scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of SES compare to other real-time replanning algorithms for MAPF, such as those based on different search strategies or optimization techniques?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares SES to k-Robust CBS as a baseline, but does not explore other real-time replanning algorithms.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on evaluating the efficiency of SES and its variants, but does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art real-time replanning algorithms for MAPF.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing SES to other real-time replanning algorithms, such as those based on different search strategies (e.g., heuristic search, constraint-based search) or optimization techniques (e.g., local search, metaheuristics), would provide insights into its relative performance.

## Limitations

- The paper's experimental validation relies heavily on simulated delays and assumes the initial MAPF solution quality
- The performance gains on large problems (up to 4x faster) are demonstrated but the comparison baseline details are sparse
- The handling of complex cycle scenarios in STPGs is theoretically addressed but not extensively tested in practice

## Confidence

- SES algorithm completeness and optimality: **High** - supported by theoretical proofs
- GSES runtime efficiency claims: **Medium** - based on experimental results but with limited baseline comparison details
- ESES vs GSES practical superiority: **Medium** - runtime differences shown but real-world applicability not fully explored

## Next Checks

1. Implement cycle detection stress tests with varying edge densities to verify the robustness of the DFS-based cycle detection mechanism under edge reversal operations.
2. Create a benchmark suite comparing GSES against state-of-the-art MAPF replanning algorithms (not just the k-Robust CBS baseline) to validate the claimed 4x speedup on large problems.
3. Test the algorithm with dynamic delay injection patterns that follow real-world distributions (e.g., Poisson processes) rather than uniform random delays to assess practical applicability.
