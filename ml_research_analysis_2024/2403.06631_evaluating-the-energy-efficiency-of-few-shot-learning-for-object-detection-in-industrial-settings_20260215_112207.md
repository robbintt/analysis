# Evaluating the Energy Efficiency of Few-Shot Learning for Object Detection in Industrial Settings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.06631
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06631
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Finetuning only detection modules without validation sets achieves the best energy efficiency while maintaining competitive mAP in industrial object detection

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates the energy efficiency of few-shot learning approaches for object detection in industrial settings, addressing the trade-off between performance and energy consumption. A finetuning strategy was applied to adapt YOLOv8 object detection models to downstream tasks using limited training data from three industrial datasets (PPE, Construction Safety, and Fire Detection). The research examined different finetuning strategies (full, head, and detection modules) and the use of validation sets during training. A novel Efficiency Factor metric was introduced to quantify the performance-energy trade-off. Results showed that finetuning only detection modules without validation sets consistently achieved the best energy efficiency while maintaining competitive performance.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated few-shot learning for object detection by finetuning pretrained YOLOv8n models on three industrial datasets with varying shot counts (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 30). Three finetuning strategies were tested: full model, head-only, and detection modules-only, with and without validation sets. Energy consumption was measured using CodeCarbon, and models were evaluated using mAP. A novel Efficiency Factor (EF = mAP / (1 + EC)) was introduced to quantify the performance-energy trade-off. The experiments compared the impact of different finetuning strategies and validation usage on both accuracy and energy efficiency across all three datasets.

## Key Results
- Detection-module-only finetuning achieved the best energy efficiency while maintaining competitive mAP across all three industrial datasets
- Models without validation sets demonstrated better energy efficiency compared to those with validation, without significant performance degradation
- The Efficiency Factor metric effectively captured the trade-off between detection accuracy and energy consumption

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Partial finetuning of YOLOv8 detection modules yields competitive mAP while consuming significantly less energy than full finetuning.
- Mechanism: By restricting gradient updates to the detection head (and bypassing backbone updates), fewer parameters are trained, reducing computational load and energy consumption without severely compromising detection accuracy.
- Core assumption: The backbone features learned on MSCOCO generalize well to industrial datasets, so re-training them is unnecessary.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "reducing the number of model parameters that are finetuned also leads to reduced energy consumption since the finetuning procedure becomes less computationally heavy."
  - [abstract]: "finetuning only detection modules without validation sets consistently achieved the best energy efficiency while maintaining competitive performance."
  - [corpus]: Weak; no direct support for this specific mechanism in related papers.
- Break condition: If domain shift between MSCOCO and industrial data is large, backbone retraining becomes necessary, negating efficiency gains.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Omitting validation sets during finetuning reduces energy consumption without significantly hurting final mAP.
- Mechanism: Validation steps add overhead by computing mAP on a hold-out set each epoch; skipping them reduces epoch time and total energy, while the best model can still be selected based on training loss trends.
- Core assumption: Early stopping or loss trends can substitute for explicit validation in selecting the best checkpoint.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "models that do not use a validation set demonstrate better energy efficiency compared to the corresponding ones that use, which is logical given that finetuning becomes less computationally expensive without the use of the validation set in each finetuning epoch."
  - [abstract]: "finetuning only detection modules without validation sets consistently achieved the best energy efficiency while maintaining competitive performance."
  - [corpus]: Weak; related work does not explicitly discuss validation-set overhead in FSL.
- Break condition: If overfitting is rapid and severe, lack of validation monitoring could lead to poor generalization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Efficiency Factor metric successfully consolidates competing objectives (mAP and energy) into a single interpretable score.
- Mechanism: EF is defined as mAP divided by (1 + EC), normalizing performance against energy use; this rewards high accuracy with low consumption, enabling direct comparison across models.
- Core assumption: The chosen normalization (1 + EC) appropriately scales energy without undervaluing either objective.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "this paper introduces a novel way to quantify this trade-off through a customized Efficiency Factor metric."
  - [section]: "EF = mAP / (1 + EC) ... higher EF values given to models that achieve both high mAP values during testing and low energy consumption during training."
  - [corpus]: Weak; no directly comparable metrics found in related work.
- Break condition: If energy consumption spans several orders of magnitude, the simple additive form may compress distinctions; a log-scale denominator might be needed.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Few-shot learning (FSL) and its distinction from full-data training.
  - Why needed here: The study specifically evaluates models adapted to novel classes with only K examples per class.
  - Quick check question: In a 3-way 5-shot task, how many total support samples are used for finetuning?

- Concept: Transfer learning via finetuning vs. meta-learning in FSL.
  - Why needed here: The paper opts for simple finetuning rather than meta-learning to keep computational costs low.
  - Quick check question: Why might meta-learning incur higher energy costs than finetuning?

- Concept: Energy profiling with CodeCarbon and watt-hour measurement.
  - Why needed here: Energy consumption is a primary metric; accurate profiling is required to compare models.
  - Quick check question: What unit does CodeCarbon report energy in, and why is that relevant for sustainability reporting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Pretrained YOLOv8n backbone (CSPDarknet53 + FPN) -> Detection head with three detection modules -> Training pipeline with optional validation loop -> CodeCarbon integration for energy logging

- Critical path:
  1. Load pretrained YOLOv8n
  2. Partition support/evaluation data
  3. Finetune selected modules for fixed epochs (no early stopping unless validation is used)
  4. Log energy per epoch, compute final mAP
  5. Calculate EF for comparison

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Full vs. partial finetuning: accuracy vs. energy
  - With vs. without validation: overfitting control vs. efficiency
  - Shot count selection: more data → better mAP but longer training

- Failure signatures:
  - mAP drops sharply when using too few shots
  - Energy readings plateau or spike if validation loop misbehaves
  - EF becomes meaningless if EC ≈ 0 (unlikely but possible with very small models)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Finetune only detection modules on PPE dataset with K=1, no validation; record mAP, EC, EF.
  2. Repeat with K=5, with validation enabled; compare EF to experiment 1.
  3. Swap to full model finetuning on Fire dataset, K=3, no validation; evaluate trade-off between mAP gain and EC increase.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different optimization strategies (e.g., gradient checkpointing, mixed precision training) affect the energy efficiency of few-shot object detection models in industrial settings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses energy efficiency but does not explore specific optimization strategies beyond basic finetuning approaches.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on comparing different finetuning strategies (full, head, detection modules) and the use of validation sets, but does not investigate advanced optimization techniques that could further improve energy efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments applying different optimization strategies to the few-shot object detection models and measuring their impact on energy consumption and performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the Efficiency Factor metric scale when applied to larger datasets or more complex object detection models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the Efficiency Factor as a novel metric to quantify the trade-off between performance and energy consumption, but does not explore its scalability.
- Why unresolved: The study only applies the Efficiency Factor to three industrial datasets and YOLOv8 models, leaving questions about its applicability to larger-scale scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the Efficiency Factor to larger datasets and more complex models, with analysis of how the metric behaves and whether it remains a useful measure of energy efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of data augmentation techniques on the energy efficiency of few-shot learning models for object detection in industrial environments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not discuss data augmentation techniques, which could potentially improve model performance with limited data while affecting energy consumption.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on the effects of finetuning strategies and validation sets but does not explore how data augmentation might influence the energy efficiency-performance trade-off.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing few-shot learning models with and without data augmentation, measuring both energy consumption and performance metrics to determine the impact on efficiency.

## Limitations
- Limited dataset scale: The PPE dataset contains only 342 samples, which may not capture full industrial variability
- Lack of hyperparameter ablation: The study does not explore different learning rates, optimizer choices, or batch sizes
- Hardware-dependent energy measurements: CodeCarbon measurements may vary across different computing infrastructures

## Confidence
- High confidence: Detection-module-only finetuning achieves best energy efficiency while maintaining competitive mAP
- Medium confidence: Omitting validation sets improves energy efficiency without significant performance degradation
- Medium confidence: Efficiency Factor effectively consolidates performance-energy trade-off

## Next Checks
1. Test the same finetuning strategies with varying learning rates (1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6) and batch sizes (4, 8, 16) to determine if energy efficiency advantages persist across different optimization settings.

2. Apply the most energy-efficient configuration (detection modules, no validation) to an additional industrial dataset not used in the original study to verify if observed efficiency gains generalize beyond the three tested domains.

3. Replicate energy consumption measurements using an alternative profiling tool (such as NVIDIA's System Management Interface) to confirm CodeCarbon's watt-hour readings are consistent and not influenced by software-specific overhead.
