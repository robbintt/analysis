# Audio Explanation Synthesis with Generative Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.07530
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07530
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed method achieves up to 97.1% classification agreement and 85% accuracy drop on important feature removal for keyword spotting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel method for generating interpretable audio explanations using generative foundation models. The approach leverages the representational power of audio foundation models by identifying important features in their latent space using Integrated Gradients, then generates listenable audio explanations through the model's decoder. The method was evaluated on keyword spotting and speech emotion recognition tasks, demonstrating high-fidelity explanations that effectively capture meaningful audio components while outperforming baseline approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses an autoencoder-style foundation model (specifically EnCodec) with frozen encoder weights and a task-specific classifier. For explanation generation, the method computes feature attributions in the latent space using Integrated Gradients to identify important dimensions, then creates modified latent representations by preserving important features and adding noise to unimportant ones. These modified representations are decoded to generate audio explanations that maintain the classifier's decision behavior while providing interpretable content.

## Key Results
- Achieved explanation classification agreement of up to 97.1% on Speech Commands dataset and 90.4% on TESS dataset
- Demonstrated accuracy drop of up to 85% on Speech Commands and 64.6% on TESS when removing important features
- Generated explanations captured meaningful high-level audio components rather than individual frequencies
- Outperformed baseline input-space explanation methods in fidelity metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The method leverages the generative capacity of audio foundation models to create listenable explanations by working in the embedding space rather than the input space.
- Mechanism: The foundation model's encoder extracts meaningful representations from raw audio, then feature attribution methods identify important features in this latent space. The decoder then generates audio explanations directly from these important features.
- Core assumption: The latent space of audio foundation models contains interpretable, high-level audio components that can be effectively prioritized and reconstructed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our method leverages the intrinsic representational power of the embedding space within these models by integrating established feature attribution techniques to identify significant features in this space."
  - [section]: "Our method leverages the generative capacity of foundation models from latent space to produce meaningful audio explanations in the input space."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related papers focus on explanation methods but don't specifically validate the embedding space approach for audio generation.
- Break condition: If the foundation model's latent space does not contain meaningful high-level audio components, or if the decoder cannot reconstruct listenable audio from modified latent representations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Feature attribution in the latent space provides more interpretable explanations than input-space methods by capturing higher-level audio concepts.
- Mechanism: By computing feature importance in the embedding space using Integrated Gradients, the method identifies which dimensions of the latent representation are most relevant to the model's decision, rather than focusing on individual audio frequencies or time frames.
- Core assumption: The foundation model has learned a representation space where individual dimensions correspond to meaningful audio concepts rather than raw signal components.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our approach takes advantage of this meaningful space for creating understandable explanations without mapping feature relevance to the input space where individual features are difficult to interpret like audio frequencies."
  - [section]: "Without backpropagating feature attribution computation to the audio input space, our method learns the important high-level components in the latent space."
  - [corpus]: Limited evidence - related work focuses on input-space explanations but doesn't validate the advantages of latent-space attribution for audio.
- Break condition: If the latent dimensions do not correspond to interpretable audio concepts, or if the attribution method fails to identify truly important features for the model's decisions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combination of feature attribution and generative reconstruction achieves high-fidelity explanations that preserve the original model's decision-making patterns.
- Mechanism: By selectively preserving important latent features and reconstructing audio from these, the method creates explanations that maintain the classifier's decision behavior while providing interpretable audio content.
- Core assumption: Removing unimportant features from the latent representation and reconstructing audio will still preserve the essential characteristics needed for the model's classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We verify that our method can generate high-fidelity explanations through experiments that simulate removing relevant features and assess the original model's performance on these essential features."
  - [section]: "The experiments demonstrated that our method delivers high-fidelity explanations, effectively capturing meaningful audio components pertinent to the specific task."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in related papers about fidelity preservation through generative reconstruction.
- Break condition: If the reconstructed audio from modified latent representations loses critical information needed for accurate classification, or if the fidelity metrics do not correlate with actual interpretability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Audio foundation models and autoencoder architecture
  - Why needed here: Understanding how foundation models like EnCodec work as autoencoders is crucial for grasping how the method extracts and reconstructs audio representations.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main components of an autoencoder-style foundation model and what are their roles?

- Concept: Feature attribution methods (Integrated Gradients)
  - Why needed here: The method uses Integrated Gradients to compute feature importance in the latent space, which is fundamental to understanding how explanations are generated.
  - Quick check question: How does Integrated Gradients differ from standard gradient-based attribution methods, and why is this important for the proposed approach?

- Concept: Transformer-based classifiers and their training
  - Why needed here: The method uses transformer classifiers on top of foundation model embeddings, so understanding their architecture and training is essential for implementation.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of freezing the encoder weights during fine-tuning of the classifier, and how does this affect the learned representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio -> Foundation model encoder -> Classifier -> Prediction -> Feature attribution -> Modified latent representation -> Foundation model decoder -> Audio explanation

- Critical path:
  1. Encode audio with foundation model encoder
  2. Pass latent representation to classifier
  3. Compute feature attributions using Integrated Gradients
  4. Create modified latent representation with important features preserved
  5. Decode modified representation to generate audio explanation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using latent space vs input space: Higher interpretability but requires generative model capability
  - Fixed encoder vs fine-tuned: Preserves foundation model representations but may limit task-specific adaptation
  - Feature attribution method choice: IG provides good properties but may be computationally expensive

- Failure signatures:
  - Low fidelity scores (classification agreement drops significantly)
  - Generated audio is not listenable or contains artifacts
  - Feature attributions don't align with human intuition about important audio components
  - Classifier performance degrades significantly when using modified latent representations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test encoder-decoder reconstruction quality on clean audio samples to verify foundation model functionality
  2. Validate classifier performance on latent representations before implementing explanation generation
  3. Compare fidelity metrics with baseline input-space explanation methods on a small dataset subset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper mentions as a limitation that the method needs evaluation on more complex audio tasks beyond keyword spotting and speech emotion recognition, such as speaker diarization, sound event detection, or music classification.

## Limitations
- The approach relies heavily on the quality and interpretability of the foundation model's latent space, which may vary significantly across different models and tasks.
- The method's reliance on a single feature attribution technique (Integrated Gradients) may not capture all aspects of feature importance, particularly for non-linear interactions in the latent space.
- The paper demonstrates success on relatively simple classification tasks but does not address potential limitations when applied to more complex audio classification tasks.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The mechanism of using feature attribution in latent space for explanation generation is well-grounded and supported by the experimental results showing high fidelity scores.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that latent space explanations are more interpretable than input-space methods, while theoretically sound, requires further validation across diverse audio tasks and human studies.
- **Medium Confidence**: The fidelity metrics demonstrate technical success, but the relationship between these metrics and actual human interpretability remains to be established.

## Next Checks
1. Apply the method to additional audio classification tasks (e.g., environmental sound classification) to verify that the latent space approach generalizes beyond the demonstrated tasks.
2. Conduct user studies comparing the interpretability of latent-space explanations versus input-space explanations to validate the claimed advantage of the proposed approach.
3. Compare the performance of Integrated Gradients with other feature attribution methods (e.g., SHAP, DeepLIFT) in the latent space to assess the robustness of the explanations to the choice of attribution technique.
