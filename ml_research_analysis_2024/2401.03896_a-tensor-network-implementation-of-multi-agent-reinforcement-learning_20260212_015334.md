# A Tensor Network Implementation of Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.03896
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03896
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Tensor network framework for multi-agent RL with 97.5% storage reduction via SVD

## Executive Summary
This work presents a novel tensor network framework for representing and optimizing policies in multi-agent reinforcement learning under finite Markov decision process assumptions. The approach constructs tensor networks to represent joint state transitions, rewards, and policies across multiple agents, addressing the curse of dimensionality through singular value decomposition techniques. The framework demonstrates significant compression capabilities while maintaining policy optimization effectiveness, validated on a two-agent random walker example using density matrix renormalization group methods.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs tensor networks to represent joint state transitions, rewards, and policies across multiple agents in finite MDP settings. High-rank tensors representing multi-agent systems are decomposed using singular value decomposition into lower-rank components, reducing storage requirements by 97.5% while preserving essential information. The approach leverages density matrix renormalization group methods for policy optimization, addressing the exponential growth in state space complexity as agent count increases. The method is demonstrated on a two-agent random walker example, showing correct policy optimization and significant computational efficiency gains.

## Key Results
- Tensor storage requirements reduced by 97.5% while preserving information through SVD decomposition
- Framework correctly optimizes policies in two-agent random walker example
- DMRT methods successfully applied to multi-agent policy optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging tensor network representations that naturally capture the high-dimensional joint state spaces of multi-agent systems. Singular value decomposition decomposes these high-rank tensors into lower-rank components, exploiting correlations and redundancies in the multi-agent state transitions and policies. This decomposition maintains the essential information while dramatically reducing storage and computational requirements, enabling practical computation for systems that would otherwise be intractable due to the curse of dimensionality.

## Foundational Learning
- Tensor Networks: Mathematical framework for representing high-dimensional data; needed for multi-agent state representation
- Quick check: Can represent joint probability distributions across multiple agents
- Singular Value Decomposition: Matrix factorization technique for dimensionality reduction; needed for tensor compression
- Quick check: Can decompose a 1000x1000 matrix into ~50x50 components with 95% information retention
- Finite Markov Decision Processes: State-based decision making framework with discrete states/actions; needed for tensor network formulation
- Quick check: All state transitions and rewards can be represented as matrices
- Density Matrix Renormalization Group: Tensor network algorithm for finding optimal states; needed for policy optimization
- Quick check: Can find ground state of quantum spin systems with high accuracy
- Curse of Dimensionality: Exponential growth in complexity with added dimensions; needed to understand problem motivation
- Quick check: State space grows as |S|^n for n agents with |S| states each

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input States -> Joint State Tensor -> SVD Decomposition -> Policy Tensor Network -> DMRT Optimization -> Output Actions

### Critical Path
1. Construct joint state transition tensor from individual agent MDPs
2. Apply SVD to decompose into manageable components
3. Represent policy as tensor network over decomposed components
4. Optimize policy using DMRT methods
5. Extract optimal policy for each agent

### Design Tradeoffs
- Compression vs accuracy: Higher compression rates may lose policy information
- Computation vs storage: SVD reduces storage but requires upfront computational cost
- Generality vs performance: Finite MDP assumption enables tensor formulation but limits applicability

### Failure Signatures
- SVD truncation too aggressive: Policy performance degrades despite compression
- Tensor network representation inadequate: Cannot capture necessary multi-agent interactions
- DMRT convergence issues: Optimization fails to find optimal policy

### First Experiments
1. Replicate two-agent random walker results to verify implementation
2. Test SVD compression levels on simple multi-agent grid world
3. Compare tensor network policy performance against tabular methods on identical tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Validation limited to single two-agent example, limiting generalizability
- Assumes finite MDPs, excluding continuous state/action spaces
- Focuses on policy representation without addressing opponent modeling or non-stationarity

## Confidence
- Framework validity: Medium (limited empirical validation)
- Scalability claims: Medium (theoretical promise but lacking extensive testing)
- Practical utility: Medium (simple example success but real-world complexity unknown)

## Next Checks
1. Apply framework to multi-agent grid-world environments with 3-5 agents to test scalability
2. Compare tensor network policy representations against neural network approaches on identical tasks
3. Extend framework to partially observable MDPs and test on benchmark multi-agent problems
