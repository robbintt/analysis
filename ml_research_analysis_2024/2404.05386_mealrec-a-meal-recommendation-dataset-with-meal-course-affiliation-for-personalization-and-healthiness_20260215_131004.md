# MealRec$^+$: A Meal Recommendation Dataset with Meal-Course Affiliation for Personalization and Healthiness

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2404.05386
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05386
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces MealRec+, a novel dataset enabling cooperative interaction learning for personalized and healthy meal recommendations

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the lack of publicly available meal recommendation datasets with meal-course affiliation, which hinders research on personalized and healthy meal recommendations. To solve this, the authors construct a new benchmark dataset called MealRec+, which includes user-meal interactions, user-course interactions, meal-course affiliations, and healthiness scores calculated using two widely recognized nutritional standards. The dataset is derived by simulating user dining sessions based on existing user-course interaction data and then mining additional interactions using collaborative filtering principles. Experiments with various baseline models demonstrate that cooperative interaction learning methods outperform separate interaction learning approaches for personalization. However, without explicit healthiness guidance, recommendations tend to be less healthy. The study also explores post-filtering methods to improve healthiness, showing that re-weighting can effectively balance personalization and healthiness. MealRec+ provides a valuable resource for advancing AI-driven, health-aware meal recommendation research.

## Method Summary
The authors construct MealRec+ by simulating user dining sessions to derive meal-course affiliations and user-meal interactions from existing user-course interaction data. They then apply collaborative filtering to mine additional interactions. Healthiness scores are calculated using FSA and WHO nutritional standards. The dataset is evaluated using various baseline models with separate and cooperative interaction learning methods, measuring personalization through Recall@K and NDCG@K, and healthiness through mean FSA/WHO scores and ranking exposure gaps.

## Key Results
- Cooperative interaction learning methods outperform separate interaction learning for personalization
- Healthiness of recommendations degrades without explicit healthiness guidance
- Re-weighting post-filtering methods effectively balance personalization and healthiness
- MealRec+ provides a valuable resource for advancing health-aware meal recommendation research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MealRec+ enables cooperative interaction learning by providing meal-course affiliation, which connects user-meal and user-course interactions.
- Mechanism: Meal-course affiliation acts as a bridge, allowing the model to aggregate course-level representations into meal-level representations, enabling two levels of interaction to be trained jointly.
- Core assumption: The meal-course affiliation is accurate and meaningful for learning user preferences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Meal recommendation research has been constrained in exploring the impact of cooperation between two levels of interaction on personalization and healthiness."
  - [section 2.1] "When having meal-course affiliation, cooperation between two separate interaction learnings is possible."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.362, average citations=0.0. Weak corpus evidence for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If the simulated meal-course affiliation does not reflect real user preferences, the cooperative learning will be ineffective.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The dataset construction method using dining session simulation and collaborative filtering effectively expands the dataset with user-meal interactions.
- Mechanism: Simulated dining sessions derive meal-course affiliation and user-meal interactions from user-course interaction data. Collaborative filtering then mines additional interactions based on the principle that similar users have similar behaviors.
- Core assumption: Users who interact with all courses of a meal are likely to like that meal, and this assumption holds for the simulated data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "meal-course affiliation and user-meal interaction are derived from simulated user dining sessions based on user-course interaction data."
  - [section 3.3] "Based on the principle of collaborative filtering... the user (𝑢 𝑗 ) may also like the meal (𝑚𝑘)."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; no direct citations to support this specific method.
- Break condition: If the collaborative filtering principle does not hold for meal interactions, the mined interactions will be inaccurate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Healthiness scores calculated using FSA and WHO standards provide a basis for health-aware meal recommendations.
- Mechanism: Each course is assigned healthiness scores based on nutritional content, and meal healthiness is the mean of its courses' scores. This allows models to learn health-related user preferences.
- Core assumption: The nutritional standards (FSA and WHO) accurately reflect healthiness and are relevant for meal recommendation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.4] "two internationally recognized standards for measuring... the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency (FSA) 'traffic light' system... and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines."
  - [section 3.5.2] "users prefer less healthy meals in the MealRec + dataset."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; no direct citations to support the use of these standards in meal recommendation datasets.
- Break condition: If the healthiness scores do not align with user perceptions of healthiness, the health-aware recommendations will be ineffective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
  - Why needed here: GNNs are used in baseline models (e.g., BGCN) to learn user preferences from graph-structured interaction data.
  - Quick check question: How does a GNN aggregate information from neighboring nodes in a user-meal-course graph?

- Concept: Collaborative Filtering
  - Why needed here: Collaborative filtering is the principle used to mine additional user-meal interactions based on user-course interactions.
  - Quick check question: What is the core assumption of collaborative filtering, and how does it apply to meal recommendation?

- Concept: Multi-task Learning
  - Why needed here: Multi-task learning is used in models like DAM to jointly learn user-meal and user-course interactions, allowing knowledge transfer between tasks.
  - Quick check question: How does sharing embeddings between tasks in multi-task learning improve model performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data layer -> Model layer -> Training layer -> Evaluation layer
- Critical path:
  1. Load MealRec+ dataset
  2. Choose a baseline model
  3. Train the model using the appropriate interaction learning method
  4. Evaluate the model on personalization and healthiness metrics
  5. Analyze results and iterate
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Separate vs. cooperative interaction learning: Cooperative learning may improve personalization but could be more complex to implement.
  - Healthiness vs. personalization: Prioritizing healthiness may reduce personalization accuracy, and vice versa.
  - Data density: Higher density datasets (MealRec+𝐻) may provide better performance but could be harder to construct.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor personalization: Low Recall@K and NDCG@K scores
  - Unhealthy recommendations: High FSA scores and negative △𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝐹 𝑆𝐴
  - Overfitting: High training performance but low test performance
  - Data sparsity: Many users or meals with few interactions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate CFR (separate interaction learning on user-meal interactions) on MealRec+𝐻
  2. Train and evaluate BGCN (separate interaction learning on both levels) on MealRec+𝐿
  3. Train and evaluate CrossCBR (cooperative interaction learning with contrastive learning) on MealRec+𝐻 and apply re-weighting to improve healthiness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed simulation method for generating user-meal interactions compare in quality and representativeness to real-world data collection methods, and what are the potential biases introduced by this simulation approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that the simulation method is adopted due to constraints related to user health privacy and meal scenario characteristics, which hinder the collection of real-world data.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed evaluation of the simulation method's accuracy or potential biases compared to real-world data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study using real-world data (if available) to validate the simulation method's accuracy and identify potential biases would be needed.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between personalization and healthiness in meal recommendations, and how can this balance be achieved without compromising either aspect significantly?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explores methods to improve the healthiness of recommendations but notes that hard filtering methods compromise personalization, while re-weighting methods offer a trade-off.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a definitive answer on the optimal balance between personalization and healthiness, as it depends on individual user preferences and health goals.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies or A/B testing with different balance strategies would be needed to determine the optimal trade-off for various user segments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different nutritional standards (e.g., FSA, WHO) impact the healthiness evaluation of meals, and which standard is more suitable for meal recommendation systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses two nutritional standards (FSA and WHO) to calculate healthiness scores but does not compare their effectiveness in meal recommendation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparative analysis of the two standards' impact on recommendation outcomes or user satisfaction.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing the performance and user acceptance of meal recommendations based on different nutritional standards would be needed.

## Limitations

- Healthiness scores are calculated based on standardized nutritional standards rather than user-specific health conditions or preferences
- Dataset construction relies on simulated dining sessions, which may not fully capture real-world user behavior patterns
- The dataset is derived from the Yummly dataset, which may have inherent biases from its original user base

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The dataset construction methodology and the experimental framework are clearly described and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence:** The effectiveness of cooperative interaction learning is demonstrated, but the improvement over separate learning methods is incremental.
- **Low Confidence:** The healthiness evaluation metrics, while well-intentioned, may not fully capture real-world health outcomes due to their reliance on standardized scores rather than personalized health considerations.

## Next Checks

1. Validate the dining session simulation algorithm by comparing the distribution of simulated meals against real-world meal patterns from the source Yummly dataset.
2. Test the dataset's generalizability by applying the same dataset construction methodology to a different source (e.g., Allrecipes) and comparing performance metrics.
3. Conduct user studies to validate whether the FSA/WHO healthiness scores align with user perceptions of healthy meals, particularly for the post-filtering methods.
