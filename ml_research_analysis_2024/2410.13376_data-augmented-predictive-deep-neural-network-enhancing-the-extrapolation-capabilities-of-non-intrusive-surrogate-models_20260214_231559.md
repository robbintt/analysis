# Data-Augmented Predictive Deep Neural Network: Enhancing the extrapolation capabilities of non-intrusive surrogate models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.13376
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13376
- Reference count: 34
- Proposes a deep learning framework combining KDMD with CAE and FFNN to enhance extrapolation capabilities of surrogate models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework called DAPredDNN that addresses the challenge of predicting system behavior beyond the training time interval for parametric nonlinear dynamical systems. The method combines Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD) with convolutional autoencoders (CAE) and feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) to enable accurate time extrapolation without requiring additional high-fidelity simulations. By evolving latent dynamics in time intervals beyond available training data and augmenting the original dataset with these KDMD-extrapolated results, the approach achieves reliable predictions at any time point in the full interval for unseen parameter samples.

## Method Summary
The method employs a three-step process: (1) pretrain a convolutional autoencoder to compress high-dimensional physical states into a latent space, (2) use KDMD to evolve the latent dynamics beyond the training interval and decode back to physical space, and (3) train a combined CAE-FFNN model on the augmented dataset containing both original and KDMD-extrapolated data. This enables direct mapping from parameter-time pairs to full state predictions in a single step, achieving accurate extrapolation for parametric nonlinear dynamical systems without iterative prediction schemes.

## Key Results
- Achieves mean errors of 8.148×10^-4 and 4.479×10^-4 for two state variables in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, with maximum errors of 1.970×10^-2 and 1.336×10^-2 respectively
- Demonstrates mean and maximum errors of 5.498×10^-5 and 1.888×10^-3 for the flow past a cylinder case
- Shows reliable performance even for parameter values outside the training range
- Enables one-step time sequence prediction, making online prediction extremely fast compared to sequential methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KDMD in latent space enables accurate time extrapolation beyond training interval
- Mechanism: KDMD learns the Koopman operator in compressed latent space, capturing the underlying dynamics with a small number of eigenfunctions, then extrapolates these eigenfunctions to predict future latent states
- Core assumption: The dynamics in latent space are approximately linear (Koopman) and can be captured by a finite number of eigenfunctions
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions KDMD evolving latent dynamics; section describes KDMD deriving latent variables in (T0, T] based on data from [0, T0]

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Data augmentation with KDMD-extrapolated samples improves FFNN generalization
- Mechanism: Original training data is augmented with KDMD-predicted future states, allowing FFNN to learn mappings that include time extrapolation without requiring additional high-fidelity simulations
- Core assumption: KDMD-predicted states are accurate enough to serve as valid training data for FFNN
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states data is added and CAE trained with augmented data; section mentions combining data in (T0, T] with original training data

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: One-step prediction architecture enables faster online inference than sequential methods
- Mechanism: FFNN-decoder directly maps parameter-time pairs to full state predictions, avoiding iterative prediction steps required by LSTM-based or step-by-step methods
- Core assumption: FFNN can learn the complex nonlinear mapping from parameter-time space to physical space when trained on augmented data
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions FFNN-decoder generates future dynamics in one step; section states this makes online prediction extremely fast

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Koopman operator theory and its application to nonlinear dynamical systems
  - Why needed here: Forms the theoretical foundation for KDMD, which is the core mechanism enabling time extrapolation
  - Quick check question: What is the key assumption behind Koopman operator theory that makes it applicable to nonlinear systems?

- Concept: Autoencoder architectures (convolutional, feed-forward) and their training dynamics
  - Why needed here: CAE compresses high-dimensional physical states to latent space, while FFNN learns parameter-time to latent mappings
  - Quick check question: How does the bottleneck dimension of CAE affect the quality of KDMD extrapolation in latent space?

- Concept: Kernel methods and their computational tradeoffs in high-dimensional spaces
  - Why needed here: KDMD uses kernel evaluations to compute inner products without explicitly computing high-dimensional observables
  - Quick check question: What is the computational complexity of KDMD compared to standard DMD, and when does this advantage become significant?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CAE (encoder-decoder pair) → KDMD (latent dynamics evolution) → Data augmentation → CAE-FFNN (combined training) → FFNN-decoder (online prediction)
- Critical path: Encoder → KDMD → Decoder → Augmentation → FFNN training → Online prediction
- Design tradeoffs: Latent space dimension vs KDMD accuracy, kernel bandwidth vs extrapolation quality, augmentation ratio vs overfitting risk
- Failure signatures: Poor extrapolation when latent space is too small, kernel parameter mismatch, insufficient augmentation data
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test KDMD extrapolation accuracy alone on simple latent dynamics before integrating with CAE
  2. Validate data augmentation by comparing FFNN performance with vs without augmented samples
  3. Measure online prediction speed vs accuracy tradeoff by varying FFNN depth and width

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of DAPredDNN compare to existing methods like SINDy-based approaches or transformer models for time extrapolation in parametric systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that methods like LSTM-based approaches and AE-SINDy based methods achieve good predictions in both the parameter and time domain via time-marching schemes in the latent space, but it does not provide a direct comparison with DAPredDNN.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include a quantitative comparison of DAPredDNN's performance against other state-of-the-art methods for time extrapolation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive benchmark study comparing DAPredDNN's accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness against other methods like SINDy, transformers, and LSTM-based approaches on a diverse set of parametric dynamical systems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the kernel choice in KDMD on the extrapolation performance of DAPredDNN, and are there systematic ways to select optimal kernels for different types of systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that a Gaussian kernel with shape parameter = 10 is selected for KDMD in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, but it does not explore the impact of different kernel choices or provide guidelines for kernel selection.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the sensitivity of DAPredDNN's performance to the choice of kernel in KDMD or provide a framework for optimal kernel selection.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study evaluating the performance of DAPredDNN with different kernel choices (e.g., polynomial, RBF, sigmoid) on a range of parametric systems, along with guidelines for kernel selection based on system characteristics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does DAPredDNN perform on systems with high-dimensional parameter spaces or systems with discontinuities in the parameter domain?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates DAPredDNN's effectiveness on two numerical examples with relatively low-dimensional parameter spaces (FitzHugh-Nagumo: 1 parameter, Flow past a cylinder: 1 parameter). It does not address the scalability of the method to high-dimensional parameter spaces or systems with discontinuities.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the limitations of DAPredDNN in handling high-dimensional parameter spaces or systems with discontinuities, which are common in real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Numerical experiments testing DAPredDNN on systems with high-dimensional parameter spaces (e.g., 10+ parameters) and systems with discontinuities in the parameter domain, along with an analysis of the method's scalability and robustness to these challenges.

## Limitations
- Performance depends critically on the quality of KDMD extrapolation in latent space, which may not hold for systems with complex chaotic behavior
- Assumes latent dynamics can be well-captured by a finite number of Koopman eigenfunctions, limiting applicability to strongly nonlinear systems
- Lacks systematic sensitivity analysis for kernel bandwidth and latent space dimension selection

## Confidence
- High confidence: The three-step architecture combining CAE, KDMD, and FFNN is clearly defined and reproducible with specific error metrics
- Medium confidence: The mechanism by which KDMD extrapolation enables FFNN generalization is theoretically sound but lacks direct empirical validation in isolation
- Medium confidence: The one-step prediction advantage over sequential methods is demonstrated computationally but not benchmarked against alternative architectures on the same problems

## Next Checks
1. Test KDMD extrapolation accuracy on latent dynamics from a simple known dynamical system before integrating with the full CAE-FFNN pipeline to isolate the contribution of the KDMD component

2. Systematically vary kernel bandwidth, latent space dimension, and augmentation ratio to quantify their impact on extrapolation accuracy and identify optimal configurations for different types of dynamical systems

3. Implement alternative architectures such as LSTM-based or physics-informed neural networks on the same test problems to benchmark the proposed method's extrapolation performance and computational efficiency
