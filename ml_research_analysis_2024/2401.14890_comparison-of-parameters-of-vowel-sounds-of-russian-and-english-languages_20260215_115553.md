# Comparison of parameters of vowel sounds of russian and english languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.14890
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14890
- Reference count: 5
- One-line primary result: This paper analyzes vowel formant patterns in Russian and English to support language-independent speech recognition, finding systematic shifts based on consonant context and measurable cross-linguistic acoustic matches.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates vowel formant patterns in Russian and English to develop a generalized acoustic model for multilingual speech recognition. Using a custom program complex, the authors extract first and second formants in two frequency ranges (60-750 Hz, 750-2500 Hz) and compare patterns across vowel sounds. The analysis reveals that Russian vowels exhibit systematic formant shifts depending on surrounding consonant context (hard vs. soft), while cross-linguistic comparison identifies strong acoustic matches between specific Russian and English vowels. These findings provide foundational data for building language-independent speech recognition systems.

## Method Summary
The research employs a custom program complex (sr) to extract and analyze vowel formant parameters from speech recordings. The software determines vocalization presence, fundamental frequency, intensity dynamics, and harmonic ratios. For Russian vowels, 22 variants were analyzed based on hard/soft consonant context, revealing consistent harmonic shifts where soft contexts raise upper-range harmonics and hard contexts lower them. English vowels (20 total: short, long, diphthongs) were compared to Russian equivalents by mapping first and second formants in the 60-750 Hz and 750-2500 Hz ranges. The analysis identified strong, partial, and poor acoustic matches between corresponding vowels in the two languages.

## Key Results
- Russian vowels show systematic formant shifts based on consonant context: soft contexts raise upper-range harmonics, hard contexts lower them
- Strong acoustic matches found between Russian and English vowels: [a:] with [а], [ɔ:] with [о], [i:] with [и], [ai] with [ai], [ɔi] with [ɔi]
- Partial matches identified for [u:], [iə], [uə]; poor matches for [ə:], [ə], [e], and [əu]

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Russian vowel formant patterns vary systematically based on consonant context (hard/soft), enabling acoustic distinction in speech recognition.
- Mechanism: The formant frequencies of vowels shift predictably depending on whether they are surrounded by hard or soft consonants. Soft contexts elevate upper-range harmonics, while hard contexts lower them.
- Core assumption: The acoustic properties of vowels are significantly influenced by adjacent consonant articulation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "For Russian, 22 vowel variants were analyzed based on consonant context (hard/soft), revealing consistent harmonic shifts: soft contexts raise upper-range harmonics, hard contexts lower them."
  - [corpus]: Weak match; no direct formant comparison found, but related phonetic studies exist (e.g., "A Data-Centric Framework for Addressing Phonetic and Prosodic Challenges in Russian Speech Generative Models").
- Break condition: If formant shifts are not consistent across speakers or contexts, the model cannot reliably distinguish vowel variants.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: English and Russian vowels have measurable acoustic overlap, allowing cross-linguistic mapping for speech recognition.
- Mechanism: By comparing first and second formant frequencies across languages, certain vowels show strong acoustic matches (e.g., [a:] with [а], [ɔ:] with [о]), enabling a generalized acoustic model.
- Core assumption: Vowel sounds with similar articulation produce comparable formant patterns across languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Strong acoustic matches were found for [a:], [ɔ:], [i:], [ai], and [ɔi]; partial matches for [u:], [iə], [uə]; and poor matches for [ə:], [ə], [e], and [əu]."
  - [section]: "For English, 20 vowels (short, long, diphthongs) were compared to Russian equivalents."
- Break condition: If acoustic matches are inconsistent or unreliable, the generalized model cannot accurately map vowels between languages.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The program complex used extracts and visualizes formant data, enabling systematic analysis of vowel patterns.
- Mechanism: The custom software determines first and second formants in specific frequency ranges (60-750 Hz, 750-2500 Hz) and presents them as graphs, facilitating comparison.
- Core assumption: The software accurately captures and represents formant frequencies for analysis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "It can determine: the presence of vocalization of sounds; frequency of the main tone; intensity of the main tone; dynamics of change in the frequency of the main tone; deviation of the main tone frequency; dynamics of change in the intensity of the main tone; ratio of the intensity of harmonics to the intensity of the main tone."
  - [corpus]: Weak match; no direct mention of the software, but related studies on formant extraction exist (e.g., "Generating Feature Vectors from Phonetic Transcriptions in Cross-Linguistic Data Formats").
- Break condition: If the software fails to accurately extract or visualize formant data, the analysis becomes unreliable.

  - Quick check question: What acoustic features are used to compare vowels across different languages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Speech signal input -> Formant extraction module (sr software) -> Pattern analysis -> Cross-linguistic mapping -> Model training
- Critical path: Signal input → Formant extraction → Pattern analysis → Cross-linguistic mapping → Model training
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing accuracy of formant extraction with computational efficiency; choosing frequency ranges that capture relevant vowel information without noise
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent formant patterns across speakers, poor acoustic matches between languages, or software inaccuracies in formant extraction
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate formant extraction accuracy by comparing software output with known vowel samples
  2. Test cross-linguistic mapping by analyzing a small set of Russian and English vowels with known acoustic matches
  3. Evaluate model robustness by testing it on speakers with varying accents or speaking styles

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why do certain English vowels (e.g., [u:], [iə], [uə]) show unclear similarity to their expected Russian counterparts in harmonic patterns?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Table 3 notes "Resemblance unclear" for multiple English vowels compared to Russian equivalents
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the mismatch but does not explain the acoustic or articulatory reasons for the divergence from expected patterns
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed acoustic analysis comparing formant transitions and duration patterns between languages

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do non-percussive vowel sounds (unstressed vowels) differ in harmonic patterns from the percussive sounds analyzed in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 2.2 mentions "non-percussive vowel sounds in different pronunciations can vary greatly in duration and can disappear altogether"
- Why unresolved: The study deliberately excluded these sounds due to analytical challenges, leaving their acoustic properties unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative spectral analysis of stressed vs. unstressed vowel contexts across multiple speakers

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the identified harmonic patterns be generalized across different age groups or regional accents beyond the 5 male and 5 female speakers sampled?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study uses a limited sample size (10 speakers total) without addressing demographic variation
- Why unresolved: The paper does not test the stability of identified patterns across different speaker populations
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-sectional study comparing harmonic patterns across age groups and dialect regions

## Limitations
- Limited speaker sample (10 speakers total) restricts generalizability across age groups and dialects
- Lack of detailed methodological specifications for the "sr" program complex prevents independent validation
- Exclusion of non-percussive vowel sounds leaves a significant phonetic category unexplored

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The observation that vowel formants shift systematically in different consonant contexts (hard vs. soft) is well-established in phonetic literature and supported by multiple acoustic studies.
- **Medium Confidence:** The cross-linguistic acoustic mappings between Russian and English vowels are plausible based on known phonetic similarities, though the specific matching criteria and reliability across speakers need verification.
- **Low Confidence:** The program complex's ability to accurately extract and visualize formants in the specified frequency ranges cannot be independently verified without access to the software or detailed implementation documentation.

## Next Checks

1. Validate the "sr" program complex by comparing its formant extraction results against established acoustic analysis tools (e.g., Praat) using the same vowel samples.
2. Expand the speaker sample to include diverse age groups, dialects, and speaking styles to test the robustness of the observed formant patterns across different speaker populations.
3. Conduct a listener perception study to verify whether the acoustically mapped Russian-English vowel pairs are indeed perceived as similar by native speakers of both languages.
