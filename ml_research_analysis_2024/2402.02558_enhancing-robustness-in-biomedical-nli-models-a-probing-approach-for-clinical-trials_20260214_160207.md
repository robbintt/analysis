# Enhancing Robustness in Biomedical NLI Models: A Probing Approach for Clinical Trials

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.02558
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02558
- Authors: Ata Mustafa
- Reference count: 13
- Key outcome: Probing-based approach improves SciFive biomedical NLI model accuracy by 2% to 93% using mnestic probing and iterative null space projection

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a probing-based approach to enhance the robustness of biomedical natural language inference models for clinical trials. The method uses mnestic probing to investigate features learned by a fine-tuned SciFive model, focusing on monotonicity and concept inclusion relations from natural logic. By training task-specific probes and performing iterative null space projection on the model's final decoder layer, superfluous features are removed, resulting in improved accuracy and identification of key features contributing to entailment tasks.

## Method Summary
The approach involves mnestic probing to analyze the features learned by a fine-tuned SciFive model for biomedical NLI tasks. Task-specific probes are trained to identify and measure specific linguistic features, particularly monotonicity and concept inclusion relations from natural logic. These probes are then used to perform iterative null space projection on the model's final decoder layer, effectively removing superfluous features that may be hindering performance. This process enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant features for entailment tasks, leading to improved accuracy.

## Key Results
- Probing-based approach improves SciFive biomedical NLI model accuracy by 2%, reaching 93%
- Iterative null space projection effectively removes superfluous features from the model's final decoder layer
- The method helps identify key features contributing to entailment tasks in biomedical NLI

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by using mnestic probing to identify and quantify specific linguistic features in the model's representations. Task-specific probes are trained to measure features like monotonicity and concept inclusion relations. These probes then guide iterative null space projection to remove irrelevant or redundant features from the model's final decoder layer. This process refines the model's focus on essential features for biomedical NLI tasks, improving its performance on entailment tasks.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Mnestic Probing** - Why needed: To investigate and quantify specific linguistic features learned by the model. Quick check: Verify probe accuracy in detecting target features.
2. **Natural Logic** - Why needed: Provides framework for understanding semantic relations like monotonicity and concept inclusion. Quick check: Confirm correct implementation of natural logic relations.
3. **Iterative Null Space Projection** - Why needed: Method to remove superfluous features from model representations. Quick check: Validate feature removal does not impact core functionality.
4. **Biomedical NLI** - Why needed: Domain-specific language understanding for clinical trial applications. Quick check: Test on diverse biomedical datasets.
5. **SciFive Model Architecture** - Why needed: Base model for fine-tuning and robustness enhancement. Quick check: Confirm proper fine-tuning on biomedical data.
6. **Entailment Tasks** - Why needed: Core task for NLI models in clinical trial contexts. Quick check: Evaluate performance on varied entailment scenarios.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** SciFive Base Model -> Fine-tuning -> Mnestic Probing -> Task-specific Probes -> Iterative Null Space Projection -> Enhanced Model

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves fine-tuning the SciFive model on biomedical NLI data, followed by mnestic probing to identify key features. Task-specific probes are then trained and used to perform iterative null space projection on the final decoder layer, resulting in the enhanced model with improved accuracy.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach balances model complexity with performance gains. While removing features can improve accuracy, there's a risk of losing potentially useful information. The use of mnestic probing and iterative null space projection adds computational overhead but provides targeted improvements.

**Failure Signatures:** Potential failures include:
- Probes failing to accurately identify relevant features
- Over-aggressive feature removal leading to loss of important information
- Improvements not generalizing beyond monotonicity tasks
- Computational limitations preventing full exploration of the approach

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test mnestic probing accuracy on a held-out set of biomedical NLI examples
2. Evaluate the impact of iterative null space projection on a single feature type before full implementation
3. Compare model performance before and after feature removal on a diverse set of entailment tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Probing approach limited to monotonicity tasks, representing only a subset of potential robustness improvements
- Computational constraints limited the scope of experiments
- Accuracy improvement of 2% to 93% may not generalize to other biomedical NLI scenarios

## Confidence
- Probing methodology: Medium
- Accuracy improvements: Medium
- Generalizability of results: Low
- Model-specific effectiveness: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Extend the probing approach to additional natural logic relations beyond monotonicity, including concept inclusion and other semantic relations, to test generalizability across the full spectrum of robustness improvements.

2. Apply the same mnestic probing and iterative null space projection methodology to alternative biomedical language models (e.g., BioBERT, PubMedBERT) to verify whether the robustness improvements are model-specific or transferable.

3. Conduct ablation studies to determine which components of the mnestic probing approach contribute most significantly to the accuracy improvements - specifically testing the relative impact of probe training versus iterative null space projection.
