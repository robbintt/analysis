# Color Recognition in Challenging Lighting Environments: CNN Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.04762
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04762
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: CNN with edge detection segmentation achieves improved color detection accuracy and robustness under varying lighting conditions compared to SVM, LSTM, and Random Forest

## Executive Summary
This study presents a CNN-based approach for color recognition in challenging lighting environments. The method combines edge detection-based image segmentation with a three-layer CNN architecture to isolate objects and classify their colors. Tested on 250 images under different lighting conditions, the model demonstrates improved accuracy and robustness compared to traditional machine learning methods. The approach shows promise for applications requiring precise color differentiation when illumination varies significantly.

## Method Summary
The method employs edge detection (Sobel) for image segmentation to isolate objects, followed by CNN classification of the segmented object's color. The CNN architecture consists of three convolutional layers with ReLU activation, pooling, and fully connected layers. The model is trained on a dataset of 250 images representing color variations under different lighting conditions, with 200 images for training and 50 for testing. The approach aims to enhance color recognition robustness by reducing background lighting interference through segmentation before classification.

## Key Results
- Improved color detection accuracy and robustness compared to SVM, LSTM, and Random Forest baselines
- Reduced training and validation loss with increased accuracy over training epochs
- Effective color classification under varying illumination conditions through combined edge detection and CNN approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The combination of edge detection-based segmentation with CNN-based color classification enhances robustness to lighting variations.
- Mechanism: Edge detection isolates object boundaries before color classification, reducing the impact of background lighting variations on the CNN's color predictions.
- Core assumption: The CNN's learned color features are invariant to lighting changes when the input is properly segmented.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "image segmentation is performed using the edge detection segmentation technique to specify the object and then the segmented object is fed to the Convolutional Neural Network"
  - [section] "Firstly, image segmentation is performed using the edge detection segmentation technique to specify the object and then the segmented object is fed to the Convolutional Neural Network trained to detect the color of an object in different lighting conditions"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus comparison of edge detection + CNN vs CNN alone under varying lighting
- Break condition: If the edge detection fails to properly segment objects under extreme lighting conditions, the CNN will receive corrupted inputs and performance will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The CNN architecture with three convolutional layers and ReLU activation effectively captures color features while maintaining computational efficiency.
- Mechanism: Multiple convolutional layers progressively extract hierarchical color features, while ReLU introduces non-linearity without vanishing gradients, enabling effective learning from raw color data.
- Core assumption: The hierarchical feature extraction captures sufficient color information for accurate classification under varying illumination.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The CNN architecture includes three convolutional layers, pooling, and fully connected layers, optimized with ReLU activation"
  - [section] "We have proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for color classification containing three convolutional layers, along with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation, augmenting feature extraction, and infusing non-linearity"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence comparing this specific architecture configuration to alternatives
- Break condition: If the network depth is insufficient to capture complex color variations, or if ReLU activation causes dead neurons in certain layers.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training on a dataset with diverse lighting conditions improves the model's ability to generalize color recognition across different illumination scenarios.
- Mechanism: Exposure to color variations under different lighting during training enables the CNN to learn lighting-invariant color features through backpropagation.
- Core assumption: The training dataset adequately represents the range of lighting conditions the model will encounter in deployment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Tested on 250 images under different lighting conditions"
  - [section] "The proposed CNN is trained using a dataset of 250 images of different variations of colors in different lighting conditions"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus data on dataset diversity or generalization performance
- Break condition: If the training dataset lacks sufficient diversity in lighting conditions, the model will overfit to specific illumination patterns and fail to generalize.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Edge detection module (Sobel) → Object segmentation → Bounding box extraction → Color cube extraction → CNN classification
  - Data flow: Raw image → Edge detection → Contours → Largest contour selection → Bounding box → Cropping → Feature extraction → CNN prediction

- Critical path:
  1. Edge detection to identify object boundaries
  2. Contour processing to find largest object
  3. Bounding box extraction and cropping
  4. Color feature extraction from bounding box
  5. CNN prediction of color class

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Edge detection vs. other segmentation methods: Faster but potentially less robust to complex backgrounds
  - Three-layer CNN vs. deeper networks: Computational efficiency vs. feature extraction capability
  - Fixed-size color cubes vs. adaptive sizing: Simplicity vs. potential loss of context

- Failure signatures:
  - High loss with low accuracy: Likely overfitting or insufficient training data diversity
  - Consistent misclassification of specific colors: Possible bias in training data or insufficient color variation
  - Edge detection failures: Incorrect object boundaries leading to corrupted color inputs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test edge detection performance on images with varying lighting gradients
  2. Evaluate CNN classification accuracy on segmented vs. non-segmented objects under different lighting
  3. Measure performance degradation when training data lacks certain lighting conditions present in test set
