# Organic or Diffused: Can We Distinguish Human Art from AI-generated Images?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.03214
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03214
- Authors: Anna Yoo Jeong Ha; Josephine Passananti; Ronik Bhaskar; Shawn Shan; Reid Southen; Haitao Zheng; Ben Y. Zhao
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Automated detectors achieve high accuracy (98.03% for Hive) on AI-generated images, but human experts (83% accuracy) and combined approaches are most robust to adversarial attacks.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the effectiveness of distinguishing human art from AI-generated images using both automated detectors and human expertise. The authors conduct comprehensive studies comparing five automated detection methods (Hive, Optic, Illuminarty, DIRE, DE-FAKE) against human detection by three groups: crowdworkers, professional artists, and expert artists. Their findings reveal that while Hive achieves exceptional accuracy on unperturbed images, human experts demonstrate superior robustness against adversarial attacks, particularly when combined with automated detection in an ensemble approach.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates detection methods across 280 human artworks spanning 7 styles and 350 AI-generated images from 5 models, plus hybrid and upscaled images. Five automated detectors were tested on both unperturbed and perturbed images (JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, CLIP-based adversarial perturbation, Glaze). Three human user studies were conducted with 180 crowdworkers, over 3800 professional artists, and 13 expert artists, using 5-point Likert scales converted to binary decisions. The researchers measured accuracy, false positive/negative rates, and AI detection success rates, then developed an ensemble approach combining Hive and expert artist decisions.

## Key Results
- Hive achieves 98.03% accuracy on unperturbed AI-generated images, outperforming other automated detectors
- General users achieve only 40.81% accuracy, while professional artists reach 75.32% by identifying inconsistencies
- Expert artists achieve highest accuracy at 83% by leveraging domain-specific knowledge of artistic techniques
- Combined Hive-expert ensemble approach provides best robustness against adversarial attacks, reducing false negative rate from 19.70% to 8.82% on Glaze-perturbed images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hive outperforms other detectors with 98.03% accuracy due to its larger and more diverse training dataset.
- Mechanism: Hive's high accuracy stems from its training on a rich collection of generative AI datasets covering multiple models (9 at the time, now 27), which allows it to generalize better across different AI generators.
- Core assumption: Training data coverage directly correlates with detection performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Hive utilizes a rich collection of generative AI datasets and can identify the generative model used for the current input from a pool of nine models"
  - [section]: "According to its website, Hive utilizes a rich collection of generative AI datasets and can identify the generative model used for the current input from a pool of nine models"
- Break condition: If the training dataset becomes outdated or doesn't include newer models like Firefly, performance will degrade significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Human experts perform well (83% accuracy) by leveraging domain-specific knowledge of artistic techniques and medium limitations.
- Mechanism: Expert artists identify AI-generated images through knowledge of medium-specific characteristics (e.g., watercolor bleeding patterns, oil painting textures) and intentionality in details that AI models often miss.
- Core assumption: Expert knowledge of artistic mediums and techniques is transferable to detection tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "expert artists are most accurate (83%) using domain knowledge"
  - [section]: "Our expert artists are generally very confident at judging images from more than 2 art styles. The most frequently selected one is fantasy art. The primary decision factors are intrinsic artistic details, which often go beyond the '(in)consistency' element used by professional artists in their detection efforts"
- Break condition: If AI models evolve to better capture medium-specific characteristics and artistic intentionality, expert detection accuracy will decline.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A combined approach using both human and automated detectors provides the best accuracy and robustness, especially against adversarial attacks.
- Mechanism: The ensemble detector leverages the complementary strengths of Hive (high confidence on unperturbed images) and expert artists (better at detecting Glaze-perturbed images) through a tie-breaking mechanism based on confidence scores.
- Core assumption: Human and automated detectors make different types of errors that can be mitigated by combining their decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We believe these weaknesses will persist, and argue that a combination of human and automated detectors provides the best combination of accuracy and robustness"
  - [section]: "Table 11 shows that the combined detector is highly effective in judging Glazed images, outperforming both Hive and expert. Notably, it outperforms Hive by lowering FNR from 19.70% down to 8.82%"
- Break condition: If the confidence-based tie-breaking mechanism fails to accurately represent the reliability of each detector's decision, the ensemble performance will degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Image classification and detection
  - Why needed here: Understanding how different detectors classify images as human or AI-generated is fundamental to evaluating their performance.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a binary decision and a probabilistic score in image classification?

- Concept: Adversarial perturbations
  - Why needed here: The study tests detector robustness against various perturbations, which requires understanding how these perturbations affect image features.
  - Quick check question: How do adversarial perturbations in CLIP space differ from Gaussian noise in terms of their effect on image classifiers?

- Concept: Likert scale and confidence scoring
  - Why needed here: The study uses a 5-point Likert scale for both human and automated detectors, requiring understanding of how to convert these scores to binary decisions.
  - Quick check question: Why did the researchers choose to exclude "not sure" responses when computing accuracy metrics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data collection pipeline (human art, AI-generated images, perturbations) -> Automated detectors (Hive, Optic, Illuminarty, DIRE, DE-FAKE) -> Human detection studies (general users, professional artists, expert artists) -> Evaluation metrics (ACC, FPR, FNR, ADSR) -> Ensemble mechanism (Hive + expert tie-breaking)

- Critical path:
  1. Curate dataset of human art across 7 styles and AI-generated images from 5 models
  2. Apply perturbations (JPEG, Gaussian noise, adversarial, Glaze)
  3. Run automated detectors on all image variants
  4. Conduct human user studies on same image set
  5. Analyze performance metrics and compare human vs automated detectors
  6. Test ensemble approach combining Hive and expert artists

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dataset size vs. diversity: The study balances comprehensive coverage of art styles and AI models with practical constraints on data collection.
  - Human vs. automated detection: While humans excel at detecting subtle artistic inconsistencies, automated detectors offer scalability and consistency.
  - Perturbation types: The study includes both benign (JPEG, noise) and malicious (adversarial, Glaze) perturbations to test detector robustness.

- Failure signatures:
  - Hive performance degradation on newer models with less training data (e.g., Firefly)
  - Human experts overfitting to specific AI generator patterns and missing newer generation styles
  - Ensemble approach failing when confidence scores don't accurately reflect decision reliability

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run all automated detectors on a small subset of unperturbed images to verify baseline functionality
  2. Apply Gaussian noise to a few AI-generated images and test Hive's robustness
  3. Have expert artists classify a small set of difficult images to understand their decision process before full-scale study

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective are detection methods at distinguishing between AI-generated images and human art when both use the same artistic style and medium?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the impact of art style on detection accuracy, with professional artists performing better on styles like anime, cartoon, and fantasy, and struggling more with oil/acrylic.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how different artistic styles and mediums affect the detection accuracy of both human and automated methods. It only mentions that Hive and expert artists perform well but make mistakes in different ways.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed study comparing the performance of human and automated detectors across a wide range of artistic styles and mediums, including both traditional and digital art forms.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the limitations of current detectors in identifying AI-generated images that have been intentionally altered or perturbed to evade detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the impact of adversarial perturbations, including Gaussian noise, JPEG compression, and adversarial perturbations on CLIP, on the detection performance of automated detectors.
- Why unresolved: The paper only explores a limited set of perturbations and does not investigate other potential methods of evading detection, such as using multiple AI models to generate different parts of an image or adding human-made imperfections to AI-generated images.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study evaluating the effectiveness of various evasion techniques on both human and automated detectors, including a wide range of perturbations and image manipulation methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the detection methods perform on images that are a combination of human-made and AI-generated elements, such as hybrid images where human artists have painted over AI-generated images?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that hybrid images are included in the dataset and discusses the performance of detectors on these images, but does not provide a detailed analysis of how well different methods handle this type of content.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of detection methods on hybrid images, which are becoming increasingly common as AI-generated content is used as a starting point for human artists.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed study comparing the performance of human and automated detectors on a large dataset of hybrid images, with varying degrees of human and AI-generated elements, to determine the strengths and limitations of each method.

## Limitations
- Small sample size of human artworks (280 total) and limited focus on only 5 AI generation models
- Hive detector's vulnerability to adversarial perturbations raises concerns about real-world deployment
- Expert artist group consisted of only 13 participants, potentially limiting generalizability
- Study did not evaluate computational cost or inference time of different detectors

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Hive outperforms other automated detectors with 98.03% accuracy on unperturbed images
- **Medium Confidence:** Professional artists achieve 75.32% accuracy by focusing on inconsistencies
- **Medium Confidence:** Combined human-automated approaches provide optimal robustness against adversarial attacks

## Next Checks
1. **Scale Validation:** Test the combined Hive-expert ensemble approach on a larger dataset (minimum 1000 images) across all 7 art styles and additional AI generation models to verify scalability of the accuracy gains.

2. **Adversarial Robustness Testing:** Evaluate detector performance against a broader range of adversarial attacks beyond Glaze and CLIP-based perturbations, including black-box attacks and physically realizable perturbations.

3. **Cross-Cultural Validation:** Replicate the human expert study with artists from different cultural backgrounds and artistic traditions to assess whether detection strategies generalize across diverse artistic perspectives.
