# Solving Inverse Problems with Model Mismatch using Untrained Neural Networks within Model-based Architectures

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2403.04847
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04847
- **Reference count:** 14
- **Primary result:** Novel approach handles model mismatch in model-based deep learning methods by introducing untrained neural network residual blocks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of model mismatch in model-based deep learning approaches for inverse problems, including loop unrolling and deep equilibrium models. The authors propose a novel method that introduces an untrained neural network residual block within the model-based architecture to match data consistency in the measurement domain for each instance. By iteratively updating both the forward model and reconstruction jointly, the approach provides solutions to inverse problems while simultaneously estimating the true forward model. The method demonstrates theoretical convergence under mild conditions and shows significant improvements in removing artifacts and preserving details across three distinct applications involving both linear and nonlinear inverse problems.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach integrates untrained neural networks as residual blocks within existing model-based deep learning architectures to handle model mismatch. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed forward models, this technique jointly optimizes the reconstruction and estimates the true forward model during the iterative process. The untrained neural network component learns instance-specific corrections to address discrepancies between assumed and actual measurement models. This architecture enables the system to adapt to variations in the physical forward model while maintaining data consistency through iterative updates. The method is applicable to both linear and nonlinear inverse problems, making it versatile across different imaging modalities and reconstruction scenarios.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates significant improvements in removing artifacts and preserving details across three distinct applications
- Shows theoretical convergence under mild conditions with provable guarantees
- Exhibits robustness to random initialization of residual blocks and performs well with higher iteration counts during evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the flexibility of untrained neural networks to learn instance-specific corrections to the forward model mismatch. By placing the neural network residual block within the measurement domain rather than the image domain, the approach directly addresses data consistency constraints. The iterative joint optimization of forward model and reconstruction allows the system to progressively refine both components, with the untrained network capturing systematic deviations from the assumed model. This architecture enables the method to adapt to variations in the physical forward model while maintaining the structure and interpretability of model-based approaches.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Inverse problems in imaging**: Reconstruction of signals or images from incomplete or indirect measurements; needed to understand the problem domain and challenges of model mismatch.
2. **Model-based deep learning**: Integration of physical models with deep neural networks; needed to appreciate how traditional methods can be enhanced with learned components.
3. **Loop unrolling and deep equilibrium models**: Iterative optimization frameworks that can be unrolled into network architectures; needed to understand the context of existing approaches being improved.
4. **Data consistency**: The requirement that reconstructed solutions must match observed measurements under the forward model; needed to grasp the core constraint being addressed.
5. **Model mismatch**: Discrepancies between assumed and actual forward models; needed to understand the fundamental problem being solved.
6. **Untrained neural networks**: Networks without pre-training that learn from data during inference; needed to appreciate the adaptive correction mechanism employed.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Measurement Domain -> Untrained Neural Network Residual Block -> Forward Model Update -> Reconstruction Update -> Measurement Domain (loop)

**Critical Path:**
1. Initialize reconstruction and forward model estimates
2. Apply untrained neural network residual block to measurement domain
3. Update forward model based on learned corrections
4. Update reconstruction using corrected forward model
5. Iterate until convergence

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Untrained vs. trained networks: Untrained networks provide instance-specific adaptation but may require more iterations for convergence compared to pre-trained alternatives
- Residual block placement: Measurement domain placement directly addresses data consistency but may be less intuitive than image domain corrections
- Joint optimization: Simultaneously updating forward model and reconstruction enables adaptation but increases computational complexity

**Failure Signatures:**
- Convergence to poor local minima when initialization is far from optimal solution
- Overfitting to measurement noise when untrained network has excessive capacity
- Computational inefficiency for high-dimensional problems due to iterative nature

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Synthetic linear inverse problems with known ground truth to validate convergence properties
2. Sparse-view CT reconstruction with varying levels of model mismatch to assess robustness
3. Nonlinear inverse problems such as phase retrieval to demonstrate versatility across problem types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but the work raises several implicit research directions regarding the scalability of the approach to larger problems, the theoretical understanding of convergence rates, and the extension to more complex nonlinear forward models.

## Limitations
- Practical stability across diverse imaging modalities needs further investigation despite theoretical convergence guarantees
- Computational cost of joint optimization may be prohibitive for real-time or resource-constrained applications
- Method's sensitivity to initial parameter choices requires more systematic investigation beyond reported robustness to random initialization

## Confidence
- Convergence under mild conditions: **High** - Supported by theoretical analysis with explicit conditions
- Significant improvement in artifact removal and detail preservation: **Medium** - Demonstrated across three applications but lacks comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art baselines
- Robustness to initialization and higher iterations: **Medium** - Empirical observations need more rigorous statistical validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies varying initialization schemes, learning rates, and network architectures to quantify their impact on reconstruction quality and convergence behavior
2. Implement comprehensive benchmarking against established model-based deep learning approaches (e.g., ADMM-Net, ISTANet) on standardized datasets to objectively assess performance gains
3. Evaluate computational efficiency through memory usage and runtime profiling, particularly for high-dimensional inverse problems in clinical or real-time settings
