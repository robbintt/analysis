# A Survey on Large Language Models for Code Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2406.00515
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00515
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Systematic literature review of LLMs for code generation with taxonomy and empirical comparisons across major benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This survey addresses the growing need for a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review in the rapidly evolving field of large language models for code generation. The paper introduces a taxonomy to categorize recent advancements across multiple dimensions including data curation, model architectures, fine-tuning techniques, and evaluation methods. Through a historical overview and empirical comparisons using HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench benchmarks, the survey highlights progressive enhancements in LLM capabilities while identifying critical challenges and opportunities. The authors also establish a GitHub resource page to continuously document and disseminate the most recent advances in this dynamic field.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review approach to synthesize the state of research on LLMs for code generation. The methodology includes comprehensive coverage of data curation practices, model architecture developments, fine-tuning techniques, and evaluation methodologies. The authors conduct empirical comparisons using established benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench) to demonstrate progressive improvements in LLM capabilities. A GitHub resource page is created as a living document to track ongoing developments in the field.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive taxonomy categorizing advancements in LLMs for code generation across data curation, architectures, fine-tuning, and evaluation
- Historical overview tracing the evolution of LLMs specifically for code generation tasks
- Empirical comparison demonstrating progressive enhancements using HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench benchmarks
- Identification of critical challenges and promising opportunities bridging academic research and practical development

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by systematically organizing the rapidly evolving field of LLMs for code generation into a coherent taxonomy that enables researchers and practitioners to understand the landscape. The empirical comparisons across multiple benchmarks provide quantitative evidence of progress, while the historical overview contextualizes current achievements. The GitHub resource page addresses the field's fast pace by creating a continuously updated reference point.

## Foundational Learning

**Code Generation Task Types**: Understanding different code generation tasks (function completion, docstring generation, code translation) - needed to properly categorize and evaluate LLM performance across diverse scenarios; quick check: verify taxonomy covers all major task types.

**Benchmark Methodologies**: Familiarity with HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench evaluation frameworks - needed to interpret empirical comparisons and assess progress; quick check: compare benchmark characteristics and their applicability to different use cases.

**Model Fine-tuning Strategies**: Knowledge of instruction tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and domain-specific adaptation - needed to understand how LLMs are optimized for code generation; quick check: map fine-tuning techniques to their impact on code-specific performance metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Curation -> Model Architecture -> Fine-tuning Techniques -> Evaluation Methods -> Practical Applications

**Critical Path**: Data curation and model architecture form the foundation, with fine-tuning techniques enabling task-specific optimization, leading to measurable performance through evaluation methods that inform practical applications.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Larger models offer better performance but at higher computational costs; specialized training data improves task-specific performance but may reduce general applicability; evaluation through multiple benchmarks provides comprehensive assessment but requires significant resources.

**Failure Signatures**: Overfitting to training data manifests as poor generalization to unseen code patterns; insufficient fine-tuning leads to degraded performance on domain-specific tasks; benchmark limitations may not capture real-world complexity and edge cases.

**First Experiments**:
1. Reproduce HumanEval benchmark results on a representative LLM to establish baseline performance
2. Compare model performance across different fine-tuning strategies on code-specific tasks
3. Test taxonomy classification on newly emerging LLM architectures not covered in the original survey

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions regarding the sustainability of the GitHub resource page, the generalizability of benchmark results to real-world scenarios, and the long-term relevance of the proposed taxonomy given the field's rapid evolution.

## Limitations
- Benchmark selection may not fully capture real-world code generation complexity
- Taxonomy framework may become outdated quickly due to rapid field evolution
- GitHub resource page sustainability and maintenance protocols remain uncertain

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Historical overview of LLM evolution and general taxonomy framework
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical comparisons across benchmarks and identification of critical challenges
- **Medium confidence**: Assessment of practical applications and research-development gap analysis

## Next Checks
1. Validate the survey's taxonomy against newly emerging LLM architectures and training methodologies published since the survey's completion
2. Replicate empirical comparisons using additional benchmarks and code generation tasks to test generalizability
3. Assess the GitHub resource page's maintenance protocols and update frequency to ensure long-term reliability of documented advances
