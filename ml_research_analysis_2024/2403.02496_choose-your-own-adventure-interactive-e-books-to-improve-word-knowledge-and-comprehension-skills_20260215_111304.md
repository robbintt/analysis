# Choose Your Own Adventure: Interactive E-Books to Improve Word Knowledge and Comprehension Skills

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.02496
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02496
- Reference count: 0
- Students in grades 3-5 who read interactive e-books with embedded comprehension strategies significantly improved word knowledge and science concept understanding compared to pretest scores.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated interactive e-books designed to improve word knowledge and science concept understanding in grades 3-5 students. Two choose-your-own-adventure e-books were developed with embedded comprehension strategies: word learning, summarization, and question generation. Students read the e-books over three weeks with daily 20-minute sessions and weekly whole-class review. Results showed significant improvements in vocabulary and hurricane concept understanding, with greater gains for students who performed well on embedded questions and read the e-books multiple times. Teacher feedback indicated high student engagement, though small-group implementation may be more effective than whole-class sessions.

## Method Summary
The study involved 12 teachers and their students in grades 3-5 who were randomly assigned to one of three strategy versions for each of two e-books. Students completed daily 20-minute reading sessions over three weeks, with weekly whole-class book club reviews. Pre and post assessments measured word knowledge and hurricane concept understanding. Embedded multiple-choice questions with immediate feedback were included in each e-book, and student responses were logged. Hierarchical linear modeling analyzed the effects of strategy versions, baseline skills, and embedded question performance on learning outcomes.

## Key Results
- Students showed significant gains in word knowledge (Dragon's Lair) and hurricane concept understanding (Hurricane!) from pre to post assessment
- No single strategy version (word learning, summarization, or question generation) yielded better outcomes than others
- Performance on embedded multiple-choice questions was associated with greater posttest gains
- Reading the e-books more than once improved outcomes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Interactive e-books with embedded comprehension strategies improve word knowledge and science concept understanding in grades 3-5.
- Mechanism: Embedded multiple-choice questions provide immediate feedback, prompting students to stop, reflect, and repair understanding before proceeding.
- Core assumption: Immediate corrective feedback is necessary for comprehension repair and vocabulary retention.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Students who performed better on embedded questions had greater posttest gains.
  - [section] "Knowing that they answered a question incorrectly, in real time, provided them with an opportunity to go back and employ the targeted comprehension strategies to repair their understanding of complex text."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; nearest papers focus on LLM-based interactive systems but not K-12 comprehension feedback.
- Break condition: If students ignore feedback or skip questions, repair mechanisms fail and gains diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Choose-your-own-adventure format increases engagement and repeated reading, which supports deeper learning.
- Mechanism: Narrative agency and multiple story paths motivate students to reread, exposing them to more vocabulary and concepts.
- Core assumption: Student agency and narrative immersion increase intrinsic motivation to reread.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Reading the e-books more than once also improved outcomes."
  - [section] "On average, for both WKe-Books, students read each story two or more times as they wanted to see what would happen if they picked a different path."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; most corpus papers focus on LLM game generation, not repeated exposure in K-12 reading.
- Break condition: If the story structure forces repeated paths without variation, motivation to reread drops.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Small-group book club reviews enhance learning more than whole-class reviews due to targeted strategy instruction.
- Mechanism: Homogeneous grouping allows focused, repeated exposure to targeted strategies matching baseline skill levels.
- Core assumption: Strategy effectiveness depends on instructional grouping size and tailoring.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Results from this study suggest that while e-books like the WKe-Books can be beneficial in improving students' learning outcomes on their own, effects can be greater with additional support from teachers to reinforce concepts and vocabulary."
  - [section] "Importantly, teachers reported the biggest hurdle in implementing a tool like the WKe-Books is lack of time outside of their regular curriculum."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; corpus focuses on AI tools rather than small-group pedagogy.
- Break condition: If grouping is random or teacher time is insufficient, individualized feedback and strategy practice degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Comprehension strategy instruction (summarization, question generation, contextual analysis).
  - Why needed here: These are the targeted strategies embedded in the WKe-Books; understanding their cognitive basis explains why feedback loops improve learning.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes summarization from question generation as a comprehension repair strategy?

- Concept: Formative assessment via stealth assessment (embedded questions).
  - Why needed here: The WKe-Books use embedded questions as stealth assessment; knowing how stealth assessment informs instruction explains why log data is valuable.
  - Quick check question: How does stealth assessment differ from summative assessment in an e-book context?

- Concept: Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) for nested student-data.
  - Why needed here: Study uses HLM to account for students nested within teachers; understanding HLM clarifies why classroom-level effects matter.
  - Quick check question: Why is HLM preferred over ordinary regression when students are grouped by classroom?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Interactive e-book engine -> Embedded question module -> Feedback system -> User log collector -> Teacher reporting UI
- Critical path: Read chapter -> Trigger comprehension question -> Immediate feedback -> Block progression until correct -> Log attempt count
- Design tradeoffs: Immediate blocking (ensures comprehension but risks frustration) vs. non-blocking (maintains flow but may reduce strategy practice)
- Failure signatures: High retry counts on questions -> possible content confusion; low retry counts -> possible guessing; zero rereads -> low engagement
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary feedback timing (immediate vs. delayed) and measure strategy use accuracy
  2. Compare small-group vs. whole-class review impact on posttest gains
  3. Test adaptive question difficulty based on prior embedded performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the effectiveness of WKe-Books vary based on students' baseline reading proficiency levels, particularly for struggling readers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study found that performance on embedded questions was associated with greater posttest outcomes, but did not examine differential effects based on baseline reading skills.
- Why unresolved: The study did not include a comprehension monitoring task to assess students' calibration, strategy use, or transfer of learned strategies, nor did it analyze differential effects based on baseline reading proficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Including a comprehension monitoring task and analyzing posttest outcomes based on baseline reading proficiency levels would help determine if WKe-Books are more or less effective for struggling readers compared to proficient readers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal frequency and duration of WKe-Book reading sessions for maximizing learning outcomes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study used a specific frequency and duration (20 minutes, three times a week), but did not test different frequencies or durations.
- Why unresolved: The study used a fixed schedule for reading sessions, but did not compare different frequencies or durations to determine the optimal schedule for maximizing learning outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting studies with varying frequencies and durations of WKe-Book reading sessions would help identify the optimal schedule for maximizing learning outcomes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the interactive features of WKe-Books, such as character naming and choose-your-own-adventure format, contribute to student engagement and learning outcomes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study found that students enjoyed the interactive features and read the books multiple times, but did not directly measure the impact of these features on engagement and learning outcomes.
- Why unresolved: The study did not include measures to directly assess the impact of interactive features on student engagement and learning outcomes, relying instead on qualitative feedback from teachers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Including measures to directly assess student engagement and learning outcomes in relation to specific interactive features would help determine their contribution to the effectiveness of WKe-Books.

## Limitations
- Lack of significant differences between strategy versions suggests either ceiling effects or insufficient differentiation in implementation
- Single district study with 12 teachers limits generalizability
- Reliance on teacher-reported engagement and enjoyment introduces potential bias

## Confidence
- High confidence: Interactive e-books with embedded comprehension strategies improve learning outcomes compared to pretest scores
- Medium confidence: Multiple reading sessions and embedded question performance predict greater gains
- Low confidence: Small-group implementation would be more effective than whole-class sessions (based on teacher feedback rather than empirical comparison)

## Next Checks
1. Test alternative feedback timing conditions (immediate vs. delayed) to isolate the causal mechanism between embedded questions and learning gains
2. Conduct a direct experimental comparison of small-group vs. whole-class review sessions to empirically validate teacher predictions about implementation effectiveness
3. Implement adaptive question difficulty that adjusts based on embedded performance to test whether personalized scaffolding improves outcomes beyond uniform implementation
