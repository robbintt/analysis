# Scalable Subsampling Inference for Deep Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.08276
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08276
- Authors: Kejin Wu; Dimitris N. Politis
- Reference count: 6
- This paper develops scalable subsampling inference methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) in regression problems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a theoretically grounded approach to subsampling inference for deep neural networks in regression settings. The authors first improve error bounds for DNN estimators using recent approximation theory results, then develop a computationally efficient "subagged" DNN estimator that achieves faster convergence rates than standard DNN estimators under mild conditions. The framework also addresses the critical gap of constructing reliable confidence and prediction intervals for DNNs, which commonly suffer from undercoverage issues. The proposed methods offer a complete package combining computational efficiency with point estimation accuracy and practically useful uncertainty quantification.

## Method Summary
The method develops scalable subsampling inference by first leveraging recent deep learning approximation theory to improve error bounds for DNN estimators. The core innovation is the "subagged" estimator, which applies subsampling techniques to construct an aggregated DNN estimator that achieves faster convergence rates than standard approaches. The framework includes novel methods for constructing confidence and prediction intervals based on the subagged estimator, addressing the common undercoverage problem in DNN-based intervals. The approach is designed to be computationally efficient while maintaining statistical validity, making it suitable for large-scale applications where traditional inference methods are prohibitively expensive.

## Key Results
- The subagged DNN estimator achieves faster convergence rates than standard DNN estimators under mild conditions
- The proposed methods construct confidence and prediction intervals that address the undercoverage issue common with DNN-based intervals
- Simulation studies demonstrate the complete package of computational efficiency, point estimation accuracy, and practically useful uncertainty quantification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the statistical power of subsampling to reduce variance while maintaining the approximation capabilities of deep neural networks. By applying subsampling techniques to create an aggregated estimator ("subagged"), the approach benefits from both the reduced computational cost of working with smaller subsamples and the improved statistical properties of ensemble methods. The improved error bounds come from recent advances in deep learning approximation theory that allow for tighter characterizations of DNN performance. The confidence and prediction intervals are constructed using the variability inherent in the subsampling process, which provides a natural source of uncertainty quantification that is often missing in standard DNN inference.

## Foundational Learning

**Subsampling Theory** - Why needed: Provides the statistical foundation for reducing computational cost while maintaining inference validity. Quick check: Verify subsampling consistency conditions hold for the data structure.

**Deep Learning Approximation Theory** - Why needed: Enables tighter error bounds for DNN estimators by characterizing their function approximation capabilities. Quick check: Confirm network architecture satisfies the required approximation conditions.

**Bootstrap and Bagging Methods** - Why needed: Forms the basis for constructing aggregated estimators and quantifying uncertainty. Quick check: Ensure the subsampling approach maintains the benefits of bootstrap methods while reducing computation.

**Regression Analysis with Dependent Data** - Why needed: Many practical applications involve correlated data where standard assumptions may not hold. Quick check: Assess robustness of methods when independence assumptions are violated.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Subsampling Engine -> DNN Estimator -> Aggregation Module -> Interval Construction

**Critical Path:** Subsampling Engine → DNN Estimator → Aggregation Module
The subsampling engine creates multiple data subsets, each processed through the DNN estimator, with results aggregated to form the final estimator. This path determines computational efficiency and statistical performance.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The primary tradeoff is between computational efficiency (more aggressive subsampling) and statistical accuracy (maintaining sufficient sample size for each subsample). The choice of aggregation method (simple averaging vs. weighted aggregation) also affects both performance and interpretability.

**Failure Signatures:** Undercoverage in intervals suggests issues with the subsampling scheme or aggregation method. Computational bottlenecks indicate the subsampling ratio is too aggressive. Poor point estimation accuracy may indicate insufficient network capacity or inappropriate network architecture for the problem.

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate subsampling consistency on a simple linear regression problem with known properties
2. Test point estimation accuracy across varying subsampling ratios on benchmark regression datasets
3. Evaluate interval coverage properties on synthetic data with known correlation structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes independent data, which may not hold in time series or spatial applications
- Error bounds rely on specific architectures (residual networks) and may not generalize to other architectures
- Computational savings depend heavily on implementation details and hardware configurations not fully characterized

## Confidence
- Point Estimation and Convergence Rates: Medium - theoretically sound within assumptions but needs broader empirical validation
- Interval Construction Methods: Medium - addresses critical gap but requires more extensive validation across diverse settings
- Computational Efficiency: High - benefits align with established subsampling literature and are straightforward to verify

## Next Checks
1. Implement the subagged DNN approach across multiple architectures (CNNs, transformers, RNNs) and validate the claimed convergence rate improvements on standardized benchmark datasets
2. Conduct coverage probability analysis for the proposed confidence intervals across diverse data-generating processes, including correlated data and high-dimensional settings
3. Benchmark the computational efficiency gains against other scalable inference methods (like dropout-based uncertainty estimation) on large-scale problems
