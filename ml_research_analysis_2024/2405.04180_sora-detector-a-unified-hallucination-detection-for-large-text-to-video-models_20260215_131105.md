# Sora Detector: A Unified Hallucination Detection for Large Text-to-Video Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.04180
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04180
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: 98% precision for overall hallucination detection, with F1 scores of 43.15% for static and 46.16% for dynamic hallucinations

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of hallucination detection in text-to-video (T2V) generation models. The authors propose Sora Detector, a unified framework that leverages keyframe extraction, knowledge graph construction, and multimodal large language models to detect prompt consistency, static, and dynamic hallucinations in generated videos. The method extracts keyframes and constructs static and dynamic knowledge graphs to represent video content, then uses GPT-4 to compare these representations against the original prompt and detect inconsistencies. The authors introduce T2VHaluBench, a benchmark dataset with 59 videos containing various hallucination types.

## Method Summary
The Sora Detector framework consists of three main components: keyframe extraction, knowledge graph construction, and hallucination detection using GPT-4. The system first extracts keyframes from input videos and constructs two types of knowledge graphs - static and dynamic. Static knowledge graphs capture objects, their attributes, and spatial relationships at each keyframe, while dynamic knowledge graphs represent temporal relationships and actions across frames. These knowledge graphs are then converted into textual descriptions that are fed into GPT-4 along with the original prompt. GPT-4 analyzes the consistency between the prompt and video content, identifying various types of hallucinations including prompt inconsistency, static hallucination (wrong object attributes), and dynamic hallucination (wrong object actions).

## Key Results
- 98% precision for overall hallucination detection across the T2VHaluBench dataset
- F1 scores of 43.15% for static hallucination detection and 46.16% for dynamic hallucination detection
- Successful implementation of an automated Sora Detector Agent that generates comprehensive video quality reports
- Effective detection of multiple hallucination types including prompt inconsistency, static hallucination, and dynamic hallucination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by converting complex video content into structured knowledge representations that can be analyzed by LLMs. By extracting keyframes and constructing knowledge graphs, the system creates a semantic representation of video content that preserves both spatial and temporal relationships. The use of GPT-4 allows for sophisticated reasoning about consistency between the prompt and generated content, leveraging the model's understanding of language and visual concepts. The dual knowledge graph approach (static and dynamic) enables comprehensive coverage of both object attributes and temporal actions.

## Foundational Learning

**Knowledge Graph Construction**: Needed for representing complex video content in a structured format that LLMs can process. Quick check: Verify that all objects, attributes, and relationships from keyframes are captured in the graph structure.

**Keyframe Extraction**: Required to reduce computational complexity while preserving essential visual information. Quick check: Ensure extracted keyframes cover the full temporal span of the video and capture key actions.

**Multimodal LLM Analysis**: Essential for comparing textual prompt with video content representation. Quick check: Confirm that GPT-4's responses are consistent across multiple runs with the same input.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Video -> Keyframe Extractor -> Static Knowledge Graph Builder -> Dynamic Knowledge Graph Builder -> GPT-4 Prompt Generator -> GPT-4 Analyzer -> Detection Results

**Critical Path**: The most time-consuming steps are keyframe extraction and knowledge graph construction. These must complete before GPT-4 analysis can begin.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational efficiency for accuracy by using keyframe extraction rather than processing every frame. The choice of GPT-4 provides strong reasoning capability but introduces dependency on external API availability and cost.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include missing objects in knowledge graphs due to occlusion, incorrect temporal relationship extraction, and GPT-4 misinterpretation of complex scenes.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test with simple videos containing one object and one action to validate basic functionality
2. Compare detection results with and without temporal relationship encoding
3. Evaluate sensitivity to keyframe extraction interval settings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- T2VHaluBench dataset contains only 59 videos, which is relatively small for training and evaluation purposes
- Benchmark focuses on English prompts and simple scenarios, limiting generalizability to multilingual or complex contexts
- Knowledge graph construction may miss nuanced semantic relationships between objects and actions
- Reliance on GPT-4 introduces potential variability in detection results across different model versions or parameter settings

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The overall hallucination detection pipeline (keyframe extraction + knowledge graph construction + LLM comparison) is methodologically sound and demonstrates strong performance metrics (98% precision for overall detection).

**Medium Confidence**: The specific detection of static and dynamic hallucination subtypes shows moderate performance (F1 scores around 43-46%), suggesting the approach works but may benefit from refinement for fine-grained classification.

**Medium Confidence**: The Sora Detector Agent's automated report generation capability is promising but would benefit from user studies to validate its practical utility and interpretability for real-world users.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Expansion and Diversity Testing**: Evaluate the method on a larger, more diverse dataset including multilingual prompts, complex scenes with multiple interacting objects, and videos from different T2V models beyond Sora.

2. **Knowledge Graph Robustness Validation**: Conduct ablation studies removing specific components of the knowledge graph construction (e.g., temporal relationships, attribute encoding) to quantify their individual contributions to detection accuracy.

3. **Real-world Deployment Assessment**: Deploy the Sora Detector Agent in a user study with content creators and consumers to measure its practical effectiveness, user satisfaction, and identify any usability issues not captured in controlled benchmark evaluations.
