# End-to-End Neuro-Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with Textual Explanations
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.12451
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12451
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: INSIGHT achieves comparable performance to neural baselines while providing interpretable language explanations for policy decisions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces INSIGHT, a neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning framework that jointly learns structured state representations and symbolic policies from visual observations. The framework addresses key limitations of previous NS-RL approaches by distilling vision foundation models into an efficient perception module that refines object coordinates with reward signals during policy learning. INSIGHT incorporates a neural guidance scheme to improve exploration and policy expressiveness, while also generating natural language explanations for learned policies using large language models. Experiments on nine Atari tasks demonstrate that INSIGHT outperforms existing NS-RL baselines and matches the performance of neural baselines.

## Method Summary
INSIGHT operates through a three-stage training process: first, it distills a pre-trained vision foundation model to obtain object coordinates; second, it uses these coordinates to construct relational graphs that serve as structured state representations; and third, it trains a symbolic policy using reinforcement learning while refining the coordinate predictions with reward signals. The framework employs a neural guidance scheme that combines symbolic and neural policies to balance exploration and exploitation. For interpretability, INSIGHT uses a language model to generate natural language explanations that describe both general policy patterns and specific decision rationales, making the learned behaviors more accessible to non-expert users.

## Key Results
- INSIGHT outperforms existing NS-RL baselines by 3-5% on average across nine Atari tasks
- Performance matches that of pure neural baseline approaches while providing structured representations
- Language explanations effectively convey policy patterns and decision rationales with minor factual errors
- The coordinate refinement mechanism shows measurable improvement in policy-relevant object localization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by bridging the gap between end-to-end neural learning and interpretable symbolic reasoning. By distilling vision foundation models rather than training from scratch, INSIGHT achieves computational efficiency while maintaining high-quality object detection. The joint learning of coordinates and policy allows the system to focus refinement efforts on objects that matter for decision-making, guided by actual reward signals. The neural guidance scheme prevents the symbolic policy from getting stuck in suboptimal behaviors by allowing occasional neural policy interventions during exploration.

## Foundational Learning
- Vision foundation models: Pre-trained models for object detection and localization provide the initial perception capability that INSIGHT builds upon
- Relational graph construction: Structured state representations capture spatial relationships between objects, enabling symbolic reasoning about game states
- Neuro-symbolic policy learning: Joint optimization of perception and decision-making allows the system to focus on policy-relevant features while maintaining interpretability

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Vision Foundation Model -> Coordinate Refiner -> Relational Graph Builder -> Symbolic Policy -> Language Explanation Generator
- Critical path: Visual input flows through the perception module, where object coordinates are predicted and refined, then constructed into relational graphs that inform the symbolic policy decisions, with explanations generated as a post-processing step
- Design tradeoffs: The framework trades some performance potential for interpretability by constraining policies to symbolic rules, but compensates through neural guidance and targeted coordinate refinement
- Failure signatures: Poor performance may stem from inaccurate object detection by the foundation model, inadequate relational graph construction, or the symbolic policy's inability to capture complex behaviors
- First experiments: 1) Ablation study removing coordinate refinement to measure its impact on performance, 2) Comparison of explanation quality with and without reward-guided refinement, 3) Analysis of neural guidance contribution by training with symbolic policy only

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on pre-trained vision foundation models limits applicability to domains without suitable pre-trained models
- Modest performance improvement over existing NS-RL approaches (3-5%) suggests incremental rather than revolutionary advances
- Language explanations occasionally contain factual errors, though frequency and severity are not quantified

## Confidence
- High: Technical implementation of the INSIGHT framework and its core neuro-symbolic architecture
- Medium: Empirical performance claims relative to baselines
- Medium: Interpretability benefits of language explanations
- Low: Robustness and error rates of generated language explanations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic evaluation of language explanation accuracy across diverse Atari tasks, quantifying factual error rates and identifying failure modes
2. Test framework performance on domains without pre-trained vision models to assess generalizability limitations
3. Compare coordinate refinement benefits against alternative perception architectures to isolate the contribution of this specific design choice
