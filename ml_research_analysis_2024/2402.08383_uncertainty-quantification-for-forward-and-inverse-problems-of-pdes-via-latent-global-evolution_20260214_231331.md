# Uncertainty Quantification for Forward and Inverse Problems of PDEs via Latent Global Evolution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.08383
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08383
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: LE-PDE-UQ achieves better calibration metrics (Miscalibration Area 0.0142 vs 0.0602 for best baseline) while maintaining competitive prediction accuracy on 2D Navier-Stokes turbulent flows

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of quantifying prediction uncertainty in deep learning-based surrogate models for time-dependent PDEs. The proposed Latent Evolution of PDEs with Uncertainty Quantification (LE-PDE-UQ) framework evolves system states and uncertainty estimates within a learned latent space, using separate latent vectors for state and uncertainty that are decoded to produce predictions and uncertainty estimates respectively. LE-PDE-UQ excels at propagating uncertainty through long autoregressive rollouts in latent space, significantly improving efficiency over input-space methods. Extensive experiments on turbulent 2D Navier-Stokes flows demonstrate superior uncertainty quantification performance compared to strong baselines including deep ensembles, Bayesian neural network layers, and dropout methods.

## Method Summary
LE-PDE-UQ learns a latent evolution model that predicts both system states and their uncertainties by evolving separate latent vectors for state and uncertainty. The framework uses temporal bundling to encode multiple consecutive time steps into single latent vectors, reducing computational burden during autoregressive uncertainty propagation. During inference, the method employs a deep ensemble wrapper to improve uncertainty quantification. The model is trained on a 2D Navier-Stokes turbulent flow dataset using a combined objective function with negative log-likelihood, reconstruction, and long-term consistency losses. The latent space compression enables efficient uncertainty propagation compared to input-space methods while maintaining competitive prediction accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieves significantly better uncertainty calibration (MA: 0.0142) compared to deep ensembles (MA: 0.0602) on 2D Navier-Stokes turbulent flows
- Maintains competitive prediction accuracy with relative L2 loss of 0.00232 compared to best baseline at 0.00242
- Demonstrates efficient uncertainty propagation through long autoregressive rollouts in latent space, avoiding the exponential computational cost of input-space methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LE-PDE-UQ's latent evolution model effectively propagates uncertainty through long autoregressive rollouts
- Mechanism: The latent evolution model g predicts both a state latent vector zt+1 and an uncertainty latent vector zt+1σ, where the latter depends on the previous state and uncertainty (zt, ztσ). This creates a feedback loop that allows uncertainty to accumulate naturally as the latent dynamics evolve.
- Core assumption: Uncertainty can be meaningfully represented and propagated in the learned latent space
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LE-PDE-UQ leverages latent vectors within a latent space to evolve both the system's state and its corresponding uncertainty estimation"
  - [section]: "Note that the latent vector zt+1 only depends on zt, zp, while the latent uncertainty vector depends on zt, zp, and the latent uncertainty vector at ztσ previous time step, modeling the propagation of uncertainty in latent space"
- Break condition: If the latent space fails to capture the relevant dynamics or if uncertainty cannot be compressed into the latent representation

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Decoding separate latent vectors for state and uncertainty provides accurate uncertainty quantification
- Mechanism: The decoder hµ maps the state latent vector to predicted states, while a separate decoder hσ maps the uncertainty latent vector to uncertainty estimates. This architectural separation allows the model to learn distinct representations for prediction and uncertainty.
- Core assumption: State and uncertainty can be disentangled in the latent space and decoded independently
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The latent vectors are decoded to provide predictions for the system's state as well as estimates of its uncertainty"
  - [section]: "uncertainty decoder hσ: Rdz → U that maps the latent uncertainty vector ztσ ∈ Rdz back to the predicted uncertainty U tσ"
- Break condition: If state and uncertainty are inherently entangled in the data, preventing clean separation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Latent space compression improves uncertainty propagation efficiency compared to input space methods
- Mechanism: By encoding high-dimensional states into lower-dimensional latent vectors, LE-PDE-UQ reduces the computational burden of autoregressive uncertainty propagation. This enables longer rollout horizons without the exponential computational cost seen in input space methods.
- Core assumption: The compressed latent representation retains sufficient information for accurate uncertainty propagation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "significantly improving efficiency over input-space methods"
  - [section]: "Compared to autoregressive rollout in input space, LE-PDE-UQ can significantly improve efficiency with a much smaller dimension of zt ∈ Rdz compared to U t ∈ U"
- Break condition: If critical information is lost during compression, leading to degraded uncertainty estimates

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal bundling in sequential data processing
  - Why needed here: The method uses temporal bundling to encode multiple consecutive time steps into single latent vectors, improving representation efficiency and capturing temporal dependencies
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of temporal bundling in LE-PDE-UQ and how does it affect the dimensionality of the latent space?

- Concept: Uncertainty propagation in latent dynamical systems
  - Why needed here: Understanding how uncertainty evolves through latent dynamical systems is crucial for interpreting LE-PDE-UQ's performance and limitations
  - Quick check question: How does LE-PDE-UQ's approach to uncertainty propagation differ from traditional input-space methods?

- Concept: Calibration metrics for uncertainty quantification
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates uncertainty quality using miscalibration area, mean absolute calibration error, and root mean squared calibration error, requiring understanding of what these metrics measure
  - Quick check question: What does a low miscalibration area indicate about a model's uncertainty estimates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Dynamic encoder (q): Maps input states to latent state and uncertainty vectors
  - Static encoder (r): Maps system parameters to static latent embedding (optional)
  - Latent evolution model (g): Evolves both state and uncertainty in latent space
  - Decoder (hµ): Maps state latent vector to predicted states
  - Uncertainty decoder (hσ): Maps uncertainty latent vector to uncertainty estimates
  - Deep Ensemble wrapper: Improves uncertainty quantification during inference

- Critical path: q → g → hµ/hσ (forward prediction), with inverse optimization adding r and BPTT through g

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Compression vs. information retention: Smaller latent dimension improves efficiency but risks losing important information
  - Separate vs. joint decoding: Separate decoders for state and uncertainty allow specialization but increase model complexity
  - Deterministic vs. probabilistic latent evolution: The model uses deterministic latent evolution with separate uncertainty encoding rather than probabilistic latent dynamics

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor calibration despite low prediction error suggests the uncertainty latent vector is not properly capturing uncertainty
  - Degraded performance on longer rollout horizons indicates uncertainty propagation is breaking down
  - Similar state and uncertainty predictions suggest the decoders are not learning distinct representations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with and without the uncertainty latent vector (ztσ) to verify its contribution to calibration
  2. Compare autoregressive rollout vs. teacher forcing to isolate the effect of uncertainty propagation
  3. Test with different latent dimensionalities to find the optimal compression level for this problem

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does LE-PDE-UQ perform on high-dimensional PDE problems with complex geometries compared to its performance on the 2D Navier-Stokes case?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates LE-PDE-UQ on 2D Navier-Stokes turbulent flow but acknowledges PDE applications span to higher dimensions and complex geometries like weather forecasting and molecular modeling
- Why unresolved: The experiments are limited to 2D Navier-Stokes flow; no validation on higher-dimensional problems or complex geometries is provided
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing LE-PDE-UQ performance on 3D PDEs, problems with irregular domains, or real-world applications like weather prediction or molecular dynamics simulations

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the computational overhead of LE-PDE-UQ compared to non-uncertainty-aware surrogate models for PDE solving?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions speedups of 10-1000 times over traditional solvers but doesn't compare computational cost between LE-PDE-UQ and simpler surrogate models without uncertainty quantification
- Why unresolved: While accuracy metrics are provided, runtime comparisons between uncertainty-aware and non-uncertainty-aware approaches are absent
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic benchmarking of inference time, memory usage, and training time comparing LE-PDE-UQ against standard deep learning PDE solvers without uncertainty quantification

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is LE-PDE-UQ to hyperparameter choices such as latent space dimension, temporal bundling length, and ensemble size?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses specific hyperparameter settings (e.g., latent dimension dz, bundling length S) but doesn't explore sensitivity to these choices or provide guidelines for hyperparameter selection
- Why unresolved: No ablation studies or sensitivity analysis are presented to show how performance varies with different hyperparameter configurations
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive ablation studies varying each key hyperparameter and analyzing the impact on both uncertainty quantification quality and prediction accuracy across different problem types

## Limitations
- The method's performance on highly chaotic systems or those with discontinuities remains untested
- The reliance on autoregressive rollout, while more efficient than input-space methods, still faces compounding error issues over long horizons
- The experimental validation is limited to a single 2D Navier-Stokes dataset, raising questions about generalizability to other PDE systems

## Confidence
- Technical approach and experimental design: High confidence
- Claims about efficiency improvements relative to input-space methods: Medium confidence (limited quantitative comparison)
- Generalization claims: Medium confidence (single dataset evaluation)

## Next Checks
1. Test LE-PDE-UQ on additional PDE systems (e.g., 1D Burgers' equation, 3D Navier-Stokes) to assess generalizability across different dynamical regimes
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing latent space dimensionality vs. uncertainty quantification quality to identify optimal compression levels
3. Perform runtime benchmarking against input-space autoregressive methods on equivalent hardware to quantify the claimed efficiency gains empirically
