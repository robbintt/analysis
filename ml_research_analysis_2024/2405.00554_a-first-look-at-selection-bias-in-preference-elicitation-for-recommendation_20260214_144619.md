# A First Look at Selection Bias in Preference Elicitation for Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.00554
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00554
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Selection bias in preference elicitation propagates to item recommendations and can be effectively mitigated using inverse propensity scoring

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first study on selection bias in preference elicitation (PE) for recommendation systems, addressing a critical gap in conversational recommender systems. The authors identify that PE interactions suffer from severe selection bias due to their extreme sparsity, yet this problem has been overlooked in previous research. To investigate this, they propose a simulation framework that generates synthetic topic-based PE data from existing recommendation datasets. Experimental results on both semi-synthetic (Yahoo! R3) and fully-synthetic datasets show that ignoring selection bias leads to suboptimal performance, while IPS-based debiasing consistently improves recommendation quality with significant improvements over baselines (p < 0.01).

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a simulation framework to generate synthetic topic-based PE data from existing recommendation datasets. The debiasing method uses inverse propensity scoring (IPS) to reweight observed ratings based on their selection probabilities. The IPS-modified loss function creates an unbiased estimate of the ideal loss, which is then used for training matrix factorization models. The method is evaluated against naive matrix factorization and ExpoMF baselines using MAE, MSE, and NDCG metrics on both semi-synthetic (Yahoo! R3) and fully-synthetic datasets with different cluster settings.

## Key Results
- Selection bias in PE propagates to downstream item recommendations, leading to suboptimal performance
- IPS-based debiasing consistently improves recommendation quality, with significant improvements over baselines (p < 0.01)
- On Yahoo! R3, IPS reduced MAE by ~36% and MSE by ~58% across different cluster settings
- On synthetic data, IPS showed consistent improvements for higher bias levels (α ≥ 0.5), with NDCG gains up to 10%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Selection bias in preference elicitation propagates to downstream item recommendations, leading to suboptimal performance.
- Mechanism: When users interact only with popular or easily accessible topics during PE, the system learns a skewed representation of user preferences. This biased preference model is then used for item recommendation, amplifying the overrepresentation of popular items and underrepresenting niche items.
- Core assumption: The PE stage serves as the foundation for user preference modeling, and errors introduced here cascade to subsequent recommendation tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ignoring the effect of selection bias early in preference elicitation can lead to an exacerbation of overrepresentation in subsequent item recommendations"
  - [section] "Similar to how selection bias in item ratings results in a biased view over topic preferences, it seems likely that selection bias in a PE stage could negatively affect the subsequent recommendation stage."
- Break condition: If the PE stage is bypassed entirely or if the recommendation stage uses an independent, unbiased preference model, the propagation effect would be eliminated.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Inverse propensity scoring (IPS) can effectively debias preference elicitation interactions by reweighting observed ratings based on their selection probabilities.
- Mechanism: IPS assigns higher weights to underrepresented (less frequently observed) user-topic interactions and lower weights to overrepresented ones. This rebalancing creates an unbiased estimate of the true user preference distribution, which improves subsequent recommendation quality.
- Core assumption: The propensity scores (probability of observation) can be accurately estimated or approximated, and the IPS estimator is unbiased when these scores are known.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To debias the loss function in Eq. 2, we apply inverse propensity scoring (IPS) [8, 18, 19], where the propensity value 𝜌𝑢,𝑡 = 𝑝 (𝑂𝑢,𝑡 = 1) is used as a weight in the loss function."
  - [section] "The modified Lips is an unbiased estimate of the ideal-loss defined in Eq. 1 [18, 19], i.e., E𝑂 [Lips] = Lideal."
- Break condition: If propensity scores are poorly estimated or if the variance of the IPS estimator becomes too high (due to very low propensity values), the debiasing effect may be negated or even worsen performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The extreme sparsity of preference elicitation interactions makes them more susceptible to selection bias than natural user-item interactions.
- Mechanism: In PE, users are typically asked to rate or select from a limited set of topics, often determined by system constraints or user fatigue. This results in very few observed interactions per user-topic pair, amplifying the impact of any selection bias present in the data collection process.
- Core assumption: The number of observed PE interactions is significantly lower than typical user-item interactions in standard recommendation datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Despite the fact that the extreme sparsity of preference elicitation interactions make them severely more prone to selection bias than natural interactions, the effect of selection bias in preference elicitation on the resulting recommendations has not been studied yet."
  - [section] "Importantly, selection bias on the item level propagates to the topic level; for example, Figure 1 demonstrates the popularity distribution over movie genres in the MovieLens dataset."
- Break condition: If PE interactions become as dense as regular user-item interactions (e.g., through extensive probing or incentivized participation), the relative impact of selection bias would diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding selection bias in recommender systems
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on existing research about selection bias in item ratings and extends it to the PE stage, so understanding the baseline problem is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between selection bias in item ratings and in preference elicitation interactions?

- Concept: Inverse propensity scoring (IPS) for debiasing
  - Why needed here: IPS is the core debiasing method used in the experiments, and understanding how it works is critical to interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: How does IPS transform a biased estimator into an unbiased one, and what are the potential downsides of this approach?

- Concept: Simulation of PE data from existing recommendation datasets
  - Why needed here: Since no real PE datasets exist, the paper proposes a simulation method. Understanding this method is key to evaluating the validity of the experimental results.
  - Quick check question: What are the main steps in the proposed simulation method, and what assumptions does it make about the relationship between item ratings and topic preferences?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Preference Elicitation (PE) stage -> Debiasing module -> Item recommendation stage
- Critical path: PE stage → Debiasing module → Item recommendation stage
  - The PE stage is the primary source of bias, the debiasing module attempts to correct it, and the item recommendation stage is the downstream task affected by bias.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using IPS introduces higher variance in the estimator, which may require more sophisticated variance reduction techniques.
  - Simulating PE data allows for controlled experiments but may not fully capture the nuances of real user behavior in PE scenarios.
  - Clustering items into topics for PE may oversimplify the true structure of user preferences.
- Failure signatures:
  - If the debiasing module is omitted or misconfigured, the item recommendation stage will exhibit strong popularity bias and poor coverage of niche items.
  - If the simulation engine produces unrealistic PE data (e.g., too dense or too sparse), the experimental results may not generalize to real-world settings.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the simulation engine on a standard recommendation dataset (e.g., MovieLens) and inspect the resulting PE data for signs of selection bias.
  2. Implement the naive PE stage (without debiasing) and measure the bias propagation to item recommendations using metrics like MAE, MSE, and NDCG.
  3. Implement the IPS-based debiasing method and compare its performance to the naive approach on the same metrics, verifying the claimed improvements.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the specific effects of selection bias in preference elicitation on downstream recommendation quality beyond what has been observed in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "ignoring the effect of selection bias early in preference elicitation can lead to an exacerbation of overrepresentation in subsequent item recommendations"
- Why unresolved: The study uses simulation methods and only evaluates on two datasets (Yahoo! R3 and fully-synthetic), which may not capture all real-world scenarios. The extent and nature of bias propagation in diverse recommendation settings remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Large-scale empirical studies using real conversational recommender system logs with explicit preference elicitation stages, comparing recommendation quality with and without debiasing across multiple domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can joint debiasing methods be designed to simultaneously address selection bias in both the preference elicitation stage and the subsequent item recommendation stage?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "As part of future work, we propose a joint debiasing method for the PE stage and the corresponding downstream tasks"
- Why unresolved: The paper only adapts existing debiasing methods (like IPS) from item recommendation to the PE stage, without considering how bias in PE might interact with bias in the recommendation stage. The optimal approach for joint optimization remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of models that jointly optimize for unbiased preference elicitation and unbiased item recommendation, comparing performance against sequential debiasing approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the severity of selection bias in preference elicitation vary across different types of conversational recommender systems (e.g., question-based vs. natural language systems)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study focuses on topic-level preference elicitation for question-based conversational recommender systems, but acknowledges this is just one form of CRS
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate whether selection bias manifests differently in other CRS architectures, such as systems using natural language understanding for preference elicitation. The generality of the findings across CRS types is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of selection bias in multiple CRS architectures, measuring bias levels and debiasing effectiveness across different elicitation methods.

## Limitations

- The study relies entirely on synthetic PE data, as no real PE datasets exist, which may not fully capture real user behavior
- Propensity score estimation uses logistic regression with item covariates, but the exact covariate features and estimation quality are not specified
- The evaluation focuses primarily on rating prediction accuracy and ranking metrics, but does not investigate other important aspects like diversity, novelty, or user satisfaction

## Confidence

- High confidence: Selection bias exists in PE and affects downstream recommendations (well-established from related work)
- Medium confidence: IPS debiasing effectively mitigates this bias (supported by experiments but limited to synthetic data)
- Medium confidence: The proposed simulation methodology accurately represents real PE scenarios (reasonable assumptions but unverified)

## Next Checks

1. Test IPS debiasing on real-world conversational recommendation datasets (where available) to validate synthetic simulation results
2. Implement alternative propensity estimation methods (e.g., deep learning approaches) and compare their effectiveness against the logistic regression baseline
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each debiasing component and identify potential variance reduction techniques for high-stakes IPS applications
