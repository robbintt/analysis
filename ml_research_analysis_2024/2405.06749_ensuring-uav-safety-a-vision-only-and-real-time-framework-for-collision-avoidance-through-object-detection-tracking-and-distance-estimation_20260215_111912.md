# Ensuring UAV Safety: A Vision-only and Real-time Framework for Collision Avoidance Through Object Detection, Tracking, and Distance Estimation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2405.06749
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06749
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Deep-learning framework for real-time vision-only collision avoidance of non-cooperative UAVs using monocular cameras

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a deep-learning framework for real-time vision-only collision avoidance of non-cooperative aerial vehicles using monocular cameras. The system integrates detection, tracking, and depth estimation modules to enable sense-and-avoid capabilities. The depth estimation is formulated as an image-to-image translation problem using a lightweight encoder-decoder network, trained on a dataset derived from the AOT dataset with distance information. The proposed method is evaluated on the AOT dataset, achieving satisfactory performance in estimating the distance of detected objects.

## Method Summary
The framework combines a detection model, a tracking module, and a depth estimation network to provide real-time collision avoidance capabilities. The depth estimation module is trained using synthetic data derived from the AOT dataset, converting the problem into an image-to-image translation task. The lightweight encoder-decoder architecture enables real-time performance while maintaining sufficient accuracy for distance estimation. The depth estimation model is integrated into the NEFELI detection and tracking pipeline, allowing the system to classify detected objects into distance categories for collision avoidance decision-making.

## Key Results
- Achieved satisfactory performance in estimating distances of detected objects on the AOT dataset
- Successfully integrated depth estimation model into NEFELI detection and tracking pipeline
- Demonstrated promising results in classifying detected objects into distance categories
- Lightweight architecture enables real-time processing capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the complementary strengths of object detection, tracking, and depth estimation to create a comprehensive collision avoidance system. The image-to-image translation approach for depth estimation allows the network to learn spatial relationships and distance cues directly from monocular images, bypassing the need for stereo cameras or LiDAR sensors. By training on synthetic data with known distance information, the model can learn to estimate depth in a controlled environment before deployment.

## Foundational Learning
- **Monocular depth estimation:** Why needed - to determine distances using single camera input for UAV collision avoidance; Quick check - compare estimated depths against ground truth in controlled scenarios
- **Image-to-image translation:** Why needed - to transform raw images into depth maps using learned spatial relationships; Quick check - validate translation quality on diverse test images
- **Real-time object tracking:** Why needed - to maintain consistent identification of moving objects across frames; Quick check - measure tracking accuracy under varying speeds and occlusion
- **Lightweight neural network design:** Why needed - to enable processing on embedded UAV hardware; Quick check - benchmark inference time on target hardware

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Camera input → Detection network → Tracking module → Depth estimation network → Distance classification → Collision avoidance decision
- **Critical path:** Detection → Tracking → Depth estimation → Classification
- **Design tradeoffs:** Monocular vs stereo vision (cost/complexity vs accuracy), synthetic vs real training data (control vs generalization), lightweight vs heavy models (speed vs accuracy)
- **Failure signatures:** Depth estimation errors in textureless regions, tracking failures with rapid object movement, detection misses in low-light conditions
- **First experiments:** 1) Measure inference latency on target hardware, 2) Validate depth accuracy against ground truth in controlled environment, 3) Test tracking robustness with multiple moving objects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Depth estimation relies on relatively small synthetic training dataset, limiting real-world generalization
- Monocular approach faces inherent accuracy challenges compared to stereo/LiDAR methods
- Performance in complex environments with multiple moving obstacles and varying lighting conditions remains unvalidated
- Classification into distance categories introduces uncertainty in close-proximity avoidance scenarios
- Real-time performance on embedded hardware not thoroughly tested

## Confidence
- Vision-only detection and tracking: **High**
- Depth estimation via image-to-image translation: **Medium**
- Real-time performance on embedded systems: **Low**
- Integration effectiveness in avoidance scenarios: **Medium**

## Next Checks
1. Conduct hardware-in-the-loop testing on embedded UAV platforms to measure actual processing latency and frame rates
2. Evaluate system performance in real-world outdoor environments with varying lighting, weather, and background conditions
3. Compare distance estimation accuracy against ground truth measurements using calibrated LiDAR or stereo systems in controlled scenarios
