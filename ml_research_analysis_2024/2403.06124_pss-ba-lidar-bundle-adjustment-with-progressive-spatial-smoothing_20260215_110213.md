# PSS-BA: LiDAR Bundle Adjustment with Progressive Spatial Smoothing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.06124
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06124
- Authors: Jianping Li; Thien-Minh Nguyen; Shenghai Yuan; Lihua Xie
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Achieves 0.02-0.03 m APE on simulation datasets and 26.7% reduction in voxel size on real-world datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitations of traditional LiDAR bundle adjustment methods that rely heavily on planar features, which fail in environments with complex geometries or large initial pose errors. The proposed PSS-BA method introduces progressive spatial smoothing to extract polynomial surface constraints from noisy point clouds, enabling more accurate 3D modeling in challenging environments. The approach combines a spatial smoothing module with a pose adjustment module that works iteratively to correct poses using multi-scale smoothing kernels. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in both simulated and real-world scenarios, particularly in environments with low planar structures.

## Method Summary
PSS-BA introduces a novel approach to LiDAR bundle adjustment by incorporating progressive spatial smoothing that extracts polynomial surface constraints from point clouds. The method operates through two main components: a spatial smoothing module that uses multi-scale smoothing kernels to obtain robust surface constraints from noisy point clouds, and a pose adjustment module that progressively corrects initial pose estimates using these extracted constraints. This combination allows the system to handle complex environments where traditional planar-based methods struggle, particularly in scenes with curved surfaces or large initial pose errors. The progressive nature of the adjustment allows for iterative refinement, improving accuracy as the algorithm converges.

## Key Results
- Achieves average APE of 0.02-0.03 m on simulation datasets
- Reduces average occupancy voxel size by 26.7% on real-world datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Demonstrates superior performance in environments with low planar structures where traditional methods fail
- Shows robustness to large initial pose errors through progressive correction mechanism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by addressing the fundamental limitation of traditional LiDAR BA methods that rely on planar features. By introducing polynomial surface constraints extracted through progressive spatial smoothing, PSS-BA can handle complex geometries that lack sufficient planar structures. The multi-scale smoothing kernels provide robustness against noise while preserving surface features, and the progressive adjustment mechanism allows for gradual correction of pose errors without requiring precise initial estimates. This combination enables accurate 3D modeling in challenging environments where traditional approaches would fail or produce suboptimal results.

## Foundational Learning
- **Polynomial surface constraints**: Mathematical representation of curved surfaces extracted from point clouds; needed to handle non-planar geometries; quick check: verify constraint accuracy against ground truth surfaces
- **Multi-scale smoothing kernels**: Processing technique that applies smoothing at multiple spatial scales; needed to balance noise reduction with feature preservation; quick check: test different kernel sizes for optimal performance
- **Progressive pose adjustment**: Iterative refinement approach that gradually corrects pose estimates; needed to handle large initial errors; quick check: monitor convergence behavior across iterations
- **Spatial smoothing**: Noise reduction technique applied to point cloud data; needed to extract reliable surface constraints from noisy measurements; quick check: measure improvement in surface quality metrics
- **Surface constraint extraction**: Process of deriving geometric constraints from point cloud data; needed as alternative to planar feature detection; quick check: validate extracted constraints against known geometries
- **Bundle adjustment**: Optimization framework for simultaneous refinement of poses and structure; needed as the underlying optimization framework; quick check: verify convergence and accuracy improvements

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Point Cloud Input -> Spatial Smoothing Module -> Surface Constraint Extraction -> Pose Adjustment Module -> Refined Poses -> Output

**Critical Path**: The core workflow follows: noisy point cloud → multi-scale smoothing → polynomial surface extraction → progressive pose adjustment → converged solution. The spatial smoothing module and pose adjustment module form the critical components that differentiate PSS-BA from traditional approaches.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity (due to multi-scale processing and iterative refinement) for improved accuracy in complex environments. The progressive approach sacrifices some speed for robustness to poor initial conditions, while the polynomial surface modeling requires more sophisticated processing than simple planar extraction.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when surface constraints become unreliable due to extreme noise levels, when the progressive adjustment cannot converge due to very large initial errors, or when the polynomial fitting fails to capture the true surface geometry. The system may also struggle with extremely sparse point clouds that lack sufficient geometric information.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test on synthetic datasets with varying levels of planar vs. curved surfaces to quantify performance differences
2. Evaluate convergence behavior with systematically degraded initial pose estimates
3. Measure computational overhead compared to traditional BA methods across different point cloud densities
