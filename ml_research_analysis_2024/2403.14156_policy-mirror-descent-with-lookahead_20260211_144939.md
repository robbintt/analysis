# Policy Mirror Descent with Lookahead

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.14156
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14156
- Authors: Kimon Protopapas; Anas Barakat
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces h-PMD algorithm with multi-step greedy policy improvement and faster γh-linear convergence rates

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel generalization of Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) algorithms through the introduction of lookahead depth h, resulting in h-PMD. The method extends standard PMD by incorporating multi-step greedy policy improvement, which generalizes Policy Iteration (PI) and enjoys faster γh-linear convergence rates. The authors establish both exact and inexact sample complexity bounds, showing improved dependence on the effective horizon 1-γ. The work also extends h-PMD to linear function approximation, where sample complexity depends on feature space dimension rather than state space size. Experiments on DeepSea and continuous control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of lookahead in improving convergence rates, connecting PMD to successful tree search methods like AlphaZero.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces h-PMD, a novel class of Policy Mirror Descent algorithms that incorporate multi-step greedy policy improvement with lookahead depth h. The method generalizes standard PMD (which corresponds to h=1) and enjoys faster γh-linear convergence rates compared to existing PMD and PI algorithms. The authors establish sample complexity bounds for both exact and inexact settings, showing improved dependence on the effective horizon 1-γ. The method is extended to linear function approximation, where the sample complexity depends on the feature space dimension rather than the state space size. Experiments on DeepSea and continuous control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of lookahead in improving convergence rates.

## Key Results
- Introduces h-PMD with multi-step greedy policy improvement and lookahead depth h
- Establishes faster γh-linear convergence rates compared to standard PMD and PI algorithms
- Shows improved sample complexity bounds with dependence on effective horizon 1-γ
- Extends method to linear function approximation with complexity depending on feature dimension
- Demonstrates effectiveness through DeepSea and continuous control experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The lookahead mechanism in h-PMD enables multi-step greedy policy improvement by simulating future states and actions before updating the current policy. This creates a tree search structure where the algorithm can evaluate longer-term consequences of policy decisions before committing to updates. The γh-linear convergence rate improvement comes from the fact that each iteration effectively jumps h steps ahead in the value function space, reducing the number of iterations needed to converge. The mirror descent framework ensures stability while the lookahead provides more informed gradient estimates.

## Foundational Learning

**Mirror Descent in RL**: A first-order optimization method that updates policies by following the negative gradient in a dual space. Needed because standard gradient descent can be unstable in policy space; quick check: verify KL divergence or other divergence measure is properly defined.

**Bellman Operator and γ-horizon**: The Bellman operator T^γh represents h-step lookahead with discount factor γ. Understanding this is crucial for grasping how lookahead improves convergence; quick check: confirm that T^γh contracts at rate γh rather than γ.

**Approximate Policy Iteration (API)**: Framework for policy iteration with function approximation. Essential for understanding the inexact setting; quick check: verify that the approximation error is properly bounded.

**Sample Complexity Analysis**: Measures how many samples are needed to achieve ε-optimal policy. Critical for understanding practical efficiency; quick check: confirm that the bounds properly account for both estimation and optimization error.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Environment -> Sampler -> Value Function Estimator -> Policy Mirror Descent (with lookahead) -> Updated Policy

Critical path: Sampling trajectories → Estimating multi-step returns → Mirror descent policy update → Policy evaluation

Design tradeoffs: The lookahead depth h creates a fundamental tradeoff between computational cost (exponential in h) and convergence speed (better with larger h). The mirror descent framework trades off between aggressive improvement (like PI) and stability (like gradient methods).

Failure signatures: 
- High variance in value estimates leading to unstable updates
- Computational explosion with increasing h
- Poor performance when function approximation error is large
- Suboptimal choice of divergence measure in mirror descent

First experiments to run:
1. Compare convergence rates for different h values on a simple gridworld
2. Test sensitivity to mirror map choice (KL divergence vs other divergences)
3. Evaluate computational overhead vs convergence improvement tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation lacks comparison against recent strong baselines beyond standard PMD and PI algorithms
- Potential computational overhead from lookahead mechanism not adequately addressed, especially for larger h values
- Choice of h appears arbitrary without systematic sensitivity analysis
- Limited scope of experimental domains may not capture scalability challenges

## Confidence
- Theoretical convergence analysis: High - proofs follow standard optimization techniques with rigorous mathematical framework
- Sample complexity bounds: High - systematically derived and connect well to existing literature
- Function approximation extension: Medium - theoretically sound but needs more empirical validation
- Experimental results: Medium - promising but limited scope and comparison set

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying h systematically to understand the trade-off between computational cost and convergence improvement
2. Compare against recent model-free RL methods (e.g., SAC, TD3) on standard benchmark suites to establish practical competitiveness
3. Implement the algorithm on larger-scale problems with high-dimensional state spaces to test scalability of the lookahead mechanism
