# Impacts of Color and Texture Distortions on Earth Observation Data in Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.04385
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04385
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Deep learning models for EO land cover classification are more sensitive to texture distortions than color distortions

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how color and texture distortions affect deep learning models for land cover classification in Earth observation data. The authors systematically apply these distortions to EO images during inference using models trained without such distortions. Three state-of-the-art segmentation models (U-Net-EfficientNet-B4, DeeplabV3-ResNet50, and FTUNetFormer) are evaluated on the OpenEarthMap dataset. The key finding is that these models are significantly more sensitive to texture distortions than color distortions, indicating that texture serves as a primary discriminative feature for classification.

## Method Summary
The authors train three semantic segmentation models on the OpenEarthMap dataset using only horizontal and vertical flips as augmentations. During inference, they systematically apply grayscale transformations and pixel-swap distortions at varying intensities to test images. The grayscale transformation progressively converts images to gray-scale, while the pixel-swap distortion randomly swaps pixel values within each class. Model performance is evaluated using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) across the validation set under different distortion intensities, with results analyzed per class to identify sensitivity patterns.

## Key Results
- Models show greater sensitivity to texture distortions (pixel-swaps) than color distortions (grayscale) across all architectures
- Models leverage surrounding context for predictions, with performance dropping significantly when context is removed
- Class sensitivity to distortions is not directly related to class frequency in training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Deep learning models for EO land cover classification are more sensitive to texture distortions than color distortions.
- Mechanism: Texture provides discriminative information for class boundaries and local patterns, while color variations are often consistent within classes due to the spectral properties of land cover materials. When texture is disrupted through pixel-swapping, the model loses the spatial correlations it relies on for classification.
- Core assumption: The models have learned to use texture as a primary feature for distinguishing classes, not just color.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our results reveal the strengths and limitations of deep learning models for land cover classification, and offer guidance for future research and improvement."
  - [section 4] "As for texture distortion (pixel-swaps, see bottom row) we see more rapid performance drops in general."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of texture sensitivity in neighbor papers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Models leverage surrounding context to make predictions, particularly at class boundaries.
- Mechanism: The models use information from neighboring pixels of different classes to disambiguate uncertain regions. When context is removed, the model's accuracy drops significantly because it can no longer rely on this contextual information.
- Core assumption: The network architecture (e.g., U-Net, DeepLabV3) is designed to capture contextual information through its receptive field and skip connections.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "This coupled with the third row of Fig. 3 clearly indicates that the network leverages surrounding context for its predictions."
  - [section 4] "Our experiments indicate that models use the surrounding context when making predictions and are sensitive to changes in this context."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of context usage in neighbor papers.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The robustness to distortions is not directly related to the frequency of classes in the training data.
- Mechanism: Classes that are common in the dataset (like tree and range) are not necessarily more robust to distortions, suggesting that the model's sensitivity is more related to the inherent visual properties of the class rather than its prevalence.
- Core assumption: The model learns class-specific features that are independent of class frequency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "Finally, we note that range and tree are among the classes that are most affected by degradations... even though they are among the most common classes in the training set."
  - [abstract] "Our results reveal the strengths and limitations of deep learning models for land cover classification"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of class frequency vs robustness in neighbor papers.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Texture vs Color Invariance
  - Why needed here: Understanding how models differentiate between texture and color information is crucial for interpreting the results of the distortion experiments.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model be more sensitive to texture distortions than color distortions in EO imagery?

- Concept: Contextual Information in CNNs and Transformers
  - Why needed here: The models use surrounding context for predictions, which is a key finding of the paper. Understanding how this works is essential for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: How do U-Net and DeepLabV3 architectures capture contextual information?

- Concept: Data Augmentation and Model Robustness
  - Why needed here: The paper suggests that current data augmentation techniques may not be sufficient for EO tasks, highlighting the need for class-dependent augmentation strategies.
  - Quick check question: How can data augmentation be tailored to improve model robustness to specific types of distortions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: U-Net-EfficientNet-B4 -> DeeplabV3-ResNet50 -> FTUNetFormer (all semantic segmentation architectures)
- Critical path: Apply distortion to input image → pass through trained model → compare predictions to ground truth → compute mIoU per class and overall
- Design tradeoffs: Trade-off between capturing local details (through skip connections or low-level features) and global context (through large receptive fields or transformer layers)
- Failure signatures: Rapid mIoU decrease with increasing pixel-swap proportion indicates texture sensitivity; significant performance drop when context is removed indicates context dependence
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply grayscale transformation to validation image and evaluate mIoU compared to original
  2. Apply pixel-swap with small proportion (0.1) to validation image and evaluate mIoU compared to original
  3. Apply pixel-swap with large proportion (0.9) to validation image and evaluate mIoU compared to original

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors investigate the impact of color and texture distortions on the performance of deep learning models for land cover classification in Earth observation data.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific impact of each type of distortion on different classes within the dataset. It only provides a general observation that models are more sensitive to texture distortions than color distortions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the impact of each type of distortion on each class in the dataset would provide more insights into the specific effects of these distortions on the performance of deep learning models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the surrounding context affect the predictions of deep learning models for land cover classification in Earth observation data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe that models use the surrounding context when making predictions and are sensitive to changes in this context.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the surrounding context affects the predictions of deep learning models. It only provides a general observation that models are sensitive to changes in the context.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of how the surrounding context affects the predictions of deep learning models would provide more insights into the role of context in the performance of these models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the insights gained from the impact of visual distortions on deep learning models be used to develop more robust models for land cover classification in Earth observation data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that the insights gained from the impact of visual distortions on deep learning models can be used to guide the development of more robust models within the Earth observation domain.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific suggestions on how to develop more robust models based on the insights gained from the impact of visual distortions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Specific suggestions on how to develop more robust models based on the insights gained from the impact of visual distortions would provide more guidance for future research in this area.

## Limitations
- Single dataset (OpenEarthMap) with limited sample size (5,000 images) may not generalize
- Only three specific model architectures evaluated, limiting broader applicability
- Artificial distortion mechanisms may not reflect real-world degradation patterns in EO data

## Confidence
- High: Texture sensitivity claim supported by consistent patterns across all three models and clear visual evidence
- Medium: Context dependence claim is compelling but could benefit from additional ablation studies
- Low: Class-frequency independence claim lacks sufficient statistical analysis and has potential confounding factors

## Next Checks
1. Test model robustness on a second, independently collected EO dataset to verify generalization beyond OpenEarthMap
2. Implement and evaluate a control condition where distortions are applied during training to assess whether models can learn invariance to these specific transformations
3. Conduct statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA) to determine whether observed differences in class sensitivity are significant beyond random variation
