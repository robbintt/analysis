# Acoustic characterization of speech rhythm: going beyond metrics with recurrent neural networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.14416
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14416
- Reference count: 20
- A recurrent neural network trained on amplitude envelopes and voicing information achieves 40% accuracy in identifying 21 languages

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the acoustic basis of linguistic rhythm using deep learning methods. The authors trained a recurrent neural network on a language identification task, using amplitude envelopes and voicing information as input features to focus on prosodic rather than phonetic information. The model achieved 40% accuracy in identifying the language of 10-second speech recordings across 21 languages, with the correct language in the top-3 guesses in two-thirds of cases. Analysis of the model's internal representations using clustering and visualization techniques revealed groupings of languages consistent with rhythmic typologies, although the resulting maps were more complex than a simple stress vs. syllable-timed dichotomy. Further analysis showed that certain dimensions of the network's internal representation were correlated with established speech rhythm metrics, providing interpretable insights into the acoustic features the model learned.

## Method Summary
The authors collected speech recordings from 21 languages from various open web databases, extracting amplitude envelopes (SPL and SPL-H) and voicing information as input features. A recurrent neural network with two LSTM layers (150 units each) was trained on 10-second speech segments to identify the language. The model was evaluated on its language identification accuracy and analyzed for correlations between its internal representations and established speech rhythm metrics. The authors also performed clustering and visualization of the model's hidden layer activations to explore language groupings.

## Key Results
- 40% overall accuracy in identifying 21 languages from 10-second speech recordings
- 67% top-3 accuracy, with correct language in top 3 guesses in two-thirds of cases
- Clustering of languages based on model's internal representations showed groupings consistent with rhythmic typologies, but more complex than stress vs. syllable-timed dichotomy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The LSTM network can extract language-specific rhythmic patterns from amplitude envelopes and voicing information alone, without direct phonetic input.
- Mechanism: By constraining input to low-resolution prosodic features (amplitude envelopes, voiced/unvoiced markers), the model is forced to learn shared rhythmic representations across languages rather than memorizing language-specific phonetic cues.
- Core assumption: Rhythmic cues in amplitude envelopes and voicing patterns are sufficient to distinguish languages at a statistical level.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The network had access to the amplitude envelopes and a variable identifying the voiced segments, assuming that this signal would poorly convey phonetic information but preserve prosodic features."
  - [section] "Inputs extracted from the speech recordings were intentionally limited to force the model to rely primarily on prosodic cues."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence of rhythmic signal sufficiency provided.
- Break condition: If phonetic variability within languages overwhelms rhythmic patterns, or if prosodic features are too similar across languages.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Linear combinations of hidden layer activations correlate with established speech rhythm metrics, providing interpretable dimensions of the learned feature space.
- Mechanism: The network implicitly learns acoustic features that align with known rhythm metrics (like %V, ΔC, nPVI) through supervised language identification, making the model's internal representations interpretable via regression analysis.
- Core assumption: The statistical structure captured by the DNN overlaps with the dimensions measured by traditional rhythm metrics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We further analyzed the model by identifying correlations between network activations and known speech rhythm metrics."
  - [section] "We employed two strategies to examine the correlations between the rhythm metrics and the model activations."
  - [corpus] Weak - correlations found but no external validation on different datasets.
- Break condition: If the network learns representations that are orthogonal to traditional rhythm metrics or if the correlations are spurious.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Medium-sized networks (150 LSTM units per layer) balance expressivity and generalization, avoiding overfitting while capturing shared rhythmic features.
- Mechanism: Smaller networks force shared representations across languages by limiting capacity, while dropout regularization encourages reliance on a reduced number of activated units, promoting generalization over language-specific memorization.
- Core assumption: Larger networks overfit to language-specific patterns, while smaller networks learn generalizable rhythmic features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We oriented the choice of the architecture towards smaller networks to force the model to learn shared representations across languages."
  - [section] "Architectures with 3 hidden layers achieved similar performance as the 2-layer model, but were more difficult to train."
  - [corpus] Moderate - performance comparison between small and large models provided, but no ablation study on dropout effects.
- Break condition: If the network size is too small to capture necessary rhythmic complexity or if dropout prevents learning of essential features.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Speech rhythm metrics (e.g., %V, ΔC, nPVI)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these metrics is crucial for interpreting the model's learned representations and validating that the network captures linguistically meaningful features.
  - Quick check question: What does %V measure, and how does it relate to stress-timed vs. syllable-timed languages?
- Concept: Recurrent neural networks and LSTM units
  - Why needed here: The model architecture relies on LSTMs to process sequential speech data and capture temporal dependencies in rhythmic patterns.
  - Quick check question: How do LSTM units handle the vanishing gradient problem compared to standard RNNs?
- Concept: Feature extraction from raw audio signals
  - Why needed here: The model uses specific acoustic features (amplitude envelopes, voicing) as input, requiring understanding of how these relate to prosodic information.
  - Quick check question: Why were amplitude envelopes and voicing information chosen over more detailed phonetic features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input layer: 3 features (SPL, SPL-H, voicing) + deltas → 6-dimensional vector
  - Hidden layers: 2 LSTM layers (150 units each) with forget gates
  - Output layer: Dense layer with softmax (21 language probabilities)
  - Regularization: Dropout (recurrent: 0.1, between layers: 0.1, dense: 0.2)
- Critical path: Input → LSTM1 → LSTM2 → Dense → Softmax → Language prediction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Small network size vs. expressivity: Prevents overfitting but may miss complex patterns
  - Limited input features vs. information content: Forces rhythmic learning but may reduce accuracy
  - Dropout regularization vs. learning capacity: Prevents overfitting but may hinder learning
- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting: High training accuracy but low test accuracy
  - Underfitting: Low accuracy on both training and test sets
  - Confusion between rhythmically similar languages
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train baseline model with 2×150 LSTM units and test accuracy
  2. Compare performance with larger network (2×180 units) and F0 inclusion
  3. Analyze correlation between hidden layer activations and rhythm metrics using the Ramus corpus

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several implications emerge from the results:
- How do the rhythmic patterns captured by the neural network differ across the various language families and linguistic typologies present in the dataset?
- Can the neural network's rhythmic representations be used to improve the accuracy of language identification systems, particularly for languages with similar rhythmic characteristics?
- How do the rhythmic patterns captured by the neural network relate to the perception of speech rhythm by human listeners?

## Limitations

- Corpus Representativeness: Web-collected speech data introduces variability in recording quality and speaker demographics that may not generalize to controlled conditions.
- Feature Selection Validity: Limited input features may exclude relevant acoustic information; exact implementation details are not fully specified.
- Correlation Analysis Interpretation: Statistical relationships between hidden activations and rhythm metrics do not establish causation or prove linguistic meaningfulness.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Language identification results (40% accuracy, 67% top-3) are reproducible given described methodology and dataset size.
- Medium Confidence: Claim that model learns prosodic rather than phonetic features is supported by input design but not definitively proven.
- Low Confidence: Broader claim about advancing understanding of speech rhythm through deep learning is forward-looking and not fully substantiated.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-validation on controlled corpus - Test the trained model on the TSV and RVLC controlled corpora to verify whether the language groupings and rhythm metric correlations hold across different recording conditions and speaker populations.

2. Ablation study of input features - Systematically remove or modify the amplitude envelope and voicing features to determine which components contribute most to language discrimination and rhythm metric correlations.

3. Generalization to unseen languages - Evaluate the model's ability to correctly identify languages outside the training set or distinguish between rhythmically similar languages (e.g., Spanish vs. Italian) to test the robustness of the learned representations.
