core_contribution: The paper presents AdamZ, an enhanced variant of the Adam optimizer
  for neural network training that dynamically adjusts the learning rate to address
  overshooting and stagnation issues. AdamZ introduces six key hyperparameters (overshoot
  factor, stagnation factor, stagnation threshold, patience, stagnation period, and
  learning rate bounds) to control its responsiveness to training dynamics.

# AdamZ: An Enhanced Optimisation Method for Neural Network Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.15375
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15375
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: AdamZ optimizer achieves higher classification accuracy than standard Adam on MNIST and synthetic datasets

## Executive Summary
AdamZ introduces a dynamic learning rate adjustment mechanism to the Adam optimizer, addressing overshooting and stagnation issues during neural network training. The method monitors loss trends and adjusts learning rates accordingly through six hyperparameters that control responsiveness to training dynamics. Empirical results demonstrate consistent accuracy improvements over standard Adam, SGD, and RMSprop on both shallow and deep network architectures, though with modest increases in training time.

## Method Summary
AdamZ enhances the standard Adam optimizer by incorporating dynamic learning rate adjustments based on loss trend monitoring. The optimizer tracks loss reduction over sliding windows and compares against stagnation thresholds to determine when to increase or decrease learning rates. Six key hyperparameters control this behavior: overshoot factor, stagnation factor, stagnation threshold, patience, stagnation period, and learning rate bounds. The method can be applied to any model trained with Adam, requiring only the addition of these hyperparameters and integration of the dynamic adjustment logic into the training loop.

## Key Results
- On MNIST dataset, AdamZ achieved 95.9% median accuracy versus Adam's 84.2%
- Training time increased from 63.5 to 68.0 seconds on MNIST (approximately 7% increase)
- AdamZ consistently outperformed Adam, SGD, and RMSprop across tested architectures
- Superior loss minimization capabilities while maintaining controlled learning rate adjustments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AdamZ works by monitoring loss reduction trends and dynamically adjusting learning rates to prevent both overshooting (rapid loss increases) and stagnation (minimal loss improvement). When overshooting is detected, the learning rate is reduced to stabilize training. During stagnation, the learning rate is increased to escape local minima. This adaptive behavior allows the optimizer to maintain momentum during smooth optimization phases while being conservative during volatile periods, resulting in more precise convergence.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dynamic learning rate adjustment**: Needed to respond to changing optimization landscapes; quick check: verify learning rate changes correlate with loss trends
- **Loss trend monitoring**: Essential for detecting overshooting and stagnation; quick check: confirm window-based loss calculation captures meaningful patterns
- **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: Critical for balancing responsiveness and stability; quick check: test performance across different hyperparameter configurations
- **Optimizer comparison metrics**: Required to evaluate improvements objectively; quick check: ensure consistent evaluation protocols across optimizers
- **Early stopping criteria**: Important for preventing overfitting; quick check: verify stopping conditions are appropriately tuned

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data -> Model -> AdamZ Optimizer -> Loss Function -> Backpropagation -> Parameter Update -> AdamZ Adjustment

**Critical Path**: Training loop -> Loss calculation -> Trend analysis -> Learning rate adjustment -> Parameter update

**Design Tradeoffs**: Higher accuracy vs. increased training time; more hyperparameters vs. flexibility; dynamic adjustment vs. stability

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Excessive learning rate increases leading to divergence
- Insufficient adjustments causing premature convergence
- Hyperparameter misconfiguration resulting in oscillatory behavior

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare AdamZ against Adam on MNIST with identical architectures
2. Test sensitivity to overshoot factor on make_circles dataset
3. Evaluate stagnation factor impact on shallow network convergence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited validation scope with only two datasets and specific architectures tested
- Six hyperparameters may require extensive tuning for different applications
- Reported training time increases may become more significant for larger models
- No comparison against more recent state-of-the-art optimizers

## Confidence

**High**: The core mechanism of dynamically adjusting learning rates based on loss trends is theoretically sound and the reported improvements on tested datasets are reproducible within the experimental setup described.

**Medium**: The claim of superior precision over speed is supported by the results but may vary significantly with different model architectures and problem complexities not covered in the study.

**Low**: The generalizability of AdamZ's performance improvements across diverse machine learning tasks and real-world applications remains unverified.

## Next Checks
1. Test AdamZ on larger-scale datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100) and deeper architectures (ResNet, Transformer models) to assess scalability and performance across different problem domains.
2. Conduct a comprehensive hyperparameter sensitivity analysis to determine how AdamZ's performance varies with different hyperparameter configurations and establish guidelines for automatic hyperparameter selection.
3. Compare AdamZ against recent state-of-the-art optimizers (Lion, AdaFactor, NovoGrad) in both accuracy and training efficiency to establish its relative position in the current optimization landscape.
