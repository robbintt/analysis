## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of processing long event streams from neuromorphic sensors in an event-by-event manner, crucial for real-time applications and fully leveraging the advantages of these sensors. The authors propose a novel method based on deep state-space models (SSMs) that can scale to millions of events while maintaining the ability to learn long-range dependencies and handle asynchronous inputs. They introduce several techniques to adapt SSMs for event stream processing, including a novel discretization method for irregular sequences and an event-pooling architecture. The method is evaluated on three event-based datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach adapts deep state-space models (SSMs) for event stream processing through a novel discretization method that handles irregular temporal sequences and an event-pooling architecture. The discretization method converts asynchronous events into regular time steps while preserving temporal information, and the event-pooling mechanism aggregates events within these time steps to create a compact representation. This combination allows the SSM to process millions of events efficiently while maintaining the ability to learn long-range temporal dependencies. The architecture processes events sequentially without requiring frame-based preprocessing, enabling direct learning from raw event streams.

## Key Results
- Achieves 87.1% accuracy on Spiking Speech Commands, improving state-of-the-art by 6.6%
- Demonstrates competitive performance on DVS128-Gestures without using frames or CNNs
- Successfully processes event streams directly without preprocessing into frames

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the inherent ability of state-space models to handle sequential data while adapting them to the unique characteristics of event streams. The discretization method creates a bridge between asynchronous events and the regular time steps required by SSMs, preserving temporal relationships. The event-pooling architecture reduces computational complexity while maintaining information density, allowing the model to scale to millions of events. This combination enables the model to learn both local and global temporal patterns in the event stream, which is crucial for tasks like speech recognition and gesture classification.

## Foundational Learning
1. **State-Space Models (SSMs)**: Neural architectures that model temporal dynamics through state transitions, needed for capturing long-range dependencies in sequences; quick check: verify that state updates follow the recurrence relation x_t = A x_{t-1} + B u_t
2. **Event-based sensors**: Bio-inspired sensors that output asynchronous events instead of frames, providing high temporal resolution and low power consumption; quick check: confirm events contain timestamp, x-y position, and polarity information
3. **Discretization of irregular sequences**: Converting asynchronous time series into regular intervals while preserving temporal information, needed because SSMs require regular time steps; quick check: ensure the discretization method maintains temporal ordering and event density information
4. **Pooling operations**: Aggregation techniques that reduce dimensionality while preserving important information, needed to handle the high event rates in neuromorphic sensors; quick check: verify that pooling preserves the most informative events within each time step

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input events -> Discretization module -> Event pooling -> SSM layers -> Output layer

Critical Path: Event stream enters discretization module which converts irregular events into regular time steps, followed by event pooling that aggregates events within each time step, then processed through multiple SSM layers, and finally through output layer for classification.

Design Tradeoffs: The discretization resolution trades off between temporal precision and computational efficiency; finer discretization preserves more temporal information but increases computational load. Event pooling reduces the number of inputs to the SSM but may lose fine-grained temporal details. The SSM depth balances model capacity against training complexity and inference speed.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance on temporally precise tasks when discretization is too coarse; vanishing gradients or training instability when SSM depth is excessive; inability to distinguish similar gestures when event pooling is too aggressive; failure to converge when discretization intervals are too irregular.

3 First Experiments:
1. Test discretization sensitivity by varying the time step size on a simple gesture recognition task
2. Evaluate the impact of event pooling granularity on classification accuracy for speech commands
3. Benchmark training stability across different SSM depths with synthetic event streams
