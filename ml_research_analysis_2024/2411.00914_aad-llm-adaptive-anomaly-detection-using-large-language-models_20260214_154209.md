# AAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.00914
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00914
- Reference count: 39
- Achieved F1 scores of 77.0% on plastics manufacturing and 55.6% on SKAB dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper presents AAD-LLM, a novel framework that repurposes large language models for anomaly detection in industrial environments without requiring training or fine-tuning on target datasets. The method addresses key challenges in data-constrained manufacturing settings where traditional anomaly detection methods struggle with concept drift and lack of transferability. By converting time series data into a "language" task through statistical process control preprocessing and domain-specific text templates, AAD-LLM achieves zero-shot transferability and demonstrates adaptability to changing normal behavior patterns. The framework integrates expert knowledge with sensor data analysis to enable collaborative decision-making between models and operators.

## Method Summary
AAD-LLM transforms time series anomaly detection into a language task by preprocessing sensor data using statistical process control techniques, then converting the processed data into text templates enriched with domain-specific semantics. The framework employs an LLM to analyze these text representations and detect anomalies without requiring training on the target dataset. A key innovation is the adaptability mechanism that allows the model to update its understanding of normal behavior as new data arrives, addressing concept drift in dynamic industrial environments. The method was validated on both a plastics manufacturing use case and the SKAB dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting anomalies while maintaining zero-shot transferability across different domains.

## Key Results
- Achieved F1 score of 77.0% on proprietary plastics manufacturing dataset
- Obtained F1 score of 55.6% on public SKAB benchmark dataset
- Demonstrated zero-shot transferability without requiring training or fine-tuning
- Showed multimodality and integration of domain-specific expert knowledge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding capabilities to detect patterns and anomalies in structured textual representations of time series data. By converting sensor readings into domain-specific text templates enriched with statistical derivatives, the method taps into LLMs' pre-trained semantic understanding while avoiding the need for domain-specific training. The adaptability mechanism allows continuous updating of the model's concept of "normal" behavior, enabling it to track concept drift in dynamic industrial environments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Statistical Process Control (SPC)**: Why needed - to identify and preprocess data patterns before text conversion; Quick check - verify SPC calculations produce consistent results across different sensor types
- **Text Template Engineering**: Why needed - to create meaningful representations that capture temporal and statistical features; Quick check - test template parsing with sample sensor data
- **Concept Drift Detection**: Why needed - to trigger model adaptation when normal behavior changes; Quick check - simulate gradual parameter changes and verify adaptation triggers
- **Domain Semantics Integration**: Why needed - to incorporate expert knowledge into anomaly detection; Quick check - validate semantic mappings with domain experts
- **Zero-shot Learning**: Why needed - to enable transfer without target dataset training; Quick check - test on completely unseen manufacturing processes
- **Collaborative Decision Framework**: Why needed - to combine model outputs with operator expertise; Quick check - implement human-in-the-loop validation workflow

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Sensor Data → SPC Preprocessing → Statistical Derivatives → Text Templates → LLM Analysis → Anomaly Detection → Adaptability Update → Operator Interface

**Critical Path:** The core anomaly detection workflow flows from raw sensor data through SPC preprocessing to generate statistical metrics, which are then embedded in text templates. These templates are processed by the LLM to identify anomalies, with results fed back through the adaptability mechanism to update the model's understanding of normal behavior.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades computational efficiency (text processing overhead) for flexibility and transferability. While traditional ML methods require extensive training data and struggle with concept drift, AAD-LLM leverages pre-trained LLMs but incurs the overhead of text conversion and processing. The adaptability mechanism adds complexity but enables continuous learning without retraining.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation may occur when: 1) Text templates fail to capture critical sensor relationships, 2) Concept drift exceeds the adaptability mechanism's update rate, 3) Domain semantics are incorrectly specified, or 4) LLM context windows are insufficient for long time series.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test text template generation with synthetic sensor data showing known anomalies
2. Validate SPC preprocessing produces expected statistical metrics across different sensor types
3. Benchmark LLM inference time and memory usage for real-time anomaly detection

- Long-term stability of the adaptive mechanism under continuous concept drift remains untested
- Computational overhead of text-based processing is not characterized
