# Co-clustering for Federated Recommender System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.01690
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01690

- Primary result: CoFedRec improves HR@10 from 72.85 to 77.52 and NDCG@10 from 43.89 to 50.65 on MovieLens-100K

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CoFedRec, a co-clustering federated recommendation mechanism that addresses statistical heterogeneity in federated recommender systems. Traditional clustering methods like K-Means struggle with data sparsity and diverse user preferences, limiting their effectiveness in federated settings. CoFedRec overcomes these limitations by grouping users based on specific item categories during each communication round, generating group-specific models while leveraging supervised contrastive learning to capture global item relationships.

The method demonstrates significant improvements across four real-world datasets (MovieLens-100K, MovieLens-1M, FilmTrust, and LastFM-2K), achieving notable gains in HR@10 and NDCG@10 metrics. The approach maintains user privacy through the federated learning framework while showing robustness across different dataset sizes and backbone models. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of combining co-clustering with supervised contrastive learning in addressing the challenges of statistical heterogeneity in federated recommender systems.

## Method Summary
CoFedRec operates by performing user clustering based on item categories during each communication round in a federated recommender system. Unlike traditional clustering approaches that group users based on overall similarity, CoFedRec creates category-specific user groups, allowing for more granular and relevant model personalization. The method incorporates a supervised contrastive learning term that helps capture global relationships between items across different user groups, addressing the challenge of maintaining global consistency while enabling local personalization.

The federated learning framework ensures that raw user data remains on local devices, with only model updates being shared during communication rounds. This approach not only preserves privacy but also reduces communication overhead compared to sharing raw data. The co-clustering mechanism dynamically adjusts user groupings based on item categories, making the system more adaptive to diverse user preferences and reducing the impact of data sparsity that commonly affects recommender systems.

## Key Results
- HR@10 improved from 72.85 to 77.52 on MovieLens-100K dataset
- NDCG@10 improved from 43.89 to 50.65 on MovieLens-100K dataset
- Demonstrated effectiveness across four real-world datasets including MovieLens-1M, FilmTrust, and LastFM-2K
- Showed robustness across different dataset sizes and backbone models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CoFedRec addresses statistical heterogeneity in federated recommender systems by recognizing that users have diverse preferences across different item categories. Traditional clustering methods that group users based on overall similarity fail to capture these nuanced preferences, leading to suboptimal recommendations. By clustering users based on specific item categories during each communication round, CoFedRec creates more homogeneous groups where users share similar interests within particular domains.

The supervised contrastive learning component plays a crucial role by helping the model learn meaningful relationships between items across different user groups. This global item relationship learning ensures that the system maintains consistency and can leverage knowledge from one group to benefit others, even when users have different primary interests. The combination of category-specific clustering with global item relationship learning allows CoFedRec to balance personalization with system-wide knowledge sharing, addressing both local diversity and global consistency challenges in federated recommender systems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Federated Learning**: Distributed machine learning framework where models are trained across multiple devices without sharing raw data. Needed because user privacy must be preserved while training recommendation models. Quick check: Verify data remains on local devices during training.
- **User Clustering**: Grouping similar users based on behavior patterns or preferences. Required to create homogeneous groups for personalized recommendations. Quick check: Assess clustering quality using silhouette score or similar metrics.
- **Contrastive Learning**: Self-supervised learning technique that learns representations by comparing similar and dissimilar examples. Essential for capturing item relationships without explicit labels. Quick check: Validate that similar items are mapped closer in embedding space.
- **Statistical Heterogeneity**: Variations in data distribution across different users or devices. Critical challenge in federated learning that affects model performance. Quick check: Measure distribution divergence between user groups using statistical tests.
- **Co-clustering**: Simultaneous clustering of both users and items. Needed to capture more nuanced relationships than traditional user-based or item-based clustering alone. Quick check: Evaluate co-clustering quality through information preservation metrics.
- **Recommendation Metrics (HR@10, NDCG@10)**: Evaluation metrics for recommender systems measuring hit rate and ranking quality. Required to assess recommendation performance objectively. Quick check: Verify metric calculations follow standard definitions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Devices -> Local Model Training -> Co-clustering Module -> Category-specific Group Models -> Supervised Contrastive Learning -> Global Model Aggregation

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves local model training on user devices, followed by co-clustering to form category-specific groups, then applying supervised contrastive learning to capture global item relationships, and finally aggregating updated models for the next round.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades increased computational complexity during the co-clustering phase for improved recommendation quality and better handling of statistical heterogeneity. While traditional federated learning focuses on simple model averaging, CoFedRec invests additional resources in understanding user-item relationships at a more granular level. This tradeoff is justified by the significant performance improvements demonstrated in experiments.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failure modes include poor co-clustering quality leading to ineffective group formation, insufficient contrastive learning capturing meaningful item relationships, or communication bottlenecks due to frequent model updates. The system may also struggle with extreme data sparsity or when user preferences span too many categories to form meaningful clusters.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison with traditional federated averaging without clustering on the same datasets
2. Ablation study removing the supervised contrastive learning component to measure its individual contribution
3. Sensitivity analysis varying the number of communication rounds to assess convergence behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope with only four datasets, which may not represent full diversity of real-world scenarios
- Focus on specific evaluation metrics (HR@10 and NDCG@10) without comprehensive analysis of diversity, fairness, or long-tail item performance
- Computational overhead of co-clustering and supervised contrastive learning not thoroughly discussed, raising scalability concerns for large-scale deployments

- Effectiveness of combining co-clustering with supervised contrastive learning

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments on additional diverse datasets including implicit feedback scenarios and different domain types to verify generalizability

2. Perform comprehensive ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of co-clustering and supervised contrastive learning components

3. Evaluate system performance under varying communication constraints and computational resources to assess practical deployment feasibility
