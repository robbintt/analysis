core_contribution: This paper proposes MakeSinger, a semi-supervised training method
  for singing voice synthesis (SVS) using classifier-free diffusion guidance. The
  key idea is to enable training of diffusion-based SVS models on any speech or singing
  data regardless of labeling, thereby improving quality with large amounts of unlabeled
  data.

# MakeSinger: A Semi-Supervised Training Method for Data-Efficient Singing Voice Synthesis via Classifier-free Diffusion Guidance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.05965
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05965
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Semi-supervised diffusion model outperforms labeled-only baselines in pronunciation, pitch accuracy, and overall singing quality

## Executive Summary
MakeSinger introduces a semi-supervised training framework for singing voice synthesis that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data through classifier-free diffusion guidance. The method employs a dual guiding mechanism to balance text and pitch conditioning during reverse diffusion steps, enabling training on any speech or singing data regardless of labeling status. By incorporating large amounts of unlabeled data alongside smaller labeled datasets, the model achieves superior synthesis quality compared to models trained exclusively on labeled data. The approach also demonstrates the ability to synthesize singing voices for TTS speakers without requiring their specific singing voice data.

## Method Summary
The method employs classifier-free diffusion guidance to train a singing voice synthesis model using both labeled and unlabeled data. During reverse diffusion, a dual guiding mechanism balances text and pitch conditioning signals. The model learns from any available speech or singing data, regardless of whether text and pitch labels are present. This semi-supervised approach allows the model to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to improve synthesis quality while maintaining control through the limited labeled data. The framework enables transfer learning from TTS data to singing synthesis without requiring singing voice data for TTS speakers.

## Key Results
- Semi-supervised model outperforms baselines trained only on labeled data in pronunciation accuracy
- Model achieves better pitch accuracy compared to labeled-only training approaches
- Incorporating TTS data enables singing voice synthesis for TTS speakers without their singing voice data
- Overall quality improvements demonstrated across multiple evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The semi-supervised approach works by leveraging the vast amounts of available unlabeled speech and singing data to learn general acoustic patterns and prosody. The classifier-free diffusion framework allows the model to handle both labeled and unlabeled data seamlessly during training. The dual guiding mechanism ensures that during inference, the model can balance between text and pitch conditioning to produce coherent singing synthesis. By learning from unlabeled data, the model captures broader acoustic variations and speaker characteristics that would be impossible to obtain from limited labeled datasets alone. The ability to incorporate TTS data extends the model's versatility by transferring learned speech synthesis capabilities to the singing domain.

## Foundational Learning

**Classifier-free Diffusion Guidance**
- Why needed: Enables training on both labeled and unlabeled data without requiring separate classifier networks
- Quick check: Model can perform inference with or without guidance strength parameter

**Dual Guiding Mechanism**
- Why needed: Balances text and pitch conditioning signals during reverse diffusion for coherent synthesis
- Quick check: Both text and pitch information are preserved in generated outputs

**Semi-supervised Learning**
- Why needed: Leverages large amounts of unlabeled data to improve model generalization
- Quick check: Performance improves when unlabeled data is added to training

**Singing Voice Synthesis**
- Why needed: Specialized task requiring precise control over pitch, rhythm, and pronunciation
- Quick check: Generated audio matches musical score timing and pitch contours

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Text Encoder -> Pitch Encoder -> Diffusion UNet -> Audio Decoder

Critical Path: Text/Pitch conditioning → Diffusion UNet → Audio generation

Design Tradeoffs: The semi-supervised approach trades computational complexity during training for improved data efficiency and generalization. The dual guiding mechanism adds inference-time flexibility but requires careful balancing of guidance strengths.

Failure Signatures: Poor text alignment indicates insufficient text guidance, while pitch inaccuracies suggest inadequate pitch conditioning. Over-smoothing of generated audio may indicate excessive denoising steps.

First Experiments:
1. Test inference with varying guidance strengths to evaluate text-pitch balance
2. Compare synthesis quality on labeled vs. unlabeled test data
3. Evaluate cross-speaker generalization by synthesizing for unseen speakers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Assumes pitch-aligned speech data contains sufficient prosodic information for singing transfer, which may not hold across diverse speaker characteristics
- Limited detail on how label noise in supervised data affects model performance
- Fixed dual guiding mechanism may not be optimal across different datasets
- Extensive validation across varied speaker profiles and singing styles is lacking

## Confidence
High: Claims about improved pronunciation and pitch accuracy
Medium: Claims about overall quality improvements and TTS speaker generalization
Low: Claims about cross-lingual capabilities and complex musical structure handling

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on speakers with distinct vocal characteristics not present in training data
2. Evaluate impact of varying label noise levels in supervised subset on final synthesis quality
3. Assess model's ability to handle multilingual singing data and cross-lingual transfer
