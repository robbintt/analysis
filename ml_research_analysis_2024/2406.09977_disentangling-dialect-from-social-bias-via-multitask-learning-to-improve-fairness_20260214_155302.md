# Disentangling Dialect from Social Bias via Multitask Learning to Improve Fairness

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.09977
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09977
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Multitask learning improves fairness and performance in social bias detection for AAE dialect texts

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses performance disparities in social bias detection for African-American English (AAE) dialect texts by proposing a multitask learning approach that jointly models dialect detection and five bias aspects (offensiveness, intent, lewdness, target group, and ingroup membership). The method uses a shared encoder with separate classification heads for each task, trained with alternating round-robin loss computation. By automatically augmenting the Social Bias Inference Corpus with AAE dialect labels, the authors demonstrate that their multitask approach improves both fairness and classification performance, particularly for AAE texts, outperforming single-task and generative baselines.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a multitask learning framework where a shared encoder processes text inputs, with separate classification heads for dialect detection and five bias detection tasks. The model is trained using alternating round-robin loss computation across tasks. To enable this approach, they automatically augment the Social Bias Inference Corpus with AAE dialect labels using a trained classifier. This allows the system to jointly learn dialect and bias detection, addressing performance gaps between AAE and non-AAE texts. The approach leverages the complementary information between dialect and bias aspects to improve overall fairness and accuracy.

## Key Results
- Multitask learning improves classification performance and fairness for AAE dialect texts
- Modeling dialect as an auxiliary task reduces performance gaps between AAE and non-AAE texts
- The approach outperforms single-task and generative baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multitask learning framework works by leveraging the shared linguistic features between dialect identification and social bias detection tasks. By jointly modeling these tasks, the system can better distinguish between dialectal variations and actual social bias indicators, reducing false positives that arise from dialectal differences being misinterpreted as offensive content. The alternating training schedule allows the model to balance learning across all tasks while maintaining task-specific discriminative power.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multitask Learning**: Training multiple related tasks simultaneously to improve generalization across all tasks
  - Why needed: To leverage shared linguistic patterns between dialect and bias detection
  - Quick check: Monitor task-specific performance to ensure no task is neglected during training
- **Dialects and Social Bias Detection**: Understanding how dialectal variations can be misinterpreted as social bias indicators
  - Why needed: To address fairness issues where dialect speakers are unfairly flagged for bias
  - Quick check: Analyze performance differences across dialect groups
- **Automatic Data Augmentation**: Generating additional labeled data through classification or transformation techniques
  - Why needed: To create dialect labels for existing bias detection datasets
  - Quick check: Validate automatically generated labels against human annotations

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Text -> Shared Encoder -> Dialect Detection Head + Bias Detection Heads (Offensiveness, Intent, Lewdness, Target Group, Ingroup Membership)

**Critical Path**: Text input flows through shared encoder to all classification heads; losses are computed separately and applied in alternating round-robin fashion during training

**Design Tradeoffs**: Shared encoder promotes knowledge transfer but may limit task-specific specialization; alternating training balances task learning but requires careful scheduling to prevent task dominance

**Failure Signatures**: Overfitting to dialect patterns at expense of bias detection; imbalanced task performance indicating training schedule issues; poor generalization to unseen dialect variations

**First Experiments**: 1) Train single-task baseline for dialect detection, 2) Train single-task baseline for each bias detection task, 3) Evaluate performance gaps between AAE and non-AAE texts on single-task models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the work raises important considerations about the generalizability of fairness improvements to other dialect variations and the long-term impact of automatic label generation on model reliability.

## Limitations
- Automatic augmentation of dialect labels introduces potential label noise that could affect downstream performance
- Evaluation focuses primarily on AAE versus non-AAE distinctions, potentially overlooking other dialect variations
- Limited comparison with alternative fairness-enhancing techniques such as adversarial debiasing

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The multitask learning framework's technical implementation and its ability to improve overall classification performance for bias detection tasks
- **Medium confidence**: The fairness improvements specifically for AAE texts, given the automatic label generation and limited dialect diversity in evaluation
- **Medium confidence**: The superiority of the proposed method over single-task baselines, though broader comparison with other fairness techniques would strengthen this claim

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human validation studies on the automatically assigned AAE dialect labels to assess label accuracy and its impact on model performance
2. Extend experiments to include additional dialect variations beyond AAE to evaluate generalizability of fairness improvements
3. Compare the multitask approach against alternative fairness methods such as adversarial debiasing or domain adversarial training to establish relative effectiveness
