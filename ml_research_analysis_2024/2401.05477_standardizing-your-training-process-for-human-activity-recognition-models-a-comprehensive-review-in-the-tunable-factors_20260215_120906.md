# Standardizing Your Training Process for Human Activity Recognition Models: A Comprehensive Review in the Tunable Factors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.05477
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05477
- Reference count: 31
- Standardized training procedure improves HAR model performance across five benchmark datasets without increasing computational cost

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical reproducibility problem in human activity recognition research by identifying that most studies omit crucial training configuration details. Through systematic control-variates experiments, the authors demonstrate that hyperparameters like optimizer, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay significantly impact model performance, particularly macro F1 scores in leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Based on these insights, they propose a standardized training procedure that consistently improves performance across multiple datasets and model architectures while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a control-variates approach to systematically vary key training hyperparameters while holding others constant, isolating their individual effects on model performance. They evaluate across five benchmark HAR datasets using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation and three model architectures (CNN-based, CNN-LSTM, and Transformer). Based on the experimental insights, they define a novel integrated training procedure with optimized hyperparameters including Adam optimizer, Cosine learning rate scheduling, batch size 16, and early stopping based on validation F1 score. This standardized procedure is then evaluated for its effectiveness across all datasets and models.

## Key Results
- Training procedure details are frequently omitted in HAR literature, affecting reproducibility
- Validation loss and F1 score diverge during training, with F1 continuing to improve after validation loss reaches minimum
- Proposed standardized training procedure consistently improves performance across five datasets and three model architectures
- Optimizer, learning rate, weight decay, and batch size independently influence model performance in LOSO-CV settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Controlling for optimizer, learning rate, weight decay, and batch size independently reveals their impact on HAR model performance
- Mechanism: By holding all other hyperparameters constant while varying one factor at a time, the researchers isolate the effect of each parameter on validation loss and F1 score
- Core assumption: The relationships between hyperparameters are independent and additive
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we utilize a control variables approach to assess the impact of key tunable components (e.g., optimization techniques and early stopping criteria)"
  - [section] "To gain a clearer understanding of the impact of missing descriptions, we utilize a control variables approach"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss HAR but don't specifically address control-variates methodology
- Break condition: If hyperparameters interact non-linearly or exhibit synergistic effects, the control-variates approach would miss these interactions

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Standardizing training procedures across different model architectures improves reproducibility and performance consistency
- Mechanism: By defining a single integrated training procedure with optimized hyperparameters for each factor, models trained on different datasets and architectures can achieve more consistent performance
- Core assumption: There exists a universal optimal configuration that works well across different HAR datasets and model architectures
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we define a novel integrated training procedure tailored to the WHAR model"
  - [section] "Based on these insights, we propose a countermeasure and provide experimental evidence of its efficacy"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors mention WHAR datasets and methods but don't discuss standardization procedures
- Break condition: If dataset-specific characteristics require fundamentally different training approaches, a universal standard would fail to optimize for each dataset's unique properties

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using validation F1 score instead of validation loss for early stopping prevents premature termination of training
- Mechanism: The control-variates analysis shows that validation loss and F1 score diverge during training, with F1 continuing to improve after validation loss reaches its minimum
- Core assumption: F1 score is a more reliable indicator of model generalization performance than validation loss for imbalanced HAR datasets
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Our analysis reveals that the validation loss decreases gradually and reaches its minimum at approximately the 15th epoch. However, the loss tends to increase progressively thereafter. In contrast, the F1 score continues to improve gradually even after the 15th epoch"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus neighbors about early stopping criteria selection
- Break condition: If F1 score becomes unreliable due to extreme class imbalance or if validation loss correlates better with test performance on certain datasets

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Control-variates experimental design
  - Why needed here: To isolate the effect of individual hyperparameters on model performance when the hyperparameter space is too large for exhaustive grid search
  - Quick check question: If varying batch size from 16 to 512 while keeping all other parameters constant shows performance degradation, what can you conclude about batch size's effect on generalization?

- Concept: Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation
  - Why needed here: To evaluate model generalization across different subjects, which is critical for real-world HAR applications where training and testing subjects differ
  - Quick check question: In LOSO-CV, if a model achieves 95% accuracy on training subjects but only 60% on held-out subjects, what does this indicate about the model's generalization capability?

- Concept: Macro F1 score for imbalanced classification
  - Why needed here: HAR datasets typically have imbalanced class distributions, and macro F1 treats all classes equally regardless of frequency
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts the majority class for all samples and achieves 80% accuracy, what would its macro F1 score be if the minority class represents 20% of samples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing (sliding windows) -> Model training (standardized procedure) -> LOSO-CV evaluation -> Performance comparison
- Critical path: Dataset preprocessing → Model training with standardized procedure → LOSO-CV evaluation → Performance comparison
- Design tradeoffs: Standardizing training procedures sacrifices potential dataset-specific optimization for reproducibility and comparability
- Failure signatures: If performance varies wildly across datasets despite standardized procedure, it suggests dataset-specific factors dominate training effects
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement sliding window preprocessing with varying overlap percentages and measure impact on feature extraction quality
  2. Train baseline models with different optimizers (SGD, Adam, Adadelta) while keeping all other parameters constant to verify control-variates results
  3. Compare early stopping based on validation loss versus validation F1 score to confirm divergence patterns observed in control experiments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do specific hyperparameter choices (e.g., learning rate, batch size, weight decay) affect model performance across different WHAR datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conducted control-variates analysis to assess the impact of hyperparameters like optimizer, learning rate, weight decay, and batch size on model performance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides some insights, the impact of hyperparameters may vary depending on dataset characteristics, model architecture, and task complexity. More extensive experimentation across diverse datasets is needed to draw generalizable conclusions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive studies evaluating hyperparameter effects across a wide range of WHAR datasets and model architectures, with systematic ablation experiments and statistical analysis of performance differences.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between model complexity and generalization performance for WHAR tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper emphasizes the importance of model training procedures but does not explicitly address the trade-off between model complexity and generalization. Different model architectures (CNN, CNN-LSTM, Transformer) were tested, but their relative strengths and weaknesses were not deeply analyzed.
- Why unresolved: The optimal balance likely depends on factors such as dataset size, feature complexity, and computational constraints. Further research is needed to understand how model architecture choices impact generalization and to develop guidelines for selecting appropriate model complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the performance of various model architectures on diverse WHAR datasets, with a focus on analyzing the relationship between model complexity, generalization ability, and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop more robust and interpretable training procedures for WHAR models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose a standardized training procedure and demonstrate its effectiveness. However, they acknowledge the need for further research to improve robustness and interpretability.
- Why unresolved: Robustness and interpretability are crucial for real-world deployment of WHAR models. Developing training procedures that are resistant to noise, adversarial attacks, and domain shifts, while also providing insights into model decision-making, remains an open challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research efforts focused on developing training techniques that incorporate robustness and interpretability considerations, such as adversarial training, uncertainty quantification, and explainable AI methods tailored for WHAR tasks.

## Limitations
- The control-variates approach may miss non-linear interactions between hyperparameters
- The universal optimal training configuration may not hold across diverse HAR datasets
- LOSO cross-validation may not reflect performance in scenarios with subject overlap between training and testing

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The observation that training procedure details are frequently omitted in HAR literature and that this affects reproducibility is well-supported by the systematic review of existing papers. The finding that validation loss and F1 score diverge during training, suggesting early stopping based on F1 is preferable, has direct empirical support from the control experiments.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that the proposed standardized training procedure improves performance across all datasets and model architectures is supported by the experimental results, but the magnitude of improvement and generalizability to other datasets or model types requires further validation. The assertion that this approach is "low-cost" needs more context about computational requirements.

**Low Confidence**: The universality of the proposed training configuration for all HAR applications is questionable given the diversity of sensor setups, activity types, and application domains in the field. The paper doesn't adequately address scenarios where dataset-specific optimization might be necessary.

## Next Checks
1. **Interaction Effects Test**: Design experiments that systematically vary pairs of hyperparameters simultaneously (e.g., learning rate and batch size together) to identify any non-linear interactions that the control-variates approach missed.

2. **Cross-Dataset Robustness**: Apply the standardized training procedure to additional HAR datasets not included in the original study, particularly those with different sensor modalities (e.g., ECG, EMG) or activity types to test generalizability.

3. **Real-World Deployment Validation**: Implement the trained models in a real-world HAR application with new subjects not present in any training or validation data to assess actual generalization performance and identify any practical limitations of the standardized approach.
