core_contribution: This paper tackles the challenge of classifying public tenders
  using the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) taxonomy, which is mandatory for certain
  important tenders in the European Union. The task is complicated by the taxonomy's
  large size (9454 labels), deep hierarchy (up to 7 levels), and highly imbalanced

# Zero-Shot Hierarchical Classification on the Common Procurement Vocabulary Taxonomy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.09983
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09983
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: HCE achieves 0.5334 micro-precision and 0.3274 macro-precision on CPV taxonomy classification

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of classifying public tenders using the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) taxonomy, a mandatory classification system for EU public procurement with 9,454 labels across a 7-level hierarchy. The task is complicated by severe class imbalance, with many fine-grained classes having insufficient or no training examples. The authors propose a zero-shot hierarchical classification approach using a Hierarchical Cross-Encoder (HCE) based on BERT, which computes similarity between tender data and label descriptions without requiring training examples for every class. Their approach demonstrates improved performance on low-frequency classes compared to baselines while maintaining zero-shot capabilities for unseen categories.

## Method Summary
The authors tackle zero-shot hierarchical classification of public tenders using the CPV taxonomy through a Hierarchical Cross-Encoder (HCE) architecture. The model leverages pre-trained BERT to compute similarity scores between tender data and label descriptions, enabling classification without requiring training examples for each CPV code. The approach respects the taxonomy's hierarchical structure while addressing the challenge of class imbalance, where fine-grained classes often lack sufficient training data. The HCE model is trained using an exclusive sibling sampling strategy and evaluated on Italian public contract data from contrattipubblici.org, demonstrating improved performance on low-frequency classes compared to traditional baselines.

## Key Results
- HCE achieves micro-precision of 0.5334 and macro-precision of 0.3274 on CPV classification
- Model performs well on unseen classes with macro-precision of 0.3333, demonstrating zero-shot capabilities
- Significant improvement on low-frequent classes compared to three baseline approaches
- Model respects CPV taxonomy hierarchy while enabling zero-shot classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Hierarchical Cross-Encoder leverages pre-trained language models' semantic understanding to compute similarity between tender descriptions and CPV label descriptions, bypassing the need for extensive training data per class. By operating in the semantic space of label descriptions rather than relying solely on training examples, the model can generalize to unseen classes and handle the long-tail distribution of CPV codes. The hierarchical structure is respected through the model's architecture, which ensures that predictions align with the taxonomy's parent-child relationships.

## Foundational Learning
- **BERT semantic embeddings**: Pre-trained transformer models provide rich semantic representations needed for cross-category similarity computation - quick check: verify BERT embeddings capture domain-specific procurement terminology
- **Hierarchical classification constraints**: Taxonomy structure must be respected during prediction to ensure valid classification paths - quick check: validate all predictions form valid paths in CPV hierarchy
- **Zero-shot learning principles**: Models must generalize to unseen classes using semantic similarities rather than learned patterns - quick check: test performance on completely novel CPV codes
- **Class imbalance handling**: Long-tail distributions require strategies beyond simple sampling to ensure minority class performance - quick check: analyze per-class precision across frequency deciles

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Tender data → BERT encoder → Label description encoder → Similarity computation → Hierarchical constraint enforcement → Classification output

**Critical Path**: The core computation flow involves encoding tender descriptions and label descriptions separately through BERT, computing cross-encoder similarity scores, applying hierarchical constraints to ensure valid taxonomy paths, and producing final classifications.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model prioritizes zero-shot generalization and hierarchical consistency over raw classification speed, resulting in slower inference compared to traditional classifiers. The use of pre-trained BERT provides strong semantic understanding but increases computational requirements.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on genuinely novel classes, violation of hierarchical constraints in predictions, and degraded accuracy for extremely rare classes indicate model limitations. Integration failures with traditional classifiers suggest architectural incompatibility issues.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare HCE performance against non-hierarchical BERT classifiers to quantify hierarchy benefit
2. Test model on artificially created unseen classes to validate zero-shot capabilities
3. Evaluate performance across different CPV hierarchy depths to identify structural weaknesses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Inference speed optimization**: How can HCE inference be accelerated without sacrificing zero-shot accuracy?
- **Optimal sampling strategies**: What sampling approaches best balance performance across taxonomy hierarchy levels?
- **Model integration**: Can HCE be effectively combined with traditional hierarchical classifiers despite initial integration challenges?

## Limitations
- Model inference is slower than baseline approaches, limiting real-time deployment potential
- Performance on genuinely unseen classes suggests potential overfitting to seen class patterns
- Single-country (Italian) focus limits generalizability to broader EU procurement contexts

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: CPV taxonomy characteristics and relative baseline performance comparisons
- **Medium confidence**: Absolute performance metrics and reported improvements on low-frequency classes
- **Low confidence**: True zero-shot generalization capabilities on completely novel categories

## Next Checks
1. Validate model performance on procurement data from multiple EU countries to assess cross-country generalization
2. Test zero-shot capabilities on artificially created CPV codes that are semantically distinct from training classes
3. Conduct ablation studies removing taxonomy structural components to quantify their contribution to performance
