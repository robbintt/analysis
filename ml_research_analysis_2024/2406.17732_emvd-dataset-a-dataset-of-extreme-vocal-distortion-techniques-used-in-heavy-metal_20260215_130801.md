# EMVD dataset: a dataset of extreme vocal distortion techniques used in heavy metal

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.17732
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17732
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: 93% accuracy for binary classification, 75% accuracy for multi-class classification

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Extreme Metal Vocals Dataset (EMVD), a comprehensive collection of 760 audio recordings featuring four distinct extreme vocal distortion techniques and three vocal effects used in heavy metal music. The dataset includes recordings from 27 different singers across various pitch ranges, all performed without musical accompaniment or post-processing effects. The recordings were evaluated using a state-of-the-art deep learning model, demonstrating strong performance for binary classification between clear voice and distorted vocals, with more modest results for distinguishing between specific vocal techniques.

## Method Summary
The EMVD dataset consists of 760 audio excerpts (1-30 seconds long, ~100 minutes total) from 27 singers, featuring four distortion techniques (Black Shriek, Death Growl, Hardcore Scream, Grind Inhale) and three vocal effects (Pig Squeal, Deep Gutturals, Tunnel Throat). Audio files were converted to Mel spectrograms using 1024-sample frames with 256-sample hop length, 128 Mel bins, and frequency range 20-8000 Hz. The EfficientNet b0 model was trained with Adam optimizer (learning rate 10^-3), BCE loss for 20 epochs, and batch size 32. A 4-fold cross-validation approach was used with 20% validation split for each fold.

## Key Results
- Binary classification between clear voice and distorted vocals achieved 93% accuracy
- Multi-class classification among four vocal techniques achieved 75% accuracy
- Black Shriek technique showed the lowest classification accuracy due to overlapping characteristics with Death Growl and Hardcore Scream
- Dataset includes comprehensive metadata including singer identification, recording conditions, and quality grades

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The dataset enables accurate binary classification between clear voice and distorted vocals due to significant spectral differences.
- Mechanism: Clear voice maintains harmonic structure while extreme vocal techniques produce altered or noise-like spectral content.
- Core assumption: Spectral differences between clear and distorted vocals are consistent enough for reliable classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The model achieved a 93% accuracy for binary classification"
  - [section]: "distinguishing Clear Voice from vocal distortion techniques is expected to be much easier than differentiating between various distortion techniques, as the harmonics of Clear Voice are completely altered in the other techniques"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors are mostly unrelated to vocal classification tasks
- Break condition: If vocal techniques produce spectrograms that overlap significantly with clear voice characteristics, classification accuracy would drop.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-class classification accuracy is lower because some extreme vocal techniques share similar spectral characteristics.
- Mechanism: Black Shriek technique exhibits characteristics of both Death Growl and Hardcore Scream, making it difficult to distinguish.
- Core assumption: Vocal techniques that share production methods will have overlapping spectral features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "75% accuracy for multi-class classification"
  - [section]: "Black Shriek appears challenging to differentiate, possibly because it exhibits characteristics of both Death Growl and Hardcore Scream"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus evidence about classification challenges
- Break condition: If expert annotation can reliably separate techniques with similar production methods, classification accuracy would improve.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The dataset's diversity in singers and recording conditions enables robust model generalization.
- Mechanism: Including 27 different singers with varied recording setups prevents overfitting to specific vocal characteristics.
- Core assumption: Variation in singers and recording conditions captures the true variability of extreme metal vocals.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "These vocal recordings are from 27 different singers"
  - [section]: "Of the 27 singers involved in the project, 22 were recorded using the equipment detailed in section III-A, while 5 singers utilized their own remote recording setups"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus does not provide evidence about dataset diversity
- Break condition: If the dataset lacks representation of certain vocal ranges or techniques, model performance on those categories would suffer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spectrogram interpretation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how vocal techniques appear in spectrograms is crucial for both dataset creation and model evaluation
  - Quick check question: What spectral differences distinguish clear voice from Death Growl in a log-Mel spectrogram?

- Concept: Vocal production mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Knowledge of how extreme vocal techniques are produced helps understand why they have certain spectral characteristics
  - Quick check question: Which anatomical regions are primarily involved in producing Black Shriek versus Hardcore Scream?

- Concept: Audio preprocessing for deep learning
  - Why needed here: Proper preprocessing (normalization, windowing, mel-filterbanks) is essential for consistent model performance
  - Quick check question: Why were 1024-sample frames with 256-sample hop length chosen for this dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion → Spectrogram generation → Model training → Evaluation → Metadata grading system → Quality filtering → Dataset splitting → Remote recording management → Equipment standardization → Quality control

- Critical path:
  1. Load audio files with proper normalization
  2. Generate consistent spectrograms (1024 samples, 256 hop, 128 Mel bins)
  3. Apply quality filtering based on metadata grades
  4. Split data for cross-validation
  5. Train EfficientNet with BCE loss for classification
  6. Evaluate using accuracy metrics and confusion matrix

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Quality vs. quantity: Including only grade 1-2 files ensures quality but reduces dataset size
  - Remote vs. controlled recording: Remote recordings increase diversity but introduce variability
  - Technique coverage vs. depth: Including many techniques provides breadth but may limit samples per category

- Failure signatures:
  - Low binary classification accuracy suggests fundamental issues with spectral separation
  - High confusion between specific techniques indicates need for better feature extraction or more training data
  - Poor cross-validation performance suggests overfitting to specific singers or recording conditions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test binary classification with reduced dataset (only high-quality files) to establish baseline
  2. Experiment with different spectrogram parameters (frequency range, Mel bins) to optimize feature extraction
  3. Train separate models for each vocal range to determine if register-specific models improve performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Black Shriek technique relate to Death Growl and Hardcore Scream techniques in terms of acoustic characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "Black Shriek appears to encompass characteristics from both Death Growl and Hardcore Scream techniques, featuring localized noise typical of Hardcore Scream as well as lower, more distorted noise akin to Death Growl."
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that these characteristics depend on the singer, making it difficult to differentiate Black Shriek from the other techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further analysis and reannotation of Black Shriek audio samples by expert singers to categorize them more accurately into Death Growl or Hardcore Scream categories.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific anatomical differences in vocal production between the extreme vocal techniques described?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the techniques manifest as unconventional vibratory behaviors within the vocal tract and other larynx components, but does not provide detailed anatomical analysis.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the acoustic characteristics and classification of the techniques rather than their anatomical production.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed laryngostroboscopic imaging and acoustic analysis of the vocal tract during the production of each technique.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the EMVD dataset be used to improve automatic content labeling and real-time vocal effect processing in live performances?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that the dataset can be used for "automatic content labeling for streaming platforms" and "real-time vocal effect processing during live performances based on online detection of the vocalization type."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific applications or results of these potential uses.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of automatic content labeling systems and real-time vocal effect processing tools using the EMVD dataset.

## Limitations
- Binary classification accuracy (93%) is high, but multi-class classification accuracy (75%) shows challenges in distinguishing between similar vocal techniques
- Limited representation of remote recording setups (only 5 of 27 singers) may affect generalization to diverse recording environments
- Absence of pitch information for many recordings restricts utility for register-specific applications

## Confidence
- High confidence: Binary classification between clear voice and distorted vocals is reliable due to clear spectral differences
- Medium confidence: Multi-class classification accuracy is adequate but may not generalize to all extreme metal vocal styles
- Medium confidence: Dataset diversity is sufficient for general applications but may not capture all regional or stylistic variations

## Next Checks
1. Test the trained model on recordings from metal vocalists not included in the EMVD dataset to assess generalization capabilities
2. Compare model performance when trained only on studio recordings versus including remote recordings to quantify the impact of recording variability
3. Have professional metal vocalists manually classify samples to validate the automated grading system and identify potential misclassification patterns
