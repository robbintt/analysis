# Self-Imagine: Effective Unimodal Reasoning with Multimodal Models using Self-Imagination

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.08025
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08025
- Reference count: 40
- Improves LLAVA-1.5 by 3.1–6.9% on math reasoning and 3.2–6.0% on symbolic reasoning tasks

## Executive Summary
Self-Imagine is a novel approach that enables unimodal reasoning with multimodal models through self-imagination. The method uses a single vision-language model (VLM) to transform text-based reasoning problems into HTML representations, render them as images, and then solve the problems using both the original question and the generated image. This approach achieves significant performance improvements on mathematical reasoning tasks without requiring additional training data or model fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The Self-Imagine method leverages the multimodal capabilities of VLMs in an unconventional way. First, it converts text-based reasoning problems into HTML format, which can represent structured information, mathematical notation, and visual layouts. The HTML is then rendered as an image using standard web technologies. Finally, the same VLM that generated the HTML uses both the original question and the rendered image to solve the reasoning problem. This self-referential approach effectively transforms unimodal text problems into multimodal inputs that better leverage the VLM's visual reasoning capabilities.

## Key Results
- Boosts LLAVA-1.5 performance by 3.1–6.9% on three math reasoning tasks
- Improves LLAVA-1.5 by 3.2–6.0% on average across nine symbolic reasoning tasks
- Enhances GEMINI PRO by 4.5–9.3% on math reasoning tasks
- Mixed results observed for GEMINI PRO on symbolic reasoning tasks, with some tasks showing degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the multimodal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through visual representation of structured information. By converting text problems into HTML and rendering them as images, the approach taps into the VLM's ability to process visual patterns, spatial relationships, and structured layouts. This visual encoding can capture semantic relationships and hierarchies more effectively than raw text alone, particularly for problems involving mathematical notation, tables, or structured data.

## Foundational Learning
- Vision-Language Models (VLMs): AI models that can process both visual and textual information; needed because they provide the foundation for multimodal reasoning; quick check: verify model supports both image and text input/output
- HTML as Intermediate Representation: Web markup language used to structure information; needed because it can represent complex layouts, mathematical notation, and tables; quick check: validate HTML accurately captures problem structure
- Image Rendering from HTML: Process of converting HTML to visual format; needed because VLMs process visual information more effectively than raw HTML code; quick check: ensure rendered image preserves all semantic information
- Zero-shot Learning: Model inference without additional training; needed because Self-Imagine doesn't require fine-tuning; quick check: confirm no model parameters are modified
- Multimodal Reasoning: Problem-solving using multiple input modalities; needed because combining text and visual information improves reasoning; quick check: verify performance gains on multimodal vs unimodal approaches

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Question Text -> HTML Generator -> Image Renderer -> VLM Input (Question + Image) -> Answer

**Critical Path:** The pipeline's success depends on the HTML generator's ability to accurately represent the problem structure and the image renderer's ability to preserve this structure visually. The VLM must then effectively integrate information from both the original question and the rendered image.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Uses zero-shot learning (no training data needed) but performance is bounded by VLM capabilities; HTML representation may not capture all problem types effectively; method adds computational overhead through image rendering.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degrades when HTML cannot adequately represent problem complexity; image quality issues lead to reasoning errors; symbolic reasoning tasks show mixed results indicating domain-specific limitations.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test HTML generation on diverse problem types to ensure accurate structural representation
2. Verify image rendering preserves all semantic information from HTML
3. Compare VLM performance on raw text vs text-plus-image inputs for simple problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance gains are highly task-dependent, with no improvement on visual reasoning problems
- Mixed results on symbolic reasoning tasks, with some showing performance degradation
- Success depends on the VLM's ability to accurately render HTML as images, which may fail for complex layouts
- Method may not generalize well to problems requiring specialized mathematical notation or diagrams

## Confidence
**High confidence:** Performance improvements on math reasoning tasks are consistent and well-documented across multiple benchmarks.

**Medium confidence:** Mixed results on symbolic reasoning tasks and lack of improvement on visual reasoning tasks suggest clear limitations that are not fully explained.

**Low confidence:** Generalizability to other reasoning domains beyond those tested remains unclear, as does scalability to more complex problem types.

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on additional mathematical domains including calculus and statistics problems to verify consistency of improvements across broader mathematical reasoning tasks
2. Evaluate performance on problems requiring specialized mathematical notation or diagrams that may be difficult to represent in HTML
3. Compare results against task-specific fine-tuned models to quantify the trade-off between zero-shot nature and potentially higher performance from specialized training
