# Linguistic Structure Induction from Language Models

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: StructFormer effectively induces syntactic trees from transformer encoders using syntactic distance

## Executive Summary
This thesis investigates methods for inducing syntactic structures from pre-trained language models, focusing on constituency and dependency tree representations. The StructFormer model, which retrofits transformer encoders with a parser network using syntactic distance, is systematically studied and extended through architectural modifications and subword tokenization analysis. The research includes reproduction of prior results, evaluation of parser network positioning, benchmarking on the BabyLM challenge, and comparative analysis against vanilla transformer baselines. The findings demonstrate that structure induction is feasible and can improve masked language modeling while showing mixed results on syntax-specific downstream tasks.

## Method Summary
The research centers on StructFormer, a model that retrofits transformer encoders with a parser network to induce syntactic structures using syntactic distance. The thesis extends this work through several experiments: reproducing baseline StructFormer results, analyzing the impact of repositioning the parser network within the architecture, evaluating subword-based tokenization for structure induction, and benchmarking on the BabyLM challenge. The approach involves training language models with architectural modifications that enable syntactic tree extraction, then evaluating both the structural quality and downstream linguistic task performance. Key experiments compare StructFormer variants against vanilla transformers across multiple metrics including masked language modeling and syntax-specific tasks.

## Key Results
- StructFormer effectively induces syntactic constituency and dependency trees from transformer encoders
- StructFormer outperforms vanilla transformers in masked language modeling and some linguistic tasks
- Performance on syntax-specific tasks shows mixed results despite structural quality improvements
- Subword tokenization provides benefits for structure induction capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The StructFormer model works by integrating a parser network directly into the transformer architecture, allowing it to generate syntactic trees through syntactic distance calculations. The parser network learns to predict the distance between tokens in the syntactic tree, which can then be converted into tree structures. By retrofitting existing transformer encoders rather than training from scratch, the model leverages pre-trained language understanding while adding explicit structural capabilities. The syntactic distance formulation provides a differentiable way to represent hierarchical relationships, enabling gradient-based optimization of both language modeling and structure induction objectives simultaneously.

## Foundational Learning

**Transformer Architecture**: Why needed - forms the base language model; Quick check - verify self-attention and feed-forward layers are correctly implemented

**Syntactic Distance**: Why needed - provides differentiable representation of tree structure; Quick check - confirm distance values correlate with tree depth

**Constituency vs Dependency Trees**: Why needed - different structural representations for linguistic analysis; Quick check - verify both tree types can be extracted from model outputs

**Masked Language Modeling**: Why needed - standard pretraining objective for evaluation; Quick check - ensure masking strategy follows standard practices

**Parser Metrics**: Why needed - quantitative evaluation of structural quality; Quick check - validate metrics align with linguistic annotation standards

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Transformer Encoder -> Parser Network -> Syntactic Distance Output -> Tree Extraction

**Critical Path**: Input tokens flow through transformer layers, then through parser network to generate syntactic distances, which are converted to tree structures

**Design Tradeoffs**: The retrofit approach preserves pre-trained language knowledge but adds architectural complexity; syntactic distance enables differentiability but may not capture all linguistic phenomena

**Failure Signatures**: Poor structural quality indicated by low parser metric scores; language modeling degradation suggests interference between objectives

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify StructFormer can reproduce baseline syntactic tree extraction on standard treebanks
2. Test parser network repositioning effects on structural quality metrics
3. Evaluate masked language modeling performance against vanilla transformer baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Syntactic distance formulations may not generalize across languages or treebanks
- Subword tokenization introduces potential biases in structural analysis
- Mixed performance on syntax-specific downstream tasks despite structural improvements
- Structural quality assessment depends heavily on parser metrics that may not capture full linguistic validity

## Confidence

**High confidence**: StructFormer's ability to induce syntactic trees from pre-trained transformers
**Medium confidence**: Relative performance improvements across different architectural variants
**Medium confidence**: Benefits of subword tokenization for structure induction
**Low confidence**: Robustness of syntax-specific task performance improvements

## Next Checks

1. Cross-linguistic evaluation of StructFormer variants on typologically diverse treebanks
2. Ablation studies isolating impact of syntactic distance formulation choices
3. Comparison against contemporary structure induction approaches using identical training data and protocols
