# Taylor Videos for Action Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.03019
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03019

- Primary result: Taylor videos achieve competitive action recognition accuracy compared to RGB videos and optical flow, with computational efficiency benefits

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes Taylor videos, a new video format for action recognition that highlights dominant motion patterns by applying Taylor series expansion to an implicit motion-extraction function over temporal video blocks. The method computes displacement, velocity, and acceleration channels by summing higher-order difference frames, effectively removing static objects and emphasizing dominant motions. Taylor videos are shown to be effective inputs for various action recognition architectures including 2D CNNs, 3D CNNs, and transformers, achieving competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets while being computationally more efficient than optical flow.

## Method Summary
Taylor videos are computed by performing Taylor series expansion on an implicit motion-extraction function defined over temporal video blocks. The method computes higher-order difference frames within each block and sums them to approximate the function at the starting frame, resulting in frames that emphasize dominant motion patterns while removing static content. The resulting Taylor frames contain three channels representing displacement, velocity, and acceleration. These videos can be used as input to existing action recognition architectures, either individually or in combination with RGB videos and optical flow, providing a computationally efficient alternative for motion representation.

## Key Results
- Taylor videos achieve 78.1% top-1 accuracy on HMDB-51 with I3D pretrained on Kinetics, outperforming RGB (74.3%) and optical flow (77.3%)
- The method is significantly faster to compute than optical flow due to in-place matrix operations
- Taylor videos are complementary to RGB and optical flow, with combined modalities yielding additional accuracy improvements
- Effective compression of redundant information reduces storage requirements compared to other video formats

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Taylor videos improve action recognition accuracy by emphasizing dominant motion patterns and removing static content.
- Mechanism: Taylor series expansion applied to motion-extraction function over temporal video block, summing higher-order difference frames to highlight dominant motions while suppressing static objects and small/unstable motions.
- Core assumption: Dominant motion patterns are sufficient for action recognition and static content is redundant or detrimental.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states Taylor videos yield competitive accuracy compared to RGB and optical flow; paper section confirms summation of higher-order terms gives dominant motion patterns where static objects and small motions are removed.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Taylor videos provide computationally efficient alternative to optical flow for motion representation.
- Mechanism: Taylor frames computed using in-place matrix operations (differences and higher-order differences of frames) rather than iterative optimization used in optical flow methods.
- Core assumption: Frame differencing is sufficient approximation of motion for action recognition and is computationally cheaper than optical flow.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states Taylor videos are much faster to compute due to in-place matrix operations and are not subject to computing errors due to mathematical nature.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Taylor videos are complementary to RGB videos and optical flow, leading to improved accuracy when combined.
- Mechanism: Taylor videos capture motion information (displacement, velocity, acceleration) that is complementary to spatial and appearance information in RGB videos and pixel displacement information in optical flow.
- Core assumption: Motion information and appearance information are complementary for action recognition.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states when fused with RGB or optical flow videos, further accuracy improvement is achieved.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Taylor series and its application to video processing
  - Why needed here: Taylor videos are named after and inspired by Taylor series, which is used to approximate the motion-extraction function over a temporal video block.
  - Quick check question: How does Taylor series help in approximating the motion-extraction function in Taylor videos?

- Concept: Motion concepts (displacement, velocity, acceleration) and their representation in videos
  - Why needed here: Taylor videos capture these three motion concepts in separate channels, which are then used as input to action recognition models.
  - Quick check question: What are the three motion concepts captured by Taylor videos, and how are they computed?

- Concept: Frame differencing and its use in motion estimation
  - Why needed here: Taylor videos are computed using differences and higher-order differences of frames, which is a form of frame differencing.
  - Quick check question: How does frame differencing help in estimating motion in videos?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: RGB video -> Taylor video conversion -> Action recognition model (2D CNN/3D CNN/transformer) -> Action class predictions
- Critical path: 1) Convert RGB video to Taylor video by computing Taylor frames 2) Feed Taylor video to action recognition model 3) Fine-tune or train model on Taylor video input 4) Evaluate model performance on action recognition task
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Taylor videos vs. RGB videos: Taylor videos remove static content but lose spatial detail
  - Taylor videos vs. optical flow: Taylor videos are faster to compute but may be less accurate for complex motion
  - Taylor videos with different numbers of terms: More terms capture more motion detail but increase computation cost
- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy on datasets with subtle motions or significant camera motion
  - High computational cost for long temporal blocks or many Taylor terms
  - Poor performance when fine-tuning models pretrained on RGB videos
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compute Taylor videos from a sample RGB video and visualize the Taylor frames to verify the motion patterns are captured correctly.
  2. Fine-tune a pre-trained action recognition model (e.g., I3D) on Taylor videos and evaluate the accuracy on a benchmark dataset (e.g., HMDB-51).
  3. Combine Taylor videos with RGB videos or optical flow and evaluate the accuracy improvement on the same benchmark dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Taylor video method perform on other video-based tasks beyond action recognition, such as video captioning or anomaly detection?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that Taylor videos do not encode much static texture pattern, making them less suitable for tasks like video captioning and anomaly detection.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the Taylor video method on action recognition tasks and does not explore its performance on other video-based tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the Taylor video method to video captioning and anomaly detection tasks, comparing its performance to other state-of-the-art methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the Taylor video method be extended to capture higher-order motion concepts beyond acceleration, such as jerk or snap?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses the possibility of computing more motion concepts in Taylor videos but notes that it would require heavier computation and modifications to the model architecture.
- Why unresolved: The paper only computes three motion concepts (displacement, velocity, and acceleration) in Taylor videos and does not explore the potential benefits of capturing higher-order motion concepts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of Taylor videos with different numbers of motion concepts, analyzing the trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the Taylor video method compare to other motion-based video representation methods, such as Dynamic Images or Motion Images, in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy?
- Basis in paper: The paper compares Taylor videos to RGB videos and optical flow but does not directly compare it to other motion-based video representation methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the Taylor video method to other state-of-the-art motion-based video representation methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the computational efficiency and accuracy of the Taylor video method to other motion-based video representation methods on various action recognition datasets.

## Limitations

- The specific form and properties of the implicit motion-extraction function are not explicitly defined, creating uncertainty about generalizability
- The paper lacks detailed ablation studies on the impact of different numbers of Taylor terms or temporal block sizes
- No direct empirical evidence or visualization provided to confirm that static content and small/unstable motions are effectively removed

## Confidence

- High confidence: Taylor videos can be effectively used as input to existing action recognition architectures (2D CNNs, 3D CNNs, transformers)
- Medium confidence: Taylor videos are complementary to RGB and optical flow, with combined modalities improving accuracy
- Low confidence: Taylor videos effectively remove static content and small/unstable motions based on mathematical intuition

## Next Checks

1. Visualize Taylor frames from sample videos to qualitatively assess whether static content and small/unstable motions are effectively removed and dominant motion patterns are highlighted.
2. Conduct an ablation study to evaluate the impact of different numbers of Taylor terms on action recognition accuracy and determine the optimal number of terms.
3. Apply the Taylor video method to a diverse set of action recognition datasets, including those with subtle motions or significant camera motion, to assess generalizability and limitations.
