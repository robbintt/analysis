# Human-In-The-Loop Machine Learning for Safe and Ethical Autonomous Vehicles: Principles, Challenges, and Opportunities

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.12548
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12548
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: This paper reviews HITL-ML for AVs, focusing on CL, HITL-RL, AL, and ethical principles to improve performance and safety.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores the critical role of Human-In-The-Loop Machine Learning (HITL-ML) in developing safe and ethical autonomous vehicles. While machine learning has advanced significantly, achieving full autonomy in complex driving scenarios remains challenging. The authors argue that human involvement through techniques like Curriculum Learning, Human-In-The-Loop Reinforcement Learning, and Active Learning is essential for improving AV performance, particularly in unfamiliar or complex situations. The paper emphasizes integrating ethical principles into AV systems to ensure alignment with societal values and norms.

## Method Summary
The paper reviews various HITL-ML techniques for autonomous vehicles, including Curriculum Learning for structured task progression, Human-In-The-Loop Reinforcement Learning for incorporating human feedback through reward shaping and action injection, and Active Learning for optimizing the annotation process. The methods involve using simulation environments like CARLA, integrating human expertise for validation and guidance, and applying ethical frameworks to AV decision-making. The approach emphasizes real-world deployment with human oversight to ensure safety and ethical compliance.

## Key Results
- Human-defined rewards in reward shaping improve AV learning in complex urban scenarios
- Action injection by human experts ensures safe and effective AV navigation in critical situations
- Interactive learning with human trainers improves AV learning efficiency and performance
- Active Learning optimizes the annotation process and enhances system robustness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Human-defined rewards in reward shaping improve AV learning in complex urban scenarios.
- Mechanism: Environmental rewards (e.g., lane keeping) are insufficient for unfamiliar traffic rules. Human-defined rewards supplement environmental rewards to encode region-specific behaviors (e.g., yielding to pedestrians crossing outside crosswalks).
- Core assumption: Human rewards can be effectively designed and integrated into RL algorithms to guide AVs in complex scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The AV's ML model initially relies on its standard environmental rewards, such as staying in its lane, obeying traffic signs and avoiding obstacles. However, in this unfamiliar situation, the model's performance begins to degrade, in this case it can request human assistance to refine its understanding of the situation. A human operator, aware of local driving habits and cultural nuances, could then supplement the ML model's environmental rewards with human-defined rewards."
  - [section]: "In reward shaping, the environmental reward is supplemented with human-defined rewards to guide learning. HITL can switch between multiple UAV reward functions in different situations and assist in constructing interactive reward functions."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for this specific claim. Assumption: Human-defined rewards can be effectively designed and integrated.
- Break condition: Human-defined rewards are not available or not effective in guiding AVs in complex scenarios.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Action injection by human experts ensures safe and effective AV navigation in critical situations.
- Mechanism: Human operators can intervene and inject actions when the AV's RL algorithm is uncertain or makes dangerous decisions. This allows the AV to navigate safely and effectively despite unexpected challenges.
- Core assumption: Human experts can effectively identify critical situations and inject appropriate actions to guide the AV.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A human operator, aware of local driving habits and cultural nuances, could then supplement the ML model's environmental rewards with human-defined rewards. For example, the human might adjust the reward structure to prioritize yielding to pedestrians who are likely to cross the street outside of designated crosswalks, a behavior common in that region but not explicitly covered by the original training data."
  - [section]: "The human can inject his/her action and guide the agent in critical situations, ensuring that the AVs navigates safely and effectively despite unexpected challenges."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for this specific claim. Assumption: Human experts can effectively identify critical situations and inject appropriate actions.
- Break condition: Human experts are not available or not able to effectively identify and respond to critical situations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Interactive learning with human trainers improves AV learning efficiency and performance.
- Mechanism: AVs and human trainers interact and cooperate to solve tasks. Human trainers can supplement environmental rewards and guide learning objectives to improve learning efficiency and RL performance.
- Core assumption: Human trainers can effectively provide guidance and feedback to improve AV learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The AV's ML model initially relies on its standard environmental rewards, such as staying in its lane, obeying traffic signs and avoiding obstacles. However, in this unfamiliar situation, the model's performance begins to degrade, in this case it can request human assistance to refine its understanding of the situation."
  - [section]: "The agent and human trainer can interact and cooperate to solve tasks. For example, human can supplement environmental reward and guide learning objectives to improve learning efficiency and RL performance."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for this specific claim. Assumption: Human trainers can effectively provide guidance and feedback.
- Break condition: Human trainers are not available or not able to effectively provide guidance and feedback.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning (RL)
  - Why needed here: RL is the foundation for training AVs to make decisions in complex environments. HITL-ML techniques like reward shaping, action injection, and interactive learning are applied to enhance RL algorithms.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of an RL algorithm and how do they work together to enable an agent to learn from its environment?

- Concept: Machine Learning (ML)
  - Why needed here: ML algorithms are used to interpret sensor data, predict potential hazards, and optimize navigation strategies for AVs. HITL-ML techniques are applied to improve the effectiveness of these ML algorithms.
  - Quick check question: What are the different types of ML algorithms and how are they used in AV applications?

- Concept: Curriculum Learning (CL)
  - Why needed here: CL is a technique for structuring the training process by starting with simpler tasks and gradually progressing to more complex ones. This helps AVs build foundational skills before tackling more difficult scenarios.
  - Quick check question: How does CL improve the learning efficiency and performance of AVs compared to traditional ML approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ML model for decision-making -> Human validation and annotation -> Model training with CL -> Real-world deployment with ethical considerations
- Critical path: Develop ML model -> Apply human validation and annotation -> Train model with CL -> Deploy model in real-world
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing human effort and machine autonomy, ensuring timely human intervention, managing the complexity of HITL-ML systems
- Failure signatures: AVs not responding appropriately to unexpected situations, human operators not able to effectively intervene in critical situations, ML models not generalizing well to new environments
- First 3 experiments: 1) Test reward shaping in a simulated urban environment with unfamiliar traffic rules, 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of action injection in a critical situation simulation, 3) Assess the impact of interactive learning on AV learning efficiency and performance
