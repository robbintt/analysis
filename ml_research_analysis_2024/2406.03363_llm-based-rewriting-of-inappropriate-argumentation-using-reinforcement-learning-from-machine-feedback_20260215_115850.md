# LLM-based Rewriting of Inappropriate Argumentation using Reinforcement Learning from Machine Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.03363
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03363
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: RLHF approach for rewriting inappropriate arguments that significantly improves appropriateness while preserving content

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a reinforcement learning from machine feedback (RLHF) approach to rewrite inappropriate arguments by balancing content preservation and appropriateness. The method uses an instruction-finetuned large language model (LLM) as an initial policy, which is then optimized via proximal policy optimization (PPO) using classifier-based rewards for semantic similarity and appropriateness. Experiments on non-parallel data demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines in mitigating inappropriateness while preserving content, with human evaluations preferring rewrites that prioritize appropriateness over strict semantic similarity.

## Method Summary
The approach begins with prompting an instruction-finetuned LLaMA model to generate initial rewrites of inappropriate arguments using top-p sampling. Few-shot and instruction-finetuning variants are evaluated to select the best initial policy. The selected policy is then trained using PPO with a reward combining semantic similarity and appropriateness classifiers, plus a KL divergence penalty. The method is evaluated using automatic metrics including appropriateness flip rate, BERTScore, normalized edit similarity, perplexity, and geometric mean, along with human studies for relative and absolute quality assessment.

## Key Results
- RLHF approach significantly outperforms baselines in mitigating inappropriateness while preserving content
- Human evaluations prefer rewrites that prioritize appropriateness over strict semantic similarity
- Classifier-based reward model effectively guides policy toward desired properties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The RLHF approach works by iteratively refining an initial instruction-finetuned LLM policy through feedback signals that balance two competing objectives: preserving the original argument's semantic content while improving its appropriateness. The classifier-based reward model provides differentiable signals for both semantic similarity (ensuring content preservation) and appropriateness (ensuring the rewrite is suitable), allowing the policy to navigate the trade-off between these objectives during PPO training.

## Foundational Learning

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Why needed: Stable RL algorithm for policy optimization that avoids destructive policy updates
- Quick check: PPO's clipped objective prevents large policy updates that could degrade performance

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Why needed: Framework for aligning language models with human preferences through iterative feedback
- Quick check: RLHF has been successfully applied to align LLMs for helpfulness and harmlessness

Instruction Finetuning
- Why needed: Enables LLMs to follow natural language instructions for specific tasks like argument rewriting
- Quick check: Instruction-tuned models show better zero-shot and few-shot performance on downstream tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Corpus -> Initial Policy (Instruct-Finetuned LLaMA) -> PPO Training -> Optimized Policy -> Evaluation

Critical Path: Inappropriate argument → Initial rewrite generation → Reward calculation (similarity + appropriateness) → PPO update → Final rewrite

Design Tradeoffs: Balancing semantic similarity preservation against appropriateness improvement requires careful reward weighting; using classifier-based rewards instead of human feedback enables scalable training but may introduce reward hacking risks.

Failure Signatures: Poor initial policy performance due to suboptimal prompting or few-shot examples leads to ineffective RL alignment; classifier performance degradation on extended dataset causes reward model misalignment.

First Experiments:
1. Prompt instruct-finetuned LLaMA with few-shot examples to generate initial rewrites and evaluate quality
2. Train PPO policy with different reward weightings to find optimal balance between similarity and appropriateness
3. Compare automatic metrics (App., Sim., NES, PPL, GM) between initial and RL-optimized policies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Unknown PPO hyperparameters (learning rate schedule, batch size, KL divergence coefficient) affect reproducibility
- Adapter-based LoRA configuration details are unspecified
- Reliance on classifier-based rewards rather than human feedback during training introduces uncertainty about alignment with human judgment

## Confidence
High confidence in achieving core technical goal of mitigating inappropriate language while preserving content through RLHF.
Medium confidence in generalizing across diverse inappropriate argument types given evaluation on specific corpus.
Medium confidence in classifier-based reward model effectiveness, dependent on classifier quality and potential distribution shifts.

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the approach using the same corpus and instruction-finetuned LLaMA model to verify claimed improvements in appropriateness flip rate and BERTScore
2. Evaluate the trained policy on a held-out test set with different argument types to assess generalization
3. Compare the RL-optimized policy against ablations using only semantic similarity or only appropriateness rewards to validate the benefit of the balanced approach
