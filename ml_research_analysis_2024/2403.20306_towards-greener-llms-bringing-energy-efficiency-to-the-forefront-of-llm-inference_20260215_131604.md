# Towards Greener LLMs: Bringing Energy-Efficiency to the Forefront of LLM Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.20306
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20306
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GPU frequency scaling can reduce power consumption by up to 20% with minimal performance impact

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates energy efficiency trade-offs in large language model (LLM) inference serving. The study characterizes the impact of workload types, batching, and tensor parallelism on latency, throughput, and energy consumption. Key findings include that GPU frequency scaling can reduce power consumption by up to 20% with minimal performance impact, and that different configurations are optimal for different workload types. The study also reveals that energy efficiency is not always correlated with cost or performance, suggesting opportunities for optimization in LLM serving platforms.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates energy efficiency trade-offs in LLM inference serving using a systematic approach. Researchers examine the effects of workload types, batching strategies, and tensor parallelism configurations on latency, throughput, and energy consumption. The methodology involves empirical testing across different operational scenarios to identify optimal configurations for various use cases. The paper focuses on GPU-based inference serving, measuring performance metrics under controlled conditions to quantify energy savings potential.

## Key Results
- GPU frequency scaling can reduce power consumption by up to 20% with minimal performance impact
- Energy efficiency is not always correlated with cost or performance in LLM serving
- Different configurations are optimal for different workload types, suggesting need for adaptive serving strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The energy efficiency improvements stem from the relationship between GPU operating frequency and power consumption. GPUs exhibit non-linear power scaling with frequency, where moderate frequency reductions yield substantial power savings while maintaining acceptable performance levels. The decoupling of energy efficiency from cost and performance metrics occurs because power consumption patterns differ from throughput characteristics across various serving configurations. Workload-specific optimizations work because different request patterns interact differently with batching and parallelism mechanisms, creating opportunities for targeted energy savings.

## Foundational Learning

**GPU Frequency Scaling** - Understanding how GPU clock frequencies affect power consumption and performance is essential because it reveals opportunities for energy savings without significant performance degradation. Quick check: Verify power vs. frequency curves for target GPU models.

**Batch Processing in LLM Inference** - Batching multiple requests together improves throughput but may increase latency, making it crucial to understand the trade-offs for different workload patterns. Quick check: Measure throughput improvements vs. latency increases at different batch sizes.

**Tensor Parallelism** - Distributing model computations across multiple GPUs can improve performance but affects energy consumption patterns differently than frequency scaling alone. Quick check: Compare energy consumption between single-GPU and multi-GPU inference setups.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: User Requests -> Load Balancer -> Batching Layer -> Tensor Parallelism Module -> GPU Execution -> Energy Monitoring

Critical path: Request reception → Batching decision → Model inference → Response generation. The most time-sensitive components are the batching layer and GPU execution, as they directly impact latency and energy consumption.

Design tradeoffs: The primary tension exists between latency and energy efficiency - aggressive batching improves energy efficiency but increases latency. Tensor parallelism offers performance benefits but may increase overall energy consumption due to inter-GPU communication overhead.

Failure signatures: Energy inefficiency typically manifests as suboptimal frequency settings, improper batch sizing for workload patterns, or unnecessary tensor parallelism overhead. Performance degradation may indicate insufficient GPU resources or communication bottlenecks.

First experiments:
1. Measure power consumption across GPU frequency settings at fixed batch sizes
2. Characterize latency-throughput trade-offs for different batch sizes
3. Compare energy efficiency between single-GPU and tensor-parallel configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Focus on a limited set of workloads and configurations that may not generalize to all LLM serving scenarios
- Results based on specific hardware and software setups with unclear applicability to other systems
- Does not address energy consumption of model training, a significant component of overall LLM energy footprint

## Confidence
High confidence in GPU frequency scaling finding (20% power reduction with minimal performance impact) based on empirical data.

Medium confidence in broader claim that energy efficiency is not always correlated with cost or performance, as this is based on limited experiments and may not hold across all scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. Test GPU frequency scaling findings on a wider range of LLM models and hardware configurations to assess generalizability
2. Conduct experiments with additional workload types and serving patterns to validate observed energy efficiency trade-offs
3. Compare energy consumption of different LLM serving platforms under varying operational conditions to confirm cost-performance-energy relationship conclusions
