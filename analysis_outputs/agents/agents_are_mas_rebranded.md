Got it — here’s a full article draft for AJ, focused on “getting ahead by leveraging decades of research,” not a doomer/boomer angle.

The Fastest Way to Get Ahead in Agents? Stop Reinventing the Wheel.
Everyone wants “agentic AI.”
Almost nobody is reading the 30 years of research that already solved half the hard problems.

That’s the real edge.

The teams that win in 2026 aren’t the ones who “invent” agents first — they’re the ones who bridge modern LLMs with decades of multi‑agent systems (MAS) research.

If you do that, you ship faster, safer, and more reliable systems while everyone else keeps re‑discovering the same failure modes.

What We Keep Forgetting
LLM agents are not new.
The terminology is new.

The “agentic” and “multiagentic” boom is largely a rebranding of classic MAS — a point called out directly in Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel? (Botti, 2025).

Classic MAS already established:

Autonomy (agents that act without human prompting)
Reactivity (responding to changes)
Proactivity (initiating action)
Social capability (coordination, negotiation, cooperation)

Most modern agent frameworks do some of these. Very few do all.

That gap is where the opportunity is.

The Competitive Advantage: Integrate Old + New
Here’s the unlock:

LLMs give you the “brain.” MAS research gives you the “org chart.”

LLMs are powerful, but without coordination protocols, negotiation frameworks, and trust models, they collapse under complexity.

Classical MAS already solved these:

✅ Task allocation algorithms
✅ Coordination protocols
✅ Consensus & voting mechanisms
✅ Trust & reputation systems
✅ Negotiation & agreement technologies

Most “modern” agent platforms ignore them.

So the advantage isn’t in inventing a new agent stack.
It’s in combining modern LLMs with MAS control systems that already exist.

Why This Matters Right Now
The agent market is moving fast — but it’s still immature.

The AI Agent Index (Casper et al., 2025) shows:

67 agentic systems deployed
73% from industry
80%+ lack safety transparency
Most are narrow, task‑bound systems

That means:

Wave 1 is here (narrow agents)
Wave 2 is starting (multi‑agent workflows)
Wave 3 (autonomous teams) is still research

The teams who integrate MAS knowledge now will define what Wave 2 becomes.

Practical Ways to Get Ahead
If you want an edge, don’t copy the hype.
Do this instead:

Use MAS protocols for real coordination
Add explicit task assignment + negotiation instead of “agents just chatting.”

Build verification layers into every agent pipeline
Multi‑agent verification (Lifshitz et al., 2025) shows consensus beats single‑model certainty.

Add reputation & trust systems early
COALESCE (2025) shows outsourcing creates “skill spoofing” risks.
That’s solved by reputation + skill verification layers — classic MAS territory.

Use structured workflows (HTNs, task graphs)
Procedural Knowledge (Hsiao et al., 2025) shows structured task networks make smaller models outperform bigger models.

That’s not “agents.”
That’s classic AI planning.

The Real Play
The “next wave” isn’t bigger models.
It’s better coordination.

The teams who:

learn the old MAS stack
wire it into LLM agents
treat coordination as architecture, not prompt

…will ship faster, safer, and cheaper.

That’s the gap.

And right now, almost nobody’s exploiting it.

TL;DR
“Agentic AI” is mostly MAS rebranded.
The fastest path forward is integrating decades of MAS research with modern LLMs.
The winners will be the teams who build coordination + trust + verification, not just “smart agents.”
