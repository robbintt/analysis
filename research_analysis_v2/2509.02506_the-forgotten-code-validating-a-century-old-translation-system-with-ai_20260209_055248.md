- Primary result: AI-generated translations using Federico Pucci's 1931 rule-based system closely matched his original French translations of Dante's La Vita Nuova

## Executive Summary
This study validates Federico Pucci's 1931 rule-based translation system by reproducing his Italian-to-French translation of Dante's La Vita Nuova using modern AI models. The AI-generated translations closely matched Pucci's original, with only minor variations, demonstrating the system's coherence and foresight. The research positions Pucci as a pioneering precursor to machine translation, highlighting his symbolic interlingua and rule-based approach. By showing how his method anticipates modern computational principles, the study underscores the historical significance of Pucci's work and calls for a reevaluation of overlooked contributions in the history of language technologies.

## Method Summary
The study digitally encoded Pucci's Charts A and B (grammatical function ideograms and verbal tense/mood markers) and submitted them to modern LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, Grok 3, GPT-5, Grok 4) with prompts to translate a Dante excerpt using Pucci's method. The AI systems were instructed to implicitly rebuild Pucci's symbolic rule-based system from the provided charts. The outputs were compared to Pucci's 1931 French translation using BLEU, chrF, and METEOR metrics, along with quantitative text comparison (removals/additions) and qualitative literary evaluation.

## Key Results
- AI-generated translations closely matched Pucci's original French translation with only minor variations
- ChatGPT-5 achieved BLEU score of 67.45, chrF of 85.60, and METEOR of 82.62 against Pucci's reference
- Quantitative divergence metrics showed Pucci's framework produces systematically distinct outputs from modern NMT systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Modern LLMs can infer and apply Pucci's rule-based symbolic system from minimal structured input. When provided with Pucci's Charts A and B, the AI systems performed implicit rule reconstruction—mapping grammatical categories to symbolic codes and applying them consistently to input text without explicit procedural programming.

### Mechanism 2
Pucci's symbolic interlingua produces translations structurally similar to modern neural MT outputs. His three-step process—morphological decomposition, symbolic interlingual encoding, target-language reconstruction—operates similarly to encoder-decoder architectures in NMT, where intermediate representations mediate between source and target.

### Mechanism 3
Quantitative divergence metrics (removals/additions) reveal methodological signatures across translation systems. The study operationalizes word-level differences between version pairs, showing Group 1 (NMT vs. NMT) has lowest variation while Groups 2–3 (Pucci-trained and Pucci original) show ~48–52 changes—an 11% elevation suggesting Pucci's framework produces systematically distinct outputs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT)**: Pucci's system is explicitly classified as an RBMT precursor; understanding symbolic rules, grammatical encoding, and dictionary-based transfer is essential to interpret Charts A/B and the three-step process.

- **BLEU, chrF, and METEOR evaluation metrics**: The study's quantitative claims rest on these metrics; understanding what n-gram overlap (BLEU), character-level matching (chrF), and synonym/stemming awareness (METEOR) measure clarifies why Pucci scores highest against ChatGPT-5 vs. human translators.

- **Interlingual representation in MT**: Pucci's ideogram system functions as a symbolic interlingua; this concept connects his work to modern interlingua-based MT architectures and explains the convergence finding.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Chart A (grammatical function ideograms) -> Chart B (verbal tense/mood ideograms) -> Encoding layer (ideogram substitution) -> Decoding layer (target-language reconstruction)
- **Critical path**: 1. Simplify input (plain language preprocessing) -> 2. Encode using Charts A/B -> 3. Transfer via dictionary lookup -> 4. Decode with syntactic reordering
- **Design tradeoffs**: Literal fidelity vs. stylistic fluency; Romance-language optimization vs. universal applicability; Human post-editing vs. fully automatic
- **Failure signatures**: "Aux mes yeux" error (incorrect article+preposition contraction); Low BLEU against literary translations; Higher variance in Groups 2–3
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Replicate encoding on new Romance-language input (Spanish→Italian) -> 2. Ablate the "plain language" preprocessing step -> 3. Extend Chart A/B to a non-Romance language (German) and identify modification requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How robust is Pucci's method when applied to modern and technical texts using AI? The study confines its detailed comparative metrics to the literary Dante excerpt, despite noting general consistency for technical texts in the abstract.

### Open Question 2
Can Pucci's symbolic method be adapted for non-Romance languages to provide a universalizable translation approach? The study validates the system only for Romance languages (Italian/French); the structural adaptability to Germanic or Slavic languages remains unproven empirically.

### Open Question 3
Can AI function as a general tool to restore forgotten or marginalized contributions to scientific history? This research presents a single case study of Pucci; it remains unknown if this "AI resurrection" methodology is applicable or effective for other lost theoretical designs.

## Limitations
- Validation relies on comparing AI-generated outputs against a single reference translation rather than multiple human translations
- The exact prompt engineering and intermediate encoding outputs are not fully specified, making systematic reproduction challenging
- The "plain language" preprocessing step's impact on final output quality is not quantified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The convergence of Pucci's symbolic interlingual approach with modern NMT architectures
- **Medium Confidence**: The ability of modern LLMs to implicitly reconstruct rule-based systems from minimal structured input
- **Medium Confidence**: The methodological distinctiveness of Pucci's framework revealed through quantitative divergence metrics

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the encoding process with full transparency by documenting exact prompt text, intermediate ideogram-encoded outputs, and structured representation of Charts A/B
2. Test generalization beyond Romance languages by extending validation to a non-Romance language pair (e.g., Spanish→German) using modified Charts A/B
3. Ablate the preprocessing step by systematically varying or removing the "plain language" preprocessing to measure its quantitative impact on BLEU/chrF scores and edit distances
