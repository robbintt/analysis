# Model Consistency as a Cheap yet Predictive Proxy for LLM Elo Scores

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.23510
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23510
- **Reference count:** 14
- **Primary result:** Consistency score achieves 91% correlation with human Elo scores using minimal human input

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method to evaluate LLM intelligence without human input by measuring how consistently an LLM selects the same model as the winner in pairwise comparisons. The method computes a Consistency score, which correlates 91% with human-generated Elo scores and achieves a mean absolute error of 35.2 Elo points. The score is computed by aggregating pairwise preferences from LLM judges and rescaling the resulting variance. Results show that using contests with models having large Elo differences maximizes information extraction, with just 30 high-difference matchups achieving full correlation. This approach offers a scalable, cheap proxy for evaluating model intelligence, though it struggles to distinguish among top-tier models.

## Method Summary
The method computes a Consistency score by first having an LLM judge evaluate pairwise contests between models using a two-stage prompting process (reasoning followed by preference extraction). For each matchup, win probabilities are calculated from the judge's preferences, and the variance of these probabilities is averaged across all matchups. The Consistency score is then derived as 1 minus four times this average variance. The approach leverages the insight that higher-capability models exhibit lower variance when discriminating between responses of varying quality, creating a scalable proxy for intelligence evaluation that correlates strongly with human Elo scores.

## Key Results
- Consistency score achieves 91% Pearson correlation with human-generated Elo scores
- Mean absolute error of 35.2 Elo points when predicting Elo from Consistency
- Using just 30 high-difference matchups is sufficient to extract full information
- Correlation drops to 0.12 when applied to top-tier model clusters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** If an LLM possesses higher general capability (intelligence), it exhibits lower variance when discriminating between responses of varying quality.
- **Mechanism:** The paper posits that a "smart" judge model consistently identifies the superior response in a pairwise contest, resulting in low decision variance. Conversely, a less capable judge guesses randomly, producing variance closer to 0.25 (random chance).
- **Core assumption:** The capability required to generate high-quality text is strongly correlated with the capability required to evaluate and discriminate text quality (Judge capability ≈ Model capability).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - "consistency with which it selects a model as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own human-produced Elo score."
  - "variance... approaches 0.25 if both models are equally likely to win and tends toward 0 if the same model's answer is always preferred."
- **Break condition:** If the models being judged are too similar in quality (small Elo gap), even a capable judge will appear inconsistent (high variance) because the distinction is genuinely ambiguous.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Matchups between models with large capability gaps maximize the information gain required to distinguish judge intelligence.
- **Mechanism:** High-difference matchups (e.g., GPT-4 vs. a small random model) allow strong judges to demonstrate consistency (locking in a preference), while weak judges remain inconsistent. This variance in consistency differentiates the judges.
- **Core assumption:** The available dataset contains a sufficient number and diversity of "unbalanced" matchups to create a stable signal.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - "pairs with a larger Elo difference are easier to discriminate, allowing strong judges to excel... increasing the variance on that matchup."
  - "using just 30 matchups [with high differences] is sufficient to extract the full information."
- **Break condition:** If the evaluation pool only contains models of similar capability (e.g., only top-tier SOTA models), the consistency metric flattens and loses predictive power (correlation drops to 0.12 for top clusters).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Two-stage preference elicitation (Reasoning → Preference) is necessary to ensure the variance signal reflects judgment capability rather than instruction-following failure.
- **Mechanism:** Lower-capability models often fail to understand complex judging instructions in a single pass (e.g., they try to answer the question instead of judging). Forcing a reasoning step first grounds the judge in the evaluation criteria before extracting a binary preference.
- **Core assumption:** The "Reasoning" output is a faithful representation of the judge's evaluation process and not just a post-hoc rationalization.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - "single-pass prompting often led judge LLMs with lower Elo scores to misunderstand the task... By first generating a justification, we ensure that the judge LLM adheres to the evaluation criteria."
  - Mention of positional bias mitigation via symmetric ordering.
- **Break condition:** If the prompt format creates a bias (e.g., positional bias) that affects weak judges differently than strong ones, the variance metric measures bias rather than intelligence.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bradley-Terry Models & Elo Ratings**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire metric relies on the assumption that "Consistency" maps linearly to Elo. You must understand that Elo is not an absolute score but a relative probability of winning pairwise contests.
  - **Quick check question:** If Model A has an Elo of 1200 and Model B has 1000, what is the expected probability of Model A winning? (Answer: ~0.76)

- **Concept: Bernoulli Variance**
  - **Why needed here:** The "Consistency" score is a direct rescaling of Bernoulli variance (p(1-p)). You need to understand why variance peaks at p=0.5 (uncertainty) and minimizes at p=0 or p=1 (certainty).
  - **Quick check question:** Why is the Consistency score formula 1 - 4 · Var? What does the '4' normalize?

- **Concept: Position Bias in LLM-as-Judge**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly corrects for this. Without understanding that LLMs irrationally prefer the first presented answer, you might misinterpret high consistency as high intelligence when it is actually high bias.
  - **Quick check question:** How does submitting contests in both orders (i vs j and j vs i) mathematically neutralize first-position bias?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input matchups → Two-stage Judge LLM → Preference aggregation → Variance calculation → Consistency score

- **Critical path:**
  1. Matchup Curation: Selecting 30-50 high-Elo-difference pairs (Critical: If you select random pairs, the correlation drops significantly)
  2. Preference Elicitation: Running the two-stage prompt for both orderings (AB and BA)
  3. Score Calculation: Aggregating results into the final Consistency score

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Cost vs. Resolution: You can evaluate a new model with very few contests (~30-50) if you strictly select high-difference matchups. This is extremely cheap but may lack resolution at the top end.
  - Metric Ceiling: The metric saturates for top-tier models (correlation 0.12 in the top cluster). It is useful for distinguishing weak vs. strong, but not strong vs. strongest.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High Variance in Top Cluster: If you see Consistency scores bunching up for your best models (e.g., 0.22 vs 0.23), do not use this for ranking; it is a known limitation.
  - Floor Effect: If a model is catastrophically bad at instruction following, it may output invalid preferences (not 0/1/2), breaking the variance calculation.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check: Reproduce the 0.91 correlation using the provided code/data subset to validate your inference pipeline.
  2. Ablation on Matchups: Measure correlation when using random matchups vs. sorted (high-difference) matchups to empirically validate the information extraction theory.
  3. Position Bias Audit: Run the judge on a single matchup 10 times with fixed order vs. 10 times with swapped order to quantify the positional bias drift.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can the Consistency metric be refined to reliably distinguish between top-performing models with similar Elo scores?
  - **Basis in paper:** The authors note the metric "lacks the ability to distinguish between top-performing models," yielding a correlation of only 0.12 in the highest-performing cluster.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current variance-based method creates a ceiling effect where high-intelligence models all achieve similar consistency scores, failing to capture subtle capability differences.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified metric demonstrating a correlation greater than 0.7 when applied specifically to a dataset of models with Elo scores above 1250.

- **Open Question 2:** Would a variance-weighting formula that accounts for the Elo gap between matchup pairs improve the prediction accuracy of the Consistency score?
  - **Basis in paper:** The authors suggest that "pairs with smaller differences yield noisier results and might merit downweighting" as an area for future improvement.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current method averages variance across all matchups equally, potentially diluting the high-information signal provided by matchups with large Elo differences.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study showing that a weighted average reduces the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) below the current 35.2 Elo points.

- **Open Question 3:** Can a curated set of contest prompts optimize information extraction better than the random subset used in the current study?
  - **Basis in paper:** The authors identify "curating dedicated contest sets optimized for information extraction" as a specific area for potential improvement over the "essentially random data utilized."
  - **Why unresolved:** It is currently unknown if specific prompt categories (e.g., complex reasoning vs. creative writing) elicit consistency patterns that correlate more strongly with intelligence.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis showing that a fixed-size curated set of prompts yields a higher correlation with Elo scores than a random set of the same size.

## Limitations
- The metric shows poor discriminative power for high-Elo models (r=0.12 for top cluster)
- The method assumes judge capability correlates directly with general LLM intelligence without direct validation
- The two-stage prompting process may measure prompt compliance rather than intrinsic judgment capability

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The 91% correlation with human Elo scores across the full model range; the mathematical validity of the variance-to-consistency transformation; the positional bias correction methodology.
- **Medium Confidence:** The information extraction theory (that high-difference matchups maximize signal); the judge capability ≈ model capability assumption.
- **Low Confidence:** The method's behavior for models below Elo 1000 (not tested); the stability of consistency scores across different prompt formulations.

## Next Checks

1. **Causality Test:** Design an experiment where judge LLMs are fine-tuned on specific evaluation skills (e.g., instruction following) and measure whether Consistency changes independently of general capability.

2. **Cross-Domain Validation:** Apply the Consistency metric to a different evaluation domain (e.g., code generation quality, mathematical reasoning) and measure whether it maintains high correlation with human-annotated Elo scores in that domain.

3. **Prompt Ablation Study:** Systematically vary the reasoning prompt complexity and length while keeping the same judge model, measuring how these changes affect Consistency scores and their correlation with Elo.
