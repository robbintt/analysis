## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic reasoning in large language models, organizing capabilities into three complementary dimensions: foundational capabilities (planning, tool use, search), self-evolving adaptation (feedback, memory, continuous improvement), and collective multi-agent collaboration (specialization, communication, shared goals). The work distinguishes between in-context reasoning (orchestration and planning at inference time) and post-training reasoning (reinforcement learning and fine-tuning). It maps the landscape across real-world applications in math, robotics, healthcare, scientific discovery, and autonomous research, while reviewing benchmarks that isolate core reasoning mechanisms as well as end-to-end performance.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic literature survey synthesizing 40 key references to create a unified taxonomy of agentic reasoning. It categorizes existing methods by analyzing their capabilities across planning, tool use, search, memory, and multi-agent collaboration, mapping them onto a three-layer framework (Foundational, Self-evolving, Collective) and two optimization modes (In-context vs. Post-training). The survey identifies open challenges including personalization, long-horizon reasoning, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance frameworks for safe deployment. The approach is conceptual rather than empirical, focusing on organizing the field's knowledge rather than conducting original experiments.

## Key Results
- Provides systematic taxonomy of agentic reasoning across three complementary dimensions

- Identifies key open challenges including personalization, long-horizon reasoning, and governance frameworks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Planning as Structured Goal Decomposition
Planning mechanisms enable agents to break down complex goals into executable sub-tasks, transforming static inference into iterative decision-making. Agents analyze goals, generate high-level plans, decompose into subgoals, and execute through feedback loops via workflow design, tree search, or process formalization. This operates under the assumption that tasks can be decomposed into independent or weakly coupled sub-tasks solvable sequentially. Breaks when sub-tasks are strongly interdependent, environment dynamics invalidate plans mid-execution, or decomposition granularity mismatches task structure.

### Mechanism 2: Tool-Augmented Reasoning Extension
Tool use extends agent capabilities beyond intrinsic model knowledge by providing access to external computation, information retrieval, and environment actions. Agents learn when to invoke tools, which tool to select, and how to generate valid calls through in-context prompting, post-training SFT/RL, or orchestration frameworks. Results integrate back into reasoning chains. This assumes tools provide reliable, well-specified interfaces that the agent can correctly parameterize and interpret. Fails with unreliable tool outputs, poorly documented interfaces, or inability to map natural language queries to tool parameters correctly.

### Mechanism 3: Feedback-Driven Self-Evolution
Feedback mechanisms enable agents to improve reasoning and action selection over time through experience accumulation and policy refinement. Agents receive evaluative signals (environment rewards, execution errors, validator feedback) and update internal representations, reasoning patterns, or action policies. Three regimes exist: reflective (inference-time self-critique), parametric (training-based consolidation), and validator-driven (external success/failure signals). This requires feedback signals to be sufficiently informative and frequent, with the agent correctly attributing outcomes to specific reasoning steps. Fails when feedback is sparse/misleading, credit assignment across long horizons is inaccurate, or overfitting to recent feedback degrades generalization.

## Foundational Learning

### Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)
**Why needed here:** The paper formalizes agentic reasoning using POMDPs to model environments where agents have incomplete information. Essential for understanding how agents handle uncertainty, plan under partial observability, and maintain internal belief states.
**Quick check question:** How does an agent's internal memory state differ from the observable environment state in a POMDP formulation?

### Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals (PPO/GRPO)
**Why needed here:** Post-training reasoning extensively uses RL methods like PPO and GRPO for optimizing agent behaviors. Understanding reward design, policy gradients, and credit assignment is crucial for implementing self-evolving agents.
**Quick check question:** How does the GRPO objective handle group-relative advantages for multi-tool learning compared to standard PPO?

### Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns
**Why needed here:** Collective reasoning relies on specialized roles (manager, worker, critic), communication protocols, and shared memory systems. Understanding these patterns is necessary for designing effective multi-agent systems.
**Quick check question:** What are the trade-offs between centralized vs. distributed communication topologies in multi-agent coordination?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Goal Reception → Planning (decompose task) → Action Selection (tool/reasoning step) → Execution → Observation (feedback/response) → Memory Update → Reflection (evaluate outcomes) → Policy Update (if learning mode)

### Critical Path
Goal Reception → Planning (decompose task) → Action Selection (tool/reasoning step) → Execution → Observation (feedback/response) → Memory Update → Reflection (evaluate outcomes) → Policy Update (if learning mode)

### Design Tradeoffs
- **In-Context vs. Post-Training:** Flexibility/no parameter updates vs. internalized strategies/computational cost
- **Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent:** Simpler deployment vs. distributed capability/coordination overhead
- **Flat vs. Structured Memory:** Implementation simplicity vs. complex reasoning support

### Failure Signatures
1. **Plan Invalidation**—agent continues obsolete plan despite environment changes → Enable re-evaluation triggers
2. **Tool Misuse**—incorrect selection/parameters → Implement documentation parsing and validation
3. **Feedback Misinterpretation**—wrong credit assignment → Use process-level feedback and trajectory analysis
4. **Coordination Breakdown**—multi-agent convergence failure → Add goal alignment and conflict resolution
5. **Memory Overload**—irrelevant retrieval → Implement prioritization and decay

### First 3 Experiments
1. **Baseline Planning Assessment:** Implement ReAct-style workflow agent on ALFWorld; establish baseline, identify decomposition/execution failure modes
2. **Tool Integration Stress Test:** Add 3-5 curated tools; measure selection accuracy, parameter correctness, error recovery
3. **Memory-Augmented Evolution:** Add episodic memory; run multi-episode experiments; measure learning curves, retention, generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can agentic systems effectively assign credit across tokens, tool calls, and memory updates to generalize learning across long sequences of tasks?
- Basis in paper: Section 8.2 identifies the "core open problem" of assigning credit across these granularities and generalizing across episodes.
- Why unresolved: Current reinforcement learning approaches rely on heavily engineered, domain-specific rewards and often treat episodes independently, causing errors to compound rapidly in long-horizon tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: An agent demonstrating sustained performance improvement over multi-episode streams without requiring manual reward engineering for each domain.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can world models be jointly trained and evaluated in non-stationary environments to guarantee calibration and downstream planning reliability?
- Basis in paper: Section 8.3 highlights the reliance on "ad hoc representations" and short-horizon data as open problems regarding calibration and causal impact.
- Why unresolved: Current designs lack mechanisms to ensure models generalize when environments change, and there is no standard method to assess their causal impact on planning.
- What evidence would resolve it: A standardized evaluation framework where world model performance directly correlates with long-term planning success in dynamic, non-stationary simulations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can governance frameworks effectively attribute failures arising from long-horizon planning and complex component interactions?
- Basis in paper: Section 8.6 notes that failures in agentic systems "arise from interactions across time and components, making attribution and auditing difficult."
- Why unresolved: Existing benchmarks and guardrails primarily target short-horizon behaviors, leaving planning-time failures and multi-agent dynamics largely unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A governance system capable of successfully flagging and attributing specific failure modes in complex, multi-component agentic workflows during real-world deployment.

## Limitations
- Missing empirical validation of proposed taxonomy's practical utility
- Boundary ambiguity in classifying hybrid approaches that blur in-context vs. post-training boundaries
- Limited discussion of computational constraints, deployment challenges, and real-world integration barriers

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Foundational definitions of planning, tool use, and search as core agentic capabilities
- **Medium Confidence**: Three-layer taxonomy as useful organizational framework
- **Medium Confidence**: Distinction between in-context and post-training reasoning
- **Low Confidence**: Specific claims about relative effectiveness of different architectural choices without empirical comparison data

## Next Checks
1. **Reconstruct the citation matrix**: Manually verify that each of the 40 cited papers is correctly classified across the three-layer taxonomy and optimization modes by reading their abstracts and methodologies
2. **Boundary case analysis**: For 5-10 hybrid methods that blur in-context vs. post-training boundaries, develop and test a systematic classification framework based on whether methods modify weights, require training phases, or operate purely at inference time
3. **Empirical proof-of-concept**: Implement a minimal three-agent system (manager/worker/critic) on a simple task like ALFWorld to test whether the proposed collective reasoning patterns actually improve performance over single-agent baselines
