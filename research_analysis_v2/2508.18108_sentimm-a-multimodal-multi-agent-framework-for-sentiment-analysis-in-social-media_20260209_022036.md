# SentiMM: A Multimodal Multi-Agent Framework for Sentiment Analysis in Social Media

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.18108
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18108
- **Reference count:** 25
- **Primary result:** Proposes SentiMM framework achieving 89.3% accuracy and 88.4% macro F1 on multimodal sentiment analysis task

## Executive Summary
SentiMM is a multi-agent framework for multimodal sentiment analysis in social media that processes text and visual inputs through specialized agents, fuses multimodal features, enriches context via knowledge retrieval, and aggregates results for final sentiment classification. The framework processes text and visual inputs through specialized agents, fuses multimodal features, enriches context via knowledge retrieval, and aggregates results for final sentiment classification. To support this task, the authors introduce SentiMMD, a large-scale multimodal dataset with seven fine-grained sentiment categories. Experimental results show that SentiMM achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with an accuracy of 89.3% and macro F1-score of 88.4%, significantly outperforming existing models on the SentiMMD dataset. The ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module in the framework.

## Method Summary
SentiMM processes multimodal social media content through a five-stage pipeline using specialized LLM agents: (1) Text Analyst extracts sentiment scores and semantic features from text, (2) Image Analyst performs visual sentiment analysis, (3) Fusion Inspector combines modalities and detects conflicts, (4) KB Assistant retrieves similar historical examples via RAG, and (5) Classifier Aggregator produces final sentiment classification with weighted combination. The framework uses MLLMs (GPT-4o or Qwen2.5-VL) for all stages and operates on the SentiMMD dataset containing 3,500 multimodal samples across seven sentiment categories.

## Key Results
- Achieves 89.3% accuracy and 88.4% macro F1 on SentiMMD dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines
- Ablation studies show each module contributes meaningfully: Fusion Inspector (+4.1 points), KB Assistant (+4.6 points), full framework outperforms single modalities (74.3% text-only, 78.9% image-only)
- GPT-4o backbone achieves 7.2 points higher accuracy than Qwen2.5-VL-7B (82.1%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Specialized Agent Decomposition with Sequential Processing
Decomposing multimodal sentiment analysis into five specialized agents improves classification accuracy over monolithic model approaches. Each agent handles a distinct subtask (text analysis, image analysis, fusion, knowledge retrieval, aggregation), producing structured outputs that serve as inputs for subsequent stages. This allows specialized processing per modality before integration.

### Mechanism 2: Cross-Modal Conflict Detection and Refinement
Explicit detection of inconsistencies between text and visual sentiment signals, followed by refinement, improves fusion quality. The Fusion Inspector computes difference metrics between multimodal and unimodal sentiment scores, and when discrepancies exceed threshold θ, generates hypotheses about missing or conflicting cues.

### Mechanism 3: Retrieval-Augmented Context Enrichment
Retrieving semantically similar historical multimodal data provides contextual signals that improve sentiment classification robustness. The KB Assistant extracts key features from fused representations, retrieves top-k similar entries from a vector-indexed knowledge base containing prior annotations, and generates a contextual report summarizing patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**: Why needed here: SentiMM uses GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL as backbone models for vision-language understanding across all agents. Quick check question: Can you explain how an MLLM processes both image pixels and text tokens in a unified embedding space?
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Why needed here: The KB Assistant uses RAG to retrieve similar historical posts from a vector database for context enrichment. Quick check question: What is the role of the similarity function in determining which examples are retrieved, and how does retrieval quality affect downstream generation?
- **Feature Fusion Strategies**: Why needed here: The Fusion Inspector combines text features and visual features into a joint representation via learned function φ. Quick check question: What are the tradeoffs between early fusion (concatenating raw features) vs. late fusion (combining modality-specific predictions)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Text Analyst → Image Analyst → Fusion Inspector → KB Assistant → Classifier Aggregator
- **Critical path:** Text Analyst → Image Analyst → Fusion Inspector → KB Assistant → Classifier Aggregator. Each stage depends on outputs from all prior stages. The Fusion Inspector is the integration point where modality-specific analyses converge.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Complexity vs. interpretability (five-stage pipeline improves interpretability but increases latency and token costs), Knowledge base coverage vs. noise (larger KB improves retrieval recall but may return less relevant examples), Backbone model choice (GPT-4o achieves higher accuracy but Qwen offers lower inference cost and local deployment).
- **Failure signatures:** Text-only input drops to 74.3% accuracy (-15.0 points), Image-only input drops to 78.9% accuracy (-10.4 points), Missing KB retrieval drops to 84.7% accuracy (-4.6 points), No fusion refinement drops to 85.2% accuracy (-4.1 points).
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Reproduce ablation on single modality to verify 74.3% (text-only) and 78.9% (image-only) baselines, 2) Vary retrieval threshold k in KB Assistant across k ∈ {1, 3, 5, 10, 20} to find saturation point, 3) Test conflict threshold θ sensitivity in Fusion Inspector across θ ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5} to identify optimal operating point.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the SentiMM framework be effectively adapted for real-time sentiment tracking and extended to incorporate modalities beyond text and images, such as audio or physiological signals?
- Does SentiMM maintain its performance superiority when evaluated on established external multimodal sentiment benchmarks, rather than solely on the proprietary SentiMMD dataset?
- Is the computational overhead of the multi-agent architecture justified by the performance gain when compared to optimized single-model approaches?

## Limitations
- Dataset availability: SentiMMD dataset is not publicly accessible, preventing direct replication and external validation
- Single dataset evaluation: All results are reported on SentiMMD only, raising questions about domain-specific optimization
- Hyperparameter specification: Critical parameters including fusion function, conflict detection threshold, and aggregation weights are not numerically specified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Modular architecture design with specialized agents is well-specified and theoretically sound, ablation studies showing performance drops when removing components are convincing
- **Medium Confidence**: Relative performance gains over baselines are credible given ablation results, but absolute performance numbers cannot be independently verified
- **Low Confidence**: Specific mechanisms for conflict detection thresholds and RAG retrieval quality assessment lack detailed specification, making implementation reproducibility uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce Text Analyst and Image Analyst in isolation on comparable multimodal sentiment dataset to verify claimed single-modality baselines
2. Systematically vary top-k retrieval parameter in KB Assistant across k ∈ {1, 3, 5, 10, 20} on held-out validation set to identify optimal trade-off
3. Sweep Fusion Inspector's conflict threshold θ across multiple values to characterize relationship between refinement frequency and classification performance
