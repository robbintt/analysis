# Actual Causation and Nondeterministic Causal Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.07849
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07849
- **Reference count:** 21
- **Primary result:** Defines actual causation functionally for nondeterministic causal models, avoiding intuition-based subjectivity

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces nondeterministic causal models as a generalization of Pearl's deterministic models and uses them to define actual causation functionally. Rather than relying on intuition, the approach develops actual causation based on its role in efficiently communicating and learning causal models. The method proceeds by generalizing counterfactual dependence, showing its role in causal discovery, introducing structural simplifications of causal models, and defining actual causation as the presence of counterfactual dependence in some structural simplification. The resulting definition applies equally to deterministic and nondeterministic models and yields verdicts nearly identical to the author's previous definition. This work offers a novel functional account of actual causation that avoids the subjectivity of intuition-based approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper defines actual causation in nondeterministic structural causal models (NSCMs) through a four-step process: First, it establishes NSCM semantics with multi-valued structural equations that output sets of possible values. Second, it defines actualized refinement by fixing functions to output actual values at actual parent inputs. Third, it introduces structural simplification by removing edges and updating functions to union over removed parent values. Finally, it defines actual causation as the existence of counterfactual dependence in some structural simplification of the actualized model. The key insight is that actual causation emerges from the functional role of counterfactual dependence in learning and communicating causal structure.

## Key Results
- Introduces NSCMs as a generalization of Pearl's deterministic models
- Defines actual causation functionally based on counterfactual dependence in structural simplifications
- Avoids subjectivity of intuition-based approaches while maintaining consistency with previous definitions
- Applies equally to deterministic and nondeterministic models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by grounding actual causation in its functional role rather than intuitive judgments. By showing that counterfactual dependence is essential for causal discovery, the paper justifies why actual causation should be defined through the presence of such dependence. Structural simplifications capture the minimal causal structure needed to explain observed correlations, making actual causation a matter of whether this minimal structure contains counterfactual dependence. This functional approach avoids the pitfalls of intuition-based definitions while maintaining intuitive verdicts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Nondeterministic Structural Causal Models (NSCMs):** Causal models where structural equations can output sets of values rather than single values. *Why needed:* To handle uncertainty and multiple possible outcomes in causal reasoning. *Quick check:* Can represent both deterministic and probabilistic scenarios.
- **Actualized Refinement:** Process of fixing NSCM functions to output actual values given actual parent inputs. *Why needed:* To ground counterfactual reasoning in the actual world. *Quick check:* Creates a concrete model from abstract NSCM by incorporating observed facts.
- **Structural Simplification:** Removing edges from causal graphs while updating functions to preserve possible outcomes. *Why needed:* To identify minimal causal structure explaining observed data. *Quick check:* Each simplification must maintain at least one valid world from the original model.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
NSCM Model -> Actualized Refinement -> Structural Simplification Generator -> Counterfactual Dependence Checker -> Actual Causation Verdict

**Critical Path:**
1. Build NSCM with multi-valued functions
2. Apply actualized refinement to fix actual values
3. Generate all valid structural simplifications
4. Check each for counterfactual dependence
5. Return verdict if any simplification shows dependence

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Exponential search space of structural simplifications vs. functional precision
- Computational complexity vs. theoretical elegance
- Generality to deterministic/nondeterministic models vs. implementation simplicity

**Failure Signatures:**
- Deterministic solver returning single values instead of sets
- Missing structural simplifications due to incorrect ancestor tracking
- Incorrect actualized refinement leading to wrong counterfactual checks

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test NSCM solver on simple model with known multiple outcomes
2. Verify actualized refinement correctly fixes functions to actual values
3. Check structural simplification preserves at least one valid world

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No efficient algorithm provided for searching exponential space of structural simplifications
- Requires cross-referencing external axiomatization for complete implementation details
- Computational feasibility unclear for models with many edges

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Conceptual framework and mathematical definitions are precise and reproducible
**Medium confidence:** Implementation details are clear but lack specific search algorithm
**Low confidence:** Computational feasibility for complex models with many edges

## Next Checks
1. Test the actualized refinement: Implement a basic NSCM solver and verify that it correctly returns sets of possible outcomes for a given intervention in the actualized model
2. Verify structural simplification logic: For a simple 3-variable model, manually enumerate all valid structural simplifications and confirm the subgraph generator produces the same set
3. Cross-reference axiomatization: Obtain and review Beckers (2025) to ensure the implementation correctly handles modal validity and edge cases in the proof system
