# Distributed Knowing How

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22374
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22374
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Proposes a novel framework for distributed knowledge-how combining planning-based multi-step and coalition-based one-step approaches, with sound and complete axiomatization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a unified framework for distributed knowledge-how that bridges planning-based multi-step and coalition-based one-step approaches. The key innovation is introducing group actions that can be irreducible, inherited from subgroups, or joint actions computed as intersections of composing actions. The framework formalizes distributed knowledge-how as multi-step strategies using these distributed actions and distributed knowledge-that. The main technical contribution is a sound and complete axiomatization for the logic of distributed knowledge-how, with axioms closely resembling those for distributed knowledge-that. A notable finding is that the cooperation axiom from coalition-based approaches does not hold in this multi-step setting.

## Method Summary
The paper constructs a logic of distributed knowledge-how (DKH) with two main operators: KG (distributed knowledge-that) and KhG (distributed knowledge-how). The framework models agents with epistemic relations and actions, defining distributed action sets A*G via closure over irreducible atomic group actions, inherited actions from subgroups, and joint actions computed as intersections. Strategies σG map equivalence classes to distributed actions, and a group knows how to achieve φ iff there exists σG such that all complete executions terminate and all leaf nodes satisfy φ. The completeness proof uses unraveling techniques for both epistemic relations and action transitions, constructing a canonical model with mixed sequences encoding both action transitions and epistemic relations.

## Key Results
- Introduces three distinct types of group actions: irreducible, inherited, and joint (intersection-based)
- Proves sound and complete axiomatization for distributed knowledge-how logic
- Demonstrates that cooperation axiom fails in multi-step setting, distinguishing from coalition logic
- Shows distributed actions allow groups to accomplish tasks beyond individual abilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Groups can possess distributed knowledge-how beyond the union of individual abilities through three distinct action types.
- Mechanism: The framework constructs distributed action sets A*G via closure over: (I) irreducible atomic group actions A_G, (II) inherited actions from subgroups, and (III) joint actions computed as intersections of composing actions. This allows couch-moving scenarios where synchronized actions belong to no proper subgroup.
- Core assumption: Agents cannot execute two actions simultaneously (partial partitions enforce this), and joint action effects are deterministic intersections of component transitions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We assume a group can accomplish more than what its individuals can jointly do."
  - [section] Example 1 (couch moving) demonstrates irreducible group actions; Definition 11 formalizes distributed action closure.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support; this is a novel synthesis per paper claims.
- Break condition: If agents could execute multiple simultaneous actions, the partial partition constraint would be violated, potentially allowing unrealistic self-teaming.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-step distributed know-how requires compositional strategy concatenation, not one-step joint action coordination.
- Mechanism: Strategy σG maps equivalence classes to distributed actions. A group knows how to achieve φ iff there exists σG such that: (1) all complete executions terminate, and (2) all leaf nodes satisfy φ. The axiom AxKhKh (KhG KhG φ → KhG φ) enables strategy composition by combining first-stage strategies with per-leaf second-stage strategies via well-ordering.
- Core assumption: Strategies are uniform across epistemically indistinguishable states; the Well-ordering Theorem guarantees strategy combination without domain conflicts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "distributed knowledge-how is based on...multi-step strategies using...distributed actions and distributed knowledge-that"
  - [section] Proposition 22 sketch describes combining σG with σ'G via ordinal-indexed leaf nodes.
  - [corpus] Weak/no corpus connection—corpus papers focus on knowledge-that or LLM knowledge, not multi-step know-how logic.
- Break condition: If the cooperation axiom (KhG φ ∧ KhH ψ → KhG∪H(φ∧ψ)) were valid, the multi-step composition would reduce to trivial one-step coordination—it is explicitly invalid here.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sound and complete axiomatization is achievable via unraveling both epistemic relations and action transitions.
- Mechanism: The canonical model uses "mixed sequences" X0⟨(φ1,G1),H1⟩X1... encoding both action transitions (φj,Gj) and epistemic relations (Hj). This dual unraveling prevents accidental satisfaction of joint know-how formulas—Proposition 27 proves all joint actions are non-executable in the canonical model, forcing witnesses to be atomic.
- Core assumption: The trivial epistemic relation ∼∅ (indistinguishing all states) and trivial action (⊤,G) ensure any two relevant MCSs are connected.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "completeness proof uses unraveling techniques for both epistemic relations and action transitions"
  - [section] Definition 24 (canonical model), Lemma 33 (Truth Lemma), Proposition 27 (joint actions non-executable).
  - [corpus] No corpus papers address this specific unraveling technique.
- Break condition: If joint actions were executable in the canonical model, KhG,H(φ∧ψ) could be satisfied without the formula being in the MCS, breaking the Truth Lemma.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Distributed Knowledge-That (Standard Epistemic Logic)**
  - Why needed here: The framework builds on K_Gφ formulas and their S5 axiomatization; understanding equivalence relations ∼_i and their intersection ∼_G = ∩_{i∈G} ∼_i is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Given agents 1,2,3 where s∼_1 t and s∼_2 t but s≁_3 t, does the group {1,2,3} distributedly know φ at s if φ holds at all t where s∼_1 t and s∼_2 t?

- Concept: **Transition Systems and Non-Deterministic Actions**
  - Why needed here: Models contain action transitions a→ that may be non-deterministic; strategies require executability on entire equivalence classes.
  - Quick check question: If action a is executable on state s but not on t where s∼_G t, can a be part of group G's strategy at [s]_G?

- Concept: **Partial Partitions and Joint Action Composition**
  - Why needed here: Distributed actions use non-trivial partial partitions of groups to represent parallel subgroup actions without double-booking agents.
  - Quick check question: For agents {1,2,3,4}, is {{1,2},{3}} a valid partial partition? What about {{1,2},{2,3}}?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - States (S): Worlds with propositional valuations
  - Epistemic relations ({∼_i}_{i∈I}): Equivalence relations per agent; ∼_G = ∩_{i∈G} ∼_i
  - Atomic group actions ({A_G}_{G⊆I}): Type (I) irreducible actions with disjointness constraint (G⊊H → A_G ∩ A_H = ∅)
  - Distributed action closure (A*_G): Computed via Definition 11 recursion
  - Transitions ({a→}_{a∈A^+_I}): Binary relations on S, potentially non-deterministic
  - Strategies (σ_G): Partial functions [S]_G → A*_G with executability constraint

- Critical path:
  1. Parse model specification (agents, atomic actions, transitions, epistemic relations)
  2. Compute A*_G closures for all groups
  3. For Kh_G φ query: search for strategy σ_G with finite complete executions and φ-satisfying leaves
  4. Leverage axioms for deduction: AxKtoKh (knowledge implies know-how), AxKhKh (composition), AxKhMono (monotonicity)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Generality vs. decidability**: Framework allows arbitrary irreducible group actions; decidability not yet proven
  - **Expressivity vs. Cooperation axiom**: Multi-step setting invalidates coalition-style cooperation—more expressive but harder to compose subgroup know-how
  - **Action disjointness**: Technically optional but conceptually distinguishes irreducible actions from inherited ones

- Failure signatures:
  - **Infinite execution**: Strategy with non-terminating complete execution violates Kh semantics
  - **Empty transition intersection**: Joint action ⟨d_0,...,d_n⟩ has d→ = ∩_k d_k→ = ∅, making it non-executable
  - **Strategy non-uniformity**: Action executable on some but not all states in [s]_G violates strategy definition

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Implement A*_G closure computation**: Given A_1={a,b}, A_2={c}, A_{1,2}={d}, verify A*_{1,2}={d,a,b,c,⟨a,c⟩,⟨b,c⟩}
  2. **Validate axiom instances**: Construct a model where Kh_i φ ∧ Kh_j ψ holds but Kh_{i,j}(φ∧ψ) fails (cooperation axiom invalidity)
  3. **Small canonical model test**: For 2 agents, 2 propositions, enumerate mixed sequences up to length 3 and verify Proposition 27 (joint actions non-executable)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Is the logic of distributed knowledge-how decidable, and what are its key model-theoretic properties (e.g., finite model property, bisimulation invariance)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We leave the discussions on the decidability and model-theoretical properties to a future occasion."
- Why unresolved: The completeness proof uses unraveling techniques that typically produce infinite models, leaving open whether finite models suffice. The combination of epistemic and action relations with the strategy-based semantics complicates standard model-theoretic analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: A decidability proof via filtration or finite model construction, or a proof of the finite model property; alternatively, an undecidability reduction from a known undecidable problem.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the axiomatization for the restricted class of models where all non-singleton atomic group actions are empty (A_G = ∅ for |G| > 1), bringing the framework closer to coalition logic?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "One may want to consider the case when the atomic group actions are all empty except the singleton ones, which will bring our framework closer to the setting of coalition logic and (epistemic) ATL."
- Why unresolved: The cooperation axiom from coalition-based approaches fails in the general multi-step setting, but may be recoverable in this restricted subclass. The relationship between the two frameworks remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: A sound and complete axiomatization for this restricted class, showing whether the cooperation axiom or its variants become valid.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the framework be extended to resource-sensitive settings where the number of agents performing the same action affects outcomes (e.g., ⟨a,a⟩ ≠ a)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "This invites us to extend our work in a non-trivial way to handle resource-sensitive settings where the number of individuals performing the same action matters."
- Why unresolved: The current semantics computes joint actions as intersections of transitions, making ⟨a,a⟩ equivalent to a. Distinguishing these requires fundamentally changing how distributed transitions are defined, likely complicating the completeness proof.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified semantics and sound-and-complete axiomatization that distinguishes resource-sensitive joint actions while preserving intuitive group know-how properties.

## Limitations

- The framework's expressiveness may come at the cost of potential undecidability, which remains unproven
- The reliance on the Well-ordering Theorem for the AxKhKh axiom proof suggests the framework may not be constructively valid
- The framework assumes deterministic joint action effects via intersection, which may not capture all real-world distributed knowledge-how scenarios

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The technical framework construction (distributed actions, strategies, semantics) and basic soundness arguments. The axioms closely resembling distributed knowledge-that logic appear well-founded.
- **Medium confidence**: The completeness proof via unraveling techniques. While the approach is sound, the use of transfinite ordinals and the handling of infinite mixed sequences in the canonical model require careful verification.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about practical applicability to real-world distributed knowledge-how scenarios. The framework is theoretical and its connection to empirical cognitive science or AI systems remains speculative.

## Next Checks

1. **Automated theorem proving implementation**: Encode the syntax, semantics, and SDKH axioms in a proof assistant (Coq/Lean) to verify the soundness proof and test the completeness construction on small examples.

2. **Decidability analysis**: Investigate whether the logic is decidable by examining the structure of strategies and the action closure computation. Consider restricting the framework to finite models or bounded strategy depth.

3. **Empirical validation**: Design simple multi-agent scenarios (e.g., cooperative block-pushing puzzles) to test whether the framework's predictions about distributed knowledge-how align with intuitive expectations and potentially with human performance data.
