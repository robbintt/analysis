# Visual Room 2.0: Seeing is Not Understanding for MLLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12928
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12928
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Perception performance (79.09%) significantly exceeds cognition (71.10%) in MLLMs, with cognition failing 28.6% of tasks even with perfect perception

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Visual Room 2.0, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate the alignment between perception and cognition in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Inspired by Searle's Chinese Room argument, the authors propose the Visual Room hypothesis: MLLMs can precisely describe visual details yet fail to comprehend underlying meaning. The benchmark spans 17 tasks across three levels for both perception and cognition, revealing that accurate visual perception does not causally enable higher-order cognitive reasoning. Key findings include perception-cognition functional independence, differential scaling saturation, and hierarchical processing asymmetry.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs on 350 multimodal samples with 2,100 questions using a hierarchical task structure. Perception tasks progress from attribute recognition to scene understanding, while cognition tasks range from textual entailment to causal reasoning. The key metric is conditional accuracy: P(cognition correct | perception correct). A hybrid semantic similarity metric (SentenceTransformers + Claude-4 judge) scores high-level perception, and zero-shot standard I/O prompting is used for inference. The dataset is publicly available at the provided HuggingFace link.

## Key Results
- Perception performance (79.09%) significantly exceeds cognition (71.10%) across all models
- Cognition fails 28.6% of tasks even with perfect perception accuracy
- Cognition scales with model size while perception performance plateaus early

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Perception-Cognition Functional Independence
Visual encoders and projection layers generate rich perceptual representations, but the LLM backbone processes these as isolated tokens without guaranteed semantic integration. Perception succeeds when token-level patterns match training distribution; cognition fails when task requires composing those tokens into coherent meaning structures the model hasn't explicitly learned.

### Mechanism 2: Differential Scaling Saturation
Low-level visual recognition tasks are solved by the vision encoder + minimal projection, saturating at small model sizes. Cognition requires the LLM backbone's full representational capacity for abstract reasoning, showing continued gains with scale as the language model's reasoning circuits expand.

### Mechanism 3: Hierarchical Processing Asymmetry
Perception tasks form a smooth complexity spectrum with predictable transfer. Cognition has a sharp discontinuity between pattern-matching tasks and pragmatic inference, requiring qualitatively different reasoning modes that don't transfer automatically.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Searle's Chinese Room Argument**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core theoretical framework extends this philosophical argument to multimodal systems. Without understanding the original claim (symbol manipulation ≠ understanding), the Visual Room metaphor will be misinterpreted.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Searle argues that passing the Turing test is insufficient evidence for genuine understanding?

- **Concept: Pearson vs. Spearman Correlation Interpretation**
  - Why needed here: Section 3.3.2's hierarchical validation relies on interpreting why Pearson (linear) and Spearman (rank) correlations diverge. The key insight—that strong Pearson + weak Spearman indicates co-variation without ranking consistency—is central to the perception-cognition independence claim.
  - Quick check question: If Pearson r = 0.81 (p < 0.01) but Spearman ρ = 0.15 (p = 0.68), what does this tell you about the relationship between two variables?

- **Concept: Conditional Probability in Evaluation Design**
  - Why needed here: The paper's key metric is P(correct cognition | correct perception), isolating whether perceptual accuracy causally enables reasoning. Understanding conditional evaluation vs. marginal evaluation is essential for interpreting Table 5.
  - Quick check question: Why is P(C | P=1) a stronger test of causal dependence than correlating marginal P and C scores?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** [Vision Encoder] → [Projection Layer] → [LLM Backbone] → Low-level perception (saturates early) → High-level cognition (scales with params)

- **Critical path:** Vision encoder outputs → Projection to token space → LLM processes with language priors → Cognition emerges (or fails) based on LLM reasoning capacity, not perceptual fidelity

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Smaller models (7B): Perception-competitive, cognition-limited — viable for recognition tasks
  - Larger models (70B+): Both improve but cognition gains dominate — necessary for reasoning tasks
  - Chain-of-thought: Inconsistent benefits (−5.3% to +1.6% for perception, −1.8% to +0.3% for cognition) — don't rely on prompting alone

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Watch Problem: Model names components (brand, strap color, digits) but cannot integrate into semantic whole (time reading)
  - Emotion-context disconnect: Correctly identifies facial expressions but fails to infer context-implied emotions
  - Scaling skepticism: If your use case requires sarcasm/causal reasoning, don't assume a better vision encoder will help—scale the LLM

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce the conditional evaluation: Run P(cognition | perception=correct) vs. P(cognition) on your target model using the PCBench dataset
  2. Scale ablation: Test perception-only tasks across model sizes in your model family
  3. Progressive prompting test: Compare zero-shot vs. chained perception→cognition prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What specific architectural modifications are required to bridge the perception-cognition gap, given that explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning fails to consistently improve cognitive performance?
- Does the observed functional independence persist in dynamic, video-based, or interactive contexts, or does temporal information facilitate the causal link between seeing and understanding?
- How can training objectives be redesigned to enforce a causal dependency where accurate perceptual encoding guarantees improved cognitive reasoning?

## Limitations

- The study relies on an LLM-based hybrid scoring system for high-level perception, which could introduce bias or inconsistency
- The conditional independence metric assumes perfect perception evaluation, but perception errors could propagate to cognition evaluation in ways not fully isolated
- The sample size (350 multimodal samples) may limit generalizability across diverse visual domains

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The overall finding that perception performance (79.09%) significantly exceeds cognition (71.10%) across multiple models and tasks
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that cognition scales with model size while perception does not
- **Low Confidence:** The specific 28.6% failure rate of cognition tasks even with perfect perception

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness Test:** Replicate the conditional evaluation using multiple LLM judges to verify the perception-cognition independence is not an artifact of judge bias
2. **Architecture Probe:** Test whether fine-tuning the vision encoder while keeping the LLM frozen improves cognition performance
3. **Domain Generalization:** Evaluate the same benchmark on non-Reddit sources to assess whether the perception-cognition pattern holds across visual domains
