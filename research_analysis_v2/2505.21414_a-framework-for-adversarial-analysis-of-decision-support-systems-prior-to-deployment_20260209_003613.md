# A Framework for Adversarial Analysis of Decision Support Systems Prior to Deployment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.21414
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21414
- **Reference count:** 12
- **Primary result:** Framework for analyzing and securing DRL decision support systems via adversarial observation perturbations, validated on CyberStrike environment.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for analyzing and securing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) decision support systems prior to deployment by providing insights into learned behavior patterns and vulnerabilities through simulation. The core method involves collecting attack data through adversarial perturbations of observations, developing realistic attack strategies with feasibility constraints, and measuring attack impact on environment properties. The framework was validated using CyberStrike, a custom-built strategic network-defense game. Experiments demonstrated that adversarial attacks can significantly impact agent behavior and game outcomes, with attack effectiveness varying by timing and observation index. The analysis also showed varying levels of attack transferability across different DRL algorithms and training curricula, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to protect decision-making policies in high-stakes environments.

## Method Summary
The framework consists of three main phases: (1) data collection from frozen DRL policies using a custom CyberStrike environment with 8 red nodes, 4 blue hackers, and 100-dimensional observations; (2) adversarial attack generation using FGSM perturbations applied to each observation index, with simulated rollouts to measure property impact; and (3) behavioral analysis using SAMDP visualization with t-SNE embeddings and Chinese-Whispers clustering. The method trains multiple DRL variants (A2C and DQN with ADR, CL, and combined curricula) to 90% win-rate, then collects 10,000 state-action-metadata tuples per policy. Transferability is measured through action change rates and sub-action target-transferability across policies, providing insights into attack effectiveness and robustness across different learning approaches.

## Key Results
- Adversarial attacks significantly impact agent behavior and game outcomes, with effectiveness varying by timing and observation index
- Attack transferability shows varying success rates across DRL algorithms (A2C-ADR+CL, A2C-ADR, A2C-CL, DQN-CL, DQN-deterministic)
- Single-point attacks are computationally tractable, while chains of multiple attacks would exponentially increase time complexity
- The framework successfully identifies observation-dependent and time-dependent vulnerabilities in decision-making policies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging gradient-based adversarial perturbations to systematically explore the vulnerability space of DRL policies. By applying FGSM attacks to each observation index and measuring the resulting changes in agent behavior through simulated rollouts, the method can quantify how sensitive policies are to specific input features. The SAMDP visualization provides interpretable insights into behavioral patterns, while transferability metrics reveal which attack strategies generalize across different training approaches. This systematic approach enables identification of critical vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Foundational Learning
- **FGSM adversarial perturbations**: Essential for generating effective attacks by computing gradients of loss with respect to observations; quick check: verify gradient computation works for discrete action spaces
- **Curriculum Learning (CL)**: Enables progressive skill development in CyberStrike environment; quick check: verify win-rate progression across curriculum levels
- **Adaptive Domain Randomization (ADR)**: Introduces variability during training to improve robustness; quick check: compare performance with/without ADR
- **SAMDP visualization**: Reduces high-dimensional state-action trajectories to interpretable 2D embeddings; quick check: validate t-SNE perplexity and clustering parameters
- **Transferability metrics**: Quantifies attack effectiveness across different policies; quick check: ensure action change rate calculations handle multi-discrete actions correctly
- **Simulated rollouts**: Measures attack impact without real-world execution; quick check: verify computational feasibility with stratified sampling

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data Collection -> FGSM Attack Generation -> Simulated Rollouts -> Property Impact Analysis -> SAMDP Visualization -> Transferability Analysis

**Critical Path:**
Train DRL policies → Freeze policies → Collect 10K tuples → Apply FGSM attacks per observation index → Run simulated rollouts → Compute property deltas → Generate SAMDP embeddings → Calculate transferability metrics

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Single-point attacks vs. attack chains (computational complexity vs. attack sophistication)
- Simulation-based analysis vs. real-world deployment testing (safety vs. fidelity)
- Gradient-based attacks vs. black-box attacks (effectiveness vs. practicality)
- Model-specific vs. model-agnostic analysis (precision vs. generalizability)

**Failure Signatures:**
- Policies failing to reach 90% win-rate indicates curriculum or training issues
- Computationally intractable rollouts suggest need for stratified sampling
- Attacks violating feasibility constraints indicate incorrect observation bounds
- Poor SAMDP clustering suggests inadequate perplexity or distance parameters

**First Experiments:**
1. Train A2C and DQN variants with specified hyperparameters and verify 90% win-rate achievement
2. Apply FGSM attacks with multiple perturbation bounds to assess sensitivity
3. Generate SAMDP visualizations for collected attack data to validate embedding quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper explicitly leaves several questions for future research: (1) developing specific training or fine-tuning methods to guard against identified vulnerabilities, (2) analyzing the impact of chains of multiple adversarial attacks versus single-point attacks, and (3) adapting the framework to analyze LLM-based agentic architectures using language-based attacks. The authors note that their current work focuses on identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities rather than implementing defensive techniques, and computational constraints limited their analysis to single perturbations rather than multi-step attack chains.

## Limitations
- Framework relies on simulated rollouts, creating potential fidelity gaps between simulation and real-world deployment
- FGSM perturbation bounds and attack thresholds are underspecified, affecting result reproducibility
- Transferability analysis assumes access to model internals, limiting black-box applicability
- CyberStrike environment's internal mechanics beyond observation/action spaces remain incompletely detailed

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Framework architecture and methodology are clearly specified with reproducible experimental setups
- **Medium Confidence**: Transferability analysis conclusions are supported by experimental results, though exact parameters affect interpretation
- **Low Confidence**: Real-world applicability claims depend on simulation-to-deployment translation, which remains empirically unverified

## Next Checks
1. Implement CyberStrike environment and verify observation/action space dimensions match Appendix B.1 specifications; check curriculum progression reaches 90% win-rate threshold
2. Run FGSM attacks with multiple perturbation bound values to establish sensitivity of property impact metrics to attack strength
3. Validate attack transferability across additional DRL algorithms beyond the five tested variants to assess generalizability of transferability findings
