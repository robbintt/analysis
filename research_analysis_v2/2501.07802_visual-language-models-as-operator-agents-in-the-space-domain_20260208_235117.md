# Visual Language Models as Operator Agents in the Space Domain

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.07802
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07802
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: VLMs outperform text-only LLMs in spacecraft control tasks by integrating visual and textual observations for improved spatial reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper explores Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as operator agents for space missions, focusing on two paradigms: software-based spacecraft control using Kerbal Space Program simulations and hardware-oriented robotic inspection of space objects. The authors employ VLMs to interpret visual screenshots of graphical user interfaces and real-time camera data, enabling autonomous decision-making in complex orbital maneuvers and hardware diagnostics. In simulation tasks, VLMs demonstrated strong performance, achieving better overall scores than non-multimodal LLMs by effectively balancing proximity objectives and obstacle avoidance. Hardware tests using an xArm 7 robot with VLM fine-tuning showed promising accuracy (83.4% training accuracy) in inspection tasks, though latency remains a key challenge with response times between 2.9 to 11.3 seconds.

## Method Summary
The paper employs VLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, LLaMA 3.2) with few-shot visual prompting to control spacecraft in the KSPDG simulation environment, interpreting screenshots of the GUI alongside textual telemetry to generate discrete thrust commands. The action space is discretized into 27 combinations for simplified decision-making. For hardware applications, OpenVLA is fine-tuned on a small dataset of RGBD images and robot states for robotic inspection tasks. The software approach uses a scoring function balancing proximity to target and obstacle avoidance, while the hardware approach focuses on achieving high training accuracy with limited data. Both paradigms rely on multimodal prompting to integrate visual and textual information for autonomous decision-making.

## Key Results
- VLMs achieved better overall scores than non-multimodal LLMs in KSPDG simulations by effectively balancing proximity objectives and obstacle avoidance
- OpenVLA fine-tuning achieved 83.4% training accuracy and 69.5% validation accuracy for robotic inspection tasks with only 10 episodes of data
- Latency remains a significant bottleneck, with VLMs exhibiting response times between 2.9 to 11.3 seconds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VLMs outperform text-only LLMs in spacecraft control tasks by integrating visual and textual observations for improved spatial reasoning.
- Mechanism: The VLM receives visual screenshots of the simulation GUI (navball, spacecraft orientation markers) alongside textual telemetry (relative positions, velocities, prograde vectors). Visual cues compensate for LLM difficulties in interpreting raw floating-point numerical data and vessel reference frames. The model generates discrete thrust actions by reasoning across both modalities.
- Core assumption: Visual representations of spatial state are more interpretable for current VLMs than numerical telemetry arrays.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "VLMs to interpret visual screenshots of graphical user interfaces...demonstrated strong performance, achieving better overall scores than non-multimodal LLMs"
  - [Section III.A] "we observed significant difficulties for LLMs in interpreting the vessel's reference frame and effectively utilizing raw observational data presented as floating-point numbers"
  - [corpus] Related paper "Not Only Text" explores VLM compositionality but does not directly validate the spatial reasoning advantage claimed here.
- Break condition: If visual input quality degrades (low resolution, motion blur, poor lighting) or if the GUI layout changes significantly from training distribution, the visual reasoning advantage may collapse.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Few-shot visual prompting enables VLMs to map multimodal observations to structured action commands without task-specific training.
- Mechanism: System prompts contain example demonstrations pairing visual screenshots with textual reasoning and discrete action outputs. The VLM learns to extract navball orientation, combine with telemetry, and output function calls in JSON format (e.g., `perform_action(Forward Throttle: Forward, Right Throttle: Right, Down Throttle: Up)`). Action space is discretized into 27 combinations (3×3×3 thrust options).
- Core assumption: The VLM's pre-trained visual-language alignment transfers to novel GUI layouts and domain-specific control tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section III.B] "The few-shot examples in Fig. 2 demonstrate how to process and act upon this visual information in conjunction with telemetry"
  - [Section II.A.3] "Modern LLMs support structured outputs, including JSON...allowing users to guide the model in generating outputs that integrate seamlessly with APIs"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related papers focus on VLM evaluation, not few-shot prompting efficacy for control tasks.
- Break condition: If the task requires reasoning beyond the few-shot pattern (e.g., novel emergency scenarios, multi-step planning), performance may degrade without additional examples or fine-tuning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action models on limited domain data enables robotic hardware inspection with measurable accuracy.
- Mechanism: OpenVLA model is fine-tuned using an HDF5 dataset containing image frames, robot states (Cartesian positions, joint angles), and task instructions. The model outputs a 7-dimensional action vector (Δx, Δθ, χ—positional change, rotation, and snapshot flag). With only 10 episodes (20% of recommended data), the model achieved 83.4% training accuracy and 69.5% validation accuracy.
- Core assumption: The visual features learned during pre-training provide a sufficient foundation for domain adaptation with minimal data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section IV.B] "Our fine-tuning process uses an HDF5 dataset...The improvement in accuracy to 83.4% in Experiment 2 demonstrates measurable progress"
  - [Section IV.B] "With an average deviation of 50 millimeters in the final training steps, the results indicate reasonable accuracy"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation; OpenVLA paper referenced but not in neighbor set.
- Break condition: If deployment conditions differ from training (different lighting, hardware wear, object types), the fine-tuned model may require additional data collection or suffer accuracy drops.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Multimodal Tokenization and Vision-Language Alignment**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how VLMs encode images and text into a shared embedding space explains why visual cues can compensate for numerical reasoning limitations.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a vision encoder's output tokens are integrated with language model tokens in architectures like LLaVA or OpenVLA?

- Concept: **Prompt Engineering Paradigms (Zero-shot, Few-shot, CoT, ReAct)**
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on few-shot prompting with visual examples and references Chain of Thought reasoning; understanding these paradigms is essential for reproducing the approach.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between providing examples in a prompt (few-shot) versus asking the model to reason step-by-step (CoT)?

- Concept: **Action Space Discretization for Continuous Control**
  - Why needed here: The paper discretizes continuous thrust control into 27 discrete actions; this design choice affects both model performance and action resolution.
  - Quick check question: Why might discretizing a continuous action space improve LLM/VLM performance, and what tradeoffs does it introduce?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Perception Layer: KSPDG simulation screenshots (software) or Intel RealSense RGBD camera (hardware)
  2. VLM Core: Claude 3.5 / GPT-4o / LLaMA 3.2 for simulation; OpenVLA (fine-tuned) for robotics
  3. Prompt Engineering Module: System prompts with few-shot visual examples, task instructions, structured output format
  4. Action Translation Layer: Converts VLM JSON output to discrete thrust commands (simulation) or 7D action vectors (robotics)
  5. Execution Layer: KSPDG environment (simulation) or xArm 7 robot arm (hardware)

- Critical path:
  1. Capture visual frame (screenshot or camera)
  2. Augment with textual telemetry (positions, velocities, prograde)
  3. Construct multimodal prompt with few-shot examples
  4. Run VLM inference (2.9–11.3s latency)
  5. Parse structured output
  6. Execute action
  7. Wait for action completion before next frame (synchronized pipeline)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Latency vs. Model Capability**: Larger models (Claude, GPT-4o) offer better reasoning but higher latency (up to 11.3s), which may be impractical for real-time operations
  - **Discretization vs. Precision**: 27 discrete actions simplify decision-making but limit control granularity compared to continuous thrust
  - **Few-shot vs. Fine-tuning**: Few-shot enables rapid deployment without training data; fine-tuning improves accuracy but requires dataset collection

- Failure signatures:
  - **Visual misinterpretation**: VLM fails to read navball orientation correctly → incorrect thrust direction
  - **Latency timeout**: Inference exceeds acceptable delay → missed maneuver window
  - **Reference frame confusion**: Output actions in wrong coordinate system → erratic spacecraft behavior
  - **Overfitting in robotics**: High training accuracy but low validation accuracy → poor generalization to new inspection scenarios

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline comparison**: Run LLM (text-only) vs. VLM (text + screenshots) on identical KSPDG scenarios (e.g., lg1-i1 Lady-Bandit-Guard) using the same few-shot prompt structure; compare scores using equation (1) and record latency.
  2. **Ablation on visual prompting**: Test VLM with and without visual few-shot examples (text-only prompts vs. multimodal prompts) to isolate the contribution of visual guidance to spatial reasoning.
  3. **Latency budget mapping**: Measure inference time across model sizes (LLaMA 3.2 vs. Claude vs. GPT-4o) with varying prompt lengths; identify maximum prompt complexity that maintains latency within acceptable bounds (e.g., <5s for near-real-time control).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can VLM architectures be optimized to reduce inference latency sufficiently for real-time closed-loop control in time-critical space operations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify latency (2.9s–11.3s) as the "primary bottleneck" and note that for proprietary models, strategies like prompt caching are considered to mitigate this.
- Why unresolved: Despite attempts to use optimizations like Flash Attention, response times remain high relative to the rapid dynamics of orbital maneuvers.
- Evidence: Demonstration of a VLM-controlled agent maintaining stable rendezvous trajectories with sub-second decision latencies in the KSPDG environment.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can VLMs learn to infer motion dynamics, such as inertia and velocity, directly from visual inputs without relying on augmented textual telemetry?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section III.B states that under the current research state, the model "cannot visually interpret motion dynamics, such as inertia or proximity changes," necessitating text-based data augmentation.
- Why unresolved: The current system depends on explicit textual injection of the prograde vector (Eq. 2) because the visual module fails to extract these physical properties from screenshots alone.
- Evidence: Successful completion of orbital maneuvers in an ablation study where textual velocity/position data is removed from the prompt, forcing the model to rely solely on visual cues.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent do VLMs outperform fine-tuned LLMs in complex, multi-objective space environments where visual reasoning conflicts with specialized heuristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that while VLMs achieved better overall scores, "LLMs demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities," and external benchmarks (Balrog) suggest LLMs often outperform VLMs.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents conflicting results where fine-tuned LLMs excel at specific proximity metrics (e.g., "Best Dist." in Table 1) while VLMs generalize better to the scoring function, leaving the superiority in complex scenarios uncertain.
- Evidence: A comparative study showing VLMs consistently surpassing the best fine-tuned LLM baselines in both proximity and evasion metrics across diverse KSPDG scenarios.

## Limitations

- The paper's primary limitation is the reliance on specific GUI layouts and simulation configurations without sufficient detail for exact replication.
- The VLM performance advantages depend heavily on the quality and consistency of visual input, with no robustness testing under degraded conditions.
- Latency measurements (2.9-11.3s) reveal a critical constraint for real-time space operations that is not adequately addressed.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The VLM outperforms text-only LLMs in KSPDG simulations when using the described few-shot visual prompting approach. The mathematical formulation for scoring and the action discretization framework are clearly specified.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that visual representations improve spatial reasoning over numerical telemetry is supported by qualitative observations but lacks systematic ablation studies comparing visual vs. textual spatial representations directly.
- **Medium confidence**: The robotics fine-tuning results (83.4% training accuracy) demonstrate technical feasibility but the small dataset size and limited validation metrics reduce generalizability claims.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on visual prompting**: Compare VLM performance with identical prompts containing only textual telemetry versus multimodal prompts with GUI screenshots on the same KSPDG scenarios to isolate the visual reasoning contribution.
2. **Latency optimization benchmark**: Measure inference time across different prompt compression techniques (caching, distillation, structured output constraints) to identify feasible latency targets for near-real-time control applications.
3. **Generalization stress test**: Evaluate VLM performance on modified GUI layouts, degraded visual conditions (blurred images, poor lighting), and novel spacecraft configurations to assess robustness beyond the training distribution.
