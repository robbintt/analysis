# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Fintech: Agentic Design and Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25518

- Primary result: Agentic RAG achieves 62.35% retrieval accuracy vs 54.12% baseline on fintech knowledge base, with higher semantic accuracy (7.04 vs 6.35) but increased latency (5.02s vs 0.79s)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of deploying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in specialized fintech domains where domain-specific ontologies, dense terminology, and acronyms complicate retrieval and synthesis. It proposes an agentic RAG architecture with modular agents for query reformulation, sub-query decomposition, acronym resolution, and cross-encoder-based re-ranking to improve retrieval robustness. Evaluated on an 85-question fintech knowledge base, the agentic system achieved 62.35% retrieval accuracy versus 54.12% for a baseline, with higher semantic accuracy (7.04 vs. 6.35 on a 10-point scale), albeit with increased latency (5.02s vs. 0.79s).

## Method Summary
The paper compares a baseline RAG (B-RAG) pipeline against an agentic RAG (A-RAG) with specialized modules. A-RAG uses an Orchestrator Agent managing Query Reformulator, Acronym Resolver, Retriever, Sub-Query Generator, Re-Ranker, and Summary agents. The system employs Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings, ChromaDB vector store, and cross-encoder re-ranking. Evaluation uses 85 synthetic QA pairs and 27 human-verified benchmark questions with multi-answer ground truth, measuring retrieval accuracy (Hit@5), latency, and semantic accuracy via LLM-judge scoring.

## Key Results
- A-RAG achieved 62.35% retrieval accuracy vs 54.12% for baseline B-RAG
- Semantic accuracy improved to 7.04/10 vs 6.35/10 for baseline
- Latency increased from 0.79s to 5.02s per query
- Sub-query generation was identified as the most effective agentic component
- Acronym resolution prevented semantic drift but risked overly generic results if glossary was incomplete

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Iterative Sub-Query Decomposition
Complex fintech queries are better resolved by decomposing them into targeted sub-tasks rather than relying on a single retrieval pass, provided the system can handle increased latency. An Orchestrator agent detects insufficient initial retrieval (via QA confidence score) and triggers a Sub-Query Generator that extracts key phrases to spawn 2-3 follow-up queries, allowing parallel retrieval of specific information fragments which are then aggregated.

### Mechanism 2: Contextual Acronym Resolution
Pre-emptive expansion of domain-specific acronyms prevents semantic drift during retrieval, particularly in regulated domains where terms have organization-specific meanings. A dedicated Acronym Resolution Logic module intercepts queries and retrieved content, matching acronyms against a local glossary to append in-line definitions, ensuring the embedding model encodes the concept rather than the opaque token.

### Mechanism 3: Cross-Encoder Re-ranking
Validating retrieved chunks with a cross-encoder improves precision over vector similarity alone, helping to filter out "near-miss" documents that share keywords but lack semantic alignment. After the Retriever Agent fetches top-k chunks, the Re-Ranker Agent applies a computationally intensive cross-encoder to reorder results based on deep semantic interaction between query and document.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed: The paper contrasts standard RAG (B-RAG) with agentic RAG (A-RAG), building from simple augmentation to complex modular architecture
  - Quick check: Can you explain why the authors argue that standard RAG fails in "fragmented" fintech domains?

- **Concept: Embeddings vs. Cross-Encoders**
  - Why needed: The architecture explicitly trades off speed of vector search for accuracy of re-ranking; grasping this distinction is essential for understanding the 5.02s latency result
  - Quick check: Why does A-RAG accept a ~6x increase in latency compared to B-RAG?

- **Concept: LLM-as-a-Judge**
  - Why needed: The paper evaluates "Semantic Accuracy" using a scoring system (1-10) derived from a judge LLM, not human evaluators
  - Quick check: What constraints led the authors to use semi-automated evaluation instead of human annotation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Query -> Intent Classifier -> Query Reformulator (w/ Acronym Expansion) -> Retriever Agent -> Re-Ranker -> Summary Agent -> QA Agent (feedback loop to Sub-Query Generator if needed)

- **Critical path:** The Orchestrator coordinates sequential execution through all agents, with feedback from QA Agent potentially triggering parallel sub-query retrieval loops

- **Design tradeoffs:** Optimized for high-stakes accuracy (62% retrieval success) at cost of real-time responsiveness (5.02s latency); assumes information is scattered across document chunks rather than contained in single documents

- **Failure signatures:** Low QA confidence may cause retrieval loops or "honest refusal"; incomplete acronym glossary may produce generic content; over-filtering may discard valid but lexically dissimilar answers

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Profile latency contribution of Cross-Encoder and LLM calls to identify primary bottleneck
  2. Disable Sub-Query Generator and QA feedback loop to verify accuracy drop
  3. Stress test Acronym Resolution against ambiguous terms like "CMA" to determine glossary precision

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can reinforcement learning or meta-controller frameworks improve agent coordination by dynamically adapting composition based on query type? The current Orchestrator follows fixed sequential flow; adaptive strategies not yet implemented.

- Do agent self-critique or reflection-based loops enhance response "helpfulness" beyond simple factual retrieval? Current architecture focuses on retrieval accuracy rather than iterative reasoning refinement.

- Can the 5.02s latency overhead be reduced without degrading retrieval accuracy gains? Paper validates effectiveness but does not propose methods to optimize the 6x latency increase for real-time use.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation constrained by narrow fintech domain and proprietary synthetic dataset
- Absolute retrieval accuracy remains modest (62%) despite improvements over baseline
- Significant latency increase (5.02s vs 0.79s) may not be acceptable for all use cases
- Acronym resolution dependent on local glossary completeness not detailed in paper

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Modular agentic architecture and iterative sub-query decomposition show consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy and semantic relevance
- **Medium Confidence:** Performance gains attributed to individual components are plausible but not fully isolated in ablation studies
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability to other specialized domains not demonstrated; robustness of acronym resolution against incomplete glossaries not explored

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation study disabling Sub-Query Generator and QA feedback loop to verify 62% accuracy is driven by multi-pass retrieval
2. Stress test Acronym Resolution module against ambiguous terms like "CMA" to assess glossary precision and identify failure modes
3. Apply agentic RAG architecture to non-fintech domain (healthcare or legal) to test adaptability and robustness
