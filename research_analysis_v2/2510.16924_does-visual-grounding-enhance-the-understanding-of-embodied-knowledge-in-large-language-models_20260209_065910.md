# Does Visual Grounding Enhance the Understanding of Embodied Knowledge in Large Language Models?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16924
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16924
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Vision-language models do not outperform text-only models on embodied knowledge tasks, with all models performing significantly worse on visual dimensions.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether visual grounding improves large language models' understanding of embodied knowledge by proposing a novel benchmark based on perceptual psychology. The authors evaluate 30 state-of-the-art models on two tasks: SensoryVec (vector comparison of sensory words) and PerceptualQA (question-answering across nine sensory dimensions). Surprisingly, vision-language models do not outperform text-only models, with particular struggles in visual-spatial reasoning. The findings suggest that current multimodal training approaches fail to fundamentally enhance models' understanding of the physical world.

## Method Summary
The authors propose two evaluation tasks: SensoryVec, which tests whether models can distinguish between synonyms and antonyms in vector space using 349 word triples with three context sentences each, and PerceptualQA, which contains 1,400 multiple-choice questions across nine sensory dimensions (Visual, Auditory, Tactile, Gustatory, Olfactory, Body, Emotion, Space, Symbol). Models are evaluated in zero-shot settings, with text-only models using standard transformer encoders and vision-language models using multimodal architectures. The evaluation includes both intrinsic measures (vector similarity) and extrinsic measures (question-answering accuracy), with special attention to positional bias through repeated trials with shuffled options.

## Key Results
- Vision-language models do not outperform text-only models on either SensoryVec or PerceptualQA tasks
- All models perform significantly worse on visual dimensions (Geometry/Symbols) compared to non-visual sensory modalities
- Text-only models like BERT achieve strong performance, suggesting language alone encodes substantial sensory knowledge
- Vector representations are easily influenced by word form and frequency, leading to antonym collapse
- Models struggle specifically with spatial perception and reasoning rather than conceptual understanding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Distributional Entanglement of Sensory Terms
Text-only and multimodal models likely struggle to distinguish sensory antonyms (e.g., big vs. small) because their vector representations rely on context overlap rather than perceptual opposition. The Distributional Hypothesis dictates that words appearing in similar contexts acquire similar vector representations. Without specific contrastive mechanisms, models fail to encode semantic opposition critical for embodied knowledge, treating antonyms as near-synonyms due to high cosine similarity.

### Mechanism 2: Static Visual Grounding Limitation
Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fail to transfer visual grounding into embodied understanding because they are trained on static image-text pairs rather than dynamic, interactive sensory data. VLMs learn to align visual features with text tokens, but embodied reasoning requires simulating physical interactions. Static images provide snapshots, not the causal chains or spatial transformations required for Geometry and Body tasks, leaving the language model's non-grounded reasoning unchanged.

### Mechanism 3: Linguistic Proxy for Sensory Knowledge
Text-only models achieve non-trivial performance because language alone statistically encodes perceptual information. By processing massive text corpora, models learn associations that proxy for sensory experience. This allows them to answer some sensory questions via textual probability, though they fail on specific visual attributes like color which are less describable without experience.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Distributional Semantics vs. Grounding**
  - Why needed here: The paper reveals that grounding (adding images) does not automatically fix the limitations of distributional semantics. Understanding the gap between "words in context" and "words in physical reality" is crucial.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model think "hot" and "cold" are similar words despite opposite meanings?

- **Concept: Multimodal Alignment**
  - Why needed here: To understand how VLMs map image patches to text tokens and why this mapping fails to capture "embodied" concepts like weight or foldability which aren't visible in a static image.
  - Quick check question: Does knowing the text label "soft" paired with an image of a pillow teach a model how a pillow feels or deforms?

- **Concept: Spatial & Transformative Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The paper identifies this as the specific failure mode. Distinguishing between "knowing a shape" (recognition) and "knowing a shape's transformation" (simulation) is key to interpreting the benchmark results.
  - Quick check question: If you rotate the number '7', how does the spatial relationship of its parts change? Can a text-model predict this without a mental image?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Sensory Input (words/questions) -> Encoder (BERT/Transformer or Vision-Language Encoder) -> Probe (Cosine Similarity or Next-Token Probability) -> Output (vector similarity score or answer choice)

- **Critical path:** 1. Select comparable model pairs (e.g., Qwen-7B vs. Qwen-VL) 2. Run SensoryVec to check vector spacing (Synonym vs. Antonym) 3. Run PerceptualQA focusing on the "Visual" subtasks (Geometry/Symbols) where performance gaps are largest

- **Design tradeoffs:** Text-Only vs. VLM: Text models are faster and often capture non-visual senses well via text stats. VLMs are computationally heavier but currently add little to embodied reasoning despite their visual input. Evaluation Method: Vector comparison (SensoryVec) tests internal representation structure, while QA (PerceptualQA) tests explicit reasoning. The paper shows both fail similarly for VLMs.

- **Failure signatures:** Antonym Collapse: High cosine similarity between a word and its antonym (e.g., big ≈ small) in vector space. Visual Spatial Deficit: Accuracy drops specifically in Visual-Geometry and Visual-Symbols tasks (approx. 30% for best models) while non-visual tasks (Tactile/Gustatory) are higher (approx. 80-90%).

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Replicate the Antonym Test: Compare embeddings of "smooth" vs. "rough" in a text-only model vs. a VLM to confirm if visual grounding separates them. 2. Transformation Stress Test: Ask a VLM to predict the outcome of folding a paper shape (text-only prompt) vs. showing it an image of the shape. Compare if the image improves reasoning. 3. Frequency Interference Check: Test if models conflate "form similarity" (e.g., sugarless vs. sugary) with meaning. If removing word-form bias improves scores, the mechanism is confirmed.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can incorporating dynamic sensory data (e.g., video, haptic feedback) and interactive training with embodied agents enable models to capture embodied knowledge more effectively than static image-text pretraining?
- To what extent can scaling purely textual data describing sensory experiences close the performance gap with human-level embodied understanding?
- Why do VLMs exhibit a systemic deficiency in visual-spatial reasoning compared to non-visual sensory modalities, and is this caused by a reliance on 2D object recognition features?

## Limitations
- Benchmark Construction Bias: The SensoryVec task relies on manually curated word triples from perceptual psychology literature that may not fully represent real-world diversity.
- Static Evaluation Framework: Both tasks assess models in isolated, controlled conditions rather than dynamic, interactive scenarios that would better reflect true physical understanding.
- Limited Model Coverage: The study focuses primarily on transformer-based architectures and does not include alternative approaches like retrieval-augmented models or neuro-symbolic systems.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Vision-language models do not outperform text-only models on embodied knowledge tasks is well-supported by experimental results across multiple model pairs and tasks.
- **Medium Confidence:** Static visual grounding fails because VLMs lack exposure to dynamic, interactive sensory data is plausible but not directly tested.
- **Medium Confidence:** Language alone statistically encodes sufficient perceptual information for non-visual senses is supported by BERT's strong performance but not systematically quantified.
- **Low Confidence:** Models struggle specifically with spatial perception and reasoning is based on task performance differences but other explanations are not ruled out.

## Next Checks
1. **Dynamic Grounding Experiment:** Evaluate the same models on embodied knowledge tasks using video inputs or simulated physical interactions rather than static images to test whether temporal or kinematic data improves spatial reasoning performance.
2. **Controlled Vocabulary Analysis:** Systematically vary the complexity and specificity of sensory descriptions in the benchmark to determine the threshold at which text-only models fail versus when visual grounding becomes necessary.
3. **Cross-Lingual Transfer Study:** Test whether models trained on languages with different embodied expression patterns (e.g., languages with rich spatial deixis) show different patterns of embodied knowledge acquisition to isolate linguistic versus perceptual factors.
