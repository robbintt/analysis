# Language Models for Longitudinal Clinical Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23884
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23884
- Reference count: 38
- One-line primary result: Achieves accurate Alzheimer's progression forecasts (CDR-SB MAE < 0.9) using frozen LLMs with minimal training data (1%)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a lightweight framework that adapts frozen large language models to forecast longitudinal clinical outcomes from neuropsychological assessments. The approach encodes patient visit histories as token sequences, conditions them with clinical prompts, and uses cross-modal reprogramming to align clinical time series with the LLM's semantic space. Applied to Alzheimer's progression forecasting on the ADNI dataset, it achieves accurate predictions (e.g., CDR-SB MAE < 0.9 even with only 1% training data) without model fine-tuning, demonstrating strong generalization under minimal supervision and promising clinical utility for early-stage monitoring.

## Method Summary
The framework processes multivariate clinical time series by first applying reversible instance normalization (RevIN) to handle inter-patient variability, then segmenting the normalized sequences into patches that are embedded into a low-dimensional space. These patches are mapped to the LLM's semantic token space through cross-attention over a fixed set of text prototypes. Demographics and task instructions are prepended as prompts to guide the LLM's reasoning. The frozen LLM processes this augmented sequence, and a lightweight prediction head outputs forecasts that are denormalized back to clinical scale. The method is trained end-to-end (except the frozen LLM) on limited data, achieving strong performance across multiple forecasting horizons.

## Key Results
- Achieves CDR-SB MAE < 0.9 on 18-month forecasts using only 1% of training data
- RevIN normalization critical for performance, preventing overfitting on small datasets
- Cross-attention reprogramming successfully maps numerical time series to LLM semantic space
- Performance degrades significantly at 36-48 month horizons with fewer LLM layers (6 vs 12)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Attention Reprogramming
The frozen LLM processes numerical clinical time series by mapping data patches to semantic token space via cross-attention over text prototypes. A trainable cross-attention module uses numerical patch embeddings as queries, while a fixed set of text embeddings from the LLM's vocabulary act as keys and values. This "reprograms" the input into a representation the frozen LLM can interpret, translating temporal dynamics into semantic tokens. The method assumes the LLM's pre-trained semantic space contains structural regularities that can approximate clinical progression patterns without weight updates.

### Mechanism 2: Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN)
RevIN normalizes input sequences to zero mean and unit variance per patient instance, stripping away baseline differences and forcing the model to learn relative temporal dynamics rather than absolute values. This handles inter-patient variability and non-stationarity in sparse clinical data, which the paper identifies as a major failure mode when omitted. The transformation is reversed at output to restore clinical scale, with the assumption that the clinically relevant signal lies in the trajectory of change rather than absolute baseline scores.

### Mechanism 3: Prompt-Based Conditioning
Static context (demographics) and task instructions are tokenized and prepended to the reprogrammed time series tokens, utilizing the LLM's context window to steer the latent representations. This creates a "patient embedding" that influences how the model processes subsequent time series tokens, leveraging the LLM's reasoning capacity to associate static demographic risk factors with trajectory patterns observed in the time series tokens.

## Foundational Learning

- **Reprogramming / Adapter Mechanisms**: Understanding how cross-attention acts as a bridge between numerical and semantic spaces is essential since the core of this paper is using a "frozen" LLM for a modality it was never trained on. Quick check: Can you explain why the weights of the LLM remain unchanged, yet the model outputs change based on the clinical input?

- **Distribution Shift & RevIN**: Clinical data suffers heavily from non-stationarity (patient baselines drift), and the paper explicitly identifies failing to handle this as a major failure mode. Quick check: If you feed raw scores from two patients with vastly different baselines into a standard transformer, what artifact might the model learn that hinders generalization?

- **Patch-based Time Series Processing**: The method segments continuous time series into "patches" (tokens) rather than using raw data points, which is necessary to match the LLM's expected input structure. Quick check: How does segmenting a time series into patches of length $\ell$ and stride $s$ affect the model's ability to detect high-frequency vs. low-frequency patterns?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Layer -> RevIN Normalization -> Patching -> Linear Projection -> Cross-Attention Reprogramming -> Frozen LLM Backbone -> Prediction Head -> Denormalization

- **Critical path**: The Reprogramming Interface (cross-attention with text prototypes) and RevIN normalization are the most sensitive components. The paper demonstrates that the choice of LLM backbone (GPT-2 vs. BERT) matters less than the integrity of these normalization and alignment steps.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Frozen vs. Fine-tuned: The paper freezes the LLM to enable training on 1% data (preventing overfitting) and reducing compute
  - Prototypes: Using a fixed subset of vocabulary (100 prototypes) acts as a bottleneck; too few may lose nuance, too many may introduce noise (Table 2 shows 1000P degrades performance)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High MAE with low data: If using <1% data, ensure RevIN is active; otherwise, the model fails to separate signal from noise
  - Scale mismatch: If predictions look like noise, verify the denormalization step is correctly applying the statistics saved during the RevIN forward pass

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. RevIN Ablation: Replicate the Table 2 experiment. Train with and without RevIN on the 10% data split to confirm the performance gap (MAE ~0.8 vs ~3.0)
  2. Prototype Sensitivity: Vary the number of text prototypes (e.g., 50, 100, 500) to visualize how the semantic bottleneck affects the "sharpness" of the attention maps on clinical decline patterns
  3. Horizon Generalization: Train on 12-month forecasts and test directly on 48-month forecasts to measure how well the frozen LLM extrapolates long-term trajectories without specific fine-tuning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can attention visualization or prototype attribution techniques effectively resolve the opacity of the mapping between time series tokens and clinical predictions?
- **Basis in paper**: The authors explicitly identify the opaque internal mapping as a limitation and propose investigating model explanation methods in future work.
- **Why unresolved**: The current cross-modal reprogramming mechanism abstracts numerical data into semantic space, making it difficult to trace which clinical features drive specific predictions.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A study demonstrating a specific interpretability method (e.g., prototype attribution) that allows clinical experts to qualitatively validate the reasoning behind predictions.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Does the framework maintain predictive accuracy when applied to longitudinal clinical datasets with different disease etiologies or irregular sampling rates?
- **Basis in paper**: The evaluation is restricted to the ADNI dataset for Alzheimer's disease, and the paper notes that real-world data is often "sparse, irregular, and incomplete."
- **Why unresolved**: It is uncertain if the text prototypes and temporal patching strategy optimized for cognitive decline transfer effectively to other medical domains with different temporal dynamics.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Benchmarks on external longitudinal datasets (e.g., ICU stay records or other chronic disease registries) showing comparable performance without architecture changes.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Does scaling the frozen backbone to larger, modern LLMs yield diminishing returns or specific benefits for clinical time-series forecasting?
- **Basis in paper**: The study utilizes relatively small models (GPT-2 and BERT), leaving the impact of model scale on the reprogramming efficacy unexplored.
- **Why unresolved**: Larger models possess richer semantic spaces which might improve the cross-modal alignment, but they also introduce higher computational costs that might not justify marginal accuracy gains.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experiments replicating the framework using larger decoder-only models (e.g., Llama-7B) on the same forecasting tasks.

## Limitations
- Prototype Selection: The method depends critically on mapping clinical variables to 100 text prototypes from the LLM's vocabulary, but the paper does not specify how these prototypes are chosen, creating a major source of variability.
- Long-Horizon Generalization: Performance degrades substantially at 36-48 month horizons with fewer LLM layers, with claims of "strong generalization" primarily supported for mid-term horizons.
- Clinical Generalization: The method is validated only on ADNI data for Alzheimer's disease, with uncertainty about whether it generalizes to other clinical domains with different temporal dynamics.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- RevIN normalization is essential for handling inter-patient variability and preventing overfitting on small datasets
- The overall framework architecture (prompt conditioning + reprogramming interface + frozen LLM) produces accurate forecasts when properly implemented
- Cross-attention mechanism successfully maps numerical patches to semantic token space

**Medium Confidence**:
- The 100-prototype selection provides optimal semantic coverage (could vary significantly with different selection methods)
- Frozen LLM approach generalizes better than fine-tuning on limited data (supported by ablation but not directly compared to fine-tuned baselines in all experiments)
- Performance on very long horizons (36-48 months) is comparable to shorter horizons (primarily demonstrated for 18-24 months)

**Low Confidence**:
- The specific text prototypes chosen are optimal for capturing clinical progression patterns
- The method will generalize to other clinical domains beyond Alzheimer's disease
- The RevIN denormalization step perfectly recovers absolute clinical thresholds without error accumulation

## Next Checks

1. **Prototype Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the number and selection method of text prototypes (e.g., random vs. semantic clustering vs. learned selection) to quantify how prototype choice affects forecasting accuracy, particularly focusing on whether the claimed 100-prototype optimal configuration is robust.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Apply the framework to a different clinical longitudinal dataset (e.g., Parkinson's progression or cardiac disease monitoring) to validate whether the frozen LLM + reprogramming approach generalizes beyond Alzheimer's disease, measuring performance degradation when moving to new clinical contexts.

3. **True Irregularity Test**: Evaluate the method on clinically realistic irregular visit patterns by introducing variable visit intervals and random missing values into the ADNI test set, then measuring performance degradation compared to the clean regular-interval validation set to verify claims about handling "sparse, irregular, and incomplete" data.
