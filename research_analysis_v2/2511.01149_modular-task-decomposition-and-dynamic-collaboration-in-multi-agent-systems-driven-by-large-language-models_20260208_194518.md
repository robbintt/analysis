# Modular Task Decomposition and Dynamic Collaboration in Multi-Agent Systems Driven by Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01149
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01149
- Reference count: 27
- Task success rate: 0.79

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a multi-agent architecture for modular task decomposition and dynamic collaboration driven by large language models to address the limitations of single-agent systems in handling complex tasks. The approach converts natural language task descriptions into unified semantic representations, decomposes tasks into hierarchical sub-tasks, and enables dynamic scheduling and routing among agents for real-time collaboration. The method incorporates constraint parsing and global consistency mechanisms to ensure coherent sub-task connections and balanced workloads. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing approaches, achieving a task success rate of 0.79, decomposition efficiency of 0.67, sub-task coverage of 0.72, and load balancing of 0.83.

## Method Summary
The method involves encoding natural language tasks into vector representations via an LLM encoder, then decomposing these into sub-tasks using attention-weighted query vectors that produce differentiated but globally-grounded subtask embeddings. Each agent maintains an internal state updated by combining its sub-task embedding with collaborative messages from other agents, enabling real-time strategy adaptation. Agent outputs are aggregated via LLM-inferred weights with a consistency loss penalizing large deviations between agent outputs. The system uses MS MARCO dataset and evaluates against baselines like Swe-agent, Agent-flan, and Aios using four metrics: Task Success Rate, Decomposition-SPL, Subtask F1, and Load Balancing.

## Key Results
- Achieved task success rate of 0.79, outperforming existing approaches
- Demonstrated decomposition efficiency of 0.67 and sub-task coverage of 0.72
- Maintained load balancing of 0.83 while preventing performance degradation from redundant communication

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Attention-weighted semantic decomposition improves sub-task alignment with global goals by encoding tasks into vector representations via an LLM encoder, then extracting sub-tasks using attention-weighted query vectors. This produces differentiated but globally-grounded subtask embeddings. The core assumption is that the latent semantic space preserves task-relevant structure that can be linearly probed via attention queries.

### Mechanism 2
Dynamic state transitions with inter-agent messaging enable real-time strategy adaptation by having each agent maintain an internal state updated at each time step through combining its sub-task embedding with collaborative messages from other agents. The LLM synthesizes local task context with global coordination signals. The core assumption is that agents can compress relevant collaborative information into messages that are both informative and bandwidth-efficient.

### Mechanism 3
Weighted output fusion with consistency constraints maintains global coherence while respecting agent specialization by aggregating agent outputs via LLM-inferred weights, with a consistency loss penalizing large deviations between agent outputs. This balances specialization with coordination. The core assumption is that the LLM can infer meaningful importance weights from context, and that pairwise output distances capture meaningful inconsistencies.

## Foundational Learning

- **Attention-based decomposition and query mechanisms**: Why needed - the method relies on attention queries to extract sub-tasks from a global embedding. Quick check - Given a task embedding h_T, can you explain how varying the query vector q_i changes which aspects of the task are emphasized in the resulting sub-task?

- **Multi-agent state updates with message passing**: Why needed - agents update their internal states based on both local sub-task context and messages from peers. Quick check - If agent A sends a message m^A_t to agent B at time t, what information must m^A_t contain for B to update its state meaningfully without full context sharing?

- **Global aggregation with consistency regularization**: Why needed - the system must fuse heterogeneous agent outputs into a coherent global result while preventing divergence. Quick check - Why might a pure weighted average fail to produce coherent results without the consistency constraint?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Semantic Encoder -> Decomposition Module -> Agent Pool -> Message Router -> Consistency Enforcer -> Output Aggregator

- **Critical path**: Task T → Semantic Encoder → h_T → Decomposition Module → {t_1, ..., t_N} → Each agent i receives t_i and initializes s^i_0 → At each timestep: agents exchange messages, update states via g(s^i_t, h_i, m^i_t) → Upon completion: collect outputs {o_1, ..., o_N}, compute weights {w_i}, aggregate O → Apply consistency check; if violated, trigger re-allocation or re-planning

- **Design tradeoffs**: Number of decomposition modules peaks at 4-5 for optimal performance; communication frequency threshold optimal around medium threshold (~4); sub-task granularity optimal at 5-6 sub-tasks

- **Failure signatures**: Sub-task overlap shows high consistency loss with low Subtask F1; agent starvation shows low Load Balancing with high communication threshold; planning inefficiency shows sharp dSPL drop when sub-task count exceeds 6

- **First 3 experiments**: Ablate consistency constraint and compare Subtask F1 and task success rate; vary decomposition module count to verify 4-5 modules remains optimal; stress-test communication threshold with controlled message latency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the optimal number of task decomposition modules and subtasks be determined automatically for novel task types? The paper shows performance peaks at 4-5 modules and 5-6 subtasks through empirical tuning, but provides no algorithmic method for predicting optimal granularity. What evidence would resolve it: A meta-learning or heuristic approach that dynamically adjusts module/subtask counts based on task complexity features, validated across diverse task types.

### Open Question 2
Does the architecture generalize to domains beyond retrieval-augmented generation, such as physical task planning or real-time decision-making? Experiments use only MS MARCO (web search queries), yet the introduction claims applicability to smart manufacturing, financial risk control, and emergency response. What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on datasets from robotics simulation, financial trading logs, or crisis response scenarios showing comparable performance metrics.

### Open Question 3
What task characteristics or system conditions cause the 21% failure rate, and can failure modes be predicted? Task success rate is 0.79; no failure analysis is provided to explain why tasks fail or whether failures are systematic. What evidence would resolve it: A breakdown of failures by task type, decomposition depth, or communication load; qualitative analysis of failure trajectories.

## Limitations
- Unknown LLM backbone and model size create uncertainty in reproducing semantic encoding quality
- Training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, optimization steps) are absent, making convergence behavior difficult to reproduce
- Baseline implementations and exact evaluation protocols for the four metrics are not detailed

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the core decomposition mechanism and dynamic collaboration framework, supported by clear equations and logical consistency with related work
- **Medium confidence** in the consistency constraint formulation and weighted output fusion, as these rely on assumed LLM capabilities without extensive empirical validation shown
- **Low confidence** in the exact implementation details needed for faithful reproduction, particularly around prompt engineering and agent initialization

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain generalization**: Evaluate the system on a held-out task set from a different domain (e.g., healthcare or technical documentation) to verify that performance gains are not specific to web search queries

2. **Scalability stress test**: Systematically vary the number of agents and sub-tasks beyond the reported optimal (4-5 modules, 5-6 sub-tasks) to identify breaking points in coordination efficiency and consistency maintenance

3. **Ablation of dynamic routing**: Compare the proposed dynamic scheduling and routing against a static assignment baseline on identical task sets to quantify the contribution of real-time adaptability to the reported improvements
