# QuantKAN: A Unified Quantization Framework for Kolmogorov Arnold Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.18689
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18689
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** First unified framework for KAN quantization with branch-aware quantization showing DSQ optimal for aggressive QAT and GPTQ for moderate PTQ

## Executive Summary
QuantKAN introduces the first comprehensive framework for quantizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), addressing the critical challenge of deploying these spline-based architectures in low-precision environments. The framework implements branch-aware quantization that independently processes base weights, spline/basis weights, and activations to account for their heterogeneous distributions and sensitivity profiles. Through extensive experiments across multiple KAN variants and benchmark datasets, QuantKAN establishes baseline low-precision performance and identifies optimal quantization strategies for different precision regimes.

## Method Summary
QuantKAN provides a unified framework supporting both quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) for KAN architectures. The core innovation is branch-aware quantization that applies independent quantizers to three parameter groups: base weights, spline/basis weights, and activations. For QAT, QuantKAN implements six modern quantizers (LSQ, LSQ+, PACT, QIL, DoReFa, DSQ) with STE-based gradient estimation. For PTQ, it extends methods like GPTQ, AdaRound, AWQ, BRECQ, and others to handle KAN's heterogeneous parameter structure. The framework supports multiple KAN variants including EfficientKAN, FastKAN, PyKAN, and KAGN, with architecture-specific wrappers to maintain their unique characteristics during quantization.

## Key Results
- DSQ is most robust QAT method at aggressive low-bit settings (w2-w3), achieving 60.47% on ImageNet VGG-KAN V4 vs 42.98% for LSQ+
- GPTQ consistently outperforms other PTQ methods at moderate precision (w4-w8), achieving near full-precision accuracy across datasets
- Parameter sensitivity analysis reveals spline/basis components are most vulnerable to quantization, motivating mixed-precision designs
- Branch-aware quantization provides significant robustness improvements over unified quantization approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Branch-Aware Quantization for Heterogeneous Parameter Distributions
- **Claim:** Separating quantizers for base weights, spline/basis weights, and activations improves low-bit robustness compared to unified quantization.
- **Mechanism:** KAN layers decompose into two functionally distinct pathways. Base weights exhibit heavier tails (kurtosis κ=37.0 in EfficientKAN) with ~4× wider dynamic range, while spline/basis weights are more concentrated. Independent quantizers allow each branch to learn/calibrate appropriate scales and clipping thresholds without scale coupling.
- **Core assumption:** The functional roles of base and spline branches are sufficiently distinct that optimizing their quantization parameters independently yields better error compensation than shared scaling.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "branch-specific quantizers for base, spline, and activation components"; [Section 3] Eq. (2) shows independent quantizers; [Section 5.4/Table 5] Parameter sensitivity reveals spline/basis groups show highest degradation.
- **Break condition:** If branches exhibit similar statistical properties and sensitivity profiles, branch-aware quantization would reduce to computational overhead without accuracy gains.

### Mechanism 2: Differentiable Soft Quantization (DSQ) for Aggressive Low-Bit Training
- **Claim:** DSQ provides the most robust QAT performance at aggressive low-bit settings (2-4 bits) across KAN variants.
- **Mechanism:** DSQ replaces hard rounding with a differentiable soft staircase controlled by a sharpness parameter α that is annealed during training. This bridges full-precision and low-bit representations, providing smoother optimization landscapes when quantization noise is amplified by KAN's nonlinear basis function blocks.
- **Core assumption:** The optimization challenge at low bits stems primarily from discrete rounding operations, and smooth interpolation between full-precision and quantized regimes helps SGD navigate the loss landscape.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "DSQ is the most robust QAT method at aggressive low-bit settings"; [Section 5.1/Table 1] DSQ consistently achieves lowest degradation across architectures.
- **Break condition:** If the smooth-to-hard annealing schedule is poorly tuned, DSQ may converge to suboptimal local minima or fail to reach true quantized representations.

### Mechanism 3: Second-Order Error Compensation (GPTQ) for Post-Training Quantization
- **Claim:** GPTQ consistently outperforms other PTQ methods for KANs at moderate precision (4-8 bits).
- **Mechanism:** GPTQ minimizes a second-order approximation of quantization error using Hessian information estimated from calibration data. Weights are quantized sequentially, with error from early decisions compensated by updating remaining weights using the inverse Hessian.
- **Core assumption:** The Hessian proxy (H ≈ 2XX^T + λI) captures sufficient curvature information to guide rounding decisions that minimize output reconstruction error.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "GPTQ is the strongest PTQ method at moderate precision"; [Section 5.2/Table 3] GPTQ achieves near full-precision accuracy at w4 and w8 across datasets.
- **Break condition:** At extreme low-bit (w2) or aggressive joint quantization, second-order compensation alone cannot recover accuracy, suggesting fundamental information loss without retraining.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: KAN Layer Structure (Base vs. Spline Branches)**
  - Why needed here: QuantKAN's branch-aware design requires understanding that y = Wb·σ(x) + Ws·Φ(x) combines a linear pathway with a flexible basis expansion pathway.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why using a single quantizer for both branches might cause scale mismatch?

- **Concept: Straight-Through Estimator (STE) for Quantization-Aware Training**
  - Why needed here: All QAT methods (LSQ, PACT, DSQ, etc.) use STE to approximate gradients through discrete rounding operations. Understanding this explains why optimization becomes unstable at very low bits.
  - Quick check question: In the backward pass, how does STE treat the rounding operation?

- **Concept: Per-Tensor vs. Per-Channel Quantization Granularity**
  - Why needed here: The paper shows variant-dependent effects—per-channel helps activations universally (+0.07 to +0.20) but harms FastKAN weights (-0.74). This interaction is critical for deployment decisions.
  - Quick check question: Why might per-channel scaling degrade performance for some weight tensors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** QuantKANLinear -> QuantFastKANLayer -> QuantPyKANLayer -> QuantGRAMLayer -> QuantKAGNConv (architecture-aware wrappers); QAT quantizers (LSQ/LSQ+, PACT, QIL, DoReFa, DSQ) in quantizers/; PTQ methods (GPTQ, AdaRound, AWQ, BRECQ, SmoothQuant, HAWQ-V2, ZeroQ) in ptq/; Branch-aware core: Independent Qb (base), Qs (spline/basis), Qa (activation) per layer

- **Critical path:** 1. Select KAN variant (EfficientKAN/FastKAN/PyKAN/GRAM-KAN) 2. Train full-precision model first 3. Choose quantization regime: QAT (use DSQ default) or PTQ (use GPTQ default) 4. Apply branch-aware quantization with independent quantizers 5. Run sensitivity analysis (Table 5 approach) if targeting mixed-precision

- **Design tradeoffs:** DSQ vs LSQ: DSQ more robust at w2-w3, LSQ competitive at w4-w8 but hyperparameter-sensitive; QAT vs PTQ: QAT enables extreme compression; PTQ faster but degrades rapidly below w4; Per-channel vs per-tensor: Per-channel universally helps activations; per-channel weights help EfficientKAN/PyKAN but harm FastKAN significantly

- **Failure signatures:** Catastrophic accuracy collapse (→1-10%) at aggressive settings: typically indicates method mismatch (e.g., PACT/QIL at w2-w3); BRECQ producing 73.77% at w8 (vs 98% full precision) on MNIST KAN FCN: indicates branch-specific calibration failure; FastKAN + per-channel weight quantization: expect ~0.7% degradation from this configuration alone

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. **Baseline establishment:** Run full-precision training on your target dataset/architecture, then apply GPTQ at w4/w8 to establish PTQ baseline accuracy. 2. **Sensitivity profiling:** Quantize each parameter group (base, spline/basis, scaling) independently to {2,3,4} bits while keeping others at 8-bit (Table 5 approach) to identify most fragile components. 3. **Mixed-precision validation:** Based on sensitivity results, allocate 8-bit to the most sensitive group and 2-4 bit to others; compare against uniform precision using DSQ (QAT) or GPTQ (PTQ).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can an automated mechanism be developed to determine the optimal mixed-precision bit-width allocation across the heterogeneous base and spline/basis branches of KANs?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper states that "Parameter-wise sensitivity analyses reveal that spline/basis components are often the dominant failure mode, motivating mixed-precision designs that allocate bits where they matter most."
- **Why unresolved:** QuantKAN establishes sensitivity heuristics (e.g., keeping sensitive spline weights at 8-bit while aggressively quantizing others) but does not propose an algorithmic solution or Hessian-based search to automate this allocation for unseen architectures or datasets.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A dynamic search algorithm (e.g., extending HAWQ-V2) capable of predicting optimal bit-widths for each branch that maximizes accuracy under a specific memory budget.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Do the efficiency gains observed in simulated quantization translate into actual latency and energy improvements on hardware accelerators (e.g., FPGA, ASIC)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly state their goal is "efficiently deploying KANs in real-world, resource-constrained environments" and describe the framework as "hardware-friendly," yet the evaluation relies entirely on software-based accuracy metrics.
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper demonstrates theoretical compression and accuracy preservation, it lacks empirical measurements of inference latency, throughput, or energy consumption on physical hardware accelerators where memory bandwidth and integer arithmetic units dictate true efficiency.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Hardware synthesis reports or on-device benchmarks showing cycles-per-inference and power consumption for QuantKAN models compared to full-precision baselines.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the branch-aware quantization robustness demonstrated on vision tasks generalize to the scientific computing and physics-informed tasks where KANs excel?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper restricts evaluation to standard vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet), despite citing the scientific and interpretability motivations of KANs (e.g., PyKAN for scientific applications).
- **Why unresolved:** KANs in scientific machine learning (SciML) often operate on fundamentally different data distributions (e.g., continuous functions, PDE solutions) and loss landscapes compared to discrete image classification; the interaction of spline quantization noise with physics-informed constraints remains unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments applying QuantKAN to physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) or symbolic regression tasks to verify if branch-aware quantization distorts the mathematical interpretability or convergence stability required for scientific accuracy.

## Limitations

- Framework assumes pretrained full-precision models as input and doesn't address end-to-end quantization from scratch
- Study focuses on feedforward and convolutional KANs, leaving recurrent or transformer-style KANs unexplored
- While sensitivity analysis identifies vulnerable components, the framework doesn't incorporate dynamic or adaptive bit-width allocation beyond manual mixed-precision design

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Branch-aware quantization improves low-bit robustness; DSQ superiority at aggressive low-bit settings; GPTQ effectiveness for moderate-precision PTQ
- **Medium confidence:** Claims about distributional differences predicting sensitivity; Per-channel effects being architecture-dependent
- **Low confidence:** Claims about quantization preserving KAN's interpretability properties (not directly evaluated)

## Next Checks

1. **Mixed-precision sensitivity validation:** Conduct comprehensive ablation testing mixed-precision allocations across all three parameter groups (base, spline/basis, activation) at {2,3,4,8} bits to validate the sensitivity analysis framework and identify optimal allocation strategies for each architecture-dataset pair.

2. **Extreme low-bit capability boundary:** Systematically explore the theoretical limit of QAT on KANs by testing DSQ at w1 with architectural modifications (e.g., wider layers, different basis functions) to determine whether the observed w2 floor is fundamental or architectural.

3. **Generalization to novel KAN variants:** Apply QuantKAN's branch-aware framework to recently proposed KAN variants like P-KANs or K-DAREK to test whether the core insight about heterogeneous parameter distributions generalizes beyond the architectures studied here.
