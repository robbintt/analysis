core_contribution: This paper introduces graded distributed belief as a formal logic
  where a group's collective belief in a fact is quantified by the degree of belief
  remaining after removing the least important information from their combined belief
  bases. The key innovation is a graded belief base semantics that extends belief
  bases to multisets, where each belief is assigned a natural number weight representing
  its importance.

# Graded Distributed Belief

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.22381
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22381
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces graded distributed belief as a logic where group belief strength is quantified by minimum importance of information removal from merged belief bases

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces graded distributed belief as a formal logic that quantifies collective belief strength by measuring the minimum importance of information that must be removed from a group's merged belief base to invalidate a deduction. The framework represents each agent's beliefs as multisets with natural number weights indicating importance, and defines group belief by summing individual weights for identical formulas. The paper provides sound and complete axiomatization, proves decidability via filtration, and shows PSPACE-completeness through a tableaux-based decision procedure. A key innovation is defining epistemic disagreement as the amount of information needing removal to restore consistency within a group.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a graded belief base semantics where belief bases are multisets mapping formulas to natural number weights. It provides two equivalent semantic frameworks: belief base semantics (MAGBM) and distance-based semantics (QNGDM). The tableaux-based decision procedure TabLGDDA extends classical tableau with rules for handling graded modalities, achieving PSPACE-completeness. The framework also enables defining epistemic disagreement as the minimum total importance of beliefs that must be discarded to restore consistency, providing a quantitative measure of group disagreement strength.

## Key Results
- Graded distributed belief strength equals the minimum total importance of information removable from merged belief bases
- The logic is decidable with PSPACE-complete complexity
- Epistemic disagreement can be quantified as the "distance from consistency" in belief bases
- Sound and complete axiomatization provided for the graded distributed belief logic

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Group distributed belief strength can be quantified by the minimum total importance of information that must be removed from the merged belief base to invalidate a deduction.
- Mechanism: The framework represents each agent's beliefs as a multiset where each formula α has an associated weight (natural number). When computing group belief, individual bases are merged by summing weights for identical formulas. The degree of distributed belief in ϕ is then the smallest k such that removing information of total importance k would prevent deducing ϕ.
- Core assumption: Belief importance is additive across agents (epistemic egalitarianism), and importance scores are commensurable across different pieces of information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The strength of the group's distributed belief is directly computed from the group's belief base after having merged its members' individual belief bases."
  - [section 2.2, Definition 3] "BJ(α) = ∑i∈J Bi(α) for every α ∈ L0" — group belief degree equals sum of individual degrees.
  - [corpus] Related work on distributed knowing-how (arxiv:2511.22374) provides convergent formalization of group-level epistemic attitudes, but does not directly validate the additive importance assumption.
- Break condition: If beliefs have incommensurable importance dimensions (e.g., safety vs. efficiency), or if importance is context-dependent rather than intrinsic, the additive aggregation may produce misleading strength measures.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The distance between possible states from a group's perspective can be defined as the weighted sum of the group's explicit beliefs violated at that state.
- Mechanism: For group J at state S, the implausibility degree of alternative state S′ equals ∑α: S′⊭α BJ(α). This creates a pseudo-metric where states satisfying more important beliefs are closer (more plausible). The modal operator □kJϕ then means "ϕ holds in all states at distance ≤ k from the current state."
- Core assumption: The distance function adequately captures epistemic accessibility; all violations are independent and additive.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2, Definition 4] "SRkJ S′ means that, from the point of view of the group J at state S, state S′ is at most k-implausible."
  - [section 3, Definition 7] Formalizes distance function ρ(J,w,u) as sum of degrees of unsatisfied beliefs.
  - [corpus] The topological evidence model approach (arxiv:2509.00184) uses different distance semantics for group belief, suggesting alternative but not validated approaches.
- Break condition: If belief violations interact non-additively (e.g., violating core assumptions makes peripheral violations irrelevant), the linear distance model fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Epistemic disagreement within a group can be quantified as the minimum total importance of beliefs that must be discarded to restore consistency.
- Mechanism: The paper defines Disagree(J,k) = □k−1J ⊥, meaning that inconsistency (⊥) is unavoidable even after removing beliefs of total importance k−1. This operationalizes disagreement as the "distance from consistency."
- Core assumption: Disagreement is fundamentally about logical inconsistency rather than other factors (e.g., divergence in action preferences, credence distributions).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.4] "Disagree(J,k) means that within the group J there is an epistemic disagreement of at least strength k."
  - [section 2.4, Example 1] Demonstrates computation: the four-agent committee has disagreement strength min{k1,k3} + min{k2,k4} based on conflicting beliefs.
  - [corpus] Related work mentions inconsistency measures [19], but corpus signals show no direct empirical validation of this disagreement measure.
- Break condition: When agents hold mutually inconsistent beliefs but don't recognize the conflict (higher-order ignorance), or when "agreeing to disagree" is rational given different priors, the purely logical measure may not capture intuitive disagreement.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Multisets and graded cardinality**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core innovation is treating belief bases as multisets (bags) where each formula can appear with multiplicity/weight. Standard set operations don't suffice.
  - Quick check question: Given multiset B where B(p)=3 and B(q)=2, what is the support Supp(B)?

- Concept: **Modal logic semantics (Kripke models)**
  - Why needed here: The paper provides both belief-base semantics and equivalent Kripke-style semantics. Understanding accessibility relations and the □ modality is essential.
  - Quick check question: In a Kripke model, what does □ϕ mean at world w?

- Concept: **Soundness and completeness of axiomatizations**
  - Why needed here: The paper proves their Hilbert-style axiomatization is sound and complete w.r.t. QNGDM semantics, which requires understanding proof theory.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for an axiomatization to be "complete" with respect to a semantics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Language L₀**: Explicit belief formulas with graded operators △ki α (agent i believes α with degree ≥k)
  - **Language L**: Full modal language adding □kJ ϕ (group J has distributed belief in ϕ with strength ≥k)
  - **State representation**: Tuple (B₁,...,Bₙ,V) with graded belief bases Bᵢ and valuation V
  - **Distance function ρ**: Computes implausibility between states for groups
  - **Tableaux calculus TabLGDDA**: Decision procedure with rules (△-Mon) and (□-Elim)

- Critical path:
  1. Parse input formula ϕ ∈ L
  2. Initialize tableau with {ϕ}
  3. Apply decomposition rules for classical connectives
  4. Apply (△-Mon) to resolve graded explicit belief constraints
  5. Apply (□-Elim) by iterating partitions δ ∈ Part(k,J) and subsets Y ⊆ X
  6. Check for closure (⊥) in all branches

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **MAGBM vs. QNGDM semantics**: MAGBM is computationally grounded (belief bases primitive); QNGDM is axiomatizable but requires explicit distance function. The paper shows equivalence via transformations.
  - **Exact equality (NGDM-DOX) vs. inequality (QNGDM-DOX)**: The exact condition isn't axiomatizable, so the framework uses the weaker inequality that still captures the logic.
  - **PSPACE complexity**: Acceptable for verification but may be prohibitive for real-time reasoning with many agents.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Non-termination**: Can occur if grade representations allow unbounded values; paper assumes finite grades in formulas.
  - **Exponential blowup in (□-Elim)**: The rule produces potentially 2^|X| denominators; naive implementation will fail on moderate formula sizes.
  - **Inconsistent belief bases**: Individual agents may have inconsistent bases; this is allowed but affects disagreement measures.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Implement the (□-Elim) rule with partition enumeration**: Given a small formula ¬□kJ ϕ ∪ X, enumerate all Y ⊆ X and δ ∈ Part(k,J). Verify that each denominator correctly captures the semantic condition. Check against the committee example (Example 1) with concrete k values.
  2. **Build a MAGBM-to-QNGDM converter**: Given a state (B₁,...,Bₙ,V) and context U, construct the equivalent QNGDM. Verify that the distance function ρ computed via (NGDM-DOX) matches manual calculation for a 2-agent, 2-world example.
  3. **Validate the disagreement measure on the committee example**: Encode the four-agent scenario with specific k₀,k₁,k₂,k₃,k₄ values. Compute Disagree(J,k) for all subgroups J. Verify that {Ann,Bob} and {Cath,John} show no internal disagreement, but the full group does.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the graded belief semantics be generalized to use ordinals instead of natural numbers for belief degrees?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Following Spohn's ranking theory [34], we plan to study, in future work, a more general variant of the graded belief semantics based on ordinals instead of natural numbers."
- Why unresolved: The current framework is limited to natural numbers (including zero and infinity), which may not capture finer-grained distinctions that ordinal-based rankings can provide.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal extension of the graded belief base semantics to ordinal grades, with corresponding sound and complete axiomatization.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What would a qualitative version of graded distributed belief look like when the counting view is replaced with a set inclusion perspective?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "In future work, we intend to investigate a qualitative version by replacing the counting view with a qualitative perspective based on set inclusion."
- Why unresolved: The current notion (Definition 4) quantifies belief strength by counting weighted information removable from the belief base; a qualitative alternative using set inclusion remains undeveloped.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal definition of qualitative graded distributed belief, with corresponding logical properties and comparison to the counting-based approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the static framework be extended to incorporate dynamic graded belief base change?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Last but not least, we aim to move from a static to a dynamic setting by extending our framework with a notion of graded belief base change."
- Why unresolved: The current logic captures static graded distributed beliefs but does not model how belief grades evolve through updates, announcements, or other belief revision operations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A dynamic extension with operators for belief change, along with sound and complete axiomatization and complexity analysis.

## Limitations

- **Additive importance assumption**: The framework assumes belief importance is additive and commensurable across agents, which may not hold for beliefs with different dimensions of importance.
- **Purely logical disagreement**: Disagreement is defined purely as logical inconsistency, potentially missing other forms of epistemic divergence such as conflicting credences or divergent action preferences.
- **PSPACE complexity**: While optimal for the logic, the PSPACE complexity may limit practical deployment in systems with many agents or large belief bases.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The formal machinery for graded belief base semantics, the tableaux decision procedure, and the soundness/completeness proofs are mathematically rigorous and well-established.
- **Medium confidence**: The interpretation of disagreement as logical inconsistency is internally consistent but may not capture all intuitive notions of epistemic disagreement.
- **Low confidence**: The additive aggregation of belief importance across agents assumes commensurability that may not hold in real-world scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical grounding**: Test the disagreement measure on controlled scenarios where intuitive disagreement strength is known, comparing the framework's output against human judgments of disagreement severity.

2. **Boundary condition analysis**: Systematically examine cases where the additive importance assumption fails—such as beliefs with competing dimensions or context-dependent importance—to quantify the framework's limitations.

3. **Implementation stress testing**: Build a prototype tableaux implementation and evaluate its performance on formulas with nested graded modalities, measuring actual vs. theoretical complexity and identifying practical bottlenecks in the partition enumeration process.
