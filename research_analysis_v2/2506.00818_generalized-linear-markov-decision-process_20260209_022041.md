# Generalized Linear Markov Decision Process

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00818
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00818
- Reference count: 32
- One-line primary result: Proposed GLMDP framework with semi-supervised offline RL algorithms achieves suboptimality rate of Õ(√drH²/n + √((dp+dr)²H⁴/(n+N))) when unlabeled data is abundant.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses reinforcement learning with complex, non-linear reward functions in data-scarce environments by proposing the Generalized Linear Markov Decision Process (GLMDP) framework. GLMDP models rewards using generalized linear models while maintaining linear transition dynamics, extending classical linear MDPs to handle binary, count-valued, and bounded continuous rewards. The authors develop two offline RL algorithms: Generalized Pessimistic Value Iteration (GPEVI) for supervised learning and Semi-Supervised GPEVI (SS-GPEVI) that leverages both labeled and unlabeled trajectories. Theoretical guarantees establish improved sample efficiency, particularly when unlabeled data is abundant and transition dynamics are complex.

## Method Summary
The GLMDP framework models rewards through generalized linear models with known link functions while preserving linear transition dynamics. The key insight is decomposing the Bellman operator into reward and transition components, enabling separate estimation and uncertainty quantification. GPEVI estimates both reward and transition parameters using only labeled data with pessimistic value iteration. SS-GPEVI improves sample efficiency by estimating transition parameters using both labeled and unlabeled trajectories while using only labeled data for reward estimation. The algorithms employ decomposed pessimism, separating uncertainty into reward and transition components, which enables interpretable bounds and supports semi-supervised learning.

## Key Results
- GPEVI achieves suboptimality rate of Õ(√drH²/n + √((dp+dr)²H⁴/n)) in supervised setting
- SS-GPEVI improves to Õ(√drH²/n + √((dp+dr)²H⁴/(n+N))) when unlabeled data is abundant
- Semi-supervised approach significantly outperforms supervised methods when transition dynamics are complex (dp ≫ dr) and unlabeled data is plentiful
- Validated through simulations and the PointMaze benchmark, demonstrating practical effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Generalized Linear Reward Modeling via Link Functions
Modeling rewards through generalized linear models with known link functions extends linear MDPs to handle binary, count-valued, and bounded continuous rewards while preserving theoretical tractability. The reward expectation becomes E[rh|x,a] = g(⟨ϕr(x,a),θ*⟩) where g(·) is a link function, and the Bellman operator is approximated through a parametric function class ensuring Bellman completeness. Core assumptions include bounded first and second derivatives of the link function and well-conditioned feature covariance matrices.

### Mechanism 2: Decomposed Uncertainty Quantification for Pessimism
Separating total uncertainty into reward (Γr,h) and transition (Γp,h) components enables interpretable pessimism bounds and supports semi-supervised learning. The uncertainty quantifier Γh(x,a) = Γr,h(x,a) + Γp,h(x,a) scales with link function derivatives and feature covariance inverse. Pessimistic Q-values are computed as Qh(x,a) = min{(BhVh+1)(x,a) − Γh(x,a), H−h+1}+, with the decomposition offering three advantages: interpretable bounds, flexibility in data usage, and computational efficiency.

### Mechanism 3: Semi-supervised Transition Learning Without Reward Imputation
Estimating transition parameters β*h using both labeled and unlabeled trajectories while using only labeled data for reward parameters θ*h improves sample efficiency when N ≫ n and dp ≫ dr. SS-GPEVI estimates βh using the combined dataset, and the suboptimality bound shows unlabeled data reduces transition uncertainty. This approach avoids the need to impute missing rewards, a major challenge in semi-supervised RL.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and link functions**
  - Why needed here: Core to the reward modeling; must understand how logistic, Poisson, and beta regression map linear predictors to expected rewards.
  - Quick check question: Can you derive the negative log-likelihood for a logistic GLM and explain why the Hessian depends on the predicted probabilities?

- Concept: **Bellman completeness**
  - Why needed here: The key property ensuring the optimal Q-function lies within the parametric function class F; without this, value iteration error accumulates uncontrollably.
  - Quick check question: Explain why standard neural network function classes typically lack Bellman completeness and the implications for offline RL.

- Concept: **Pessimism principle in offline RL**
  - Why needed here: Without exploration, uncertainty quantification via pessimism prevents overestimation of OOD actions; understand how uncertainty bounds translate to suboptimality guarantees.
  - Quick check question: Why does pessimism help in offline RL but potentially hurt in online RL with exploration?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Feature extractors (ϕr, ϕp) -> Reward estimator (GLM solver for θh) -> Transition estimator (Ridge regression for βh) -> Uncertainty quantifier (Γh = Γr,h + Γp,h) -> Value iteration (Pessimistic Q-updates)

- Critical path: 1. Feature engineering for ϕr, ϕp (domain-specific, must satisfy coverage) 2. GLM fitting for θh (requires labeled rewards) 3. Transition fitting for βh (can use unlabeled transitions) 4. Uncertainty computation and pessimistic value backup 5. Policy extraction via argmax over Q-values

- Design tradeoffs: Separate vs. shared features (ϕr vs. ϕp) increases flexibility but doubles feature engineering effort; labeled vs. unlabeled allocation - more unlabeled helps when dp ≫ dr; hyperparameters (αr, αp, λ) - cross-validation recommended

- Failure signatures: Suboptimality plateaus despite more data → check feature coverage (λmin(Λh), λmin(Σh)); SS-GPEVI underperforms GPEVI → likely dp ≪ dr or unlabeled data from shifted distribution; Numerical instability in GLM fitting → check for separation in logistic regression

- First 3 experiments: 1. Synthetic validation: Implement GPEVI on logistic regression simulation and verify suboptimality decreases as O(1/√n) 2. Semi-supervised ablation: Fix n=200, vary N ∈ {0, 500, 1000, 2000} to confirm SS-GPEVI gains emerge when N ≫ n 3. Feature coverage stress test: Reduce feature dimensionality artificially to induce λmin ≈ 0; observe uncertainty explosion and policy degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the GLMDP framework be effectively adapted to online reinforcement learning settings or model-based planning algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency? The current paper focuses exclusively on offline RL algorithms; the adaptation to online or model-based settings is proposed as a future direction but not implemented or analyzed. Deriving regret bounds for an online GLMDP variant would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
How does the framework perform in sequential decision-making tasks with temporal heterogeneity, where reward types vary across time steps? The discussion notes the framework can naturally support different link functions at different time steps, but experiments only evaluate settings with consistent reward structures. Simulation results analyzing a GLMDP with mixed reward structures would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
Can the GLMDP framework be extended to learn feature representations end-to-end rather than relying on known, hand-crafted feature maps? The model definition relies on "known feature maps," limiting applicability in domains where good feature representations are unknown. A modification that jointly learns the feature maps and generalized linear parameters without sacrificing sample efficiency guarantees would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- Assumes known link functions, which may not hold in practice
- Framework assumes linear transition dynamics, limiting applicability to highly non-linear environments
- Performance degrades significantly when feature coverage assumptions (λ_min > 0) are violated

## Confidence
- **High**: Theoretical suboptimality bounds (Corollary 1, 2) under stated assumptions; performance advantage of SS-GPEVI in synthetic settings when N ≫ n
- **Medium**: Generalization of semi-supervised gains to complex domains like PointMaze; robustness to link function misspecification
- **Low**: Applicability to continuous action spaces; scalability to very high-dimensional features

## Next Checks
1. **Link function sensitivity**: Test GPEVI with misspecified link functions (e.g., logistic for Poisson rewards) and measure performance degradation.
2. **Feature coverage stress test**: Systematically reduce feature dimensionality to induce λ_min ≈ 0 and observe how uncertainty bounds and suboptimality scale.
3. **Semi-supervised crossover analysis**: For varying dp/dr ratios, determine the minimum N/n ratio required for SS-GPEVI to outperform GPEVI.
