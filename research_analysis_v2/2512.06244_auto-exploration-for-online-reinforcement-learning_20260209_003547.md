# Auto-exploration for online reinforcement learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.06244
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06244
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces auto-exploration framework achieving O(ϵ^-2) sample complexity without requiring problem-dependent parameters or explicit exploration

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces auto-exploration, a new class of parameter-free methods for online reinforcement learning that automatically explores both state and action spaces without prior knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. The authors present two variants: one for tabular RL and one for linear function approximation. The core idea is to use dynamic mixing times and discounted state distributions to automatically explore hard-to-reach states, eliminating the need for explicit exploration or prior knowledge of mixing parameters.

## Method Summary
The method uses Stochastic Policy Mirror Descent (SPMD) with Tsallis entropy regularization. For tabular RL, it employs a Truncated On-policy Monte Carlo (TOMC) estimator with dynamic mixing time based on discounted hitting times. For linear function approximation, it combines explicit exploration with robust gradient estimation using multiple independent runs and minimum-norm selection. The framework automatically explores hard-to-reach states through dynamic mixing times and achieves O(ϵ^-2) sample complexity under algorithm-independent assumptions about the existence of an exploring optimal policy.

## Key Results
- First algorithm-independent O(ϵ^-2) sample complexity under weaker exploration assumptions
- Parameter-free implementations that don't require tuning or estimating unknown quantities
- Linear function approximation variant can converge without visiting all states
- Simple to implement and works under existence of an exploring optimal policy
- Implicit state-action exploration eliminates need for explicit exploration in tabular settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Implicit State-Action Exploration
When an optimal policy π* exists that induces a mixing Markov chain with stationary distribution ν* > 0, any intermediate policy π_t that assigns positive probability to optimal actions inherits exploratory properties through the Markov chain dynamics. The policy mirror descent update with Tsallis entropy naturally maintains sufficient probability on optimal actions.

### Mechanism 2: Dynamic Mixing Time
Uses observable discounted hitting times h^π_m(z) := γ^(m-τ^π_m(z)) instead of unknown mixing parameters. The dynamic mixing time ˜m^π(π,ς) := min{m : max_z h^π_m(z) ≤ ς·(1-γ)} adapts until bias is controlled, providing computable stopping criteria.

### Mechanism 3: Robust Gradient Estimation
Run CTD algorithm j̄ = ⌈log₂(1/δ)⌉ times independently and select ˘Q := argmin{‖ˆQ^(i)‖_∞}. This achieves high-probability bounds without variance reduction by leveraging independence of runs and exponential decay in number of runs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Mixing time and stationary distribution of Markov chains**: Essential for understanding how quickly a policy-induced Markov chain approaches its stationary distribution. Quick check: Can you explain why ‖Pr^π(s_τ = ·|s₀) - ν‖_tv ≤ C·ρ^τ implies geometric convergence to stationary distribution?

- **Policy mirror descent with Bregman divergence**: Core iterative algorithm. Quick check: What is the closed-form solution when D is KL-divergence (Shannon entropy) vs. Tsallis entropy?

- **Linear function approximation and projected Bellman equation**: Critical for understanding why Q̄ = Φ[Φ^T W Φ]^{-1}Φ^T W(γP^π Q̄ + c) defines optimal weights. Quick check: Why does the choice of weighting distribution W affect solution quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: SPMD Loop (k iterations) -> Policy Update (Equation 4) -> Q-Estimation Subsystem (TOMC/CTD) -> Convergence Certification (Advantage gap function)

- **Critical path**: The CTD inner loop dominates sample complexity. Total samples = k × N × (mixing cost). For linear FA: Õ(|A|^{3-p}|S|^4 / [(1-γ)^{13}f^4ϵ^2] · D_expl(δ))

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Higher f forces exploration of arbitrary states (worst-case better, practical worse)
  - Tabular uses implicit exploration; linear FA requires explicit ε^S_π, ε^A_π
  - More CTD runs → higher confidence but linear cost increase

- **Failure signatures**:
  1. Dynamic mixing time grows unboundedly → signals λ^π(z) ≈ 0
  2. Advantage gap ǧ^π_k(s) doesn't decrease → suggests κ estimate violates (38)
  3. ‖˘Q‖_∞ explodes → CTD not converged; increase N or m

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Tabular validation on Garnet MDP with known mixing optimal policy
  2. Ablation on frequency parameter f ∈ {0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0}
  3. Robust estimator sensitivity comparing median-of-means vs. minimum-norm selection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. Can a tailored auto-exploration design for the long-term average cost setting achieve better sample complexity than the sub-optimal O(ϵ^-7) derived from current reduction to discounted problems?

2. How can the auto-exploration framework and advantage gap function be extended to general state spaces, such as continuous state spaces S ⊂ ℝ^{n_S}?

3. Can the requirement for small function approximation error (ϵ_app,∞) be relaxed in the linear setting to avoid need for explicit state-exploration policies?

## Limitations

- The theoretical framework relies on geometric mixing rates, which may not hold in real-world MDPs
- Linear function approximation variant requires explicit state-exploration policies when approximation error is large
- Dynamic mixing time computation may become expensive in large state spaces
- Frequency parameter f still requires tuning based on function approximation quality

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core theoretical framework around mixing times and discounted state distributions is mathematically sound. Use of Bregman divergences for policy updates is well-established.

**Medium confidence**: Algorithm-independent sample complexity results hold under stated assumptions, but practical performance varies significantly depending on MDP structure.

**Low confidence**: Linear function approximation variant's convergence without visiting all states relies heavily on feature representation accuracy.

## Next Checks

1. **Mixing time sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary discount factor γ ∈ [0.75, 0.99] on standard benchmarks to measure how dynamic mixing time scales with problem parameters.

2. **Robust estimator empirical evaluation**: Compare minimum-norm robust estimator against simpler alternatives on MDPs with varying stochasticity, measuring actual failure rates vs. theoretical 2^{-j̄} bound.

3. **Function approximation quality threshold**: Conduct ablation studies varying ϵ_app,∞ from 0 to 0.1 on linearly solvable MDPs, measuring minimum f value required for convergence as function of approximation error.
