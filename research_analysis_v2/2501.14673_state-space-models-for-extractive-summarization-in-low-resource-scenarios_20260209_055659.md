# State Space Models for Extractive Summarization in Low Resource Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.14673
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14673
- Reference count: 23
- The paper introduces MPoincareSum, a method for extractive summarization in low-resource settings that outperforms several existing approaches in ROUGE scores.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MPoincareSum, a novel method for extractive summarization designed specifically for low-resource scenarios. The approach leverages the Mamba state space model to generate sentence and review semantics, applies Poincaré compression to select meaningful features, and uses a linear layer to predict sentence relevance before paraphrasing with BART. Experiments on the Amazon review dataset demonstrate that MPoincareSum achieves superior ROUGE scores compared to existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of combining State Space models with Poincaré compression for summarization tasks where training data is scarce.

## Method Summary
MPoincareSum frames extractive summarization as a binary classification task where sentences are labeled as relevant or irrelevant for the summary. The method uses a Mamba encoder to generate embeddings for reviews and sentences, concatenates these embeddings, and applies spectral clustering followed by Poincaré distance calculations to compress features. A linear classifier with LoRA fine-tuning predicts sentence relevance, and BART paraphrases the selected sentences into the final summary. The entire pipeline is designed to work efficiently with limited training data while capturing hierarchical relationships between reviews and sentences.

## Key Results
- MPoincareSum outperforms existing approaches on Amazon review dataset ROUGE scores
- Ablation study confirms Poincaré compression and LoRA are critical for performance
- The model demonstrates effectiveness in extreme low-resource scenarios (136 training samples)
- Trade-offs exist between ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2/L, suggesting semantic alignment over exact token matching

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling via Selective State Spaces
The Mamba architecture mitigates computational inefficiency of Transformers on long sequences by implementing linear scaling, preserving long-range dependencies critical for document-level context. It uses a selective scan algorithm and discretized recurrent SSM with HiPPO initialization to compress input history into a hidden state, allowing memorization without quadratic self-attention complexity.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Feature Selection via Poincaré Compression
High-dimensional embeddings are mapped to hyperbolic (Poincaré) space to improve feature quality for the classifier by better representing the latent hierarchy of sentence relevance. Spectral clustering calculates Poincaré distances between embeddings and centroids, forcing the feature space to account for hierarchical relationships between sentences and review topics.

### Mechanism 3: Regularization via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA)
Low-Rank Adaptation prevents overfitting in the low-resource regime by restricting updates to a low-rank subspace. The system freezes pre-trained Mamba weights and injects trainable decomposition matrices, drastically reducing trainable parameters and forcing the model to adapt general features rather than memorizing the small training set.

## Foundational Learning

- **State Space Models (SSMs) & Mamba**: Understand how SSMs replace attention through discretization and state propagation to debug why the model handles long reviews differently than BERT. Quick check: How does Mamba's inference complexity scale with sequence length compared to a standard Transformer?

- **Hyperbolic Geometry (Poincaré Ball)**: Grasp why distance in hyperbolic space represents hierarchy differently than Euclidean distance to interpret feature compression. Quick check: In a Poincaré ball, how does distance between points change as they move toward the edge?

- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: Understanding matrix decomposition is critical for implementing fine-tuning and adjusting the rank hyperparameter. Quick check: In LoRA, which set of weights is updated during backpropagation: frozen pre-trained weights or injected low-rank matrices?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (Review + Sentence) -> Mamba Encoder (SSM + HiPPO) -> Embeddings (H_r, H_s) -> Concatenation -> Spectral Clustering -> Poincaré Distance calculation (F_rs) -> BatchNorm1d -> Linear Layer -> Binary Prediction -> BART (Paraphrasing selected sentences)

- **Critical path**: The interaction between Mamba Encoder and Poincaré Compression. If Mamba embeddings don't capture sufficient hierarchy, Poincaré distance features will be noisy, and the linear classifier will fail.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Extractive vs. Abstractive R1 trade-off shows the model prioritizes semantic alignment (paraphrasing) over exact token matching. Efficiency vs. Complexity: Mamba offers faster inference than Transformers, but Spectral Clustering and BART paraphrasing add computational overhead.

- **Failure signatures**: High Loss/Random Guessing suggests checking Poincaré distance calculations for numerical instability; Overfitting shows as Training loss ↓, Val loss ↑, requiring verification of LoRA activation; Incoherent Final Summary indicates checking BART input quality from extractive classifier.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Ablation (Compression): Run Mamba + Linear Classifier without Poincaré compression to establish baseline contribution. 2) Ablation (Encoder): Swap Mamba for BERT to verify State Space Model contribution over standard attention. 3) LoRA Rank Sweep: Test different LoRA ranks to find sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can Mixture of Experts (MoE) models enhance training efficiency and ROUGE scores for this architecture without compromising inference speed? The paper plans to experiment with MoE models to improve ROUGE scores while maintaining training efficiency.

- **Open Question 2**: Does the Mamba-based SSM provide significant computational or performance advantages over Transformers when processing sequences longer than 128 tokens tested? The experiments used max sequence length of 128, not validating the theoretical advantage of SSMs for long sequences.

- **Open Question 3**: Does Poincaré compression specifically capture hierarchical semantic information better than standard Euclidean clustering methods? The ablation study only tests presence/absence of compression, not comparing Poincaré vs. Euclidean geometry specifically.

## Limitations
- Novelty validation gap exists as the corpus provides no direct validation of hyperbolic geometry for this task, resting on theoretical advantages rather than empirical comparison against alternatives
- Results may not generalize beyond extreme low-resource scenarios (136 samples) to moderately low-resource settings where full fine-tuning could become viable
- Complex hybrid architecture makes debugging difficult as failure at any stage propagates without intermediate component analysis

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Mamba's linear-time inference provides computational advantages over Transformers for long sequences, and LoRA effectively prevents overfitting in extreme low-resource settings
- **Medium confidence**: Poincaré compression meaningfully improves feature quality for the binary classifier, though no comparison against simpler alternatives establishes hyperbolic geometry as specifically responsible
- **Low confidence**: The specific hierarchical structure assumption for Amazon reviews, as the paper asserts hierarchical relationships suitable for Poincaré representation without validation through qualitative analysis

## Next Checks
1. **Geometric baseline comparison**: Implement and compare Poincaré compression against Euclidean spectral clustering and simple concatenation to isolate the contribution of hyperbolic geometry versus clustering as a feature engineering technique.

2. **Resource regime sweep**: Replicate experiments with increasing training data sizes (100, 500, 1000 samples) to identify the transition point where LoRA's parameter efficiency becomes limiting versus full fine-tuning's capacity advantage.

3. **Intermediate component analysis**: Instrument the pipeline to log Poincaré distance distributions, Mamba attention patterns, and BART input quality to identify which component most influences final summary coherence.
