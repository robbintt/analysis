# Uncertainty Quantification in SVM prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.15429
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15429
- Authors: Pritam Anand
- Reference count: 9
- One-line primary result: Sparse Support Vector Quantile Regression (SSVQR) achieves up to 69% feature reduction and 53% faster training while maintaining or improving Prediction Interval quality

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the lack of sparsity in existing SVM Prediction Interval (PI) models by introducing Sparse Support Vector Quantile Regression (SSVQR). The method constructs PIs and probabilistic forecasts by solving a pair of linear programs with L1-regularization, producing sparse solutions that reduce model complexity. The authors also develop a feature selection algorithm for PI estimation using SSVQR that effectively eliminates a significant number of features while improving PI quality in high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, they extend SVM models to Conformal Regression setting for obtaining more stable prediction sets with finite test set guarantees.

## Method Summary
The SSVQR method solves a linear programming problem with L1-regularization on the weight vector to obtain sparse quantile regression solutions. For each quantile pair (q, 1+q-α), the model solves two linear programs to estimate the lower and upper PI bounds. The method uses RBF kernels for non-linear forecasting and linear kernels for feature selection. Hyperparameters C and q are tuned via grid search, and the MATLAB 'linprog' solver is used for SSVQR while 'quadprog' is used for standard SVQR. Feature selection is performed by thresholding the absolute weights of the sparse solution vector, eliminating features below a small threshold ε.

## Key Results
- SSVQR achieves sparse solutions (15-70% sparsity) while maintaining global optimal properties, addressing the lack of sparsity in existing SVM PI models
- Feature selection algorithm reduces features by up to 99% on high-dimensional datasets while improving PI quality (PICP from 0.71 to 0.9375 on MADELON)
- Conformal Regression extension provides stable prediction sets with zero standard deviation in PICP/MPIW across runs, compared to neural network baselines
- Numerical results show up to 69% feature reduction and 53% improvement in training time for high-dimensional datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Replacing L2-norm regularization with L1-norm in Support Vector Quantile Regression (SVQR) yields sparse solution vectors, reducing model complexity. The SSVQR model minimizes the pinball loss with an L1-regularization term on the weight vector, forcing a significant portion of coefficients to shrink exactly to zero. This produces a sparse solution vector, meaning the final quantile estimate depends on a smaller subset of training points. Core assumption: The relationship between inputs and conditional quantiles can be accurately captured using a linear combination of kernel functions, and many training samples are redundant for defining the prediction interval boundaries.

### Mechanism 2
Feature selection for linear Prediction Intervals can be achieved by thresholding the sparse weight vector learned by SSVQR, improving coverage on high-dimensional data. Algorithm 3 first trains a linear SSVQR model to obtain the weight vector, then discards features with weights below a small threshold ε for both quantile models. This reduces dimensionality and can improve PI quality by eliminating noise. Core assumption: For linear PI estimation, the magnitude of a feature's weight in the quantile model is a direct measure of its relevance.

### Mechanism 3
Combining SVM-based quantile regression with Conformal Prediction yields finite-sample coverage guarantees with superior stability compared to neural network baselines. The Split Conformal Regression framework uses a trained SVQR model to compute nonconformity scores on a held-out calibration set, then adjusts the PI by a quantile of these scores. Stability arises because the underlying SVQR model has a unique, globally optimal solution for a given hyperparameter setting. Core assumption: The data points are exchangeable (i.i.d.) and the base SVQR model provides a reasonable ranking of prediction uncertainty.

## Foundational Learning

- **Quantile Regression and the Pinball Loss**: This is the core statistical loss function that SSVQR minimizes to estimate a specific quantile. For a target quantile q=0.05, if a prediction error u = y - f(x) = 10 (underestimation), the pinball loss ρ_q(u) = q * u = 0.5.
- **The Representer Theorem & Kernel Trick**: These allow the SSVQR model to find a linear solution in a high-dimensional feature space without computing coordinates in that space. According to the representer theorem, the final quantile function f(x) is expressed as a linear combination of kernel functions evaluated at training points.
- **Conformal Prediction**: It provides a mathematically rigorous wrapper to convert heuristic prediction intervals into intervals with guaranteed probability of containing the true value. In Split Conformal Regression, the separate calibration set I2 is used to compute nonconformity scores for adjusting the final prediction interval.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw features and targets -> Kernel Matrix Computation -> SSVQR LP Solver -> Sparse Coefficient Vector -> Quantile Prediction Function -> Feature Selector (Optional) -> Conformal Wrapper (Optional)
- Critical path: Data Preprocessing -> Kernel Matrix Computation -> SSVQR LP Solver -> Sparse Coefficient Vector -> Quantile Prediction Function
- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Sparsity vs. Fidelity**: Controlled by regularization parameter C. Lower C increases sparsity but risks underfitting. Higher C improves fit but reduces sparsity and may increase training time.
  - **Linear vs. Non-linear Kernels**: Linear kernel required for feature selection pipeline, RBF kernel provides greater flexibility for complex relationships but sacrifices direct feature importance.
  - **LP vs. QP Solvers**: SSVQR uses LP solver (linprog) which is more scalable for problems with many variables than QP solver (quadprog) used by standard SVQR.
- Failure signatures:
  - **No Sparsity (Sparsity ~0%)**: Regularization parameter C is likely too high. Action: Decrease C.
  - **Under-coverage (PICP < 1-α)**: Model may be underfitting or quantile is poorly chosen. Action: Increase C or tune quantile.
  - **Excessive Width (High MPIW)**: Often due to high data noise or suboptimal kernel parameters. Action: Tune RBF kernel parameter or regularization C.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Sparsity Validation**: On "AD 1" artificial dataset, train both SVQR and SSVQR to confirm SSVQR produces sparse solution vector (15-20% sparsity) while SVQR produces 0% sparsity.
  2. **Feature Selection Efficacy**: On "UCI-secom" dataset, apply Algorithm 3 and compare number of features dropped and change in PICP against results in Table 8.
  3. **Conformal Stability Test**: Implement full SVQR+CR pipeline on "Boston Housing" dataset, run 10 times with different random seeds, verify standard deviation of PICP/MPIW is zero.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the feature selection algorithm for Prediction Interval estimation be extended to handle non-linear dependencies? The current SSVQR-based feature selection algorithm operates under the assumption that PI bounds are linear functions of input features. Development of a non-linear SSVQR feature selection method that maintains PI quality on datasets where linear assumptions fail.

### Open Question 2
Can incremental or online SVM-based models be developed for probabilistic forecasting in dynamic data environments? Current batch SVM models are not well-suited for dynamic scenarios. An online SSVQR algorithm that updates PI estimates efficiently without full retraining while preserving calibration.

### Open Question 3
How can Uncertainty Quantification analysis be extended to SVM classification models? The current study focuses exclusively on regression and forecasting tasks. Derivation of conformal prediction sets or sparse probabilistic outputs for SVM classification tasks.

## Limitations
- Sensitivity to regularization parameter C requiring careful grid search tuning for each dataset
- Feature selection algorithm depends on unspecified threshold ε, potentially affecting reproducibility
- Linear-weight-based feature selection mechanism is limited to linear PI models and may not capture complex non-linear feature interactions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The sparsity mechanism (L1 regularization producing sparse solutions) is well-established through comparison with LASSO regression and validated empirically
- **Medium Confidence**: The feature selection algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated on high-dimensional datasets but lacks detailed sensitivity analysis for the threshold parameter
- **Medium Confidence**: The conformal regression extension provides stability guarantees, though exact split ratios for calibration sets are unspecified

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies on the feature selection threshold ε to determine its sensitivity and optimal range across different datasets
2. Test SSVQR on datasets with strong feature interactions to evaluate whether linear-weight-based selection incorrectly discards critical features
3. Compare computational efficiency of LP vs QP solvers across varying dataset sizes to validate the claimed 53% training time improvement
