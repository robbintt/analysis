# UiS-IAI@LiveRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Information Nugget-Based Generation of Responses

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.22210
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22210
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GINGER pipeline achieves strong performance using information nuggets for factual grounding, source attribution, and response completeness within 2-hour processing constraint

## Executive Summary
This paper presents GINGER, a modular retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that addresses key challenges in RAG systems: factual correctness, source attribution, and response completeness. The system operates on information nuggets—atomic units of relevant information—extracted from retrieved documents. The pipeline includes query rewriting with sub-question generation, passage retrieval and reranking, nugget detection and clustering, cluster ranking and summarization, and response fluency enhancement. Experiments on TREC RAG'24 and DataMorgana datasets show that combining original queries with a few diverse sub-query rewrites improves recall, while using more than 3 rewrites yields diminishing returns. The system achieves strong performance when using k=40 documents for reranking and m=10 documents for response generation, balancing quality and efficiency within a two-hour processing constraint for 500 queries.

## Method Summary
GINGER operates as a modular pipeline with five key stages: (1) Query rewriting using Falcon3-10B to generate intermediate answers and l=3 diverse sub-queries concatenated with the original query, (2) Two-stage retrieval and reranking using BM25 + e5-base-v2 embeddings combined via RRF, followed by MonoT5-base pointwise reranking (n=500) and DuoT5-base pairwise reranking (k=40), (3) Nugget detection where Falcon3-10B annotates key excerpts in top m=10 passages, (4) BERTopic clustering to group nuggets by facet, DuoT5 cluster ranking, and per-cluster summarization generating one sentence per cluster, and (5) Fluency enhancement with Falcon3-10B to rephrase the final response. The pipeline uses multiprocessing with concurrent queuing across 8-12 GPUs to meet the two-hour processing constraint for 500 queries.

## Key Results
- Combining original queries with 3 diverse sub-query rewrites improves recall without diminishing returns
- k=40 documents for reranking and m=10 documents for response generation provides optimal balance of quality and efficiency
- Information nugget approach inherently promotes factual grounding and facilitates source attribution
- Response completeness achieved within length constraints through cluster-based summarization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by breaking down the complex RAG task into modular components that each address specific challenges. Query rewriting with sub-questions improves retrieval recall by exploring different aspects of the information need. The two-stage reranking (pointwise then pairwise) effectively identifies the most relevant documents. Nugget detection extracts atomic units of information, preventing over-generation and hallucinations. BERTopic clustering groups related information by facet, enabling comprehensive coverage. Cluster ranking ensures the most important facets are prioritized. Per-cluster summarization maintains brevity while ensuring completeness. Finally, fluency enhancement produces natural-sounding responses without sacrificing factual accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Information Nuggets:** Atomic units of relevant information extracted from passages; needed to ensure factual grounding and prevent hallucinations; quick check: verify nuggets are concise and directly relevant to the query
- **RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion):** Combines multiple retrieval rankings by averaging reciprocal ranks; needed to leverage both sparse and dense retrieval strengths; quick check: ensure fused rankings improve over individual methods
- **BERTopic:** Topic modeling algorithm that clusters documents based on semantic similarity; needed to group related nuggets by facet for comprehensive coverage; quick check: validate clusters are coherent and non-overlapping
- **Pointwise vs. Pairwise Ranking:** Pointwise ranks documents individually, pairwise compares document pairs; needed for effective reranking at different scales (n=500 vs k=40); quick check: verify pairwise ranking improves top-k quality
- **Query Rewriting:** Generates multiple reformulated queries from one original; needed to improve recall by exploring different query formulations; quick check: ensure rewritten queries are diverse and relevant
- **Multiprocessing with Concurrent Queueing:** Distributes pipeline stages across multiple GPUs; needed to meet strict time constraints for large query volumes; quick check: monitor queue depths and GPU utilization

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Query Input -> Query Rewriting -> BM25 + Dense Retrieval -> RRF Fusion -> MonoT5 Reranking -> DuoT5 Reranking -> Nugget Detection -> BERTopic Clustering -> DuoT5 Cluster Ranking -> Per-Cluster Summarization -> Fluency Enhancement -> Final Response

**Critical Path:** Query rewriting → retrieval & reranking → nugget detection → clustering → summarization → fluency enhancement

**Design Tradeoffs:** The pipeline trades computational efficiency for quality by using two-stage reranking (pointwise then pairwise) and extracting nuggets for better factual grounding. The choice of k=40 for reranking balances the need for comprehensive document coverage against the O(k²) complexity of pairwise reranking.

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Exceeding time limits indicates bottleneck in pairwise reranking or API calls
- Poor recall suggests ineffective query rewriting or retrieval combination
- Low V_strict scores indicate issues with nugget detection, clustering, or summarization
- Factual errors suggest problems with nugget extraction or generation stages

**First Experiments:**
1. Test query rewriting with varying numbers of sub-queries (1, 3, 5, 7) to find optimal recall-quality tradeoff
2. Evaluate different k values for reranking (20, 40, 60) to balance quality against computational cost
3. Compare single-stage vs. two-stage reranking to quantify quality improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How can RAG response evaluation frameworks be improved to reliably assess open-ended queries when ground-truth annotations are derived from only a limited set of reference passages? The authors note that AutoNuggetizer relies on sparse ground-truth nuggets, leading to unfairly low scores for well-grounded responses.
2. Can query rewriting strategies be dynamically adapted based on query type (factoid vs. open-ended) to improve retrieval effectiveness across the full spectrum of information needs? The current uniform approach underperforms for open-ended queries where broader context is needed.
3. Does the observed saturation point of 3-4 query rewrites generalize across different corpora, retrieval models, and query distributions? The paper's findings are based on limited experiments and may not generalize.

## Limitations
- Key hyperparameters including RRF k parameter, BERTopic configuration, and Falcon API parameters are unspecified, hindering exact reproduction
- Response length limit is mentioned but not numerically specified
- Two-hour processing constraint may not be achievable with fewer GPUs or slower API services
- Evaluation framework limitations when ground-truth nuggets are sparse can lead to unfairly low scores

## Confidence
- **High:** Modular pipeline architecture, general effectiveness of information nugget approach
- **Medium:** Specific performance metrics and hyperparameter choices
- **Low:** Exact reproduction of system due to unspecified parameters and lack of detailed prompt engineering

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation study varying RRF k parameter and BERTopic clustering configuration to understand their impact on recall and response quality
2. Perform sensitivity analysis on number of sub-queries (l parameter) beyond reported 3 to test diminishing returns threshold
3. Implement timing benchmarks for each pipeline stage to verify two-hour constraint for 500 queries is consistently met, focusing on pairwise reranking bottleneck
