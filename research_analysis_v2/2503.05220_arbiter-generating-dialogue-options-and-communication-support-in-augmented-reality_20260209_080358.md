# ARbiter: Generating Dialogue Options and Communication Support in Augmented Reality

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.05220
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05220
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Position paper proposing AR+AI system for real-time dialogue options and conversational support using AR HMDs and LLMs

## Executive Summary
This position paper introduces ARbiter, a conceptual framework that integrates Large Language Models with augmented reality head-mounted displays to generate real-time dialogue options and conversational support during face-to-face interactions. Drawing inspiration from video game dialogue systems, ARbiter proposes displaying context-aware suggestions visible to some or all conversation participants. The system would leverage live conversation transcripts, social cues from AR sensors, and contextual information to produce dialogue suggestions, with UI placement adapted from gaming interfaces but optimized for real-world environments. While the paper outlines numerous potential applications including accessibility support, language learning, interview preparation, and debate mediation, it acknowledges significant challenges around LLM hallucinations, AI biases, security, and privacy that require careful consideration.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a conceptual pipeline for ARbiter that captures live audio through AR HMD microphones, transcribes conversations using automatic speech recognition, aggregates contextual information including social cues from sensors and participant metadata, and constructs prompts for LLMs to generate dialogue suggestions. These suggestions would be displayed as UI elements in the user's field of view, with placement dynamically adapted based on environmental factors and social considerations. The system would support configurable visibility settings allowing hints to be private to one user or shared among participants. No implementation details, specific prompt templates, or quantitative metrics are provided as this is a position paper outlining a vision for future research at the intersection of AR, AI, and human-computer interaction.

## Key Results
- Conceptual framework for AR-based conversational support system combining LLMs with HMDs
- Identification of key technical challenges: latency optimization, prompt engineering for constrained outputs, adaptive UI placement
- Recognition of important social and ethical considerations: privacy, consent, shared visibility implications
- Proposal of multiple application domains: accessibility, language learning, interview prep, debate mediation
- Acknowledgment of current limitations: LLM hallucinations, AI biases, data security concerns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Context-Aware Prompt Construction for Dialogue Generation
Providing LLMs with multimodal conversational context (transcripts + social cues + participant metadata) can yield situationally appropriate dialogue suggestions. The system wraps live speech-to-text transcripts, sensor-captured social cues, and contextual information into a structured prompt that requests suggestions oriented toward a user-specified conversational goal. Core assumption: LLMs can infer socially appropriate response options from partial, noisy real-world context. Break condition: If transcription latency or error rates exceed conversational timing thresholds.

### Mechanism 2: Video Game-Inspired UI Patterns Adapted for Real-World AR Placement
Dialogue-option UI patterns from video games can be adapted to AR environments to present conversational hints without severely disrupting natural social interaction. The system displays a finite set of suggested responses positioned in the user's field of view, with dynamic adaptation based on environmental factors and social norms. Core assumption: Users can quickly parse and select from AR-displayed options without breaking conversational flow. Break condition: If UI elements consistently obstruct gaze patterns or social cues.

### Mechanism 3: Visibility Configuration for Shared vs. Private Support
Configurable visibility of AR hints (private to one user vs. visible to all participants) enables different interaction paradigms, from individual assistance to group mediation. The system allows hints to be visible to subsets of participants, with shared visibility enabling the system to serve as a neutral party in debates or discussions. Core assumption: Shared visibility does not create social friction or gaming of the system. Break condition: If shared visibility causes distrust or performative behavior.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Real-time speech-to-text with speaker diarization
  - Why needed here: The system relies on accurate, low-latency transcription of multi-party conversations to generate contextually relevant suggestions
  - Quick check question: Can you identify available ASR APIs that support <500ms latency with speaker separation for 2–4 participants?

- **Concept**: Prompt engineering for constrained output generation
  - Why needed here: LLMs must generate a small set of actionable dialogue options rather than open-ended responses, requiring careful prompt design
  - Quick check question: How would you structure a prompt to constrain an LLM to output exactly 3 dialogue options with associated confidence scores?

- **Concept**: AR UI occlusion and social gaze norms
  - Why needed here: Poorly placed AR content can disrupt eye contact and nonverbal communication, violating social norms and degrading conversation quality
  - Quick check question: What regions of the visual field should be avoided when displaying AR content during face-to-face conversation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Microphone array → ASR engine → transcript stream; HMD sensors (camera, IMU) → social cue extractor (facial expression, gaze, body language); User profile / context database → Context aggregator → prompt constructor → LLM API → response parser → UI layout engine → AR renderer → HMD display

- **Critical path**: Audio capture → transcription → context aggregation → LLM inference → UI rendering. Latency at each stage compounds; end-to-end must remain sub-2–3 seconds to feel conversational.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Latency vs. context richness**: More sensor data improves suggestion quality but increases processing time
  - **Hint quantity vs. cognitive load**: More options provide flexibility but may overwhelm users; paper suggests game-inspired 2–4 options
  - **Private vs. shared visibility**: Shared visibility enables mediation but raises consent and social friction concerns

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Stale suggestions**: Hints arrive after conversation has moved on (latency breakdown)
  - **Context mismatch**: Suggestions reference incorrect speakers or topics (diarization or prompt construction failure)
  - **Social disruption**: UI elements consistently interfere with eye contact or partner visibility (placement algorithm failure)
  - **Hallucinated content**: Suggestions contain fabricated facts (LLM grounding failure)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Latency profiling**: Build a minimal pipeline (ASR → LLM → text output) and measure end-to-end latency across 50+ conversation turns. Identify bottlenecks.
  2. **Prompt iteration for constrained output**: Test multiple prompt formulations to reliably generate 3 ranked dialogue options with confidence scores. Evaluate output format consistency across 100+ samples.
  3. **Static UI placement pilot**: Display mock dialogue options at different screen positions during simulated conversations. Measure task completion time, perceived intrusiveness, and gaze disruption using a low-fidelity AR prototype or video overlay.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can the placement of AR dialogue hints be dynamically optimized to ensure readability without disrupting eye contact or violating social norms?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state that "positioning of UI elements may also disrupt the conversation, as it can interfere with eye contact," and describe this as a "continuous optimization problem" influenced by dynamic environments.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper is a position paper; no user studies or algorithmic solutions have been tested to balance these competing constraints in real-time.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Empirical data from user experiments comparing different adaptive UI placement algorithms on social comfort and task efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What mechanisms are required to manage privacy and consent when multiple participants are involved in a conversation processed by an AR assistant?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper lists "issues regarding consent, data collection, privacy, ethics... and even secure data transfer" as limitations that "need to be resolved."
- **Why unresolved**: Current systems often focus on single-user data; the social and legal implications of recording and analyzing group conversations in AR remain unaddressed.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Prototypes of secure, multi-party consent protocols and studies on user comfort levels regarding data sharing in this context.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: To what extent does reliance on real-time LLM-generated dialogue options impact users' long-term cognitive skills and conversational authenticity?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper highlights the risk that "Allowing AI systems to 'dictate' the conversations moves us towards dystopian scenarios" and cites concerns about the "erosion of cognitive skills."
- **Why unresolved**: As a conceptual proposal, the system has not been deployed, so longitudinal psychological or sociological impacts are currently theoretical.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Longitudinal studies assessing the critical thinking and social agency of users who regularly employ such assistance versus a control group.

## Limitations
- No empirical validation or quantitative results presented; this is purely a conceptual position paper
- Key technical challenges (latency, prompt engineering, UI placement) acknowledged but not solved
- Privacy and security concerns around continuous audio capture and sensor data processing remain unaddressed
- Social acceptability of AR-based conversational hints, particularly shared visibility configurations, is purely speculative

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The conceptual integration of AR and LLM technologies for conversational support is technically feasible based on existing capabilities in each domain
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed pipeline architecture (ASR → context aggregation → LLM → AR UI) represents a logical flow, though specific implementations remain undefined
- **Low confidence**: Claims about shared visibility configurations enabling effective mediation without social friction are highly speculative and lack supporting evidence

## Next Checks
1. **End-to-end latency validation**: Build a minimal functional prototype (ASR + LLM + text-only output) and measure pipeline latency across 100+ conversation turns with varying lengths and speaker counts. Establish whether sub-2-second performance is achievable with current technology stacks.

2. **Prompt engineering validation**: Systematically test multiple prompt formulations for generating constrained dialogue options (3-5 responses with confidence scores) using conversation transcripts from diverse domains. Evaluate output consistency, relevance, and format adherence across 200+ samples.

3. **Social acceptability pilot study**: Conduct a small-scale user study (n=15-20) with a low-fidelity AR prototype (video overlay on screen) to assess perceived intrusiveness, cognitive load, and social acceptability of different UI placement strategies during simulated conversations.
