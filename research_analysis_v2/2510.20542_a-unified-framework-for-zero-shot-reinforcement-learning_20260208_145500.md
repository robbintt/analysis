# A Unified Framework for Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20542
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20542
- Authors: Jacopo Di Ventura; Jan Felix Kleuker; Aske Plaat; Thomas Moerland
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Presents the first unified framework for zero-shot reinforcement learning, categorizing methods into direct and compositional representations with consistent notation and taxonomy.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first comprehensive framework for zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL), where agents must solve new tasks immediately at test time without further training. The authors establish a clear taxonomy that unifies existing approaches into two main families: direct representations that learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional representations that exploit the substructure of value functions through successor measures or features. By providing consistent notation and mathematical foundations, the framework enables direct comparison between methods and highlights their shared principles and key differences. The work also derives an extended error bound for successor-feature methods in the zero-shot setting, offering theoretical insights into the limitations and trade-offs of different approaches.

## Method Summary
The framework categorizes zero-shot RL methods into two primary families. Direct representations learn universal value functions $Q(s,a,z)$ conditioned on task embeddings $z$, where $z$ is derived from the reward function through an encoder. Compositional representations instead learn successor measures or features that predict future state occupancy, allowing value functions to be reconstructed as inner products with reward vectors at test time. The framework distinguishes between pseudo reward-free methods that sample practice rewards during training for fast inference, and reward-free methods that require test-time search. The mathematical foundations include Bellman-like equations for training these representations, with compositional methods relying on linear decompositions and direct methods using universal function approximation.

## Key Results
- Establishes the first unified taxonomy for zero-shot RL, categorizing methods into direct and compositional representations with consistent mathematical notation
- Introduces an extended error bound for successor-feature methods that explicitly accounts for linearization error in the zero-shot setting
- Provides clear design tradeoffs between inference speed and flexibility, showing how pseudo reward-free methods enable fast test-time inference while maintaining generalization
- Highlights the critical role of task distribution coverage and feature expressiveness in determining zero-shot generalization performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Factorized Value Inference via Successor Measures
Zero-shot generalization is facilitated by decoupling environment dynamics from reward signals, allowing a single learned dynamics representation to be recombined with novel rewards at test time. Methods learn a Successor Measure (SM) or Successor Features (SF), which predicts the discounted future occupancy of states. The value function $Q$ is then approximated as the inner product of this representation and the reward vector. At test time, when a new reward $r$ is revealed, the agent computes $Q$ via this composition rather than re-learning. The core assumption is that the value function can be linearly decomposed into features $\phi$ and weights $w$, or that the reward structure is captured by the measure. Break condition: if the reward function is non-linear and cannot be approximated by the learned features, or if the state space is vast and the measure approximation is poor.

### Mechanism 2: Latent Task Conditioning (Direct Representations)
Generalization can be achieved by learning a universal value function $Q(s,a,z)$ conditioned on a latent task embedding $z$, provided the encoder captures the "shape" of the reward landscape. An encoder $f: \mathcal{R} \to \mathcal{Z}$ compresses the reward function into a vector $z$. A "direct" network learns the mapping $(s,a,z) \to Q^*$. At test time, the novel reward is encoded to $z$ and fed into the network. The core assumption is that the distribution of test tasks $D_{test}$ is covered by the training distribution $D_{train}$, and the encoder preserves sufficient information to distinguish optimal behaviors. Break condition: if the task encoder maps distinct rewards to identical embeddings (identifiability issue), or if the training task distribution is too narrow.

### Mechanism 3: Computation Shifting via Pseudo Reward-Free Pre-training
Zero-shot inference speed is maximized by shifting the "search" for the optimal policy to the pre-training phase using self-supervised intrinsic rewards. Pseudo reward-free methods sample random "practice" rewards during training to learn a repertoire of policies or a universal representation. This front-loads the computational cost. At test time, they simply compute a task embedding $z$ and query the representation (a "forward pass") rather than running an optimization loop or planning tree. The core assumption is that the agent can simulate or sample from a wide enough distribution of rewards during pre-training to cover the geometric space of possible test tasks. Break condition: if the test-time task requires planning depth or logic that exceeds the statistical generalization of the pre-trained representation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) & The Value Function**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames zero-shot RL as a problem of generalizing the value function $Q^*$ across a family of MDPs (specifically, reward functions).
  - Quick check question: Can you define $Q^\pi(s,a)$ and explain why knowing it allows you to act optimally?

- **Concept: Successor Representations (SR)**
  - Why needed here: This is the theoretical backbone of "Compositional" methods. Understanding SR is necessary to grasp how agents predict future states to estimate value without knowing the reward yet.
  - Quick check question: How does the Successor Representation decouple the dynamics (transition function) from the reward?

- **Concept: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL)**
  - Why needed here: GCRL is treated in the paper as a specific, tractable subset of zero-shot RL (where the task is reaching a state). It serves as a conceptual bridge to broader task embeddings.
  - Quick check question: In GCRL, how is the "task" typically represented, and how does this differ from a general reward function?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Direct Architectures: Reward Sampler → **Task Encoder** ($f: r \to z$) → **Universal Q-Network** ($Q(s,a,z)$) → Policy
  - Compositional Architectures: Environment → **Feature Extractor** ($\phi$) → **Successor Feature Network** ($\psi(s,a)$) → Value Estimator ($\psi^\top w_r$)
  - FB Architectures: Environment → **Forward Network** ($F$) + **Backward Network** ($B$) → Task embedding $z = \mathbb{E}[B r]$

- **Critical path:** The definition of the **Feature Space** ($\phi$ for Compositional, $Z$ for Direct).
  - In Compositional methods, if $\phi$ does not capture the aspects of the state relevant to the test reward, the linear approximation fails (The "Curse of $\phi$", Section 5.1).
  - In Direct methods, if the latent space $Z$ is not smooth or expressive, the Q-function cannot interpolate to new tasks.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Inference Speed vs. Flexibility:** Pseudo reward-free methods (Direct, FB) offer fast inference (forward pass) but require training on reward distributions that cover test cases. Reward-free methods (GPI+SF) offer more flexibility but require expensive test-time search.
  - **Linearity:** Compositional methods (SF) generally assume linearity in reward features (Eq 15). Direct methods (FRE) can handle non-linear reward structures but may suffer from identifiability issues (Section 4.1).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Catastrophic forgetting / Interference:** In Universal Value Functions, learning new tasks corrupts the representations of old tasks.
  - **Linearization Error:** In SF methods, if the test reward $r$ cannot be written as $\phi^\top w$, the error bound (Theorem 5.3) grows linearly with the linearization error.
  - **Task Ambiguity:** In Direct methods, distinct rewards $r_1, r_2$ mapping to the same $z$ will result in identical, suboptimal policies.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate Linearization Bound:** Implement a simple SF agent. Systematically vary the complexity of the test reward $r$ relative to the features $\phi$ to verify the correlation between linearization error (Eq 26) and performance drop.
  2. **Compare Direct vs. Compositional Inference Latency:** Implement FRE (Direct) vs. FB (Compositional). Measure wall-clock time for inference on a batch of 1000 diverse tasks to confirm the "Fast Inference" claim for Direct methods (Figure 2).
  3. **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization:** Train a Direct agent on goal-reaching tasks (GCRL) and test on "path-following" or "object-collection" rewards. Compare this against an FB agent to see which representation better handles the semantic shift.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can a dedicated benchmark suite for zero-shot RL be designed to expose specific limitations, such as the inability of Forward-Backward (FB) methods to handle high-frequency rewards, that are obscured by current unsupervised or offline RL benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section states that "no dedicated benchmark suite currently exists" and suggests that "designing environments where rewards rely on these high-frequency components could directly test this limitation."
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation relies on benchmarks designed for other paradigms (e.g., D4RL, URLB), which may not effectively reveal the structural weaknesses of specific zero-shot representations.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development and adoption of a benchmark containing tasks with specific spectral properties (e.g., high-frequency rewards) that cause performance degradation in methods like FB while sparing others.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent can advances in representation learning improve direct zero-shot methods in defining objectives that efficiently span the space of downstream tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section identifies direct representations as "relatively underexplored" and posits that "advances from that [representation learning] community may offer crucial insights" into creating smooth, expressive latent spaces.
- Why unresolved: Direct methods require expressive task embeddings to generalize, but current approaches struggle to define an embedding space that is both expressive enough to capture rewards and smooth enough for generalization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Novel direct representation algorithms that leverage modern representation learning techniques to achieve superior generalization on diverse reward functions compared to compositional methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the representations learned in zero-shot RL be utilized to develop more sophisticated exploration strategies for the online setting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion notes that while most work focuses on the offline setting, "Moving to the online regime introduces the problem of exploration" and suggests "representations used for zero-shot RL can themselves guide exploration."
- Why unresolved: There is a lack of research on how to effectively couple the rich representations used for zero-shot transfer with active exploration policies during online training.
- What evidence would resolve it: An online zero-shot RL algorithm that leverages its learned representation (e.g., successor measures) to guide exploration, demonstrating improved sample efficiency over standard intrinsic motivation baselines.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Is the linearization error inherent to successor-feature methods a significant practical bottleneck compared to approximation and inference errors?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper derives an extended bound (Theorem 5.3) that includes a linearization error term, and the Discussion notes that recent work relaxing linearity showed only minor gains, raising the question of whether this error is a key limitation.
- Why unresolved: While the theoretical bound exists, the practical impact of linearization error relative to the cost of inference or representation approximation in complex environments remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: An empirical analysis comparing the magnitude of linearization error against inference error in non-linear reward settings, showing which factor primarily limits performance.

## Limitations

- The framework assumes that the training distribution $D_{train}$ adequately covers $D_{test}$, but doesn't provide methods to verify this coverage or quantify performance degradation when test tasks lie in low-density regions.
- The linearization error assumption in compositional methods is critical - the theoretical error bound grows linearly with approximation error, but the practical impact of this error in high-dimensional or complex environments remains unclear.
- Direct representations suffer from identifiability issues where distinct rewards may map to identical latent embeddings, causing catastrophic policy failure, but this problem is identified rather than resolved.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The taxonomy and notation unification framework itself. The mathematical definitions of direct vs compositional representations are rigorous and internally consistent. The distinction between pseudo reward-free and reward-free methods is well-founded.

**Medium Confidence:** The error bound derivation for successor-feature methods. The mathematical steps appear sound, but the practical implications depend heavily on the approximation quality of the successor features, which varies significantly across domains.

**Low Confidence:** The claim about universal applicability across all zero-shot RL scenarios. The framework is comprehensive but may not fully capture methods that combine compositional and direct approaches or those that use hierarchical task representations.

## Next Checks

1. **Error Bound Validation:** Implement the extended error bound formula (Theorem 5.3) and empirically verify the correlation between linearization error and performance drop across multiple environment complexities and reward structures.

2. **Distribution Coverage Analysis:** Systematically test agents on increasingly out-of-distribution tasks to quantify the degradation in performance and identify the boundary where the support condition fails.

3. **Latent Space Identifiability Test:** Design experiments where multiple distinct rewards are mapped to the same latent embedding in direct methods, and measure the resulting policy degradation to quantify the severity of the identifiability issue.
