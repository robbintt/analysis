## Executive Summary
Sci-Phi is the first large language model capable of comprehensive spatial audio scene understanding. It integrates a spatial encoder with a spectral encoder to describe up to four directional sound sources, background noise, and room acoustics from first-order Ambisonics input. The model generates structured metadata covering content, timing, direction, distance, loudness, and reverberation for all sources. Trained on over 4,000 hours of synthetic spatial audio, Sci-Phi generalizes well to real room impulse responses with only minor performance loss.

## Method Summary
Sci-Phi processes first-order Ambisonics (4-channel) audio through two complementary encoders: a spatial encoder based on SELDNet for directional features and a frozen monaural encoder for semantic understanding. The spatial encoder extracts 7-channel spatial features (4 mel spectrograms + 3 intensity vectors), while the frozen encoder provides pre-trained semantic representations. These are projected to text embedding space and combined with a Phi-4-Mini LLM augmented with LoRA adapters. The model outputs structured descriptions of up to four sound sources, background noise, and room acoustics in a fixed enumeration order based on decreasing loudness.

## Key Results
- Achieves 91.5% source counting accuracy on synthetic data and 75.2% on real RIRs
- Maintains high performance across 15 metrics for localization, timing, and acoustic attribute estimation
- Shows robust generalization from synthetic training to real room impulse responses
- Demonstrates resilience to varying SNR, reverberation, and source similarity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Complementary Spatial-Spectral Feature Factorization
Separating spatial features (4-channel mel + intensity vectors) from spectral features (mono mel) enables independent optimization of localization and semantic understanding. The spatial encoder (SELDNet-based, 3 conv + 2 GRU + 2 attention layers) processes direction/distance cues from inter-channel relationships, while the frozen monaural encoder (24 conformer blocks) retains strong pre-trained semantic capabilities. Two separate projectors align both to 3072-dim text embedding space. This separation allows each encoder to specialize without interference.

### Mechanism 2: Permutation-Invariant Source Enumeration via Loudness-Ordered Generation
Training the LLM to enumerate sources by decreasing loudness provides a stable canonical ordering that reduces search space during inference while matching evaluation protocol. The model learns an implicit loudness estimator (C50, level) to determine output order. This forces consistent source-to-slot assignment across training examples, avoiding the label assignment ambiguity problem in multi-source detection. Loudness ordering yields the best metric performance compared to other ordering strategies.

### Mechanism 3: Sim-to-Real Generalization via Distributional Coverage
Massive synthetic data diversity (10k rooms, 1.6M mixtures) creates a sufficiently broad acoustic prior that real RIRs fall within the interpolated distribution. Synthetic data spans 4×4×3m to 25×25×6m rooms, RT60 variation, 1-4 sources, 8 languages, and SNR variation. Real RIR performance drop is limited (91.5%→75.2% count accuracy) because test conditions are "seen" as combinations of training distribution extremes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: First-Order Ambisonics (FOA)**
  - Why needed here: Input format is 4-channel FOA (W, X, Y, Z). Understanding that W is omnidirectional and X/Y/Z encode 3D particle velocity/intensity is essential for interpreting the spatial feature extraction.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why intensity vectors from (X,Y,Z) relative to W encode direction information?

- **Concept: Permutation-Invariant Training/Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: Multi-source detection has no inherent source ordering. The paper uses both POS (optimal-source permutation) and POM (optimal-metric permutation) protocols to fairly evaluate without penalizing valid reorderings.
  - Quick check question: If ground truth is [(dog, left), (cat, right)] and prediction is [(cat, right), (dog, left)], should this be penalized? Why or why not?

- **Concept: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
  - Why needed here: The model adds a spatial LoRA (rank 320) to Phi-4-Mini while keeping audio LoRA frozen. Understanding LoRA is critical for efficient fine-tuning without modifying base LLM weights.
  - Quick check question: What does the rank parameter control in LoRA, and why might rank 320 be appropriate here?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** FOA 4-channel → [Mel spectrograms ×4] + [Intensity vectors ×3] = 7-map spatial features → Spatial encoder (SELDNet) → Spatial projector → Spatial LoRA → Phi-4-Mini → Token generation
- **Critical path:** FOA input → spatial encoder → spatial projector → spatial LoRA → token generation. This path handles the novel spatial reasoning; failures here cause counting/localization errors.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Freezing audio encoder preserves ASR quality but limits audio-spatial co-adaptation; 45° angular quantization reduces output vocabulary (26 zones) but limits precision; loudness ordering provides stable training but requires implicit loudness estimation.
- **Failure signatures:** Count accuracy degradation with more sources (99.8% at 1 source → 87.8% at 5 sources); distance/RT60 overfitting to synthetic RIRs (3× RT60 error increase on real data); source splitting when sound events contain pauses.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablate spatial vs. spectral encoder: Zero out each feature set independently. Expected: spatial removal → ~25% count accuracy; spectral removal → degraded ASR/CLAP but intact localization.
  2. Test enumeration ordering: Train separate models with loudness/distance/onset/name ordering. Expected: loudness best, name worst (per Table 3).
  3. Synthetic-to-real transfer curve: Train on subsets of synthetic data (10%, 50%, 100%) and evaluate on real RIRs. Expected: monotonic improvement but with diminishing returns on RT60/distance metrics.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does Sci-Phi perform on unconstrained, "in-the-wild" acoustic recordings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state the study has "not included systematic evaluation on in-the-wild recordings" largely due to the absence of reliable ground truth and label taxonomy mismatches.
- Why unresolved: The model’s generalization capability is currently demonstrated only on synthetic data and the controlled real-RIR FOA-MEIR dataset, leaving its robustness to diverse, uncontrolled real-world noise and environmental factors unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of Sci-Phi on a diverse dataset of unconstrained field recordings with verified ground truth.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can LLM-based audio descriptors efficiently model moving sound sources?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The limitations section notes the framework assumes stationary sources, stating that generating "per-timestep trajectories with an LLM would be computationally very expensive."
- Why unresolved: The current serialization of metadata represents sound events as static entities with fixed locations, lacking a mechanism to represent temporal movement without exorbitant token generation costs.
- What evidence would resolve it: An architectural extension (e.g., specialized trajectory tokens or sliding windows) that successfully tracks moving sources without losing inference efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does synthetic training data limit the accuracy of room acoustic parameter estimation (e.g., RT60, distance) in real environments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The results show that RT60 and distance estimation errors increase significantly on real RIRs compared to synthetic ones, which the authors suggest indicates "potential overfitting to synthetic RIRs."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the degradation is due to the inherent domain gap of the synthetic image-source model or limitations in the model's capacity to generalize acoustic cues from simulation to reality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing models trained on synthetic data versus those fine-tuned on real-world acoustic measurements to see if the error gap closes.

## Limitations

- Synthetic-to-real generalization gap for acoustic attributes (RT60 error increases 3.6×, distance error increases 2.9×)
- 45° angular quantization limits fine-grained localization precision
- Assumes stationary sources; moving sources require computationally expensive per-timestep trajectory generation
- Source splitting occurs when sound events contain pauses

## Confidence

- **Low** for real-world generalization: Significant degradation in acoustic attribute estimation (RT60 0.092s→0.333s, distance 0.78m→2.28m) suggests overfitting to synthetic RIR characteristics
- **Medium** for counting and localization accuracy: 91.5% count accuracy on synthetic, 75.2% on real RIRs, but 45° quantization limits precision and source splitting occurs
- **Medium** for frozen-encoder architecture: Separation enables efficient training but may limit performance when spatial and semantic features correlate strongly

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Environment Transfer Test**: Evaluate Sci-Phi on real-world recordings from diverse environments not represented in the synthetic corpus (outdoor spaces, vehicles, reverberant concert halls, anechoic chambers). Measure degradation in counting, localization, and acoustic attribute estimation compared to synthetic performance.

2. **Dynamic Source Scenario Test**: Create test scenarios with moving sources (simulating walking, approaching/receding) and evaluate temporal tracking accuracy. Current metrics assume static sources; dynamic scenarios would reveal whether the model can track changing spatial attributes over time.

3. **Fine-Grained Localization Benchmark**: Test the model with sub-45° angular resolution requirements using a synthetic corpus with 15° quantization and evaluate localization error in degrees. This would quantify the precision limitations of the current angular quantization.
