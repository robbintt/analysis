core_contribution: This work extends the Structural Causal Explanation (SCE) algorithm
  to handle temporal data by introducing a tree-based explanation structure that captures
  causal relationships over time. The Temporal SCE (T-SCE) formulation incorporates
  both retrospective (explaining past causes) and anticipative (predicting future
  effects) explanations, enabling richer causal reasoning in dynamic systems.

# Causal Explanations Over Time: Articulated Reasoning for Interactive Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.03915
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03915
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: Extends SCE to temporal data via tree-based explanation structures that capture causal relationships over time, supporting both retrospective and anticipative explanations in dynamic systems.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces Temporal Structural Causal Explanations (T-SCE), extending the original SCE algorithm to handle temporal data by constructing explanation trees that capture causal relationships over time. The framework supports both retrospective explanations (why did X happen?) and anticipative explanations (what will X cause?) by recursively traversing causal graphs in different directions. Applied to synthetic time series and a 2D grid game, T-SCE generates human-readable explanations that summarize consistent causal sequences and identify changing relationships, providing more structured and temporally coherent explanations compared to state-of-the-art causal explanation methods.

## Method Summary
T-SCE operates on structural causal models (SCMs) by recursively constructing explanation trees where each node encodes variable-name, time-step, and Explanation Rule indicators. The algorithm starts from a valid Why-Question and traverses the causal graph, attaching child nodes via Explanation Indicators that resolve ER1/ER2/ER3 rules. The recursion terminates at root variables or maximum depth K. T-SCE supports dual modes: retrospective (using causal parents) and anticipative (using causal children), with a post-hoc sequence indicator function that identifies consistent causal sequences across time steps. The method maintains backward compatibility with the original SCE framework while enabling richer temporal reasoning in dynamic systems.

## Key Results
- T-SCE generates structured explanation trees that capture temporal causal relationships through recursive traversal
- The dual-mode (retrospective/anticipative) approach enables both backward-looking and forward-looking explanations
- Sequence indicators identify consistent causal chains over time, enabling collapsed human-readable output
- Qualitative evaluation shows T-SCE provides more structured and temporally coherent explanations compared to LEWIS and Causal Shapley Values

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Recursive Explanation Tree Construction
The T-SCE algorithm generates structured explanations by recursively traversing causal graphs over time, producing a tree where each node encodes variable-name, time-step, and Explanation Rule indicators. Starting from a root node representing a valid Why-Question, the recursion iterates over causal parents (retrospective) or children (anticipative), attaching child nodes via Explanation Indicators that resolve ER1/ER2/ER3 rules. The recursion terminates at root variables or maximum depth K.

### Mechanism 2: Retrospective-Anticipative Dual Mode
T-SCE supports both backward-looking (why did X happen?) and forward-looking (what will X cause?) explanations by swapping the traversal direction over the causal graph. Definitions 4 and 5 define Φ1 differently—retrospective uses causal parents and filters by threshold θ or top-n; anticipative uses causal children. This yields explanations grounded in causes vs. effects.

### Mechanism 3: Sequence Indicator for Temporal Summarization
T-SCE can identify and summarize consistent causal sequences over time by detecting when Explanation Rule indicators remain stable across consecutive time steps for the same variable relationship. A post-hoc function iterates over endogenous variables in descending temporal order. If direct child nodes share identical ER encodings across time, a unique sequence ID is assigned, enabling collapsed human-readable output.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Structural Causal Models (SCMs)**
  - Why needed here: T-SCE operates on SCMs and requires understanding structural assignments Vi = fi(Pai, Ui) and induced causal graphs.
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish endogenous from exogenous variables and explain how structural equations define causal parents?

- **Concept: Explanation Rules (ER1, ER2, ER3)**
  - Why needed here: These rules encode "because" (ER1), "although" (ER2), and "mostly" (ER3) relationships based on effect sign (α) and value comparisons.
  - Quick check question: Given αX→Y = -0.5, x below average, y below average, which rule fires and what natural language fragment results?

- **Concept: Time-Series Causal Discovery**
  - Why needed here: T-SCE requires a causal graph as input; practitioners may need to induce graphs via Granger, VARLiNGAM, or Lasso on lagged variables.
  - Quick check question: Why does lagged variable construction (prefix "Lag_") enable causal discovery in time-series settings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Why-Question Validator -> Causal Scenario Builder -> Explanation Rule Evaluator -> Explanation Tree Constructor -> Sequence Indicator -> Pronunciation Module

- **Critical path:**
  Why-Question → Causal Scenario → ER Evaluation → Tree Recursion (retrospective or anticipative) → Sequence Detection → Natural Language Output

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Tree vs. Linked List: Trees enable one-sentence-per-variable explanations and sequence summarization; tradeoff is increased memory for large SCMs.
  - Threshold θ vs. Top-n: Φ1 filtering reduces noise from weak edges but may exclude meaningful variables in dense graphs.
  - Retrospective-only vs. Dual-mode: Anticipative mode requires future data or assumptions; useful for agent behavior, less for real-time prediction.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Empty explanation tree: Causal graph missing edges for the queried variable.
  - Contradictory ER indicators over time: Non-stationary SCM or excessive noise.
  - Anticipative mode returns trivial effects: Future variables not causally connected; graph incomplete.
  - Sequence indicator produces fragmented IDs: ER indicators flip due to marginal value differences near thresholds.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce the Causal Hans time-series experiment (10,000 records, 50 time steps) with known SCM; verify explanation tree matches ground-truth causal paths and sequence IDs are correctly assigned.
  2. Ablation on Φ1 filtering: Compare full parent/child sets vs. θ-thresholded vs. top-n; measure explanation conciseness and coverage of true causes.
  3. Cross-method comparison: Run T-SCE, LEWIS, and Causal Shapley Values on the same classification dataset; qualitatively assess whether T-SCE yields more structured, temporally coherent explanations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can T-SCE be extended to handle non-linear causal relationships while preserving structured, human-readable explanations?
- Basis in paper: "T-SCE inherits some weaknesses of the SCE algorithm in terms of applicability to linear models... While T-SCE inherits the linearity assumption of SCE, this comes with the benefit of providing uniquely structured explanations."
- Why unresolved: The current formulation relies on linear structural equations and weighted causal graphs with signed coefficients.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified T-SCE formulation that operates on non-linear SCMs and generates coherent explanations on benchmark datasets with known non-linear causal structures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can T-SCE be adapted for non-stationary time series where the underlying causal structure changes over time?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes "causal time series models assume a stationary process, which means that the data generation process... do not change," but the dynamic Causal Hans example hints at scenarios where causal relationships could shift.
- Why unresolved: Current T-SCE assumes context-dependent SCMs based on discrete state variables, not gradual structural drift or regime changes in continuous time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of T-SCE on datasets with known structural breaks, with accuracy metrics on detecting and explaining causal relationship transitions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does T-SCE improve user understanding and trust compared to existing causal explanation methods in human-subject evaluations?
- Basis in paper: The paper provides algorithmic comparisons with LEWIS and Causal Shapley Values but no human evaluation. The motivation section emphasizes "how these factors influence users' trust in AI systems" and T-SCE is designed for "human-readable" explanations.
- Why unresolved: Readability and utility are ultimately subjective; algorithmic metrics do not establish whether users actually comprehend or trust explanations more.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled user studies measuring explanation comprehension, task performance, and trust ratings when participants receive T-SCE vs. baseline explanations for the same scenarios.

## Limitations
- T-SCE inherits the linearity assumption from SCE, limiting applicability to non-linear causal relationships
- The method assumes stationary causal processes, making it unsuitable for non-stationary time series without modification
- Evaluation relies on qualitative comparisons rather than quantitative metrics or human subject studies
- Implementation details for critical components like EI function and sequence indicators remain underspecified

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1** (recursive tree construction): High confidence - precisely defined with explicit formulas
- **Mechanism 2** (dual-mode traversal): High confidence - clearly formalized with Definitions 4-5
- **Mechanism 3** (sequence indicators): Medium confidence - limited algorithmic detail on detection implementation

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test the sequence indicator function on synthetic data to verify it correctly identifies and summarizes consistent causal chains across time steps.
2. Conduct ablation studies on Φ1 filtering parameters (θ vs. top-n) to measure their impact on explanation quality and coverage of true causes.
3. Apply T-SCE to a new time-series dataset with known ground truth causal structure to quantitatively evaluate explanation accuracy against baselines.
