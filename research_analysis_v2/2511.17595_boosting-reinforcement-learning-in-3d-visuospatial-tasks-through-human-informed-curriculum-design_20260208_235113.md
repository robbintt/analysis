# Boosting Reinforcement Learning in 3D Visuospatial Tasks Through Human-Informed Curriculum Design

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17595
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17595
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Curriculum learning, especially when informed by human performance data, enables RL agents to solve complex 3D Same-Different visuospatial tasks that direct RL and imitation learning methods fail to master.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates reinforcement learning approaches for a complex 3D Same-Different visuospatial task inspired by human psychophysical experiments. The research systematically evaluates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), imitation learning (Behavioral Cloning and GAIL), and Curriculum Learning. While direct RL methods struggled across the problem space, curriculum learning proved effective, particularly when the lesson plan was informed by human performance data. The agent successfully solved environments with up to 48 viewpoints, achieving high accuracy and surpassing average human performance in simpler cases. The findings highlight the potential of structured learning approaches for tackling complex visuospatial tasks and suggest future integration of cognitive principles like attention and memory.

## Method Summary
The research employed a Unity ML-Agents environment simulating a 3D room where an agent must determine if two 3D objects are geometrically congruent. The agent used a Simple CNN policy network with PPO as the base learning algorithm. The study implemented curriculum learning with 13 lessons that progressed through increasing object complexity (Easy→Medium→Hard) and relative orientations. A human-informed curriculum sequence was developed based on human psychophysical data showing non-linear difficulty scaling. The agent operated in discrete viewpoint grids (6, 12, 24, 48, 72, or 96 cells) with sparse rewards (+1 for correct, -1 for incorrect, -0.01 for looking away). Training ran for up to 10^8 steps with early stopping after 5M episodes plateauing, using 12 random seeds for each experiment.

## Key Results
- Direct RL methods (PPO) and imitation learning (BC, GAIL) failed to learn optimal strategies across the full problem space, achieving only ~50% accuracy (random chance)
- Curriculum learning succeeded where direct methods failed, with the human-informed curriculum achieving 88.33% accuracy in the 48-viewpoint environment
- The agent exploited simultaneous viewpoints where both objects were visible, allowing direct comparison without memory requirements, achieving high accuracy that surpassed average human performance in simpler cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Progressive Complexity Scaling
Structuring the learning task as a curriculum of increasing complexity enables effective policy acquisition in sparse-reward 3D visuospatial environments where direct methods fail. The agent masters simpler subtasks first, establishing baseline policies that bootstrap performance on incrementally harder variants. This traverses a more favorable loss landscape by avoiding local minima that exist in complex visuospatial tasks.

### Mechanism 2: Human Performance-Informed Sequencing
Leveraging empirical human psychophysical data to inform the curriculum sequence improves learning efficiency and final agent performance compared to intuitively designed curricula. Human data reveals non-linear difficulty scaling (e.g., for medium/hard objects, 90° is easier than 0°, which is easier than 180°), allowing the agent to encounter challenges in a sequence more aligned with the inherent structure of the task's difficulty.

### Mechanism 3: Simultaneous Viewpoint Exploitation Strategy
The RL agent, when successfully trained via curriculum learning, converges on an exploitative policy that prioritizes a small set of "information-rich" viewpoints allowing simultaneous observation of both target objects. This bypasses the need for complex memory or sequential reasoning, as the visual input contains discriminative features of both objects at once.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Curriculum Learning in Reinforcement Learning**
  - Why needed: This is the core successful intervention. Without understanding the principle of training on progressively harder subtasks, one cannot grasp why PPO failed and the curriculum approach succeeded.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why training an agent on a "hard" task from scratch might fail, and how a curriculum addresses this?

- **Concept: Sparse Reward Signals**
  - Why needed: The paper uses a sparse reward (+1/-1 at the end of a trial). This is central to the problem's difficulty, as it provides no intermediate guidance for the agent's exploration.
  - Quick check: How does a sparse reward function make the credit assignment problem more difficult for an RL agent?

- **Concept: Action Space Discretization**
  - Why needed: The study explicitly compares continuous and discrete action spaces. The success of the curriculum learning approach was contingent on using discrete viewpoint grids.
  - Quick check: What is the primary tradeoff an engineer makes when choosing to discretize a continuous action space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Unity Environment -> Discrete Action Space (viewpoint grid) -> PPO Agent with Simple CNN Policy -> Curriculum Manager
- **Critical path**:
  1. Define the discrete action space grid (e.g., 12 viewpoints) within the Unity environment
  2. Implement the curriculum lesson plan (sequence of {difficulty, RO} pairs), either naïve or human-informed
  3. Configure the PPO agent with the specified CNN policy network and hyperparameters
  4. Begin training, where the agent interacts with the environment, starting from Lesson 1
  5. The curriculum manager advances the lesson when a performance threshold is met or after a fixed number of steps
  6. Monitor for "catastrophic forgetting" (sudden reward drop) and early stopping if it occurs

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Naïve vs. Human-Informed Curriculum: An intuitive difficulty order is simpler to design but may be suboptimal. A human-data-informed order may yield better performance but requires costly data collection.
  - Discrete vs. Continuous Action Space: Discrete action spaces make the problem tractable for PPO in this setting but simplify the task and may encourage exploitative strategies. Continuous spaces are more realistic but resulted in learning failure.
  - Viewpoint Number vs. Learnability: Increasing the number of discrete viewpoints increases the action space size. Environments with >48 viewpoints were not learned successfully even with curriculum learning.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - No Learning / Random Policy: Accuracy plateaus around 50% (random chance) for millions of steps
  - Stagnant Reward in Imitation Learning: BC and GAIL reward curves remain flat (near 0.0) without any upward trend
  - Catastrophic Forgetting: During curriculum learning, the cumulative reward suddenly drops to near zero after progressing to more difficult lessons

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline PPO: Train a PPO agent from scratch on the full problem space in the simplest discrete environment (6 viewpoints). Verify that it achieves ~94% accuracy as a sanity check.
  2. Naïve Curriculum: Implement the 13-lesson naïve curriculum in the 12-viewpoint environment. Train the agent and log the cumulative reward and lesson progression.
  3. Ablate Curriculum Order: Train two agents in the 24 or 48 viewpoint environment: one with the naïve curriculum and one with the human-informed curriculum. Compare their final accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can integrating memory or history-based state representations enable RL agents to adopt human-like sequential observation strategies? The current agent avoids memory demands by finding viewpoints where both objects are visible simultaneously, whereas humans use memory to verify features sequentially.

- What architectural modifications allow curriculum learning to succeed in discrete environments with more than 48 viewpoints? The complexity of the 72 and 96-cell action spaces prevented the current curriculum approach from finding a solution.

- Does incorporating cognitive principles like attention or explicit planning improve agent robustness in complex visuospatial tasks? The current agent relies on repetitive fixation on a few key locations rather than the diverse, planned exploration observed in humans.

## Limitations

- The approach strongly depends on discrete action spaces, as continuous control failed to learn effective policies, limiting real-world applicability
- The curriculum approach shows scalability limits, with success plateauing at 48 viewpoints, suggesting fundamental exploration challenges remain unresolved
- The exact geometry of the TEOS objects and precise CNN architecture details are unspecified, creating reproducibility barriers

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The claim that curriculum learning outperforms direct RL and imitation learning methods for this specific task
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that human-informed curriculum sequencing improves learning efficiency
- **Low Confidence**: The mechanism that the agent exploits simultaneous viewpoints to bypass memory requirements

## Next Checks

1. Test the learned policies in a modified environment where simultaneous viewpoints are prevented to verify whether the agent can adapt to require sequential processing and memory
2. Implement the curriculum learning approach with continuous action spaces using advanced exploration techniques to determine if the discrete-action dependency is fundamental or circumstantial
3. Conduct ablation studies varying the lesson transition criteria to quantify the impact of curriculum management strategy on learning efficiency and final performance
