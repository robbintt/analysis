- 16-channel LiDAR on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, >99% fewer parameters than deep learning baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vulnerability of LiDAR-based semantic segmentation systems to adversarial attacks, which can severely degrade the performance of autonomous vehicle perception. While existing defenses typically target 3D point clouds and rely on computationally intensive generative models, many state-of-the-art LiDAR segmentation pipelines operate on efficient 2D range-view representations. The paper proposes an efficient model-based purification framework tailored for adversarial defense in this domain. It introduces a direct attack formulation in the 2D range-view domain and develops an explainable purification network based on a mathematically justified optimization problem. The framework achieves strong adversarial resilience with minimal computational overhead. On standard benchmarks, the proposed method consistently outperforms generative and adversarial training baselines. Notably, the method is successfully deployed on a demo vehicle equipped with an NVIDIA Jetson Orin and a 16-channel LiDAR sensor, demonstrating accurate operation in practical autonomous driving scenarios with over 99% fewer parameters than conventional deep learning defenses.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a model-based purification framework for defending LiDAR semantic segmentation against adversarial attacks. It introduces a direct 2D range-view adversarial attack using projected gradient descent with ℓ2-norm constraints, which is shown to be more effective than 3D attacks projected to 2D. The core defense is a Deep Unrolled Adversarial Purification (DU-AP) network that solves a constrained optimization problem using Half Quadratic Splitting (HQS). The network unrolls K=5 iterations of alternating data consistency updates and denoising steps, where the denoiser is a small CNN with 64 filters per layer. The framework is specifically designed for range-view representations, incorporating horizontal gradient regularization to exploit the spatial structure of LiDAR data. The method is evaluated on SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS benchmarks and deployed on a real autonomous vehicle platform.

## Key Results
- DU-AP consistently outperforms generative and adversarial training baselines on standard benchmarks
- Strong adversarial resilience with minimal computational overhead
- Successful deployment on demo vehicle with NVIDIA Jetson Orin and 16-channel LiDAR
- Over 99% fewer parameters than conventional deep learning defenses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Direct 2D range-view adversarial attacks cause greater segmentation degradation than 3D attacks projected to 2D.
- **Mechanism:** Perturbations applied directly in the range-view domain align with the input format of range-view networks, bypassing quantization artifacts and geometric distortions introduced during 3D-to-2D projection. PGD optimizes perturbations pixel-wise with bounded ℓ2-norm constraints.
- **Core assumption:** The segmentation network's vulnerability is more effectively exploited when perturbations match the native input representation without intermediate transformations.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We propose a direct attack formulation in the range-view domain."
  - [Table I] Shows 2D attack causes 30.9% IoU drop vs. 15.9% for 3D attack projected to 2D.
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers focus on audio/image domains, not LiDAR range-view attacks.
- **Break condition:** If projection artifacts from 3D→2D were negligible or quantization preserved adversarial structure, the 2D-specific attack advantage would diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Purification framed as constrained optimization with deep unrolling yields interpretable, parameter-efficient defense.
- **Mechanism:** The HQS method splits the denoising objective into alternating subproblems: (1) data consistency update using gradient descent with horizontal gradient regularization, and (2) a learnable denoiser proximal operator. Unrolling K=5 iterations creates a 5-layer network where each layer corresponds to one optimization step.
- **Core assumption:** The optimization landscape of range-image denoising is sufficiently smooth that few unrolled iterations can approximate a good solution.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "explainable purification network based on a mathematically justified optimization problem"
  - [Section III-B] Equations 6–10 define the HQS formulation and iterative solutions.
  - [corpus] Graph Defense Diffusion Model uses diffusion-based purification, but differs in approach; no direct comparison to unrolling available.
- **Break condition:** If adversarial perturbations required many more iterations or non-convex optimization traps dominated, the shallow unrolled network would underperform.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Horizontal gradient regularization exploits range-view spatial structure for smoother recovery.
- **Mechanism:** Adjacent rows in range images correspond to neighboring LiDAR sensor channels, which typically measure similar distances. The term ‖∇hYr‖²F penalizes large horizontal differences, implemented via a learnable 1D circular convolution (P2) that approximates ∇ᵀh∇h.
- **Core assumption:** Real range images exhibit horizontal smoothness that adversarial perturbations disrupt.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section III-B] "introduces a handcrafted regularizer based on the horizontal gradient, which encourages adjacent pixels—corresponding to neighboring sensor channels—to exhibit similar values."
  - [Equation 9] Shows P2 convolution integrated into the update rule.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for LiDAR range-view gradient priors.
- **Break condition:** If scenes contained frequent depth discontinuities across horizontal neighbors (e.g., dense vertical structures), the smoothness prior could over-regularize and blur legitimate edges.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Range-View Projection**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how 3D point clouds map to 2D range images (C channels × M horizontal resolution) is essential to grasp why 3D attacks degrade during projection and how 2D-specific defenses operate.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a LiDAR point at (x, y, z), how would you compute its row index in a 64-channel range image?

- **Concept: Half Quadratic Splitting (HQS)**
  - **Why needed here:** The purification network architecture is derived from HQS optimization; understanding variable splitting and alternating minimization clarifies why the network has separate data consistency and denoising modules.
  - **Quick check question:** In HQS, what role does the penalty parameter b play, and what happens if b → ∞?

- **Concept: Deep Unrolling**
  - **Why needed here:** The DU-AP network is not an arbitrary CNN—it's a fixed-iteration unrolled solver. Understanding this connection explains the "explainability" claim and parameter efficiency.
  - **Quick check question:** If you unroll an iterative solver for K=5 iterations, what happens to the network's behavior if you increase K to 10 at inference time without retraining?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input → DU-AP (5 layers of denoiser + data consistency) → LENet (4M params) → segmentation output
- **Critical path:** Input adversarial range image Yn → DU-AP (5 iterations of denoiser Gθ + data consistency update) → purified range image Yr → LENet → segmentation output. Latency dominated by 5 CNN passes through Gθ.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - K=5 balances depth vs. inference speed; fewer layers reduce recovery quality, more layers increase latency.
  - 64-filter denoiser keeps params low but may limit capacity for complex perturbations.
  - Horizontal-only regularization ignores vertical structure; bidirectional gradient could improve edge preservation but increase compute.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Blurred edges: May indicate excessive horizontal regularization (μ too high)
  - Residual artifacts: If Gθ capacity insufficient for high-ϵ attacks (ϵ≥9), recovery degrades
  - Domain shift: Adversarial retraining baselines fail out-of-distribution; DU-AP generalizes better but may still struggle with unseen LiDAR sensor configurations
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation on K: Run DU-AP with K∈{1,3,5,7} on SemanticPOSS under ϵ=6 attack; plot IoU recovery vs. latency
  2. Perturbation strength sweep: Test ϵ∈{1,3,6,9} on both SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS; compare DU-AP vs. ATOP vs. adversarial retraining
  3. Real-world deployment sanity check: Deploy on embedded hardware (Jetson Orin) with 16-channel LiDAR; measure fps and IoU under clean vs. ϵ=2 adversarial input to verify minimal overhead claim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but raises several implicit considerations:
- Whether the framework maintains robustness against adaptive white-box attacks where the adversary has full knowledge of the purification module's parameters and structure
- How purification performance degrades when subjected to structural attacks such as point removal or injection, rather than additive perturbations
- Whether reported real-world robustness translates to true semantic accuracy when verified against human-annotated ground truth instead of network-generated pseudo-labels

## Limitations
- Exact PGD hyperparameters (step size, iterations) for the 2D range-view attack remain unspecified, creating potential reproducibility gaps
- Training details for DU-AP are incomplete, including whether η, b, μ are learned vs. fixed, optimizer settings, and training schedule
- Horizontal gradient regularization may over-smooth scenes with frequent depth discontinuities across LiDAR channels, though this scenario is not explicitly evaluated

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Core methodology (HQS-based unrolling for adversarial purification) is well-established in optimization literature
- **Medium confidence:** Effectiveness of direct 2D range-view attacks vs. 3D-to-2D projection attacks is demonstrated but could benefit from broader ablation
- **Medium confidence:** Real-world deployment results are promising but rely on model-generated pseudo-ground truth rather than human annotation

## Next Checks
1. Verify PGD attack implementation matches reported results by reproducing Table I on SemanticPOSS with ε=9
2. Confirm DU-AP training procedure by training with assumed hyperparameters and checking IoU recovery on SemanticKITTI validation
3. Deploy DU-AP on Jetson Orin with 16-channel LiDAR and measure fps and IoU under clean vs. ε=2 adversarial input to validate real-world claims
