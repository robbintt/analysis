- Primary result: End-to-end platform for generating domain-specific QA datasets, fine-tuning LLMs, and comparing model performance

## Executive Summary
QGen Studio is a web-based platform that enables users to create high-quality, domain-specific question-answer datasets from uploaded documents, fine-tune large language models on this synthetic data, and compare model performance. The system addresses the challenge of limited domain-specific training data by providing an interactive interface for generating QA pairs using various LLM providers (OpenAI, IBM watsonx, HuggingFace) with customizable few-shot prompts. A key feature is the dataset viewer, which provides quality metrics (Bleu, Rouge, Meteor, TFIDF, cosine similarity) and context visualization to ensure data quality. The platform streamlines the development of specialized QA systems through its integrated approach to synthetic data generation, model training via LoRA, and performance evaluation.

## Method Summary
QGen Studio implements a six-step pipeline for domain-specific QA development: (1) document upload and parsing via Docling into structured chunks with unique IDs, (2) optional creation of example QA pairs for few-shot prompting, (3) generation of QA pairs using LLM APIs with quality metrics computed for each pair, (4) interactive dataset visualization with filtering and context highlighting, (5) fine-tuning of LLMs using MLX and LoRA (Apple Silicon only), and (6) side-by-side model comparison in the Model Explorer. The platform supports both zero-shot and few-shot generation modes, with users able to control chunk size, quality thresholds, and fine-tuning parameters. While the core pipeline is implemented, the platform is noted to be open-sourced soon, and training is currently limited to Apple Silicon hardware.

## Key Results
- Platform enables domain experts to generate tailored QA datasets from uploaded documents using customizable few-shot prompts
- Quality metrics (Bleu, Rouge, Meteor, TFIDF, cosine similarity) are computed between generated QA pairs and source context for data filtering
- Integrated LoRA fine-tuning via MLX allows efficient model adaptation on synthetic data with side-by-side performance comparison

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Context-grounded QA generation with metric-based filtering may improve dataset relevance for domain-specific applications.
- Mechanism: Documents are chunked and processed via Docling, then LLMs generate QA pairs from each chunk. Quality metrics (Bleu, Rouge, Meteor, TFIDF, cosine similarity) are computed between generated QA pairs and their source context, enabling users to filter low-quality pairs.
- Core assumption: Assumption: Higher metric scores between QA pairs and source context correlate with better training data quality for downstream fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "dataset viewer provides key metrics and visualizes the context from which the QA pairs are generated, offering insights into data quality"
  - [section] "Available metrics include computational metrics such as Bleu, Rouge, and Meteor, as well as TFIDF and cosine similarity scores, all calculated between the generated QA pairs and their source context"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence validates that these metrics predict fine-tuning success; related work (Nema and Khapra 2018) cited in paper notes "lack of standardized evaluation metrics"
- Break condition: If generated QA pairs score highly on n-gram overlap metrics but contain factual errors or hallucinations not present in source context, filtering by these metrics may not improve downstream model performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: User-controlled few-shot prompting with source document visibility enables more domain-aligned QA generation.
- Mechanism: Users can inspect documents, create custom QA examples via the Example Prompts interface, and inject these as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The interface displays source text alongside prompt configuration, giving users iterative control.
- Core assumption: Assumption: Domain experts can articulate their desired QA patterns through examples, and LLMs will generalize these patterns appropriately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "interactive interface that allows users to input example prompts while viewing the source text, giving them more control over the QA generation process"
  - [section] "These pairs can be used as examples within few-shot prompts to guide dataset generation, providing more control over the type of QA pairs generated"
  - [corpus] Related systems (Patel, Raffel, and Callison-Burch 2024; Yu, Lu, and Yu 2024) are cited as "limit[ing] user control over the generation process"—QGen positions itself as addressing this gap
- Break condition: If the domain is so specialized that users cannot easily create representative examples, or if the LLM fails to generalize from few examples, the mechanism provides limited benefit.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning on synthetically generated QA data using LoRA enables domain adaptation without full model retraining.
- Mechanism: Generated QA datasets are formatted and used to fine-tune LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) through Apple's MLX framework. Users can configure learning rate, iterations, LoRA layers, and data splits. The Model Explorer then enables side-by-side comparison of base vs. fine-tuned models.
- Core assumption: Assumption: Synthetic QA data generated from domain documents transfers to improved performance on domain-specific queries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "fine-tune models on this synthetic data"
  - [section] "This process utilizes MLX to fine-tune an LLM with low-rank adaptation (LoRA)... This setup allows users to utilize one model for generation and a different model for training"
  - [corpus] Gudibande et al. 2023 (cited in paper) warns that synthetic data quality can vary and "complicat[e] their alignment for specialized tasks"
- Break condition: If synthetic data contains systematic biases, hallucinations, or distribution shifts from real user queries, fine-tuning may degrade rather than improve domain performance (a known risk from related work).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**
  - Why needed here: Required to understand the model training component—LoRA freezes pretrained weights and injects trainable low-rank matrices, enabling efficient fine-tuning without updating all parameters.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why LoRA reduces memory requirements compared to full fine-tuning, and what "LoRA layers" means in this context?

- **Concept: N-gram overlap metrics (Bleu, Rouge, Meteor)**
  - Why needed here: The platform uses these metrics to rank and filter generated QA pairs; understanding their limitations helps interpret quality scores.
  - Quick check question: What specific limitation do n-gram metrics have when evaluating semantic correctness of generated questions?

- **Concept: Few-shot prompting**
  - Why needed here: The Example Prompts feature relies on providing QA examples to guide generation; users must understand how example selection influences output distribution.
  - Quick check question: If your few-shot examples are all factoid-style questions, what bias might you expect in generated QA pairs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Document Upload → Docling parser → chunked text with unique IDs
  - Example Prompts → stored QA examples for few-shot prompting
  - Dataset Generation → LLM API calls (OpenAI/watsonx/HuggingFace) → QA pairs + metric scores
  - Dataset Viewer → interactive filtering, sorting, context highlighting
  - Model Training → MLX + LoRA fine-tuning (Apple Silicon only)
  - Model Explorer → side-by-side inference comparison

- **Critical path:** Document upload → Example prompt creation (optional but recommended) → Dataset generation with metric configuration → Quality review in Dataset Viewer → Model training with LoRA → Evaluation in Model Explorer. The paper notes training is "currently limited to Apple Silicon users, but others can download the generated datasets and train models independently."

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Multi-provider LLM support (OpenAI, watsonx, HuggingFace) vs. increased integration complexity
  - Metric-based quality filtering vs. potential over-reliance on imperfect proxies
  - Apple Silicon optimization (MLX) vs. hardware portability limitations
  - Local deployment capability (planned open-source) vs. cloud API dependencies for generation

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low metric scores across all generated pairs → likely chunking too small/large, or source documents lack coherent QA-relevant content
  - Fine-tuned model performs worse than base model → synthetic data may contain noise or distribution shift; check for hallucinated answers in training set
  - Side-by-side comparison shows similar outputs → insufficient training iterations, learning rate too low, or LoRA not targeting relevant layers

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Upload a small domain-specific document (5-10 pages), generate QA pairs with both zero-shot and few-shot configurations, compare metric distributions to validate that few-shot improves relevance scores.
  2. Create a held-out test set of 10-20 manually written QA pairs from the same documents; after fine-tuning, use Model Explorer to compare base vs. fine-tuned model performance on these held-out questions.
  3. Systematically vary one training parameter (e.g., learning rate: 1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3) while holding others constant; evaluate whether model answers become more domain-aligned or more divergent at each setting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How effectively can the platform implement multi-document querying to synthesize insights across diverse sources? (The current implementation generates QA pairs based on single documents without cross-source synthesis capabilities.)
- Does the inclusion of complex question types in synthetic data improve model performance compared to standard QA pairs? (The system focuses on standard QA generation; the utility of complex types is untested.)
- Do automated metrics like Bleu and Rouge effectively predict the utility of synthetic QA data for niche domain fine-tuning? (The platform uses these metrics for filtering, yet the field-wide challenge of lacking standardized evaluation metrics remains unresolved.)

## Limitations
- Platform's effectiveness is limited by synthetic data quality, which can contain hallucinations or distribution mismatches from real user queries
- Training component is restricted to Apple Silicon hardware, limiting accessibility
- No quantitative results showing downstream performance improvements from fine-tuning

## Confidence
- High confidence: The platform architecture is technically feasible and addresses a genuine need for domain-specific QA data generation
- Medium confidence: The mechanism of using quality metrics for filtering and few-shot prompting for control will improve dataset relevance in practice
- Low confidence: The claim that synthetic data fine-tuning will reliably improve domain performance without introducing biases or hallucinations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing base vs. fine-tuned models on held-out domain-specific questions, measuring accuracy and hallucination rates
2. Test the correlation between quality metric thresholds and actual QA pair correctness through human evaluation of filtered datasets
3. Validate the few-shot prompting mechanism by systematically varying example quality and quantity, measuring impact on generated QA relevance and diversity
