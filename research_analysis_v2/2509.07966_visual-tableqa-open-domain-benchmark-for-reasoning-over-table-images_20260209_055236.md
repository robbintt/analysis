# Visual-TableQA: Open-Domain Benchmark for Reasoning over Table Images

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.07966
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07966
- **Reference count:** 20
- **Primary result:** Introduces a fully automated pipeline for generating LaTeX-rendered table images and reasoning-intensive QA pairs, producing 2.5k tables and 6k QA pairs at under $100.

## Executive Summary
Visual-TableQA addresses the lack of high-quality multimodal benchmarks for visual reasoning over complex tables by introducing a scalable, fully automated generation pipeline. The method uses multi-model collaborative prompting and LLM-based validation to produce LaTeX-rendered table images and reasoning-intensive QA pairs. The dataset emphasizes structural reasoning over factual knowledge, enabling more effective knowledge distillation for tasks requiring symbolic interpretation. When used to fine-tune VLMs, Visual-TableQA shows strong generalization to external benchmarks, narrowing the gap between open-source and proprietary models.

## Method Summary
The pipeline generates synthetic multimodal data through a code-as-intermediary approach, using LLMs to output LaTeX code for table structures rather than direct image manipulation. It employs cross-model collaborative prompting where stronger models seed layouts and weaker models elaborate, creating diverse table structures. QA pairs with chain-of-thought rationales are generated and validated by an LLM jury. The resulting dataset is used to fine-tune Vision-Language Models via LoRA, demonstrating improved performance on external reasoning benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Dataset comprises 2.5k tables and 6k QA pairs generated at under $100
- Outperforms existing synthetic datasets in layout diversity and reasoning depth
- Fine-tuned models show +11.72% accuracy gain on ReachQA benchmark
- Successfully narrows performance gap between open-source and proprietary models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Code-as-Intermediary Translation (CIT) for Visual Complexity
Generating LaTeX code instead of direct pixel manipulation allows for scalable creation of structurally complex table images at significantly lower cost than manual annotation. The pipeline leverages LLM coding capabilities to output LaTeX source code (~100 lines per table), which is then compiled into high-resolution images. This decouples reasoning generation from visual rendering, enabling complex visual features via standard libraries.

### Mechanism 2: Cross-Model Collaborative Prompting ("Inspiration")
Using diverse LLMs iteratively—where stronger models seed layouts and varied models elaborate—produces higher layout diversity than single-model operation. The pipeline rotates the "LLM-1" role among a pool of models, with stronger models seeding layouts and topics that weaker models elaborate on. This cross-pollination prevents dataset convergence on a single layout style.

### Mechanism 3: Generalization via Structural Reasoning Distillation
Fine-tuning on synthetic, reasoning-intensive table data with high-quality rationales transfers more effectively to external visual reasoning tasks than training on domain-specific data. The dataset emphasizes structural reasoning (interpreting layout cues) over factual knowledge, forcing models to parse visual structures and providing chain-of-thought rationales that generalize to other visual domains.

## Foundational Learning

- **LaTeX Table Syntax (`multirow`, `multicolumn`, `TikZ`)**: The pipeline hinges on models generating valid LaTeX. Understanding how LaTeX encodes visual complexity is necessary for debugging pipeline failures or refining prompts. *Quick check:* How would you represent a cell that spans 2 rows and 2 columns with a diagonal line in LaTeX?

- **Knowledge Distillation (Teacher-Student)**: The pipeline uses stronger models as a "Jury" to validate outputs from potentially smaller models, a form of distillation where the student learns to emulate the structural reasoning of the teacher. *Quick check:* In this pipeline, is the LaTeX generator acting as the teacher or the student relative to the validation jury?

- **ROSCoe Reasoning Metrics**: The paper uses ROSCoe scores to validate the quality of generated Chain-of-Thought rationales. Understanding these metrics is necessary to interpret the dataset's quality assurance claims. *Quick check:* Does a lower "Redundancy" score in ROSCoe indicate better or worse reasoning coherence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Seeds (20 images + 5k topics) → VLM-0 (inspiration) → LLM-1 (generates LaTeX) → Compiler (pdflatex + pdf2image) → LLM-2 (generates QA) → LLM Jury (validation)
- **Critical path:** The Compiler step is critical—if LLM-generated code doesn't compile (e.g., 0% success for DeepSeek), the pipeline stops requiring manual adjustment.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Cost vs. Quality relies on compact LaTeX code rather than expensive image generation tokens, limiting visual fidelity to what LaTeX can render. Diversity vs. Consistency: Cross-model inspiration maximizes diversity but introduces variance requiring strict Jury filtering.
- **Failure signatures:** Layout Overflow (tables exceeding page margins), Hallucination (model asserts facts not in table), Incoherence (model extracts correct data but reasons incorrectly)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Sanity Check: Run pdflatex compilation on 50 generated tables to measure compilation rate. 2) Ablation on Inspiration: Compare structural diversity between fixed seeds vs. cross-model inspiration. 3) Transfer Validation: Fine-tune LLaVA-Next on Visual-TableQA and evaluate specifically on "Reasoning" split of ReachQA.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can a bidirectional image-to-text encoding system surpass the expressiveness limitations of LaTeX for generating complex visual tables? The current pipeline relies exclusively on LaTeX as the intermediate representation, which constrains visual complexity.

- **Open Question 2:** How can synthetic supervision be designed to specifically mitigate the "incoherence" errors observed in VLMs after fine-tuning? The current pipeline successfully reduces hallucination and misunderstanding but inadvertently increases deductive inconsistencies.

- **Open Question 3:** Why does fine-tuning on Visual-TableQA improve reasoning capabilities while causing performance degradation on certain recognition tasks like VTabFact? The paper documents this trade-off but doesn't isolate which dataset features trigger performance drops in fact-verification tasks.

## Limitations

- The pipeline's reliance on cross-model inspiration lacks precise operational details for selecting which model seeds versus elaborates, potentially leading to inconsistent diversity outcomes.
- Manual selection of tables for inspiration enrichment introduces a non-scalable human-in-the-loop step that may limit reproducibility.
- The assumption that synthetic structural reasoning transfers to real-world tasks is supported by one benchmark but lacks broader validation across multiple domains.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The <$100 cost claim is directly supported by token-efficient LaTeX generation. The +11.72% accuracy gain on ReachQA is quantitatively validated with specific LoRA hyperparameters.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim of "highly diversified layouts" via cross-model prompting is logically sound but relies on subjective assessment. LaTeX effectiveness as an intermediary is well-justified but untested against direct image generation.
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization mechanism's assumption that synthetic reasoning transfers to real-world tasks is supported by one benchmark but lacks broader validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Compilation Success Rate:** Replicate Table 2 by testing LaTeX compilation across 50 tables generated by different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1 vs. Gemini 2.0 Flash) to verify variance in pipeline stability.

2. **Diversity Quantification:** Implement structural diversity metric (e.g., Shannon entropy of LaTeX packages used) to compare tables generated via fixed seeds versus iterative cross-model inspiration.

3. **Generalization Scope:** Fine-tune a VLM on Visual-TableQA and evaluate it on both ReachQA (reasoning) and MATH-Vision (quantitative reasoning) to test whether claimed transfer extends beyond the single benchmark cited.
