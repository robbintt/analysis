# Quantized Large Language Models in Biomedical Natural Language Processing: Evaluation and Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.04534
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04534
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Quantization enables 70B-parameter biomedical LLMs to run on 40GB GPUs with ≤5% accuracy loss

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates the impact of model quantization on large language models (LLMs) in biomedical natural language processing. Twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, including both general-purpose and biomedical-specific models, were tested across eight benchmark datasets covering four key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label classification, and question answering. The evaluation compared full-precision models with 8-bit and 4-bit quantized versions. Results show that quantization reduces GPU memory requirements by up to 75% while preserving model performance, enabling 70B-parameter models to run on 40GB consumer-grade GPUs. Domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness to advanced prompting methods were largely maintained. Quantized LLMs demonstrated strong performance across all tasks, with minimal degradation in accuracy metrics such as F1 scores and classification accuracy. The findings highlight quantization as a practical strategy for deploying high-capacity LLMs in resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive biomedical environments.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated twelve LLMs (including Llama-3.3-70B, Qwen2.5-72B, and domain-specific models like ClinicalCamel) across four biomedical NLP tasks using eight public benchmark datasets. Models were tested in three precision modes: full-precision (FP16/BF16), 8-bit (W8A16), and 4-bit (W4A16) quantization using Hugging Face's BitsAndBytes library with NF4 scheme. For each setting, peak GPU memory usage, inference latency, and task performance (F1 scores, accuracy) were measured. Inference was performed with internal full-precision computation during forward passes to maintain accuracy, while weights were stored in quantized formats. Prompting strategies included standard instructions, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency.

## Key Results
- Quantization reduces GPU memory by up to 75% while preserving model performance
- 70B-parameter models can run on 40GB consumer GPUs at 4-bit precision
- Domain-specific biomedical knowledge is largely maintained after quantization
- Model responsiveness to advanced prompting methods (CoT, self-consistency) remains intact

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Weight quantization from FP16/FP32 to INT8/INT4 reduces memory footprint proportionally to bit-width reduction while preserving task performance.
- Mechanism: Weights are stored in low-precision integer formats (8-bit or 4-bit), then dequantized to higher precision (float16) during computation. The BitsAndBytes NF4 scheme uses normalized float representation with double quantization to maintain numerical stability. Memory savings scale roughly linearly: 8-bit halves memory; 4-bit reduces to ~25% of original.
- Core assumption: The model's learned representations have sufficient redundancy and dynamic range tolerance that discretization to 256 (8-bit) or 16 (4-bit) levels per weight introduces acceptable approximation error.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "quantization substantially reduces GPU memory requirements—by up to 75%—while preserving model performance"
  - [Table 1] Full-precision Llama-3.3-70B uses 132.37 GB; W4A16 uses 39.38 GB (70% reduction); F1 scores remain within 0.03 on HoC
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support for mechanism; neighboring papers focus on safety/deception (Quantized but Deceptive?) rather than memory-performance mechanics
- Break condition: Tasks requiring fine-grained probability discrimination or highly sensitive to weight perturbations may show degraded performance—observe for >5% accuracy drops in Table 1

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Full-precision computation during inference preserves accuracy at the cost of increased latency.
- Mechanism: Despite storing weights in 4-bit or 8-bit, the forward pass internally dequantizes and computes in float16. This avoids accumulating quantization error through layers but introduces overhead from type conversion.
- Core assumption: The precision conversion overhead is acceptable for biomedical applications where accuracy is paramount and latency is secondary.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.5] "Despite the quantization, computations are internally performed in full precision, which helps maintain model accuracy during the forward pass"
  - [Section 2.1] "quantization leads to an increase in response latency"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation of this specific design choice; assumption-based inference
- Break condition: Real-time clinical decision support requiring <100ms latency may find the overhead unacceptable

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Domain-specific biomedical knowledge encoded in fine-tuned models survives quantization with minimal degradation.
- Mechanism: Medical terminology, drug interactions, and clinical reasoning patterns are distributed across many weights. Quantization's uniform compression preserves the relative magnitude structure of weight matrices, maintaining learned semantic relationships.
- Core assumption: Biomedical knowledge is not concentrated in a small subset of high-precision weights that would be catastrophically affected by discretization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 2.2] "ClinicalCamel, which are trained extensively on biomedical data, retain their specialized knowledge after quantization"
  - [Figure 3] Domain models (ClinicalCamel-70B, Meditron-70B) show <2% performance change on DDI2013/HoC when quantized to 4-bit
  - [corpus] Unvalidated by corpus; neighboring papers don't examine biomedical domain knowledge retention
- Break condition: Rare disease or low-frequency medical concepts may have weaker representations that degrade disproportionately

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Quantization schemes (INT8, INT4, NF4)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding the difference between uniform quantization and Normalized Float 4 (NF4) is essential for interpreting the paper's 4-bit configuration choices
  - Quick check question: Why would NF4 outperform uniform INT4 for weight distributions with outliers?

- Concept: **GPU memory architecture (model weights vs. KV cache)**
  - Why needed here: Section 2.4 notes that few-shot learning increases KV cache size; distinguishing weight memory from activation memory is critical for capacity planning
  - Quick check question: If prompt length doubles, which memory component grows—weights or KV cache?

- Concept: **Biomedical NLP task taxonomy (NER, RE, MLC, QA)**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates across four distinct task types with different output constraints (token generation for NER vs. classification labels for MLC)
  - Quick check question: Why might NER be more sensitive to quantization than multi-label classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: HuggingFace Transformers -> BitsAndBytes quantization config -> Dequantization-on-the-fly -> Task-specific output adapters
- Critical path:
  1. Select model size based on GPU memory (70B needs 40GB at 4-bit per Table 1)
  2. Configure quantization level (W4A16 for maximum compression; W8A16 for safety margin)
  3. Set task-specific generation parameters (max_tokens, temperature)
  4. Validate on held-out biomedical data before deployment
- Design tradeoffs:
  - **4-bit vs. 8-bit**: 4-bit offers ~35GB additional savings on 70B models but with higher variance in edge cases (HuatuoGPT-o1 shows degradation in Figure 3)
  - **Latency vs. accuracy**: Full-precision computation preserves F1 but increases latency 2-3× (Table 1: Deepseek-65B HoC latency 4.57s→10.4s at W8A16)
  - **Model size vs. task saturation**: Figure 4 shows NCBI/HoC plateau at 14B; DDI/MedQA continue improving to 72B
- Failure signatures:
  - **>5% F1 drop** relative to full-precision baseline (see Llama-3.3-70B on ChemProt: 0.249→0.181 at W8A16)
  - **Latency exceeding 2× baseline** without memory constraint (indicates inefficient batch sizing)
  - **Hallucinated medical entities** post-quantization (not measured in paper; Assumption: safety risk)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Table 1 on your hardware: run full-precision, W8A16, W4A16 on one dataset (e.g., MedQA) with a single model (e.g., Qwen2.5-72B); measure memory, latency, accuracy
  2. Ablate prompting strategies: test instruction vs. chain-of-thought vs. self-consistency on quantized model to verify Figure 6 trends hold
  3. Stress-test edge case: evaluate on dataset with rare disease mentions or uncommon drug interactions to probe break conditions for domain knowledge retention

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the observed performance preservation of quantized models hold for architectures exceeding 100 billion parameters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state they were "unable to include even larger models exceeding 100 billion parameters" due to resource constraints.
- Why unresolved: It remains unclear if the linear memory savings and minimal accuracy degradation scale effectively to trillion-parameter or ultra-large dense models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking 100B+ parameter models on the same biomedical NER and QA tasks to verify if accuracy degradation remains negligible.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can inference latency be optimized without sacrificing the memory gains or accuracy observed in the current setup?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors report a "moderate increase in latency" caused by the overhead of precision conversion during full-precision computation.
- Why unresolved: The study prioritized maintaining accuracy via full-precision computation, leaving the trade-off between aggressive quantization and raw generation speed unoptimized.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of quantized models using integer-only arithmetic operations versus the current mixed-precision approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why do specific biomedical-adapted models (e.g., HuatuoGPT-o1-70B) suffer performance degradation at 8-bit precision while others maintain stability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the general conclusion is that quantization maintains domain knowledge, the results section notes that HuatuoGPT and Med42 showed "substantial performance degradation when quantized to 8 bits."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate if specific fine-tuning methods or weight distributions in these domain-specific models introduce sensitivity to quantization noise.
- What evidence would resolve it: A layer-wise analysis of weight outliers and activation distributions in models that failed quantization versus those that succeeded.

## Limitations
- **Domain Knowledge Retention Under Compression**: The analysis doesn't isolate whether all types of medical knowledge (common vs. rare conditions, standard vs. novel drug interactions) compress equally well.
- **Prompt Template Sensitivity**: The evaluation uses unspecified "instruction prompts" without providing templates, creating uncertainty about transferability to different prompting strategies.
- **Safety and Hallucination Risks**: The study focuses on standard performance metrics but doesn't evaluate whether quantization introduces new failure modes like medical hallucination.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Claims about memory reduction (75% savings at 4-bit), basic latency increases (2-3× slowdown), and overall task performance preservation across standard biomedical benchmarks.
- **Medium Confidence**: Assertions about domain-specific knowledge retention and responsiveness to advanced prompting methods, supported by observed performance metrics but lacking direct empirical validation of underlying mechanisms.
- **Low Confidence**: Safety implications and break conditions for rare medical concepts, which represent important practical considerations but are not empirically tested in the current evaluation framework.

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt Template Ablation Study**: Systematically test the impact of different prompt templates (including few-shot examples and chain-of-thought reasoning) on quantized vs. full-precision models across all four task types to verify that observed quantization benefits hold across prompting strategies.

2. **Rare Concept Sensitivity Analysis**: Design a targeted evaluation using biomedical datasets enriched with rare diseases, uncommon drug interactions, or novel medical terminology to empirically test whether quantization disproportionately affects representation of low-frequency medical concepts.

3. **Safety and Hallucination Audit**: Implement a structured evaluation measuring the frequency of medically plausible but factually incorrect entity generations (hallucinations) in quantized models compared to full-precision versions, particularly focusing on clinical decision support scenarios.
