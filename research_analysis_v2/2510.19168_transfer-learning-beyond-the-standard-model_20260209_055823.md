# Transfer Learning Beyond the Standard Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19168
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19168
- Reference count: 33
- Pre-training on ΛCDM and fine-tuning on beyond-ΛCDM simulations reduces required simulations by up to an order of magnitude, but physical degeneracies can cause negative transfer.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates transfer learning for cosmological parameter inference beyond the standard ΛCDM model. The authors demonstrate that pre-training neural networks on large ΛCDM simulation datasets and fine-tuning them on smaller, computationally expensive beyond-ΛCDM simulations can significantly reduce simulation requirements. They introduce a dummy node architecture during pre-training that provides extra representational capacity for fine-tuning. The approach works well for various extensions including massive neutrinos, modified gravity, and primordial non-Gaussianities, though success depends critically on parameter degeneracies. The study shows that transfer learning can accelerate inference beyond the standard model, but its effectiveness hinges on careful architectural choices and awareness of physical degeneracies.

## Method Summary
The authors employ transfer learning by pre-training neural networks on large ΛCDM simulation datasets and fine-tuning on smaller beyond-ΛCDM simulations. The key innovation is a dummy node architecture where extra output nodes are included during pre-training but excluded from the loss function, creating bottleneck-like structures that reserve representational capacity for beyond-ΛCDM parameters during fine-tuning. The network takes 79 bins of power spectrum or marked power spectrum as input and predicts normalized cosmological parameters. Pre-training uses 2,000-22,000 ΛCDM simulations while fine-tuning uses 100-1,000 beyond-ΛCDM simulations. The study compares multiple transfer architectures including weight initialization and attaching trainable inference heads, finding the dummy node approach consistently outperforms alternatives.

## Key Results
- Transfer learning reduces simulation requirements by up to an order of magnitude compared to training from scratch
- The dummy node architecture consistently outperforms alternatives, especially at larger simulation counts
- Negative transfer occurs when strong physical degeneracies exist between ΛCDM and beyond-ΛCDM parameters (e.g., σ8-Mν degeneracy)
- Even 2,000 pre-training simulations provide benefits, with further improvements at 22,000
- Marked power spectra are more informative but more prone to negative transfer due to increased sensitivity to degenerate parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Including dummy nodes during pre-training provides latent capacity that improves transfer to extended parameter spaces. The dummy nodes are added to the output layer during ΛCDM pre-training but excluded from the MSE loss, creating bottleneck-like structures that reserve representational capacity for beyond-ΛCDM parameters during fine-tuning, avoiding the need to reshape learned features to accommodate new outputs.

### Mechanism 2
Transfer learning reduces simulation requirements when source and target domains share transferable physical structure. Pre-training on ΛCDM simulations teaches the network to extract informative features from power spectra that partially generalize to beyond-ΛCDM cosmologies, reducing the number of expensive target simulations needed to achieve comparable MSE.

### Mechanism 3
Negative transfer occurs when strong physical degeneracies cause pre-learned feature-parameter mappings to conflict with new parameters. In ΛCDM pre-training, small-scale power spectrum features are mapped to σ8. When Mν is introduced (which also suppresses small-scale power), the network must "unlearn" the σ8 mapping and reassign those features to Mν, degrading performance for both parameters.

## Foundational Learning

- **Transfer Learning**: The core method enabling simulation cost reduction by reusing knowledge across cosmological models. Quick check: Can you explain why pre-training on one task might help—or hurt—learning on a related task?
- **Parameter Degeneracy**: Critical for understanding when transfer succeeds vs. fails; degenerate parameters share observational signatures. Quick check: If two parameters affect the same observable in similar ways, what challenges does this create for inference?
- **Bottleneck/Representational Capacity**: The dummy node architecture is motivated by bottleneck principles from representation learning. Quick check: Why might reserving "extra" output dimensions during pre-training help with fine-tuning to new tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (79 P(k) bins) -> Hidden layers (≤3, LeakyReLU) -> Output (Sigmoid + dummy nodes) -> Loss (MSE on ΛCDM during pre-training)
- **Critical path**: 1. Pre-train on ΛCDM with dummy nodes included but not contributing to loss, 2. Initialize fine-tuning network with pre-trained weights, 3. Fine-tune on beyond-ΛCDM data using dummy nodes for new parameters with reduced learning rate
- **Design tradeoffs**: Dummy nodes vs. no dummy (dummy nodes consistently outperform), Attach head vs. full fine-tuning (attaching head performs worst), Marked vs. standard power spectrum (marked is more informative but more prone to negative transfer)
- **Failure signatures**: Negative transfer (MSE increases with transfer), No improvement from transfer (check ΛCDM prior mismatches), Head attachment underperforms (switch to dummy node or weight initialization)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Baseline comparison: Train from scratch on beyond-ΛCDM data with varying N_fine-tune, 2. Dummy node ablation: Pre-train with dummy nodes on 2,000 and 22,000 ΛCDM simulations, 3. Degeneracy diagnosis: Compare transfer performance using standard vs. marked power spectrum for massive neutrino case

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can transfer learning with the dummy node architecture improve performance for normalizing flows that predict full posterior distributions rather than point estimates?** The paper focused on fully connected networks but expects similar conclusions for normalizing flows predicting full posterior distributions.

- **Does transfer learning provide greater or lesser gains for galaxy clustering and weak lensing observables compared to matter power spectra?** The paper suggests applying transfer learning to observables like galaxy clustering or weak lensing would be fruitful future work, noting these may yield greater gains due to reduced sensitivity to certain parameters.

- **Can negative transfer from parameter degeneracies be systematically predicted or avoided before fine-tuning?** The paper demonstrates negative transfer due to σ8-Mν degeneracy but relies on post-hoc SHAP analysis to explain it, without providing systematic diagnostic tools.

## Limitations

- The marked power spectrum implementation details are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- Results are based on specific simulation suites (Quijote BSQ for pre-training, Latin Hypercube for fine-tuning) that may not generalize to other frameworks
- The optimal architecture (dummy nodes) was identified through extensive hyperparameter searches, but the search space and specific configurations are not fully reported

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Transfer learning consistently reduces simulation requirements (10-100×) when no strong degeneracies exist between ΛCDM and beyond-ΛCDM parameters
- **Medium Confidence**: Dummy node architecture provides superior performance, though the exact mechanisms could benefit from additional ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence**: Physical degeneracies (σ8-Mν) cause negative transfer, particularly with marked power spectra
- **Low Confidence**: The specific architectural choices (3 hidden layers max, 79 k-bins) are optimal; the search space may have been underspecified

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on marked power spectrum sensitivity**: Systematically vary the marking parameter (R=10, 20, 30 Mpc/h) and compare transfer performance to isolate the role of small-scale sensitivity in σ8-Mν degeneracy-driven negative transfer.

2. **Transfer learning across simulation frameworks**: Pre-train on Quijote BSQ simulations and fine-tune on a different simulation suite (e.g., CAMELS) to test generalization beyond the specific simulation pipeline used in this study.

3. **Extended parameter space validation**: Apply the dummy node transfer architecture to a broader beyond-ΛCDM scenario (e.g., massive neutrinos + primordial non-Gaussianity) to test whether the architectural benefits extend to multi-parameter extensions beyond single-parameter additions.
