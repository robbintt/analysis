# Multi-Fidelity Hybrid Reinforcement Learning via Information Gain Maximization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.14848
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14848
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Proposes MF-HRL-IGM algorithm that achieves sublinear regret O(√Γ log(Γ)) by dynamically selecting simulator fidelity levels based on information gain maximization.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing reinforcement learning policies when multiple simulators with varying fidelity and computational cost are available, while constrained by a fixed cost budget. The authors propose Multi-Fidelity Hybrid RL via Information Gain Maximization (MF-HRL-IGM), which extends hybrid offline-online RL to dynamically select simulator fidelity levels based on information gain maximization. The algorithm maintains a posterior belief over candidate policies and selects fidelity levels by maximizing the information gain per unit cost, with a threshold mechanism to ensure cost-effective exploration. Theoretical analysis establishes the no-regret property of MF-HRL-IGM, showing that regret grows sublinearly with respect to the cost budget as O(√Γ log(Γ)). Empirical evaluations on the Half-Cheetah environment demonstrate that MF-HRL-IGM consistently outperforms benchmarks based on fixed fidelity levels or uniform cost allocation across fidelity levels, particularly under restrictive cost budgets.

## Method Summary
The MF-HRL-IGM algorithm operates in two phases: offline pre-training and online optimization. During offline pre-training, L bootstrap policies are trained using CQL on resampled datasets from the offline data. In the online phase, the algorithm iteratively selects fidelity levels by maximizing information gain per unit cost, collects data from the selected simulator, updates the posterior belief over policies, and performs hybrid offline-online updates using the H2O algorithm with importance weighting to correct simulator bias. The fidelity selection uses a threshold mechanism (β_r = 1/√Γ_r) to ensure cost-effective exploration, defaulting to highest fidelity when information gain per cost falls below threshold.

## Key Results
- MF-HRL-IGM achieves regret bound O(√Γ log(Γ)), growing sublinearly with cost budget
- Outperforms fixed-fidelity baselines and uniform cost allocation strategies on Half-Cheetah environment
- Demonstrates superior performance particularly under restrictive cost budgets
- Shows robust behavior across different budget constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Adaptive fidelity selection based on information gain per unit cost enables more efficient use of computational budget than fixed or uniform allocation strategies.
- **Mechanism:** At each round r, the algorithm computes mutual information I(U; B^r_k | D^{r-1}) between the latent optimal policy index U and simulated data B^r_k at each fidelity level k, then selects k_r = argmax_k I(U; B^r_k | D^{r-1})/λ_k. A threshold condition (β_r = 1/√Γ_r) prevents excessive low-fidelity exploration; if not met, highest fidelity is forced.
- **Core assumption:** Information gain estimates accurately reflect policy improvement potential (assumes posterior entropy approximations from historical batches generalize).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "dynamically select simulator fidelity levels based on information gain maximization"
  - [section 4] Equations (8)-(9) define the selection criterion and threshold condition
  - [corpus] Related work on multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (Song et al., 2019) supports information-theoretic selection; corpus lacks direct replications of MF-HRL-IGM specifically
- **Break condition:** If mutual information estimates become unreliable (e.g., posterior collapse, insufficient bootstrap diversity), selection degrades to random or greedy behavior.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Maintaining a posterior belief over L bootstrapped policies enables principled uncertainty quantification for fidelity selection.
- **Mechanism:** L binary masks generate bootstrapped datasets D^off_ℓ from offline data; each trains an independent policy π^off_ℓ via CQL. Posterior p(U=ℓ|D^r) is updated using exp(-L_ℓ(B^r_{k_r})) where L_ℓ is the H2O loss. This posterior drives information gain computation.
- **Core assumption:** Bootstrap diversity captures epistemic uncertainty about optimal policy; loss-based likelihood reflects data quality (Assumption: generalized Bayesian framework validity).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "maintains a posterior belief over candidate policies"
  - [section 4] Equation (7) defines posterior update; references bootstrap RL [16]
  - [corpus] Bootstrap RL for uncertainty quantification is established (Hu et al., 2024); corpus does not contradict this mechanism
- **Break condition:** If bootstrap policies converge to similar solutions (insufficient diversity), posterior becomes uninformative, information gain nears zero, triggering default high-fidelity selection.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Combining offline data with simulator interactions using conservative Q-learning regularization and importance weighting mitigates distribution shift while correcting simulator bias.
- **Mechanism:** The objective (Equation 1) balances: (a) conservative value regularization penalizing Q-overestimation, (b) Bellman error on offline data, and (c) importance-weighted Bellman error on simulator data using dynamics ratio P^M/P^{cM}. Discriminators estimate P(real|s,a,s') for importance weights.
- **Core assumption:** Learned discriminators accurately distinguish real vs. simulated transitions; importance weights correct bias without excessive variance (Assumption: sufficient discriminator accuracy).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.2] Equation (1) and (6) define the hybrid objective and importance weight computation
  - [section 6] Experiments show MF-HRL-IGM outperforms fixed-fidelity baselines, indirectly validating the combined mechanism
  - [corpus] H2O algorithm [3] provides foundation; corpus supports hybrid offline-online RL efficacy in related settings
- **Break condition:** If discriminators fail (e.g., sim-to-real gap too large), importance weights become noisy, causing high-variance updates or biased policy learning.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Mutual Information and Entropy**
  - **Why needed here:** Core to fidelity selection; requires understanding I(U; B) = H(U) - H(U|B) for computing information gain.
  - **Quick check question:** Given posterior entropy H(U|D) = 1.5 bits and expected conditional entropy E[H(U|B, D)] = 0.8 bits, what is the mutual information?

- **Concept: Bootstrap Aggregation for Uncertainty**
  - **Why needed here:** Enables maintaining diverse policy hypotheses for posterior-based selection.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does training L policies on bootstrapped subsets (rather than identical data) produce meaningful uncertainty estimates?

- **Concept: Importance Sampling for Off-Policy Correction**
  - **Why needed here:** Corrects simulator dynamics bias via P^M(s'|s,a)/P^{cM}(s'|s,a) weights in Bellman error.
  - **Quick check question:** If the importance weight w = P_real/P_sim has high variance, what failure mode might occur in gradient updates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Offline Phase: Dataset D^off → Bootstrap masks M_ℓ → L CQL policies {π^off_ℓ, Q^off_ℓ}; Online Phase Loop: Fidelity Selector → Simulator M_{k_r} → Discriminators → Posterior Updater → Policy Optimizer
- **Critical path:** Offline CQL pre-training → posterior initialization → [fidelity selection → data collection → posterior update → policy update] loop until budget exhausted
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - More bootstrap policies (higher L): Better uncertainty quantification, but linear compute overhead
  - Threshold β_r: Higher values → more conservative (favor high-fidelity); lower → aggressive low-fidelity exploration
  - Discriminator training frequency: More frequent → better weights, but adds overhead
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Posterior collapse (all p(U=ℓ) ≈ 1/L): Insufficient bootstrap diversity or learning rate too high
  - Always selecting k_r = K: β_r too aggressive or information gain estimates near zero
  - Degraded returns vs. offline-only: Importance weights exploding (discriminator overconfident)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation on L (bootstrap count):** Run MF-HRL-IGM with L∈{1,3,5,10} on Half-Cheetah with fixed budget Γ; plot final return vs. L to validate diversity-uncertainty relationship.
  2. **Threshold sensitivity:** Vary β_r scaling (test β_r = c/√Γ_r for c∈{0.5,1.0,2.0}); measure fidelity selection distribution and regret to confirm theoretical threshold choice.
  3. **Discriminator accuracy impact:** Inject controlled noise into discriminator predictions; quantify performance degradation to assess robustness to importance weight errors.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the MF-HRL-IGM framework perform when applied to hybrid RL algorithms other than H2O and in more complex environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that "Extending the framework to additional algorithms and more complex environments is a promising direction for future research."
- Why unresolved: The current empirical validation is restricted to the H2O algorithm within the Half-Cheetah environment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the framework using alternative base algorithms (e.g., SAC-based hybrids) and diverse high-dimensional environments (e.g., Humanoid).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How is the regret bound affected if the highest fidelity simulator does not perfectly match the true environment?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Theoretical analysis relies on Assumption 1(i), which mandates "The highest fidelity level K corresponds to the true environment."
- Why unresolved: In real-world sim-to-real transfer, even the highest fidelity simulator is typically an approximation rather than a perfect match, potentially violating the no-regret guarantee.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical derivation of regret bounds under a relaxed assumption where the highest fidelity simulator has a bounded approximation error.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the fidelity selection strategy robust to inaccuracies in the mutual information estimation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4 details the estimation of mutual information using historical simulation batches to approximate expected conditional entropy, but does not analyze sensitivity to estimation errors.
- Why unresolved: Poor estimation of information gain could lead to suboptimal fidelity selection, degrading performance relative to simpler heuristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis showing performance changes when varying the size of the history buffer used for entropy estimation.

## Limitations

- Theoretical guarantees depend on accurate posterior entropy approximations and information gain estimates, which may not hold in high-dimensional continuous control tasks
- Empirical results limited to single Half-Cheetah environment, restricting generalizability to more complex tasks
- Computational overhead of maintaining L bootstrapped policies and training discriminators may offset fidelity cost savings in practice

## Confidence

- **Theoretical analysis:** Medium - depends on assumptions about mutual information bounds without empirical validation
- **Empirical methodology:** Medium-High - consistent improvements over baselines but limited to one environment
- **Generalizability:** Low - single environment evaluation prevents strong claims about broader applicability
- **Mechanism robustness:** Medium-High for well-specified discriminators, Low if sim-to-real gaps are large

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the fidelity selection mechanism on multiple MuJoCo environments (Walker2d, Ant) to test generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies on the threshold parameter β_r to identify optimal scaling.
3. Test robustness by injecting varying levels of dynamics noise into the discriminator training process.
