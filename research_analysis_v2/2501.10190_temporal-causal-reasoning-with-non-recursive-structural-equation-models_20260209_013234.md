# Temporal Causal Reasoning with (Non-Recursive) Structural Equation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.10190
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10190
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Introduces CPLTL temporal logic integrating causal interventions with linear-time temporal logic, with polynomial-time model-checking for non-recursive SEMs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a temporal interpretation of Structural Equation Models (SEMs) that allows reasoning about time-dependent causal relationships. The core method transforms exogenous variable dynamics into endogenous variable dynamics through iterative computation, enabling the combination of counterfactual reasoning with temporal logic. The authors develop CPLTL, a temporal logic integrating causal interventions with linear-time temporal logic operators, and demonstrate that non-recursive models (with cycles) can be handled naturally in this framework.

## Method Summary
The method introduces TSEMs (Temporal Structural Equation Models) that combine time-indexed interventions with periodic exogenous contexts. Algorithm 1 computes periodic computations by iteratively applying structural equations F with context u, detecting cycles when state and loop-position repeat. CPLTL formulas are evaluated by computing intervened computations for each intervention subformula, then using Markey's PLTL path model-checking technique with past-temporal height considerations. The framework naturally handles feedback loops and arbitrary delays through 1-step reduction.

## Key Results
- CPLTL model-checking is in P (polynomial time)
- Non-recursive models with cycles can be handled naturally
- New notions of temporal equivalence for causal models introduced
- Framework accommodates arbitrary temporal delays between causal dependencies
- Provides useful modeling tools for feedback loops and mutually dependent processes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by systematically transforming exogenous variable dynamics into endogenous variable dynamics through iterative computation. By detecting cycles in computations where both state and loop-position repeat, the algorithm can efficiently compute ultimately periodic sequences. The integration of causal interventions with temporal logic allows reasoning about what happens when interventions occur at specific times within a temporal context.

## Foundational Learning
- **TSEM Signature**: Defines exogenous (U), endogenous (V), ranges (R), and structural equations (F) - needed to formalize temporal causal models with both observable and hidden variables.
- **Periodic Computation**: Algorithm that computes ultimately periodic sequences from interventions and contexts - needed to handle infinite temporal horizons efficiently.
- **CPLTL Semantics**: Combines interventions [Ȳ(ñ)←ȳ] with temporal operators - needed to express complex temporal causal queries.
- **Cycle Detection**: Identifies when C(i)=C(j) AND (i mod m)=(j mod m) - needed to determine periodicity in computations.
- **Past-Temporal Height**: h_P(φ) measures nesting of past modalities - needed to bound evaluation window for Markey's algorithm.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Signature → Structural Equations F → Periodic Context ū → Initial Assignment v → CPLTL Formula φ → Model Checking

**Critical path**: (M,ū,v),t ⊨ φ requires computing intervened computations via Algorithm 1, then evaluating φ on resulting computation using Markey's technique with past-height truncation.

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Arbitrary delays vs 1-step reduction: arbitrary delays require full history, but can be reduced to 1-step at the cost of additional variables
- Complete vs incomplete models: incomplete models lack equations for some variables but still allow computation
- Deterministic vs probabilistic: current framework is deterministic, probabilistic extension remains open

**Failure signatures**: 
- Non-termination in cycle detection if ū not truly periodic
- Incorrect past modality evaluation at t=0
- Exponential blowup when reducing arbitrary-delay models to 1-step

**First experiments**:
1. Verify (M,ū,v),0 ⊨ [ST(0)←1]◯(BS=1) for Rocks example with ū=(00,10,00,01,00...) and v=(0,0,0)
2. Test cycle detection with Deadline model's feedback loop between H and M
3. Evaluate past modality boundaries with formula ◯⁻(X=x) at t=0 and t=1

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the TSEM framework be adapted to handle probabilistic settings, specifically regarding probability distributions over temporal contexts or non-deterministic structural equations?
- What are the valid formal definitions for (bi)simulation relations between temporal causal models, and can weaker notions of temporal equivalence be established?
- Can the CPLTL framework be extended to models with infinitely many variables or infinite ranges without compromising the polynomial-time model checking result?

## Limitations
- Implementation details for structural equations F are underspecified
- No empirical evaluation of computational scalability for large models
- Probabilistic extensions remain unexplored
- Only handles deterministic structural equations

## Confidence

**Theoretical contributions**: High confidence - formally proven with rigorous mathematical definitions
**Practical applicability**: Medium confidence - implementation details ambiguous
**Computational scalability**: Low confidence - no empirical results provided

## Next Checks
1. Verify cycle detection works correctly on Deadline model's feedback loop between H and M
2. Test past modality boundary handling with formula ◯⁻(X=x) at t=0 and t=1
3. Confirm arbitrary-delay reduction preserves CPLTL equivalence by comparing results on original vs reduced models with known feedback loops
