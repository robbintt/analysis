# BridgeEQA: Virtual Embodied Agents for Real Bridge Inspections

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12676
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12676
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces BridgeEQA benchmark with 2,200 open-vocabulary QA pairs across 200 real bridge scenes (9,586 images), requiring multi-scale reasoning and long-range spatial understanding.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BridgeEQA, a benchmark for Embodied Question Answering (EQA) in the domain of bridge inspection. BridgeEQA consists of 2,200 open-vocabulary question-answer pairs grounded in 200 real-world bridge scenes with 9,586 images, requiring multi-scale reasoning and long-range spatial understanding. The authors propose a new EQA metric, Image Citation Relevance, to evaluate the semantic similarity between agent-cited images and reference evidence. To address performance gaps in existing EQA methods, they introduce Embodied Memory Visual Reasoning (EMVR), which formulates inspection as sequential navigation over an image-based scene graph, enabling dynamic context retrieval and mitigating positional bias in long-context VLMs. EMVR improves condition rating accuracy by 9.3 percentage points, Image Citation Relevance by 20.2 percentage points, and Answer Correctness by 7.2 percentage points over the Multi-Frame VLM baseline.

## Method Summary
BridgeEQA addresses embodied question answering for bridge inspection by creating a benchmark of 2,200 QA pairs across 200 real bridge scenes (9,586 images). The method introduces EMVR, which formulates QA as an MDP traversal over an image-based scene graph. Scene graphs are constructed using Gemini 2.5 Flash with nodes containing image metadata and edges representing spatial relationships. The agent executes actions (MOVE, COMPARE, REASON, RESPOND) to navigate and answer questions while citing supporting images. Evaluation uses LLM-as-a-judge for answer correctness and a novel Image Citation Relevance metric with over-selection penalties.

## Key Results
- EMVR improves condition rating accuracy by 9.3 percentage points over Multi-Frame VLM baseline
- EMVR achieves 20.2 percentage point improvement in Image Citation Relevance metric
- EMVR shows 7.2 percentage point improvement in Answer Correctness
- Outperforms Socratic LLM and Multi-Frame VLM baselines across all metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Context Window Reprioritization via Navigational Actions
EMVR improves answer correctness by mitigating the "lost in the middle" phenomenon observed in long-context VLMs. Instead of ingesting all ~48 images simultaneously, the agent executes a sequential MDP. By navigating to a specific node and then loading the image, the system effectively moves critical visual evidence to the end of the context window, increasing its attention weight. This works because VLMs attend more strongly to tokens at the start or end of the context window.

### Mechanism 2: Allocentric Grounding via Image-Based Scene Graphs
The bridge inspection domain lacks foundation models for all bridge components, so the system uses the scene graph as a semantic index. The agent reads the text-based graph structure (descriptions/focus) to decide where to move, performing a text-guided search over visual data before loading pixels. This creates an allocentric map that substitutes for missing dense object detectors.

### Mechanism 3: Visual Grounding via Forced Citation
The `Image Citation Relevance` metric and structured output requirement reduce hallucination by forcing the model to anchor textual claims in specific image observations. The agent must return a structured response including `R_agent` (cited images), and the action space includes `COMPARE` and `REASON` explicitly forcing visual processing before the final `RESPOND` action.

## Foundational Learning

- **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in LLM Agents**
  - Why needed here: EMVR formulates the QA task as an MDP (State, Action, Reward). You must understand how an LLM can function as a policy selecting function calls based on state history.
  - Quick check question: How does the `MOVE` action update the state `s_t` in the EMVR formulation?

- **"Lost in the Middle" Phenomenon**
  - Why needed here: This is the primary theoretical justification for why the Multi-Frame VLM baseline fails and why EMVR succeeds. You need to understand that model performance degrades when relevant info is buried in the middle of a long context.
  - Quick check question: Does EMVR solve context limits by increasing context size, or by selective retrieval?

- **Allocentric vs. Egocentric Representations**
  - Why needed here: The bridge inspection data is egocentric (inspector photos), but the agent needs an allocentric (global) understanding to navigate. The Scene Graph serves as this bridge.
  - Quick check question: In BridgeEQA, what serves as the allocentric map that the agent queries before deciding to load an image?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Dataset (200 Bridge Scenes) -> Graph Builder (Gemini 2.5) -> Scene Graph (JSON) -> EMVR Agent (Grok/Gemini) -> Evaluator (VLM Judge)

- **Critical path:** Scene Graph Construction (If graph lacks edges, agent cannot navigate) -> Action Execution (Must output valid function calls) -> Citation Mapping (Final output must list valid image filenames)

- **Design tradeoffs:** Multi-Frame (Baseline): Low latency, poor accuracy on long contexts due to positional bias. EMVR: High accuracy, high latency/cost (multiple sequential inference calls). Graph Granularity: Image-as-node used because object detectors don't exist for bridge parts.

- **Failure signatures:** Hallucinated Citations (Agent cites non-existent filenames), Circular Navigation (Agent moves back and forth without RESPOND), Stochastic Parrot (Agent outputs generic answers without citing images)

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline Validation: Run Multi-Frame VLM on 10 scenes to confirm positional bias hypothesis. 2) Ablation on Graph Context: Run EMVR with graph text only vs. full image access. 3) Citation Consistency Check: Manually inspect 20 random "Correct" answers to calibrate VLM-as-Judge.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can specialized finetuning enable smaller, sub-30B parameter VLMs to reliably execute the EMVR protocol?**
  - The paper excluded sub-30B models because they could not "reliably adhere to the required structured-output and function-calling protocol."

- **How does the specific design of the action space impact the efficiency and accuracy of the inspection agent?**
  - Section 5.4 lists "action space design" as a topic for future work, noting that systematic evaluations of different configurations were computationally prohibitive.

- **How robust is the EMVR agent to errors or noise in the automatically generated scene graph topology?**
  - The methodology relies on Gemini to automatically construct scene graphs, but the paper does not evaluate sensitivity to graph hallucinations or missing edges.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks detailed prompt templates and generation parameters for both scene graph construction and EMVR agent
- The "Image Citation Relevance" metric's calibration is opaque and may not correlate with human judgment
- The bridge domain's specificity raises questions about generalizability to other inspection tasks
- The study only evaluates zero-shot proprietary models, leaving potential for efficient local models unexplored

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the positional-bias mitigation mechanism (EMVR improves over Multi-Frame baseline by 20.2 pp on Image Citation Relevance)
- **Medium confidence** in the allocentric scene graph's effectiveness as a navigation scaffold
- **Medium confidence** in the metric design, though reliance on VLM judges introduces circularity concerns

## Next Checks

1. Run an ablation study comparing EMVR with and without visual access (graph text only vs. full image retrieval) to isolate the contribution of visual grounding versus semantic navigation
2. Implement a human validation study on 50 random answers to verify that the "Image Citation Relevance" score correlates with actual image relevance to the answer
3. Test EMVR on a subset of indoor scenes from existing EQA benchmarks to assess domain generalization beyond bridge inspection
