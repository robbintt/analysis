# Assessing LLM Reasoning Through Implicit Causal Chain Discovery in Climate Discourse

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13417
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13417
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: This work examines the ability of large language models to discover implicit causal chains in climate change discourse.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a zero-shot prompting method to evaluate how well large language models (LLMs) can generate implicit causal chains from cause-effect pairs in polarized climate discussions. By instructing nine different LLMs to produce all possible intermediate causal steps, the research reveals that while models vary in output quantity and detail, they generally exhibit self-consistency and confidence in their generated chains. However, their reasoning appears to be driven more by associative pattern matching than by genuine causal understanding. Human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and integrity of these chains, providing a benchmark dataset and foundational insights for future work on mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

## Method Summary
The study employs a zero-shot prompting approach to elicit causal chain generation from nine LLMs (including GPT4o, o1, DeepSeek R1, and various Llama and Mistral variants) without exemplar bias. Using cause-effect pairs from the PolarIs3CAUS and PolarIs4CAUS datasets, each model generates chains linking the pairs through intermediate causal events. The method relies on a domain-agnostic prompt template that defines causal chains, describes the task, and specifies formatting with `<step>` and `<chain>` tokens. Outputs are parsed to extract intermediate causal event pairs, which are then evaluated for self-consistency, directionality understanding, and position heuristic susceptibility. The approach avoids few-shot learning to prevent introducing biases related to chain count, intermediate event number, or detail level.

## Key Results
- LLMs generate varying numbers of causal chains with different granularities, but generally show self-consistency and confidence in their outputs
- Generated chains are validated by human evaluators for logical coherence and integrity, despite being primarily driven by associative pattern matching
- Models exhibit vulnerability to position heuristics, showing inconsistent causal judgments when linguistic framing changes
- The study provides a benchmark dataset and diagnostic framework for evaluating implicit mechanistic causal reasoning in LLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Zero-shot prompting can elicit causal chain generation without exemplar bias when prompts are domain-agnostic and structurally constrained.
- Mechanism: The prompt provides a causal chain definition, task description with cause-effect slots, and formatting instructions. Structurally consistent noun-phrase inputs (from PolarIs datasets) reduce grammatical variability. The LLM infers both the number of chains (N) and intermediate steps (M) per chain autonomously.
- Core assumption: The causal knowledge encoded in LLM parameters is sufficient for generating mechanistically plausible chains without external retrieval.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs"
  - [Section 2.4]: "We deliberately avoid a few-shot approach to prevent introducing biases related to the number of chains (i.e., N), the number of intermediate causal events in a chain (i.e., M), or the level of detail in each event."
  - [corpus]: Related work on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) compression and implicit reasoning supports that intermediate reasoning steps can be generated without explicit exemplars, though faithfulness remains an open question (arXiv:2602.01017, arXiv:2509.02350).
- Break condition: If input CE pairs are ambiguous or lack shared context, generated chains may diverge in granularity or fail to connect coherently.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs exhibit self-consistency by validating their own generated intermediate causal links as causal, but this reflects pattern-matching confidence rather than mechanistic understanding.
- Mechanism: After generating chains, each intermediate pair (E_t → E_{t+1}) is re-presented to the LLM with a yes/no causality question (λ_A1). Self-consistency is measured by the proportion classified as causal. High rates indicate the model understood the task and is confident in its outputs.
- Core assumption: Self-consistency correlates with task comprehension; however, it does not distinguish between genuine causal inference and associative completion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the intermediate causal connections in their generated chains, their judgments are mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal reasoning."
  - [Section 4.1.1]: "The majority of pairs are classified as causal, with minimal differences between general-purpose and reasoning LLMs. This suggests that the LLMs understood the causal chain discovery task well."
  - [corpus]: DiffCoT (arXiv:2601.03559) highlights error propagation in autoregressive CoT, suggesting that intermediate steps may not reflect true causal structure.
- Break condition: Self-consistency may break when prompts are rephrased (active vs. passive voice), revealing reliance on surface patterns rather than stable causal representations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs are susceptible to position heuristics, producing inconsistent causal judgments when linguistic framing changes, indicating amortized reasoning rather than genuine inference.
- Mechanism: The evaluation switches active ("Does E_t cause E_{t+1}?") to passive ("Is E_{t+1} caused by E_t?") prompts. Consistency is measured via Jaccard dissimilarity and Hamming distance. High disagreement on reversed pairs indicates sensitivity to surface form.
- Core assumption: Robust causal understanding should be invariant to syntactic transformations that preserve semantic content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.1.3]: "For λ_A2 and λ_{A2-P}, disagreement increases substantially, with values ranging from 0.25 to 0.51. This indicates a marked drop in consistency when evaluating reversed, incorrect causal relations."
  - [Section 4.1.3]: "LLMs have been shown to have internalized causal patterns during training (e.g., the event representing the cause is more frequently positioned before the event representing the effect in a text)."
  - [corpus]: "How Does Unfaithful Reasoning Emerge from Autoregressive Training?" (arXiv:2602.01017) provides theoretical grounding for why autoregressive models may produce unfaithful intermediate reasoning.
- Break condition: Position heuristics are most exposed when evaluating invalid or reversed causal relations; forward chains show higher consistency.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Causal Chain Definition (Pearl 2009)**
  - Why needed here: The paper operationalizes causal chains as sequences where M > 0 intermediate events connect cause to effect, with each link independently analyzable.
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish a valid causal chain (A→B→C) from a correlational sequence where B does not causally mediate A and C?

- Concept: **Directionality of Causality**
  - Why needed here: A key diagnostic is whether LLMs understand that causes must precede effects temporally; ~50% of reversed pairs were still judged causal.
  - Quick check question: If an LLM judges both "A causes B" and "B causes A" as valid, what does this imply about its causal representation?

- Concept: **Position Heuristics / Amortized Causal Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: Explains why LLMs fail consistency tests when prompts are rephrased—they rely on learned surface patterns rather than performing inference.
  - Quick check question: How would you design an experiment to distinguish genuine causal inference from pattern-matching in an LLM?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - PolarIs datasets (CE pairs) -> Zero-shot prompt template (λ) -> LLM backbone (ϕ) -> Output parser (token splitting) -> Diagnostic evaluations (λ_A1, λ_A2, λ_{A1-P}, λ_{A2-P}) -> Metrics aggregation

- Critical path:
  1. Load CE pairs -> 2. Apply prompt template -> 3. Generate chains (single inference pass) -> 4. Parse intermediate CE pairs -> 5. Run diagnostic evaluations -> 6. Aggregate metrics (chain counts, lengths, consistency scores)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Zero-shot vs. few-shot: Zero-shot avoids exemplar bias but may reduce consistency in output format (majority of LLMs required post-processing).
  - Single-chain vs. multi-chain generation: Allowing N chains per CE pair increases coverage but correlates with shorter average chain length (r = -.11 to -.42).
  - Domain-agnostic prompt: Improves transferability but may underperform on domains with highly implicit or contested causality.

- Failure signatures:
  - Prompt formatting failures: LLMs ignored `<chain>` and `<step>` tokens, requiring post-processing.
  - Directionality failures: ~50% of reversed CE pairs judged causal.
  - Position heuristic failures: Jaccard dissimilarity up to 0.51 when comparing active vs. passive prompts on reversed pairs.
  - Low human inter-annotator agreement: Fleiss' κ = .084 (integrity), κ = .035 (coherence), suggesting task difficulty.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline chain generation on PolarIs4CAUS subset (18 CE pairs) with o1; verify parsing and chain counts match reported statistics.
  2. Run λ_A1 and λ_A2 evaluations on generated intermediate CE pairs; compute self-consistency rates and directionality failure proportions.
  3. Introduce active/passive prompt variants (λ_{A1-P}, λ_{A2-P}) on a held-out subset; measure Jaccard dissimilarity and Hamming distance to quantify position heuristic susceptibility.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does LLM performance in implicit causal chain discovery vary across domains with different levels of causal contestability and mechanistic complexity compared to polarized climate discourse?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that while the evaluation design is domain-agnostic, the authors "expect different causal discovery behavior and quality across domains," particularly regarding knowledge coverage and conflicting associations in contested domains.
- Why unresolved: The current study is restricted to the climate change domain (PolarIs3CAUS and PolarIs4CAUS), limiting generalizability to fields with different causal structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating the same LLMs on causal chain discovery in domains with high consensus (e.g., physics) versus high contestability (e.g., economics).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improve the validity of implicit causal chains without suffering from alignment mismatches in the linguistic formulation of cause-effect pairs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion identifies RAG as a "promising follow-up baseline" but suggests it "may struggle to retrieve, align, and evaluate causal relations effectively due to subtle mismatches in the linguistic formulation of CE pairs."
- Why unresolved: The study deliberately excluded external resources to assess parametric knowledge, leaving the utility of RAG for this specific task untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the factual accuracy and logical coherence of chains generated via RAG versus the zero-shot parametric baseline introduced in the paper.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can evaluation metrics for causal chains be refined to account for non-linear causal properties such as threshold effects, scene drift, and transitive inference?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section 4.2.1, the authors note that assessing chain integrity based solely on the validity of intermediate pairs "does not fully account for certain complexities specific to causal chains, such as transitive inference, scene drift, and threshold effects."
- Why unresolved: Current binary metrics (valid/invalid) based on independent link verification fail to capture the nuance of cumulative or non-linear causal mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of a new evaluation schema that successfully differentiates between simple linear chains and chains containing critical thresholds (e.g., cold → stroke) or context shifts.

## Limitations

- The study's findings are constrained by the zero-shot prompting approach, which limits control over chain diversity and length
- Human evaluation reliability is questionable given low inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' κ = .084 for integrity, κ = .035 for coherence)
- Position heuristic vulnerability reveals that LLMs rely heavily on surface-level patterns rather than genuine causal inference
- The correlational nature of self-consistency metrics prevents definitive conclusions about whether LLMs truly understand causality versus pattern-matching

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: LLMs can generate intermediate causal steps from given cause-effect pairs using zero-shot prompting; LLMs show high self-consistency rates when evaluating their own generated causal links
- **Medium confidence**: LLMs are vulnerable to position heuristics when linguistic framing changes; human evaluations confirm logical coherence of generated chains
- **Low confidence**: Generated chains represent genuine causal understanding versus associative pattern completion; quantitative comparisons between LLMs are robust given the variability in output formats

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain transferability test**: Apply the zero-shot prompting method to CE pairs from non-climate domains (e.g., economic or medical discourse) to validate whether the approach generalizes beyond the training distribution of climate-related text.

2. **Controlled position heuristic experiment**: Systematically vary the position of cause-effect pairs in prompts (beginning vs. middle vs. end of input) while keeping semantic content constant, then measure changes in consistency scores to quantify position bias magnitude.

3. **Counterfactual intervention test**: Generate chains for valid CE pairs, then introduce controlled perturbations to intermediate events and measure whether LLMs can identify the disruption in causal flow, distinguishing between associative completion and mechanistic understanding.
