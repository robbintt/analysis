# A Modal Logic for Temporal and Jurisdictional Classifier Models

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13691

- One-line primary result: Modal logic framework for ML classifier verification in legal decision-making with conflict resolution

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a modal logic framework for modeling and verifying machine learning classifiers in legal decision-making contexts. The Temporal and Jurisdictional Classifier Logic (TJCL) extends binary classifier logic with temporal ordering, jurisdictional hierarchy, and exception handling to resolve conflicts between legal precedents. The framework models potentially binding precedents and two types of exceptions: cases decided per incuriam (against binding precedent without authority) and overruled cases. A temporal hierarchical principle resolves conflicts by selecting the most recent decision from the highest court.

## Method Summary
The method extends Binary Classifier Logic (BCL) with temporal modality [≤T] (S4), hierarchical atoms H(ci, cj), binding atoms B(ci, cj), and relevance modality R∀. The framework introduces an s-graph construction to recursively detect per incuriam and overruled cases, then applies a Temporal Hierarchical Principle to resolve conflicts by selecting the most recent decision from the highest court. The logic enables formal verification of ML classifier outcomes against precedential constraints in common law systems through a complete axiomatization with soundness and completeness proofs.

## Key Results
- Temporal Hierarchical Principle correctly resolves conflicts by selecting most recent decision from highest court
- Recursive s-graph computation accurately identifies per incuriam cases through binding relationship chains
- TJCL axiomatization is sound and complete for TJCM models
- Framework handles both overruled cases and per incuriam decisions in precedential reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Conflicting precedents can be resolved by selecting the most recent decision from the highest court.
- **Mechanism:** The Temporal Hierarchical Principle computes BestT H(β s) — the set of binding precedents that are hierarchically superior and temporally superior. When multiple binding precedents exist with opposite outcomes, this principle forces a unique decision by prioritizing hierarchical rank over temporal order, and within the same court, recency.
- **Core assumption:** The relevance relation R correctly captures factual applicability between cases; the paper intentionally leaves R unconstrained to accommodate different CBR approaches.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "A temporal hierarchical principle resolves conflicts by selecting the most recent decision from the highest court." [Section 5, Definition 23]: BestT H(β s) = {s' ∈ β s | ∀s″ ∈ β s: s' ⊀ s″ and not (s' ∼= s″ and s' <T s″)}

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Cases decided per incuriam (against binding precedent without authority) are identified through recursive graph traversal over chains of binding relationships.
- **Mechanism:** The s-graph is constructed by recursively adding potentially binding and potentially overruling states. The Incuriam predicate evaluates whether a case went against a binding precedent that was not itself per incuriam or overruled prior to that case. This chain-like evaluation propagates through the graph.
- **Core assumption:** Per incuriam status is inferred from the model rather than given; requires complete information about temporal ordering and jurisdictional relationships.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 4.2]: "The model does not specify which cases are per incuriam or overruled. Rather, this information is computed through a recursive process." [Definition 17]: Recursive conditions involving Against(s, s'), OverruleT(s', s), and Incuriam(s') ⇒ s ≺ s'

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Modal logic operators can express binding precedent relationships without explicitly enumerating case pairs.
- **Mechanism:** The logic extends BCL with temporal modality [≤T] (S4), hierarchical atoms H(ci, cj), binding atoms B(ci, cj), and relevance modality R∀. Hybrid-style naming (@n) enables state-specific binding computations. The formula Binding nϕ captures: PBinding conditions AND ¬Overruled AND ¬(Incuriam ∧ SameCourt).
- **Core assumption:** The axiomatization (TJCL+) is sound and complete for TJCM models; Hilbert-style proofs can verify properties without model enumeration.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 3.3]: Definition 5 provides full axiomatization including K[≤T], T[≤T], 4[≤T], Total[≤T], and MIX operators. [Proposition 3]: "TJCL is sound and complete with respect to TJCM."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Binary Classifier Logic (BCL)**
  - **Why needed here:** TJCL extends BCL; understanding the base framework (states as fact sets, classification function f: S → {0,1,?}) is prerequisite.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how a classifier model represents a legal case as a state s ∈ 2^Atm0 with a decision value?

- **Concept: Modal Logic S4 and Hybrid Logic**
  - **Why needed here:** The temporal operator [≤T] is S4 (reflexive, transitive); hybrid-style naming @n enables state identification without full hybrid logic machinery.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the difference between the S4 axiom [≤T]ϕ → [≤T][≤T]ϕ and the B axiom 2ϕ → ⋄ϕ?

- **Concept: Horty's Result Model and a fortiori Reasoning**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper positions itself relative to Horty's precedent models; understanding a fortiori constraint (weaker facts → same outcome) clarifies what "relevance" means in legal CBR.
  - **Quick check question:** If Case 1 {reverse, disclosed, measure} was decided for plaintiff, should Case 2 {reverse, measure} also be decided for plaintiff under a fortiori reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Atm0 = Facts ∪ Names ∪ Courts → TJCM: (S, f, Jur, ≤T, R) → s-graph construction → Incuriam/Overruled detection → β s (binding set) → BestT H selection → f*(s*) output
- **Critical path:** Given new case s*, compute R(s*) → filter by <T and B → compute exceptions via graph traversal → apply Temporal Hierarchical Principle → output forced or indeterminate decision.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Leaving R unconstrained: maximizes flexibility but delegates factual relevance modeling to external systems
  - Finite Names d assumption: guarantees termination but limits scalability to large case databases
  - Total preorder ≤T: allows simultaneous cases but requires temporal granularity decisions (same day? same week?)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - f*(s*) = {0, 1} indicates unresolvable conflict between equally-ranked binding precedents
  - Empty β s indicates no binding precedents exist (all potential bindings are per incuriam or overruled)
  - Incomplete Incuriam computation suggests missing temporal or jurisdictional data
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement TJCM for a small case base (10-20 cases) with known per incuriam and overruled instances; verify Incuriam(s) matches manual legal analysis.
  2. Compare TJCL conflict resolution against Horty's result model on inconsistent case bases; measure how often TJCL produces forced decisions vs. indeterminate outcomes.
  3. Test scalability: measure s-graph construction time as |Names d| increases; identify bottlenecks in recursive Incuriam computation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the logic be extended to model context-dependent binding relations, such as partial Supreme Court panels, rather than strictly binary ones?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in Section 6 that "the notion of binding is 'binary'" but note that in practice (e.g., UK Supreme Court), binding authority may depend on the context (e.g., whether the court sits in a partial panel).
- **Why unresolved:** The current axiomatization and semantics (specifically the B relation) are static and do not capture conditional or context-sensitive binding authority within the same court entity.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An extension of the TJCL semantics defining B as a dynamic or conditional operator dependent on state attributes, along with updated completeness proofs.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the specific algorithms and computational complexity for verifying ML classifier outputs against the TJCL formalization?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 1 describes the framework as "theoretical," intended to serve as a basis for "future applications such as verification algorithms," which are not developed in the text.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper provides the formal logic (semantics and axioms) but does not implement the actual verification tool or analyze the computational resources required to check if a classifier's prediction satisfies the precedential constraints.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A concrete algorithm that takes a classifier model and a TJCL specification as input and determines satisfiability, accompanied by a complexity analysis (e.g., decidability, PSPACE, EXPTIME).

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does constraining the generic relevance relation R with specific properties (e.g., transitivity from the Result Model) affect the logic's ability to resolve conflicts or the validity of the Temporal Hierarchical Principle?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6 notes that "The relevance relation merits further attention" and that the authors "imposed no properties on the relevance relation" to maintain flexibility.
- **Why unresolved:** While the flexibility allows for various CBR models, it is unclear if adding necessary constraints (like those in Horty's models) preserves the logic's conflict-resolution capabilities or creates paradoxes.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A theoretical analysis or proof demonstrating the consistency and applicability of the Temporal Hierarchical Principle when R is instantiated with specific properties like transitivity or reflexivity.

## Limitations

- Assumes complete knowledge of case temporal ordering and jurisdictional relationships that may be unavailable in real legal databases
- Leaves the relevance relation R unconstrained, requiring external systems to define factual applicability between cases
- Model assumes finite set of decided cases (Names d), limiting scalability to large case corpora
- Only handles binary classification (0/1 outcomes), potentially oversimplifying complex legal decisions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Axiomatization is sound and complete (Proposition 3), and Temporal Hierarchical Principle correctly resolves conflicts when a unique best binding precedent exists
- **Medium Confidence:** Recursive computation of per incuriam status is formally correct but relies on complete temporal and jurisdictional data that may be unavailable in practice
- **Medium Confidence:** Logic framework is theoretically sound but lacks empirical validation against real legal case outcomes or comparison with existing precedent-based reasoning systems

## Next Checks

1. Implement the TJCM framework for a real legal case database (e.g., UK court decisions) and validate whether the computed binding precedents match expert legal analysis.
2. Test the framework's performance on cases where temporal ordering is ambiguous or where hierarchical relationships are disputed to assess robustness under data uncertainty.
3. Compare the TJCL conflict resolution outcomes against Horty's result model on inconsistent case bases to measure differences in forced vs. indeterminate decisions.
