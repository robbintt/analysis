# Beyond the Sentence: A Survey on Context-Aware Machine Translation with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.07583
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07583
- **Reference count:** 27
- **Key outcome:** The survey systematically reviews context-aware MT using LLMs, finding commercial models outperform open-source in prompting, while fine-tuning enables open-source to match commercial quality.

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively examines recent advances in context-aware machine translation (MT) using large language models (LLMs). The authors identify two primary approaches: prompting-based methods (zero-shot and few-shot learning) and fine-tuning-based approaches, along with applications in automatic post-editing and agentic frameworks. Commercial LLMs like ChatGPT and Tower LLM generally outperform open-source models in prompt-based settings, while fine-tuned open-source models achieve comparable performance to commercial ones. Fine-tuning consistently improves translation quality over prompting alone. The survey highlights key challenges such as context utilization and the need for robust evaluation metrics tailored to document-level translation.

## Method Summary
The survey analyzes context-aware MT approaches by categorizing them into prompting-based (zero-shot and few-shot learning with document-relevant examples) and fine-tuning-based methods. For prompting, the approach uses in-context learning with context-aware examples, where document-relevant examples improve coherence over random examples. For fine-tuning, the method employs parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA and QLoRA on document-level parallel corpora, with optimal document lengths around 10 sentences. The survey also examines agentic frameworks and automatic post-editing applications. Evaluation considers both traditional metrics (BLEU, COMET) and context-aware metrics focusing on discourse phenomena like pronoun resolution and lexical consistency.

## Key Results
- Commercial LLMs (ChatGPT, Tower LLM) generally outperform open-source models (Llama, Bloom) in prompt-based settings
- Fine-tuned open-source models achieve comparable performance to commercial LLMs
- Fine-tuning consistently improves translation quality over prompting alone
- Context window size significantly impacts performance, with optimal lengths varying by domain (10 sentences or 2048 tokens)
- Existing evaluation metrics inadequately capture context utilization, as models show robustness to random context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: In-context learning (ICL) with document-relevant examples improves translation coherence over zero-shot prompting, provided examples are contextually related to the source.
- Mechanism: LLMs leverage demonstration examples to infer translation patterns and discourse constraints without weight updates. The attention mechanism allows the model to reference contextual patterns from examples when generating target sequences.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained LLM has sufficient multilingual capacity and attention bandwidth to simultaneously process example pairs and the current source sentence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "prompt-based approaches serve as good baselines to assess the quality of translations"
  - [section 2] Sia and Duh (2023) found "previous 5-sentence context achieves the best results compared to random selection" and "selecting examples randomly from the same document performs better than selecting examples randomly from outside the document"
  - [corpus] Related work (arXiv:2506.04929) confirms context-aware approaches improve handling of word ambiguity and discourse phenomena
- Break condition: Random or unrelated examples degrade to near zero-shot performance; static context (first N sentences) performs worse than dynamic selection.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning with document-level parallel corpora yields performance gains over prompting alone, with open-source models approaching commercial LLM quality.
- Mechanism: Parameter updates via supervised fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA, or full fine-tuning) adapt the model's internal representations to the distributional properties of document-level translation, improving discourse phenomena handling (pronouns, ellipsis, lexical cohesion).
- Core assumption: Sufficient document-level parallel data exists for the target language pair, and the fine-tuning procedure preserves multilingual capabilities while adapting to the translation task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "fine-tuning consistently improves translation quality over prompting alone" and "fine-tuned open-source models achieve comparable performance to commercial ones"
  - [section 3] Zhang et al. (2023c) "fine-tuning consistently achieves better results than prompt-based approaches" with optimal document length of 10 sentences
  - [corpus] arXiv:2504.01919 survey confirms instruction-following and preference-based alignment reshape MT paradigm
- Break condition: Fine-tuning on sentence-level data alone cannot generalize to documents >512 tokens (Li et al., 2024); requires translation-mixed instructions with varying lengths.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-phase encoding with separate treatment of context vs. source sentences improves context utilization over naive concatenation.
- Mechanism: Architectures like DeMPT (Lyu et al., 2024b) encode context and source in distinct phases before combining activations for prediction, allowing differential weighting and preventing source information from being dominated by context.
- Core assumption: The model architecture permits multi-phase processing with intermediate activations that can be combined during decoding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] Lyu et al. (2024b) proposed "Decoding-enhanced Multi Prompt Tuning which enables the LLMs to discriminate the context and the source sentences" with three encoding steps
  - [section 4] Mohammed and Niculae (2024) found "all models are robust to random context (with respect to automatic metrics), which shows the lack of proper context utilization"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence for this specific mechanism; related work focuses on evaluation challenges
- Break condition: Requires explicit fine-tuning; ICL alone shows insufficient context sensitivity (perturbation analysis reveals models often ignore incorrect context).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Document-level vs. sentence-level MT**
  - Why needed here: Context-aware translation addresses discourse phenomena (pronouns, ellipsis, lexical cohesion) that sentence-level models miss. The survey explicitly contrasts these paradigms throughout.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why translating "She left" without context might fail to select the correct pronoun in a gendered target language?

- Concept: **In-context learning (ICL)**
  - Why needed here: Primary inference-time technique for LLM-based translation; understanding how example selection affects output quality is essential for system design.
  - Quick check question: Given a 10-sentence document, which would likely perform better: 5 random examples from unrelated documents, or 5 previous sentences from the same document?

- Concept: **Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA)**
  - Why needed here: The survey shows LoRA outperforms full fine-tuning in bilingual scenarios while requiring less data; essential for practical deployment decisions.
  - Quick check question: Why might LoRA require ~10% of training data to match full fine-tuning's performance with only 1% of data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input layer: Concatenated context + source (with optional segmentation markers)
  - Encoding phase(s): Single-pass (concatenation) or multi-phase (DeMPT-style separate encoding)
  - Attention mechanism: Must handle extended sequences (512-4096+ tokens)
  - Decoding: Standard autoregressive or enhanced with MBR/quality-aware reranking
  - Memory components (agentic): Proper noun records, bilingual summary, short/long-term memory

- Critical path:
  1. Select or construct document-level parallel corpus
  2. Choose prompting strategy (ZSP baseline → ICL with context-aware example selection)
  3. If insufficient: fine-tune with translation-mixed instructions (varying lengths: 512, 1024, 1536, 2048)
  4. Evaluate with context-aware metrics (not just BLEU/ChrF)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Commercial vs. open-source: Commercial (GPT-4) best for prompting; fine-tuned open-source (Llama-2) approaches parity
  - LoRA vs. full fine-tuning: LoRA better for bilingual; FFT better for multilingual scenarios
  - Context window: Larger isn't always better—Wang et al. (2024a) found 2048 tokens outperformed 4096
  - Single-turn vs. multi-turn: Multi-turn translation avoids omission errors in long documents

- Failure signatures:
  - High BLEU but poor discourse accuracy → existing metrics miss context failures
  - Random context performs same as gold context → model not utilizing context (Mohammed & Niculae, 2024)
  - Omission errors in long documents → single-turn translation failing; switch to multi-turn or sentence-by-sentence
  - Inconsistent proper noun translations → missing memory/agentic component

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Establish ZSP baseline on document-level test set, then compare with ICL using 5 previous-sentence context examples (replicate Sia & Duh 2023 methodology)
  2. Fine-tune open-source model (Llama-2 or Llama-3) with QLoRA on document-level corpus, comparing 512 vs. 1024 token context windows
  3. Evaluate both prompting and fine-tuned outputs using context-aware evaluation (LLM-as-judge with fluency, content errors, lexical cohesion, grammatical cohesion metrics per Sun et al. 2025)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can context-aware machine translation be effectively adapted for low-resource language pairs where document-level parallel corpora are unavailable?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 identifies "Context-aware translation for low-resourced languages" as a key future direction, noting the scarcity of parallel data compared to monolingual data.
- Why unresolved: Most current approaches rely on fine-tuning with parallel document-level data, which does not exist for many language pairs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful translation systems for low-resource pairs built using prompting or automatic post-editing (APE) leveraged solely from monolingual document-level data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can robust, interpretable, and context-aware evaluation metrics be developed to assess discourse phenomena like lexical and grammatical cohesion?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 proposes "Context-aware evaluation" as a future direction, while Section 4 notes that standard metrics like BLEU are "ill-suited" for evaluating context-aware translation.
- Why unresolved: Existing automatic metrics often fail to penalize inconsistencies or capture document-level fluency, leading to scores that diverge from human judgment.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new evaluation framework that utilizes LLMs with minimal supervision to accurately score coherence and cohesion, validating against human annotations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can translation agents be architected to manage specific discourse aspects such as lexical consistency and context tracking in long documents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 suggests "Translation agents" as a promising direction where different agents handle specific aspects (e.g., fluency, consistency) rather than a monolithic model.
- Why unresolved: While initial agentic frameworks exist, it is unclear how to optimally decompose the translation task into agent roles to prevent omission errors in long texts.
- What evidence would resolve it: A multi-agent system demonstrating superior performance over single-pass LLMs on long-text literary translation benchmarks via specialized memory components.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Why do LLMs exhibit robustness to random or perturbed context during context-aware translation, and how can context utilization be enforced?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4 discusses analysis (Mohammed and Niculae, 2024) showing models are robust to random context, indicating a "lack of proper context utilization."
- Why unresolved: It remains unclear if models are ignoring the provided context or if the mechanisms for integrating discourse history are insufficient during standard fine-tuning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Perturbation analysis demonstrating that models fine-tuned with specific context-aware objectives show significant performance degradation when gold context is swapped for random context.

## Limitations
- Evaluation inadequacy: Existing metrics (BLEU, COMET) fail to capture context utilization, with models showing robustness to random context
- Reproducibility barrier: Commercial LLM prompt templates and parameters remain proprietary, limiting replication
- Data scarcity: Fine-tuning performance depends heavily on corpus availability, creating barriers for low-resource languages
- Context window ambiguity: Optimal context window size varies significantly across domains without clear guidelines

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Commercial LLMs outperform open-source models in prompting-based settings (Zhang et al., 2023c; Wu et al., 2024)
- **High confidence**: Fine-tuning consistently improves translation quality over prompting alone (Zhang et al., 2023c; Lyu et al., 2024b)
- **Medium confidence**: Fine-tuned open-source models approach commercial LLM quality, dependent on fine-tuning strategy and dataset
- **Low confidence**: Recommendations for context window sizes and multi-phase encoding architectures based on limited evidence

## Next Checks

1. **Context Utilization Benchmark**: Replicate the perturbation analysis from Mohammed & Niculae (2024) to test whether your model genuinely utilizes context. Create test sets with correct vs. random context and measure performance degradation. If performance remains stable, your model likely ignores context despite high BLEU scores.

2. **Fine-tuning Strategy Comparison**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing LoRA vs. full fine-tuning on the same dataset, varying context window sizes (512, 1024, 2048 tokens) and instruction mixing strategies. Measure not just BLEU but also discourse phenomena accuracy (pronoun resolution, lexical consistency) to validate claims about optimal training configurations.

3. **Evaluation Framework Stress Test**: Implement the context-aware evaluation framework from Sun et al. (2025) and apply it to both prompting and fine-tuned outputs. Compare results against standard BLEU/COMET to identify cases where traditional metrics overestimate performance. This will validate the survey's central concern about evaluation inadequacy.
