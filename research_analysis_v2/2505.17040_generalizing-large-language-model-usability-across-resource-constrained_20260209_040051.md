## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.17040
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17040
- Authors: Yun-Da Tsai
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Demonstrates that strategic data design, inference-time reasoning, and symbolic task decomposition enable effective LLM deployment under resource constraints without large-scale retraining.

## Executive Summary
This dissertation addresses the challenge of generalizing large language models (LLMs) under resource constraints, including limited data, compute, and modality variations. The core approach involves developing text-centric multimodal alignment frameworks that enable LLMs to handle missing, noisy, or dynamically changing modalities via in-context learning, without requiring retraining. Inference-time optimization techniques such as adversarial prompting and uncertainty calibration are introduced to improve model robustness. For low-resource domains like Verilog code generation, correct-by-construction synthetic data pipelines and targeted code repair strategies are designed, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal data. Additionally, reinforcement learning methods are adapted for RTL structured logic reasoning, significantly enhancing functional correctness. Across all domains, the results demonstrate that strategic data design, inference-time reasoning, and symbolic task decomposition provide effective alternatives to large-scale retraining, enabling more adaptable and resource-efficient LLM deployment.

## Method Summary
The approach combines text-centric multimodal alignment with correct-by-construction synthetic data generation. For multimodal tasks, raw inputs undergo modality-to-text conversion via specialized captioners/summarizers, followed by text-style normalization, multimodal summarization, and reasoning augmentation. For Verilog code generation, correct-by-construction data is generated through formal methods (Karnaugh maps, FSMs, waveforms), combined with targeted repair data created by analyzing model errors. The combined dataset (SDG+CC+Repair) is used to fine-tune base code LLMs. Inference-time optimization includes adversarial prompting for robustness and uncertainty calibration for correctness.

## Key Results
- TAMML achieves 21% accuracy improvement over baselines on PetFinder and 54% MSE reduction on Airbnb under modality mismatch
- Adversarial prompting achieves 94.5% accuracy retention vs 70.4% for robust training under dynamic modality changes
- SDG-CC-Repair achieves 68.0% pass@1 on VerilogEval-Human, surpassing prior SOTA by 10.9%
- Models achieve near-perfect scores on KMap/FSM problems with as few as 4k training samples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Text-Centric Multimodal Alignment
- Claim: Converting all modalities to natural language enables LLMs to handle arbitrary modality combinations without retraining.
- Mechanism: Each modality undergoes transformation via specialized captioners/summarizers into text descriptions, unified through multimodal summarization, and processed by a frozen language model. Text-style translation aligns linguistic style across modalities, and reasoning augmentation adds chain-of-thought traces.
- Core assumption: Natural language provides a sufficiently expressive common representation that preserves semantic information across modalities, and LLMs' in-context learning can adapt to new modality combinations.
- Evidence anchors: Table 3.2 shows TAMML achieving 21% accuracy improvement over baselines on PetFinder, 54% MSE reduction on Airbnb under modality mismatch.

### Mechanism 2: Adversarial Prompting for Robustness
- Claim: LLM-guided perturbations at the prompt level improve model robustness against noisy/missing modalities more effectively than traditional noise injection.
- Mechanism: The system prompts an LLM to generate adversarial examples that semantically shift inputs toward incorrect labels, including noise injection, information dropout, and permutation strategies operating in natural language space.
- Core assumption: Semantically challenging perturbations in language space create more effective stress-tests than pixel-level or embedding-level noise, and robustness gained transfers to real-world corruption patterns.
- Evidence anchors: Table 3.9 shows adversarial prompting achieving 94.5% accuracy retention vs 70.4% for robust training under dynamic modality changes on PetFinder.

### Mechanism 3: Correct-by-Construction Synthetic Data Generation
- Claim: Mathematically guaranteeing correctness during synthetic data creation enables effective fine-tuning even with minimal data quantities.
- Mechanism: For non-textual representations, the system constructs problems and solutions through formal methods—sampling valid configurations, deriving solutions algorithmically, and ensuring mathematical consistency.
- Core assumption: The formal generation process covers the distribution of real problems adequately, and models trained on this data generalize to human-authored problems of the same type.
- Evidence anchors: Figure 5.8 shows models achieving near-perfect scores on KMap/FSM problems with as few as 4k training samples.

## Foundational Learning

- **In-Context Learning**: LLMs can adapt to new tasks through prompt demonstrations without weight updates
  - Why needed here: The entire text-centric alignment approach depends on LLMs generalizing to unseen modality combinations through prompting alone
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why in-context learning enables zero-shot modality adaptation but fine-tuning on a fixed modality set would fail?

- **Modality Gap**: Different modality encoders create distinct embedding spaces that don't naturally align
  - Why needed here: Understanding why text-centric alignment outperforms embedding-based approaches requires grasping that raw embeddings cluster separately by modality
  - Quick check question: Why does reducing inter-modality Euclidean distance in semantic space correlate with improved cross-modal transfer?

- **Uncertainty Decomposition**: Distinguishing between aleatoric (inherent data ambiguity) and epistemic (model ignorance) uncertainty
  - Why needed here: Chapter 4's analysis shows existing uncertainty metrics capture answer diversity (aleatoric) rather than correctness uncertainty (epistemic), which is critical for optimization tasks
  - Quick check question: Why would a metric that measures output diversity fail to guide prompt optimization for correctness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Modality Transformers (BLIP-2, Whisper) → Text-style Translator (LLM) → Multimodal Summarizer (LLM) → Reasoning Augmenter (LLM) → Downstream Task Head (MLP/transformer)

- **Critical path**: Raw multimodal input → modality-to-text conversion → text descriptions → summarization → reasoning augmentation → task prediction

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Latency vs. robustness: Each alignment stage adds 0.35-0.52s latency, 3.21× token expansion
  - Flexibility vs. peak performance: Text-centric achieves 0.355 accuracy vs 0.382 for fine-tuned LanguageBind on PetFinder, but requires zero retraining for new modalities
  - Data quantity vs. quality: 1.4k carefully filtered repair samples match performance of 7.8k unfiltered samples

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High variance in pass rates across training checkpoints indicates data quality issues
  - Poor performance on non-textual representations signals need for correct-by-construction data
  - Uncertainty metrics correlating with diversity but not correctness indicates unsuitable metric choice

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Establish baseline by testing text-centric pipeline with single modality inputs, then progressively add/remove modalities to measure robustness degradation curves
  2. Ablate each pipeline component (transformation, translation, summarization, reasoning) to quantify individual contributions on a held-out modality combination
  3. Generate a small correct-by-construction dataset (500 samples) for a specific non-textual representation type and measure few-shot learning improvement versus LLM-generated synthetic data of the same size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Adaptive Inference Strategies**: How can adaptive inference strategies dynamically adjust computational effort based on task difficulty or input uncertainty to further optimize the efficiency-robustness trade-off in real-time systems?
  - Basis: Conclusion explicitly identifies this as a critical future direction
  - Why unresolved: Current inference-time optimization techniques introduce fixed latency overhead without dynamic scaling mechanisms
  - What evidence would resolve it: A dynamic compute allocation framework maintaining performance while reducing average latency on latency-sensitive benchmarks

- **Formal Verification in RL**: Can integrating lightweight formal verification feedback into reinforcement learning reward design improve RTL functional guarantees without requiring exhaustive simulation?
  - Basis: Section 7.4 states this holds promise for driving models toward stronger functional guarantees
  - Why unresolved: Current RL methods rely on sparse rewards that struggle to verify nuanced hardware properties
  - What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrated improvements using models trained with reward signals derived from formal verification properties

- **Open-World Modality Distributions**: How can text-centric multimodal alignment be extended to effectively handle open-world and long-tailed modality distributions where inputs may be noisy, ambiguous, or sparsely labeled?
  - Basis: Dissertation concludes this remains a critical frontier for true multimodal reasoning
  - Why unresolved: Current framework validated primarily on structured tasks; generalization to complex generation settings remains open
  - What evidence would resolve it: Successful performance maintenance on diverse, noisy, or rare modality benchmarks compared to standard datasets

## Limitations
- Text-centric alignment may fail for highly structured visual or temporal data where spatial/temporal relationships are critical
- Adversarial prompting effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of the LLM generating perturbations, introducing model-specific dependencies
- Correct-by-construction synthetic data assumes formal generation adequately captures real-world hardware design complexity, which may not hold for all edge cases

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Empirical results showing performance improvements across multiple benchmarks are well-supported by specific metrics and comparisons to baselines
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about eliminating need for modality-specific fine-tuning assume perfect information preservation during transformation, which evidence doesn't fully verify
- **Low confidence**: Assertion that uncertainty calibration directly correlates with functional correctness improvement in optimization tasks is based on limited experiments and may not generalize

## Next Checks
1. **Modality preservation test**: Generate synthetic data for a domain with known spatial/temporal relationships and measure information loss during text conversion using human evaluation or downstream task performance

2. **Cross-LLM adversarial robustness**: Repeat adversarial prompting experiments using different LLM architectures to verify robustness gains are not specific to a particular model's capabilities

3. **Long-tail generalization test**: Create a benchmark of rare but critical edge cases in hardware design and measure whether models trained on correct-by-construction data can handle these scenarios without catastrophic failure
