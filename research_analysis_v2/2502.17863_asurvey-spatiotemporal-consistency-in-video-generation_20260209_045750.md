# ASurvey: Spatiotemporal Consistency in Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.17863
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17863
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** Systematic review of video generation methods focusing on spatiotemporal consistency across foundation models, information representations, generation schemes, post-processing, and evaluation metrics.

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively reviews recent advances in video generation with a focus on maintaining spatiotemporal consistency. The authors analyze five key aspects: foundation models (GAN, autoregressive, diffusion, mask models), information representations (spatiotemporal convolution, patches, self-attention, VAE, visual encoders), generation schemes (decoupled, hierarchical, multi-stage, latent model), post-processing techniques (frame interpolation, super-resolution, stabilization, deblurring, stylization, relighting), and evaluation metrics. The review highlights how these components contribute to spatial and temporal coherence in generated videos, discussing both current achievements and future challenges like long video generation, personalization, and emotion expression.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically categorizes video generation approaches based on their core mechanisms and components. It examines how different foundation models handle spatiotemporal dependencies, how information is represented and processed (through convolutions, attention, or latent spaces), and how generation schemes structure the temporal flow. The authors analyze post-processing techniques that enhance consistency and discuss the limitations of current evaluation metrics. The framework provides a comprehensive reference for understanding the trade-offs between different approaches to maintaining spatiotemporal coherence.

## Key Results
- Autoregressive models ensure temporal coherence by conditioning each frame on preceding frames through explicit probability modeling
- Latent space compression via VAE/VQ-VAE enables efficient consistency modeling while preserving semantic structure
- Hierarchical generation with global-to-local decomposition isolates consistency enforcement at different temporal scales
- Current evaluation metrics are insufficient for assessing temporal consistency and dynamic content
- Major challenges include long video generation, personalization, and emotion expression

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Autoregressive conditional modeling preserves temporal coherence by forcing each frame to be generated conditioned on preceding frames.
- **Mechanism:** The model learns p(xᵢ|x₀, x₁, ..., xᵢ₋₁; θ), meaning the current frame's probability distribution is explicitly dependent on all prior frames. This creates a causal chain where temporal inconsistencies propagate as prediction errors, which the model minimizes via negative log-likelihood training.
- **Core assumption:** The Markov-like dependency assumption holds that the immediate visual history contains sufficient information to predict the next frame without requiring explicit long-term memory mechanisms.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 2.2]: "The autoregressive model ensures that generating each frame with high quality, while also captures the dependencies between frames, thus maintaining the spatiotemporal consistency."
  - [corpus]: "Controllable Video Generation with Provable Disentanglement" notes existing methods "neglect intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships" when treating video as a whole—autoregressive approaches address this by construction.
- **Break condition:** Fails when long-range dependencies (>~50-100 frames) become critical, as error compounds and early-frame inconsistencies cannot be corrected retroactively.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Latent space compression reduces redundancy while preserving spatiotemporal structure, enabling more efficient consistency modeling.
- **Mechanism:** VAE/VQ-VAE encoders map raw pixel sequences to compact latent representations. The encoder learns to discard intra-frame redundancy (spatial) and inter-frame redundancy (temporal) while retaining semantically meaningful features. Denoising/diffusion then operates in this compressed space where temporal relationships are more explicit.
- **Core assumption:** The compressed latent space maintains sufficient geometric and motion information to reconstruct temporally coherent video—a "lossy but semantically faithful" assumption.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.4]: "The video is first transformed into a low-dimensional latent space and then decomposed into a series of spatiotemporal patches. Using such latent patches helps the model better accommodate the diversity of inputs."
  - [section 4.4]: "Latent models are better at maintaining the spatiotemporal consistency of videos, especially in tasks involving long videos and complex scenes."
  - [corpus]: Weak direct validation; corpus papers focus on generation quality metrics rather than latent space analysis.
- **Break condition:** Over-compression (too small latent dimensions) destroys fine-grained motion cues, leading to "blobby" or morphing artifacts.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Hierarchical generation with global-to-local decomposition isolates consistency enforcement at different temporal scales.
- **Mechanism:** A global model generates sparse keyframes establishing overall scene structure and motion trajectory. Local models then fill intermediate frames conditioned on these anchor points. This decouples long-horizon planning (story/coherence) from short-term dynamics (detailed motion).
- **Core assumption:** Keyframe consistency is both necessary and sufficient for overall video coherence—local imperfections are perceptually tolerable if global structure holds.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.2]: "The global diffusion model is first used to generate key frames, and then local diffusion is applied iteratively to complete intermediate frames, allowing the video length to increase exponentially."
  - [section 4.2]: "Hierarchical strategy...ensuring global consistency" by "propagat[ing] context information from low-scale to high-scale patches."
  - [corpus]: "Learning World Models for Interactive Video Generation" identifies "compounding errors and insufficient memory mechanisms" as challenges in long video generation—hierarchical approaches mitigate compounding by resetting at each keyframe.
- **Break condition:** Global keyframe errors propagate to all interpolated frames; no recovery mechanism exists for bad anchors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Self-Attention Variants (spatial vs. temporal vs. causal)**
  - **Why needed here:** The survey distinguishes four attention patterns—each serves a different consistency role. Spatial attention maintains intra-frame coherence; temporal attention tracks cross-frame correspondence; causal attention prevents future leakage; spatiotemporal attention handles joint dependencies.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a video transformer, if you apply only spatial self-attention per frame with no cross-frame communication, what consistency failure would you expect?

- **Concept: VAE Latent Spaces and VQ-VAE Discretization**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding continuous vs. discrete latent representations is critical. VQ-VAE discretizes latents into codebook entries, which autoregressive/mask models require. Continuous VAE latents suit diffusion models.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a diffusion model prefer continuous VAE latents while an autoregressive transformer prefers VQ-VAE discrete codes?

- **Concept: Optical Flow as Implicit Motion Representation**
  - **Why needed here:** Frame interpolation and temporal super-resolution rely on motion estimation. The survey notes optical flow predicts pixel positions across frames—understanding this clarifies why flow-based interpolation works for smooth motions but fails on occlusions/disocclusions.
  - **Quick check question:** If optical flow between frames A and C is computed via A→B and B→C composition, what artifact might occur versus direct A→C estimation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input (text/image/video) -> Visual Encoder (CLIP/ViT) -> Latent Space (VAE encoder) -> Foundation Model (Diffusion/Autoregressive/GAN/Mask) -> Information Representation (3D CNN / Spatiotemporal Patches / Attention) -> Generation Scheme (Decoupled / Hierarchical / Multi-stage / Latent) -> Latent Decoder (VAE decoder) -> Post-processing (Interpolation / Super-res / Stabilization)

- **Critical path:** For diffusion-based T2V: Text -> CLIP text encoder -> Cross-attention conditioning -> Latent diffusion process (U-Net or DiT backbone with temporal attention) -> VAE decoder -> Optional cascade super-resolution

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Decoupled vs. End-to-end:** Decoupling content/motion improves controllability but risks misalignment at merge point; end-to-end learns joint representations but is harder to control.
  - **Hierarchical vs. Single-pass:** Hierarchical enables longer videos with global coherence but adds complexity and potential keyframe error propagation.
  - **Pixel-space vs. Latent-space:** Pixel-space preserves detail but is computationally prohibitive; latent-space is efficient but risks information loss.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Flickering/jitter:** Temporal attention not attending sufficiently to previous frames; discriminator not penalizing temporal inconsistency.
  - **Object morphing:** Content-motion decoupling failure; latent space over-compression.
  - **Motion stagnation:** Excessive temporal attention weight causing over-smoothing.
  - **Long-range inconsistency:** Autoregressive error accumulation; insufficient keyframe anchoring.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablate temporal attention window size:** Train identical diffusion models with varying temporal attention windows (1, 4, 8, 16 frames). Measure FVD and manual flicker assessment on held-out test videos. Hypothesis: Smaller windows train faster; larger windows improve consistency but hit memory limits.
  2. **Compare VAE vs. VQ-VAE latent spaces for same backbone:** Fix a diffusion architecture, train two versions—one with continuous VAE latents, one with VQ-VAE discretized latents. Evaluate reconstruction fidelity (PSNR/SSIM) and generation quality (FID/FVD). Hypothesis: VQ-VAE introduces quantization artifacts but may improve sample diversity.
  3. **Hierarchical keyframe density test:** Generate videos with keyframes at 1fps, 2fps, 4fps intervals, then interpolate. Measure interpolation error and perceptual consistency. Hypothesis: Denser keyframes improve quality but reduce length-scaling efficiency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the field establish a comprehensive evaluation framework that accurately assesses temporal consistency and dynamic content rather than relying on adapted image metrics?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7 states that current evaluation metrics are "mostly borrowed from the image field" and "overlook the temporal information," creating an urgent need for a "complete and comprehensive video evaluation system."
- **Why unresolved:** Existing metrics like FID or IS focus on spatial fidelity and frame quality, failing to quantify temporal coherence, motion smoothness, or dynamic narrative logic.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The development and adoption of a standardized metric that correlates strongly with human perception of temporal flow and consistency in video generation benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What architectural advancements are required to maintain spatiotemporal consistency in long video generation without incurring prohibitive computational costs?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7 highlights "Long Video Generation" as a major challenge, noting that increased length leads to "redundant and variable visual information" and "significant challenges in terms of both computational time and space consumption."
- **Why unresolved:** Current attention mechanisms often scale quadratically with sequence length, making high-resolution, long-duration generation computationally intractable while preserving consistency across all frames.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A model capable of generating coherent, long-duration videos (e.g., movie lengths) with linear or sub-quadratic complexity while maintaining consistent objects and scenes.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can video generation models effectively learn to convey complex human emotions and evoke audience resonance comparable to human-created content?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7 identifies "Video Emotion Expression" as a future direction, questioning whether generated videos can "truly convey human emotions" and if AIGC can "genuinely replace humans" in this expressive task.
- **Why unresolved:** Most current research focuses on physical consistency (shape, motion) rather than the semantic and psychological depth required to generate content that elicits specific emotional responses.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Quantitative studies demonstrating that viewers report statistically similar emotional intensities when watching AI-generated narrative videos versus human-produced ones.

## Limitations

- Claims about spatiotemporal consistency mechanisms lack rigorous quantitative validation and systematic ablation studies
- Evidence anchors rely heavily on self-referential statements with minimal external validation from broader literature
- Broad claims about approach superiority (e.g., hierarchical generation) lack systematic performance comparisons across multiple datasets
- Limited discussion of failure mode frequency and severity in practical applications

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The survey's categorization framework and coverage of existing methods are comprehensive and well-structured. The descriptions of different foundation models, information representations, and generation schemes accurately reflect the current state of the field.
- **Medium confidence:** The claims about how specific mechanisms contribute to spatiotemporal consistency are plausible and theoretically grounded, but lack robust empirical validation. The proposed failure conditions appear reasonable but are not systematically tested.
- **Low confidence:** Claims about relative performance between different approaches (e.g., VQ-VAE vs. VAE for consistency) are largely unsupported by comparative data in the survey.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled ablation experiments varying temporal attention window sizes in diffusion models to quantify the trade-off between computational efficiency and spatiotemporal consistency across multiple datasets.

2. Perform head-to-head comparisons of continuous VAE latents versus VQ-VAE discretized latents using identical backbone architectures, measuring both reconstruction fidelity and generation quality on standardized benchmarks.

3. Systematically evaluate hierarchical keyframe density effects by generating videos with varying keyframe intervals (1fps, 2fps, 4fps) and measuring interpolation error rates, temporal consistency metrics, and perceptual quality across different scene types.
