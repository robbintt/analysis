core_contribution: This study evaluates the practical viability of sentiment analysis
  for financial trading by comparing three models (two classification, one regression)
  applied to news articles on Dow Jones 30 stocks over 28 months. Using a backtesting
  framework that generates daily buy/sell signals based on sentiment scores, all models
  produced positive returns, with the regression model (RoBERTa+Transfs) achieving
  the highest cumulative return of 50.63%, outperforming the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy

# Backtesting Sentiment Signals for Trading: Evaluating the Viability of Alpha Generation from Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.03350
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03350
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Regression sentiment model achieved 50.63% cumulative return with 23.67% alpha vs. Buy&Hold benchmark

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates whether sentiment analysis from news articles can generate profitable trading signals for Dow Jones 30 stocks. Three models (FinBERT, DualGCN, RoBERTa+Transfs) were tested over 28 months using a backtesting framework that generates daily buy/sell signals. All models produced positive returns, with the regression approach (RoBERTa+Transfs) achieving the highest cumulative return of 50.63%, outperforming the Buy&Hold benchmark by 87.8%. The regression model also generated substantial alpha of 23.67% with lower risk metrics, demonstrating that continuous sentiment scores outperform discrete classifications for trading applications.

## Method Summary
The study collected 1,332,446 news articles from 8+ sources covering Jan 2020-Apr 2022 for Dow Jones 30 stocks. Articles were processed using BERT+CRF entity recognition to extract asset-specific sentences, then scored by three sentiment models: FinBERT (pre-trained classification), DualGCN (trained on Financial PhraseBank + SemEval-2017), and RoBERTa+Transfs (regression outputting continuous scores). Daily sentiment was aggregated via averaging between consecutive market opens and scaled to [0, 100]. Trading signals were generated using thresholds (SELL=40, BUY=60) with equal-value orders ($10,000 each) and 0.05% commission. Performance was measured against a Buy&Hold benchmark using Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar ratios, max drawdown, and VaR.

## Key Results
- RoBERTa+Transfs regression model achieved 50.63% cumulative return vs. 26.96% Buy&Hold benchmark
- Regression approach generated 23.67% alpha with Sharpe ratio of 3.98
- All three models produced positive returns, validating sentiment analysis viability for trading

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Continuous sentiment scores outperform discrete classifications for trading signal generation. Regression models output floating-point values in [-1.0, +1.0], preserving sentiment granularity for finer discrimination between signal intensities. Market prices respond proportionally to sentiment intensity, not just direction.

### Mechanism 2
Daily sentiment aggregation from multiple news sources produces stable signals that filter noise. Articles published between consecutive market opens are averaged per asset, reducing article-level noise while capturing daily trends. Sentiment signal has a half-life shorter than 24 hours, making older articles less relevant.

### Mechanism 3
Equal-value order sizing with fixed thresholds produces risk-adjusted returns superior to buy-and-hold. Each order executes a fixed $10,000 regardless of signal count, constraining exposure per signal and maintaining diversification across 30 assets. Signal quality is independent of signal frequency.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Transformer-based sentiment models (FinBERT, RoBERTa)**
  - Why needed here: The paper assumes familiarity with BERT-architecture models and their fine-tuning for financial text. Understanding the difference between classification (discrete labels) and regression (continuous scores) is essential.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a regression head on RoBERTa outputs a continuous score while FinBERT outputs class probabilities?

- Concept: **Risk-adjusted return metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, MDD, VaR)**
  - Why needed here: Performance evaluation relies on these metrics to compare strategies beyond raw returns. The paper reports Sharpe=3.98 and MDD=-5.27% for RoBERTa+Transfs.
  - Quick check question: Why does the Sortino ratio focus only on downside volatility, and when would it diverge significantly from the Sharpe ratio?

- Concept: **Alpha generation and benchmark comparison**
  - Why needed here: The core claim is generating alpha (23.67%) above the Buy&Hold benchmark. Understanding alpha as excess risk-adjusted return is critical.
  - Quick check question: If a strategy returns 15% and the benchmark returns 12%, but the strategy has twice the volatility, is the alpha necessarily positive?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Ingestion -> Entity Recognition -> Sentiment Models -> Aggregation Layer -> Signal Generator -> Execution Engine -> Backtesting Framework
- Critical path: Entity recognition → Sentiment scoring → Daily aggregation → Signal generation → Order execution. Errors in entity recognition propagate to all downstream components.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Equal-value vs. equal-weight: Paper uses equal-value ($10,000/signal), which leaves capital idle but reduces concentration risk
  - Threshold width (40-60): Narrower thresholds increase transaction frequency and costs; wider thresholds miss signals
  - Classification vs. regression: Classification is simpler but loses granularity; regression requires more training data and careful calibration
- Failure signatures:
  - Excessive transactions (thresholds 45/55): High turnover, commission erosion
  - Insufficient signal activation (thresholds 35/65): Low returns, capital underutilization
  - Entity recognition errors: Wrong asset attribution → incorrect sentiment aggregation
  - Stale sentiment: If news volume drops, aggregation produces unreliable scores
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the RoBERTa+Transfs sentiment scoring on a small sample (100 articles) and validate that continuous scores correlate with human-labeled sentiment intensity, not just direction.
  2. Implement the aggregation and signal generation pipeline for a single asset over 1 month; verify that BUY/SELL signals align with major news events for that asset.
  3. Run a 3-month backtest comparing thresholds [35/65, 40/60, 45/55] on paper data to confirm the 40/60 optimal threshold before full deployment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- News article collection methodology lacks specification of exact data sources and deduplication procedures
- Entity recognition system details (BERT+CRF architecture, training data, matching thresholds) are not provided
- Transaction cost assumptions only include 0.05% commission, omitting slippage and market impact costs
- Performance evaluation uses single 28-month window without cross-validation or out-of-sample testing

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Classification vs. regression performance comparison, alpha generation above benchmark, risk-adjusted metrics
- **Medium confidence**: Equal-value order sizing effectiveness, daily aggregation window appropriateness, threshold selection
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to different market conditions, robustness to transaction costs, scalability to broader asset universes

## Next Checks

1. **Entity recognition validation**: Run the BERT+CRF model on a manually annotated sample of 100 articles containing Dow Jones 30 company mentions. Calculate precision/recall for correct entity extraction and verify that sentiment aggregation produces reasonable scores when compared to human-labeled sentiment intensity for the same articles.

2. **Threshold sensitivity analysis**: Implement the backtesting framework for the RoBERTa+Transfs model using the three threshold sets tested in the paper ([35/65, 40/60, 45/55]). Generate transaction frequency and cumulative return plots to confirm that 40/60 thresholds produce balanced signal activation without excessive turnover or signal starvation.

3. **Out-of-sample performance test**: Apply the trained models and trading strategy to a different 6-month period (e.g., May-Oct 2022) using the same methodology. Compare cumulative returns, Sharpe ratios, and alpha generation against the original 28-month period to assess temporal robustness and regime sensitivity.
