# What Makes a Model Breathe? Understanding Reinforcement Learning Reward Function Design in Biomechanical User Simulation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.02571
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02571
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Completion bonus + proximity rewards are essential for task success in biomechanical RL; effort terms shape but don't enable movement

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically explores reward function design for reinforcement learning-based biomechanical user simulations. Using a choice reaction task, the authors analyze how different combinations of completion bonus, proximity, and effort terms affect movement trajectories and task performance. They find that a combination of completion bonus and proximity incentives is essential for task success, while effort terms are optional but can help avoid irregularities if appropriately scaled. The study provides practical guidelines for HCI designers to create realistic simulations without requiring deep RL expertise, demonstrating that complex interaction behaviors can be generated through careful reward function design.

## Method Summary
The authors use the User-in-the-Box (UitB) framework with MuJoCo physics to train RL policies on a choice reaction task where a biomechanical arm model (MoBL Arms Model with 5 DoFs and 26 muscles) must press colored buttons corresponding to visual stimuli. The reward function combines completion bonus, distance-based proximity terms (absolute, squared, or exponential), and effort penalty terms (Zero, EJK, JAC, CTC, or DC models). Policies are trained for 35M timesteps, with performance evaluated across success rate, completion time, and qualitative movement plausibility. The study systematically varies reward components to understand their individual and combined effects on learned behaviors.

## Key Results
- A combination of completion bonus and proximity incentives is essential for task success in biomechanical RL
- Effort terms are optional but help avoid movement irregularities when appropriately scaled
- The interaction between distance function formulation and effort model selection determines which movement strategies emerge
- No single reward combination universally dominates; task-specific tuning is required

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Sparse-Dense Reward Synergy
Combining sparse completion bonus with dense proximity rewards enables reliable task learning in biomechanical RL. The completion bonus provides a terminal goal signal that defines task success, while the proximity reward provides continuous gradient information that guides the policy through high-dimensional muscle action space toward goal states.

### Mechanism 2: Effort Terms as Movement Regularizers
Effort penalty terms shape movement quality but are dispensable for basic task completion when proximity rewards are well-designed. Effort terms add cost signals that discourage inefficient control patterns (jerky movements, excessive muscle activation), biasing the policy toward smoother trajectories within the solution space defined by completion and proximity rewards.

### Mechanism 3: Distance Function-Effort Model Coupling
The interaction between distance function formulation and effort model selection determines which strategies emerge, with no single combination universally optimal. Different distance functions create different reward landscapes that interact with effort penalty gradients, causing policies to converge to distinct local optima in movement strategy space.

## Foundational Learning

- **Sparse vs. Dense Rewards in RL**: The paper's core finding depends on understanding why sparse rewards alone fail and how dense rewards provide learning signal. Quick check: Can you explain why a sparse completion-only reward might prevent an RL agent from learning in a continuous action space?

- **Musculoskeletal Biomechanics (Actuation Redundancy)**: The 5 DoF arm with 26 muscles creates an over-actuated system where many muscle combinations produce similar movements—this is why effort terms can shape behavior without preventing task completion. Quick check: Why does having more muscles than degrees of freedom create a "movement redundancy problem"?

- **Reward Shaping and Credit Assignment**: The distance reward functions as a shaping signal that helps the agent associate intermediate states with progress toward the goal. Quick check: How does a distance-based reward help an agent learn faster than a pure completion bonus?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Visual/Proprioceptive/Tactile observations -> Muscle activation commands (26D) -> MuJoCo physics environment -> Reward function (bonus + distance + effort) -> Policy update

- **Critical path**: Define task (choice reaction) -> Select distance function -> Choose effort model and weights -> Set completion bonus -> Train policy for 35M steps -> Evaluate success rate and completion time

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Absolute distance: Higher initial gradient, better with CTC effort, may allow more direct fingertip approaches
  - Exponential distance: Highest success rates generally, but may encourage non-fingertip contact strategies
  - Squared distance: Standard RL choice, performance varies by effort model
  - Effort inclusion: Adds regularity but requires careful weight tuning; omit first per Guideline G3
  - Training time: 35M steps is minimum viable; insufficient training may misattribute failure to reward design

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Agent presses buttons from side: Missing or weak completion bonus
  - Agent remains stationary: Effort weight too high relative to task rewards
  - Agent reaches only nearest buttons: Effort weight moderately too high or distance gradient too weak at range
  - Inconsistent button targeting (non-fingertip contact): Distance function-exertion model mismatch; try absolute distance
  - No movement initiation: Only sparse rewards (completion bonus + effort, no distance guidance)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline validation: Train with w_bonus=1, b=8, w_distance=1, D_exponential, w_effort=0. Verify success rate approaches 100%.
  2. Effort weight sweep: Fix bonus and exponential distance, test EJK effort with w_effort ∈ {0.04, 0.4, 0.8, 4.0, 16.0}. Map the "too low → working → too high" transition.
  3. Distance function comparison: With fixed effort (e.g., CTC at w_effort=0.01), compare absolute vs. exponential vs. squared distance on success rate and completion time.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. Do the derived reward design guidelines generalize to other HCI tasks and biomechanical models? The authors state future work should consider additional HCI tasks, such as pointing, tracking or keyboard typing to analyze the robustness of the reward functions.

2. To what extent can appropriate dense reward terms replace adaptive curriculum learning? The authors ask whether this effect can be achieved through appropriate dense reward terms instead of curriculum learning.

3. How can designers systematically identify the optimal weighting "sweetspot" for effort terms? The authors note that additional training is required to provide more elaborate guidance on how to find that sweetspot regarding the sensitivity of effort weights.

## Limitations

- Findings are primarily based on a single choice reaction task using a specific biomechanical arm model
- Generalizability to other tasks (multi-step manipulation, locomotion) or different biomechanical models remains untested
- The optimal effort weight ranges are presented as absolute values without systematic sensitivity analysis across different training durations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core finding that completion bonus + proximity rewards are essential for task success. Directly supported by controlled ablation experiments.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that effort terms are optional but shape movement quality. Supported by qualitative and quantitative analysis, but lacks independent validation.
- **Low Confidence**: The mechanism describing distance function-effort model coupling. Shows strong patterns within the study but has minimal external validation.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the reward function analysis using a different biomechanical task (e.g., reaching and grasping, or sequential button pressing) to test whether the completion+proximity synergy and effort term effects generalize beyond the choice reaction paradigm.

2. Systematically vary training time (e.g., 10M, 20M, 35M, 50M steps) while testing effort weight sweeps to determine whether the viable effort weight ranges shift with training duration.

3. For each distance function (absolute, squared, exponential), plot the reward landscape in state space near successful trajectories to quantitatively verify the claimed differences in gradient properties and their interaction with different effort models.
