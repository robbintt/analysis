# Safe Guaranteed Dynamics Exploration with Probabilistic Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.16650
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16650
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Achieves maximum safe dynamics learning with high-probability safety guarantees in non-episodic settings, enabling autonomous systems to explore while remaining safe.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for safe online learning of unknown dynamics in non-episodic settings, where the agent must remain safe throughout the learning process without resets. The core idea is to pessimistically ensure safety for all possible dynamics while optimistically exploring informative states. The framework achieves maximum safe dynamics learning up to an arbitrary small tolerance in finite time, with high-probability safety guarantees. Building on this, the authors propose SAGEDYNX, an efficient algorithm that maximizes rewards by learning dynamics only to the extent needed for optimal performance.

## Method Summary
The method combines Gaussian Process regression with robust MPC-style planning. The agent maintains a probabilistic model of the dynamics with uncertainty bounds, and at each step solves an optimization problem that ensures safety for all possible dynamics within the uncertainty set while targeting states that maximize information gain. The algorithm uses a pessimistic policy for safety (verified against all sampled dynamics) but an optimistic objective (targeting high-uncertainty states). Information collection is guaranteed through trajectory deviation analysis under Lipschitz continuity assumptions. The exploration phase terminates when the gap between optimistic and pessimistic performance bounds closes sufficiently.

## Key Results
- Achieves maximum safe dynamics learning up to tolerance ε in finite time with high-probability safety guarantees
- SAGEDYNX algorithm maximizes rewards by learning dynamics only to the extent needed for optimal performance
- Demonstrated significant improvements over baselines in autonomous car racing and drone navigation tasks, showing better regret and safety performance
- Theoretical guarantees ensure both safety and close-to-optimal performance in safety-critical applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Asymmetric Planning via Pessimistic Safety and Optimistic Targeting
The system maintains safety guarantees while actively reducing model uncertainty by decoupling the execution policy from the exploration target. The agent solves an optimization problem to find a policy π_p that is safe for all possible dynamics in the uncertainty set F_n (pessimism). However, the objective function of this optimization targets states predicted to have high uncertainty ("informative states") based on a specific, optimistic dynamics model within F_n. If the true system deviates from the optimistic plan, the discrepancy reveals model error; if it follows the plan, the agent collects the informative sample directly.

### Mechanism 2: Guaranteed Information Collection via Trajectory Deviation
The agent guarantees the collection of informative data points even when it cannot precisely reach the targeted high-uncertainty state due to unknown dynamics. Because the true dynamics f* differ from the planned dynamics, the executed trajectory deviates. By enforcing a Lipschitz continuity assumption, the paper proves that if the planned path targets a state with uncertainty ≥ ε_d, the true trajectory must pass through a region with uncertainty ≥ ε_c (where ε_c < ε_d). This ensures at least one data point is collected per iteration.

### Mechanism 3: Task-Aware Termination via Value Gap
The agent can stop exploring and switch to pure exploitation once the "gap" between the optimistic best-case performance and pessimistic guaranteed performance closes. The algorithm continuously solves two problems: an optimistic reward maximization (J_o) and a pessimistic safety-constrained maximization (J_p). As the model learns, the pessimistic lower bound J_p rises to meet the optimistic upper bound J_o. When J_p ≥ J_o - Kε, the agent has learned the dynamics "sufficiently" for the task and terminates exploration.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gaussian Processes (GPs) for Uncertainty Quantification**: The core safety layer relies on calibrating a "confidence set" F_n around the unknown dynamics. Without the variance estimates provided by GPs, the agent cannot distinguish between "safe known state" and "safe unknown state." Quick check: Can you explain how the confidence width β_n σ_n(x) determines the trade-off between safety (pessimism) and reachability?

- **Robust Positive Invariant Sets (Safe Sets)**: The framework is non-episodic and cannot reset. It requires a "home base" (X_n) where the agent can guarantee it can stay indefinitely regardless of the specific dynamics in F_n. This set allows the agent to plan safe return trajectories. Quick check: If the safe set shrinks during learning due to updated uncertainty, how does the algorithm handle a current state that is suddenly outside the new safe set?

- **Lipschitz Continuity in Control**: The proofs for exploration rely on bounding how much the true state trajectory deviates from the planned trajectory. Lipschitz constants provide the conversion factor between uncertainty in dynamics and uncertainty in state space. Quick check: How does the performance scale if the system dynamics are chaotic (large Lipschitz constant) versus smooth?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Probabilistic Model (GP) -> Safe Set Manager -> Optimistic Planner -> Pessimistic Filter (MPC) -> Execution Engine
- **Critical path**: The loop starts with Optimistic Planning to identify a potential best-case trajectory. This trajectory is passed to the Pessimistic Filter, which adjusts it to ensure safety (constraint satisfaction) and ensures it visits high-uncertainty regions (exploration). The Execution Engine applies the control. Crucially, the agent does not return to the safe set physically every time; it only ensures a plan exists to return (returnability).
- **Design tradeoffs**: Tolerance ε vs. Learning Speed (lowering ε forces conservatism, potentially reducing exploration rate). Model Fidelity vs. Computation (more GP samples improve safety but increase solve time).
- **Failure signatures**: Infeasibility in optimization indicates safe set too small or uncertainty too large. Stuck in safe set occurs when informative states are unreachable. Constraint violation suggests miscalibrated model or violated assumptions.
- **First 3 experiments**: Safe Pendulum Swing-up (verify basic loop without falling). Drone Navigation with Aerodynamic Disturbance (learn drag profile before high-speed maneuvers). Stress Test: Shrinking Safe Set (inflating σ to test conservative behavior vs. constraint violations).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the theoretical performance guarantees be extended from finite-horizon rewards to infinite-horizon settings while maintaining safety throughout learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Although we ensure safety for all times k ∈ N, our performance bound is only valid for rewards over a finite horizon H. Providing similar performance bounds for infinite-horizon performance would require more involved tools, such as (stochastic) turnpikes."
- Why unresolved: The current theoretical analysis relies on finite-horizon formulation; extending to infinite horizon introduces challenges in bounding accumulated uncertainty and establishing convergence without a fixed planning horizon.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical proof extending Objective 2 to infinite-horizon regret bounds, potentially leveraging stochastic turnpike properties, with corresponding algorithm modifications.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do probabilistic (expected-value) safety guarantees compare to the current robust worst-case approach in terms of sample efficiency and practical safety violations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We utilize a robust bound on the noise η(k) ∈ W, which may be conservative. This can be naturally addressed by replacing the high-probability safety guarantees with (weaker) probabilistic safety guarantees using standard stochastic prediction methods."
- Why unresolved: The paper provides no analysis of the trade-off between conservatism in robust bounds and the increased sample efficiency or performance that probabilistic guarantees might offer.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical comparison of sample complexity bounds and empirical safety violation rates between robust and probabilistic formulations on standard benchmarks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the requirement for a priori known initial safe set with monotonicity, invariance, and controllability properties be relaxed or learned from scratch?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Assumption 3 requires strong conditions on the safe set, and the paper states it is "comparable to the safe initial seed for safe exploration" citing prior work, implying this remains a fundamental assumption not addressed.
- Why unresolved: The entire theoretical framework depends on having such a safe set, which may be unavailable or difficult to characterize in practice for complex systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm that constructs or expands safe sets online from only weak initial assumptions, with corresponding modified theoretical guarantees.

## Limitations

- Safety guarantees are contingent on true dynamics remaining within calibrated GP uncertainty bounds; unmodeled behaviors outside this space may violate guarantees
- Convergence proofs assume Lipschitz continuity and bounded uncertainty; highly chaotic systems may render theoretical bounds impractical
- Computationally intensive requiring non-convex optimization with robust constraints at each time step; scalability to high-dimensional systems is limited

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Theoretical safety guarantees under stated assumptions (Lemma 1, Proposition 2, Theorem 1, Theorem 2) - proofs are rigorous within probabilistic framework
- **Medium Confidence**: Practical safety in real-world scenarios - demonstrated on challenging tasks but real-world unmodeled dynamics may create uncovered edge cases
- **Low Confidence**: Scalability to high-dimensional systems and generalization across diverse dynamic regimes without extensive hyperparameter tuning

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Model Mismatch**: Introduce systematic unmodeled dynamics (e.g., sudden mass changes in drone) to test whether the agent can detect and safely respond to violations of the RKHS assumption
2. **Safety-Performance Trade-off Analysis**: Systematically vary the safety tolerance parameter ε and measure the resulting impact on learning speed and cumulative regret across multiple problem instances
3. **Computational Scaling Study**: Evaluate the algorithm's performance and runtime on incrementally more complex dynamics (8D, 12D) to identify practical dimensionality limits and assess effectiveness of approximation strategies
