## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an anticipatory governance framework for AI in the nuclear sector, addressing the rapid embedding of AI technologies in nuclear research and operations without adequate safety, security, and safeguards understanding. The authors identify that AI integration could introduce new failure modes and deskilling of personnel, necessitating proactive governance. They outline five components of anticipatory governance: hindsight (historical understanding), insight (actor intentions), topsight (system interactions), prescience (weak signals), and engagement (public values). To operationalize this framework, they propose creating a global AI observatory for the nuclear sector to document AI use, monitor regulatory developments, and facilitate stakeholder engagement through surveys, interviews, and workshops. The observatory would serve as a clearinghouse for information on AI adoption in nuclear energy while supporting the development of consensus-based norms for AI integration.

## Method Summary
The proposed method involves creating a global AI observatory for the nuclear sector to enable anticipatory governance of AI integration. The approach includes annual international surveys targeting researchers, practitioners, regulators, and students; interviews solicited through survey and professional networks (US and Australia); regulatory/policy document monitoring; and workshops with AI experts, nuclear experts, and public members. The observatory operates on a five-component framework: (1) Hindsight - historical understanding of analogous governance; (2) Insight - declarations of AI use and actor intentions; (3) Topsight - system-level risk anticipation; (4) Prescience - weak signal detection; (5) Engagement - public values elicitation. Operationalization proceeds via survey distribution → interviews → website hosting → workshops → consensus-building for AI adoption norms.

## Key Results
- Proposes five-component anticipatory governance framework (hindsight, insight, topsight, prescience, engagement) for AI in nuclear sector
- Identifies potential deskilling of personnel and new failure modes from AI integration in nuclear systems
- Proposes global AI observatory to document uses, monitor regulations, and facilitate stakeholder engagement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Information Asymmetry Reduction Enables Governance
Systematic documentation of AI use cases may reduce knowledge gaps between developers, operators, and regulators. An observatory structure collects dispersed AI adoption data → centralizes it → makes it accessible to governance actors → enables informed decision-making before risks materialize. Core assumption: Actors will disclose AI uses honestly; proprietary concerns won't completely block information sharing. Break condition: If participation is low or disclosures are superficial, the observatory becomes a façade rather than a functional tool.

### Mechanism 2: Historical Pattern Recognition Mitigates "Slow Disaster" Accumulation
Applying hindsight as a governance component may help identify deferred decisions that accumulate into systemic risk. Structured historical analysis (e.g., Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Fukushima) → identifies patterns of technical-human-organizational interaction failures → surfaces analogous risks in AI integration → enables earlier intervention. Core assumption: AI integration risks are sufficiently analogous to past nuclear system failures to inform foresight. Break condition: If AI introduces genuinely novel failure modes unrecognizable from historical analogies, hindsight provides false confidence.

### Mechanism 3: Weak Signal Detection Enables Prescient Action
Monitoring early research directions and "faint hints" may provide lead time for governance responses. Observing active research areas → extrapolating to potential industry applications → identifying emergent risks before widespread deployment → developing norms preemptively. Core assumption: Research trajectories are predictable enough to anticipate industrial applications; weak signals are detectable above noise. Break condition: If signal detection threshold is too high, risks are missed; if too low, governance resources are wasted on false positives.

## Foundational Learning

- **Safety, Security, and Safeguards (3S) Interdependence**
  - Why needed here: AI integration affects all three domains simultaneously, and they can conflict. Understanding tradeoffs is essential for governance design.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why enhancing security (e.g., restricting access for AI model review) might undermine safety (e.g., limiting independent verification)?

- **Sociotechnical Systems Thinking**
  - Why needed here: Nuclear systems are not purely technical; human, organizational, and institutional factors interact with technology. AI integration alters all layers.
  - Quick check question: If an AI system reduces human operators' workload but also reduces their situational awareness, is this a net safety improvement? Why or why not?

- **Regulatory Capture Recognition**
  - Why needed here: Governance structures can be co-opted by industry interests. Anticipatory governance requires independence mechanisms.
  - Quick check question: What structural safeguards would prevent an AI observatory funded by industry participants from becoming captured?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Collection Layer (surveys, interviews, regulatory monitoring) → Analysis Layer (trend identification, weak signal detection, 3S impact assessment) → Dissemination Layer (website, clearinghouse, public resources) → Engagement Layer (workshops with stakeholders) → Norms Development Layer (consensus-building, confidential review board)

- **Critical path**: 1. Survey design and international distribution → baseline AI use documentation; 2. Interview protocol development → deeper intention/motivation data; 3. Website launch → public clearinghouse function; 4. First workshop → initial norms discussion; 5. Regulatory monitoring begins → ongoing policy tracking

- **Design tradeoffs**: Openness vs. participation (requiring full disclosure may reduce participation; confidential review board adds complexity but may increase honest engagement); Breadth vs. depth (international scope provides comprehensiveness but complicates data harmonization); Expert-driven vs. public-engaged (balance between technical rigor and democratic legitimacy)

- **Failure signatures**: Survey response rate below threshold for representative sampling; Workshops dominated by single stakeholder type; Regulatory capture indicated by governance outcomes consistently favoring industry positions; Weak signals never materialize into actionable interventions

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Pilot survey with 50-100 nuclear sector professionals to test disclosure willingness and question clarity before full international rollout; 2. Small-scale workshop (15-20 participants) with mixed stakeholders to validate engagement methodology and identify facilitation challenges; 3. Historical case study of one past nuclear regulatory development to test whether hindsight component methodology yields actionable insights for AI governance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can an AI observatory effectively monitor and document AI adoption when many novel applications are proprietary or restricted from public disclosure? The paper acknowledges that "novel applications of AI... may be considered proprietary by their developers" and proposes exploring processes like a confidential review board to handle non-disclosable uses. Standard surveys and public repositories cannot capture proprietary data, yet excluding this data creates a blind spot in the governance framework. What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation of a confidential reporting mechanism that aggregates trends from proprietary data without violating confidentiality agreements.

### Open Question 2
To what extent does the reduction of human presence in AI-enabled nuclear systems degrade the "human improvisation and ingenuity" required to prevent initiating events from snowballing into accidents? The paper notes that eliminating human presence reduces human error but also reduces the possibility of human improvisation, a factor proven significant in safety improvements. The trade-off between reducing human error via automation and losing human adaptive capacity during unforeseen, complex failure modes is not quantified. What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies or simulations comparing incident resolution rates in fully automated versus human-in-the-loop systems during novel failure scenarios.

### Open Question 3
How can an anticipatory governance framework prevent regulatory capture given the scarcity of personnel with expertise at the intersection of nuclear engineering and AI? The paper highlights the risk of regulatory capture occurring due to "insufficient organizational... separation" and asks how to build skill reserves within independent governance systems. If the requisite dual-expertise exists mostly within industry, regulators may become dependent on industry personnel or perspectives, leading to capture. What evidence would resolve it: Identification of effective organizational structures or training pipelines that successfully create independent regulatory expertise in dual-use technologies.

### Open Question 4
What mechanisms are required to effectively integrate diverse public values into the governance of AI in a sector that has historically been highly technocratic? The paper states that the current trajectory is "purely technocratic" and calls for "engagement" to investigate public hopes and fears, noting the need for "sociotechnical assessment and co-creation." The paper outlines the need for engagement but does not define the specific methods for overcoming the technical complexity barrier that typically excludes the public from nuclear governance. What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrated methodologies from the proposed workshops that successfully elicit and incorporate non-expert values into technical AI safety standards.

## Limitations

- Participation barriers may limit observatory effectiveness due to proprietary concerns and competitive advantages
- Reliance on historical nuclear incidents may not capture novel failure modes introduced by AI integration
- Signal detection methodology lacks validation and may produce false positives or miss actual risks

## Confidence

**Low** - The observatory concept remains theoretical with no demonstrated effectiveness in similar contexts. Key uncertainties include participation barriers and proprietary concerns that may limit information collection.

**Medium** - The conceptual framework of anticipatory governance components provides coherent theoretical structure, but practical implementation challenges are not fully addressed.

## Next Checks

1. **Pilot Participation Test**: Conduct a small-scale pilot survey with 50-100 nuclear sector professionals to empirically test disclosure willingness and identify proprietary concerns that could block observatory effectiveness. Measure response rates and quality of disclosures under different anonymity/confidentiality conditions.

2. **Historical Analogue Testing**: Select one past nuclear regulatory development (e.g., post-Fukushima changes) and apply the hindsight methodology to assess whether it would have generated actionable insights for AI governance. Compare predictions against actual outcomes.

3. **Weak Signal Detection Experiment**: Monitor current AI research directions in nuclear applications and track whether identified "weak signals" successfully predict actual industry adoption patterns over a 12-24 month period. Quantify false positive and false negative rates in signal detection.
