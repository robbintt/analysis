# Defining Operational Conditions for Safety-Critical AI-Based Systems from Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22118
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22118
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Kernel-based framework achieves R² > 0.973 between data-driven ODD and convex hull in Monte Carlo tests

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a deterministic, kernel-based method for defining Operational Design Domains (ODDs) for safety-critical AI systems directly from data. The approach uses anchor points (in-distribution samples) with analytically defined RBF kernels to create a continuous affinity function that indicates ODD membership. This enables soft boundaries with graded warning zones rather than binary classifications, supporting proactive safety measures. The method is validated on Monte Carlo simulations and a real-world aviation collision avoidance use case, demonstrating strong correlation between data-driven ODDs and convex hull approximations.

## Method Summary
The core method constructs ODDs by defining RBF kernels centered on each anchor point (in-distribution sample). These kernels are combined via probabilistic superposition to create a global affinity function α(x) ∈ [0,1]. Kernel bandwidth is automatically determined using nearest-neighbor distances, adapting to local data density. The method supports OOD consistency enforcement to ensure conservative boundaries and uses convex hull of anchor points as a proxy for ground-truth ODD during threshold tuning. Runtime monitoring involves evaluating α(x) for new samples against a calibrated threshold ζ.

## Key Results
- R² > 0.973 between data-driven ODD and convex hull in Monte Carlo tests
- R² = 0.991 for precision and 0.999 for recall in aviation collision avoidance case
- Method works across sparse-to-dense data regimes (3 to 10,000 anchor points)
- Continuous affinity functions enable graded warning zones before hard safety boundaries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Kernel-Based Superposition for Continuous Affinity
- Claim: Global affinity function α(x) ∈ [0,1] approximates ODD membership by combining local RBF kernels
- Mechanism: Each anchor point defines a local RBF kernel combined via probabilistic superposition: α(x) = 1 - Πᵢ(1 - αᵢ(x))
- Core assumption: ODD manifold can be approximated by union of local neighborhoods around in-distribution samples
- Evidence: Abstract confirms continuous affinity for graded warnings; Definitions 4.2-4.3 formalize the approach

### Mechanism 2: Nearest-Neighbor Kernel Parameterization
- Claim: Kernel bandwidth automatically set using distance to nearest neighbor
- Mechanism: σ(i)_kk = (κ-λ)exp(-ηd*) + λ, where d* is nearest-neighbor distance
- Core assumption: Local data density correlates with ODD "solidity"
- Evidence: Section 4.3 explains density-based adaptation; Monte Carlo validation shows method works across regimes

### Mechanism 3: OOD Consistency Enforcement
- Claim: Explicit OOD samples constrain kernel parameters to ensure conservatism
- Mechanism: If α(xOOD) > ξ, dominant contributing kernels are reduced until constraint satisfied
- Core assumption: OOD samples correctly represent regions outside ODD
- Evidence: Section 4.4 formalizes OOD consistency constraint; Algorithm 1 shows enforcement loop

### Mechanism 4: Convex Hull as Validation Proxy
- Claim: Convex hull of anchor points serves as proxy for ground-truth ODD during threshold tuning
- Mechanism: Precision-recall curves against convex hull strongly correlate with curves against true ODD
- Core assumption: Convex hull adequately approximates ODD for affinity threshold calibration
- Evidence: Abstract reports R² > 0.973 and R² = 0.991/0.999 for precision/recall; Discussion clarifies proxy role

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Operational Design Domain (ODD)**
  - Why needed: The entire paper formalizes ODDs mathematically as structures (X, R) where X is parameter space and R is relationship constraints
  - Quick check: Given an autonomous aircraft collision avoidance system, name three parameters that would belong in its ODD taxonomy and one ontology constraint relating them

- **Concept: Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernels**
  - Why needed: Core representation uses RBF kernels with covariance matrix Σ; understanding Mahalanobis distance is essential
  - Quick check: For an RBF kernel with diagonal Σ = diag([4, 1]), how does the kernel shape differ along dimension 1 vs. dimension 2

- **Concept: Precision-Recall Trade-off and Threshold Selection**
  - Why needed: Affinity threshold ζ is tuned via precision-recall curves; safety-critical systems must balance false positives vs. false negatives
  - Quick check: If recall is 0.95 and precision is 0.80 at threshold ζ = 0.6, what happens to each if you raise ζ to 0.8

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input Data (ID + optional OOD samples) -> Anchor Point Selection -> Nearest-Neighbor Computation -> Kernel Parameter Estimation -> Local Affinity Functions -> Global Affinity Function -> [Optional] OOD Consistency Check -> Threshold Selection -> Runtime Evaluation

- **Critical path:** Nearest-neighbor computation (O(N²) naive) uses Faiss library for fast approximate search; without this, scaling to 622K anchor points would be prohibitive

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Diagonal vs. full Σ matrix: Diagonal chosen for interpretability, robustness, and reduced parameters; trade-off is loss of expressiveness for tightly coupled parameters
  - RBF vs. alternative kernels: RBF chosen for smoothness and infinite differentiability; trade-off is never reaching exactly zero, requiring threshold-based membership
  - Convex hull validation proxy: Enables tuning without ground-truth ODD; trade-off may give misleading guidance for highly concave ODDs with internal voids

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low recall despite high anchor density: Kernel parameters too conservative; check nearest-neighbor distances
  - OOD samples incorrectly classified as inside: OOD consistency enforcement failed or wasn't run
  - Numerical instability in Σ⁻¹: Anchor points far apart in unnormalized parameter space; normalize parameter ranges

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce 2D Monte Carlo validation: Generate synthetic ODD, sample 100 anchor points, compute precision-recall curves against both true ODD and convex hull
  2. Sparse data stress test: Repeat with only 5, 10, 20 anchor points; measure minimum density for R² > 0.90
  3. OOD consistency enforcement validation: Inject 10% mislabeled ID samples as OOD; verify α(x) constrained below ξ while maintaining recall

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the framework be extended to model cross-dimensional dependencies using non-diagonal kernel parameter matrices while maintaining determinism and order-independence?
- **Basis:** Conclusion states extending framework to model cross-dimensional dependencies could improve expressiveness but requires constraints to preserve certifiability
- **Why unresolved:** Current implementation assumes local independence by restricting Σ to diagonal form
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Derivation of non-diagonal kernel construction method that remains invariant to sample ordering

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can time-dependent kernels be integrated into the framework to represent evolving or context-dependent operational constraints?
- **Basis:** Conclusion identifies integrating temporal information via time-dependent kernels as promising extension for dynamic environments
- **Why unresolved:** Current mathematical representation defines ODD based on static parameter vectors lacking formalism for sequential or temporal state evolution
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Formulation of spatiotemporal affinity function α(x, t) that validates temporal sequences against dynamic safety boundaries

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can continuous affinity thresholds (ζ) be rigorously mapped to formal safety requirements to enable certifiable runtime assurance?
- **Basis:** Conclusion notes future work should explore linking affinity thresholds to formal safety requirements and certifiable data-driven ODD updates
- **Why unresolved:** While paper defines ζ, it treats threshold as user-defined parameter without establishing theoretical link between affinity values and quantitative safety guarantees
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Methodology for deriving specific ζ value from target failure probability or Development Assurance Level

## Limitations
- Convex hull proxy assumption breaks for highly concave ODDs with internal voids
- Method lacks validation on truly unknown ODD shapes and sparse-data regimes beyond Monte Carlo
- OOD consistency enforcement mechanism lacks validation on real-world mislabeled data
- Discrete parameter handling (s_adv) is not specified in the framework

## Confidence
- **High**: Order-independent property, continuous affinity function design, nearest-neighbor parameterization concept
- **Medium**: R² correlation values, OOD consistency enforcement effectiveness, applicability to highly sparse data
- **Low**: Real-world validation beyond VCAS case, handling of mixed discrete/continuous parameters, kernel adjustment algorithm details

## Next Checks
1. **Sparse data validation**: Test method with only 10-20 anchor points on synthetic concave ODD to measure breakdown point for R² correlation and recall performance
2. **OOD enforcement stress test**: Intentionally inject mislabeled ID samples as OOD and verify Algorithm 1 correctly constrains them while maintaining recall on true ID regions
3. **Discrete parameter integration**: Implement mixed discrete/continuous version of affinity function for s_adv parameter and measure impact on overall precision-recall performance
