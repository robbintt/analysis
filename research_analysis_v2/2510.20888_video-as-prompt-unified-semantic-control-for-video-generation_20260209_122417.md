# Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.20888
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves 38.7% user preference rate, rivaling leading commercial models for semantic-controlled video generation

## Executive Summary
Video-As-Prompt (VAP) introduces a unified approach to semantic-controlled video generation by treating reference videos as in-context prompts. The method employs a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) augmented with a trainable Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert to process reference videos without catastrophic forgetting. A temporally biased position embedding removes spurious pixel-mapping priors for robust context retrieval. Trained on VAP-Data (over 100K paired videos across 100 semantic conditions), VAP demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and supports various downstream applications, achieving performance rivaling leading commercial models.

## Method Summary
VAP processes reference videos as unified prompts for semantic control by encoding them into token sequences alongside noisy target video tokens and captions. A frozen Video DiT processes the target while a parallel Mixture-of-Transformers expert processes the reference prompt, communicating via full attention to enable semantic transfer without pixel-wise mapping. The approach uses temporally biased Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) that shift reference tokens before target tokens temporally, eliminating false pixel-level mapping priors. The model is trained on VAP-Data with over 100K paired videos across 100 semantic conditions, using a Flow Matching objective with the expert as the only trainable component to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

## Key Results
- Achieves 38.7% user preference rate compared to leading commercial models
- Strong zero-shot generalization demonstrated on unseen semantic conditions
- Supports diverse downstream applications including style transfer, motion guidance, and concept learning
- Maintains semantic alignment while preserving base model generative capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: In-Context Semantic Transfer
Treating reference videos as in-context prompts enables unified semantic control across diverse conditions without task-specific designs. The model encodes reference and target videos into token sequences, allowing semantic information to transfer through token interactions rather than requiring pixel-level correspondence.

### Mechanism 2: MoT Architecture for Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention
The Mixture-of-Transformers design with parallel expert and frozen backbone isolates the new in-context learning task to the expert, preserving the pre-trained DiT's generative capabilities while learning to route semantic guidance.

### Mechanism 3: Temporally Biased RoPE for Context Retrieval
Temporally biased Rotary Position Embeddings shift reference tokens before target tokens temporally, removing spurious pixel-mapping priors and signaling the model to treat references as prior context rather than aligned frames.

## Foundational Learning

- **In-Context Learning in Transformers**: Why needed - VAP's core mechanism relies on learning to use reference videos as prompts to influence generation. Quick check - Can you explain how concatenating reference tokens before target tokens enables conditional generation?

- **Catastrophic Forgetting in Transfer Learning**: Why needed - The MoT architecture prevents the pre-trained DiT from losing generative abilities when adapted for semantic control. Quick check - If you fine-tuned the entire Video DiT, what negative outcome would you expect?

- **Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)**: Why needed - Understanding how RoPE encodes relative position via rotation is necessary to grasp why shifting indices changes the model's prior. Quick check - Why would applying the same RoPE indices to reference and target imply a pixel-wise mapping prior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: VAE Encoder/Decoder -> Pre-trained Video DiT (frozen) -> In-Context DiT Expert (trainable) -> Full Attention Layer -> RoPE Layer -> Text Encoders

- **Critical path**: 1) Encode reference/target videos and captions, noise target 2) Apply temporally biased RoPE with offset Δ 3) Process reference through expert, target through frozen DiT with full bidirectional attention 4) Backbone outputs noise prediction, VAE decoder generates final video

- **Design tradeoffs**: MoT preserves backbone quality but doubles parameters/inference cost vs efficient finetuning that risks forgetting; bidirectional guidance outperforms unidirectional; synthetic data enables controlled alignment but limits real-world diversity

- **Failure signatures**: Copy-paste artifacts (appearance leakage), identity loss (subject mismatch), temporal instability (flickering motion)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Verify in-context copying with frame-from-reference test 2) Ablation comparing MoT vs single-branch finetuning 3) Zero-shot test on held-out semantic condition

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does training on large-scale, real-world video data compare to synthetic data regarding mitigation of inherited stylistic biases and artifacts?
- To what extent do instruction-style captions improve semantic alignment and control precision compared to standard descriptive captions?
- What specific architectural or positional embedding designs are required to support robust multi-reference prompting without causing feature blending?

## Limitations

- Relies on synthetic VAP-Data with only 100 semantic conditions, limiting real-world diversity
- Performance depends heavily on reference video quality and semantic clarity
- MoT architecture doubles inference cost compared to simple finetuning
- True open-world generalization to arbitrary semantic prompts remains untested

## Confidence

- **Unified semantic control via video-as-prompt**: High - Well-justified by in-context learning literature with strong ablation support
- **Catastrophic forgetting prevention**: Medium - Ablation shows benefit but long-term stability across many tasks untested
- **Robust zero-shot generalization**: Medium - Limited held-out tests show promise but true open-world generalization untested
- **Superior user preference**: Medium - 38.7% rate reported but exact comparison conditions and testing protocol unclear

## Next Checks

1. **Open-set semantic generalization test**: Evaluate on unseen conditions (Origami, Breakdance, Slow-motion waterfall) compared to strong baseline to measure true zero-shot transfer

2. **Reference video quality sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary reference video quality and ambiguity to quantify impact on semantic alignment and artifact rates

3. **Long-term catastrophic forgetting probe**: Test frozen backbone performance on original video generation tasks after fine-tuning to directly validate capability preservation
