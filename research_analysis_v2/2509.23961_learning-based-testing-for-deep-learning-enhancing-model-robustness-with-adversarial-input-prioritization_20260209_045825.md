# Learning-Based Testing for Deep Learning: Enhancing Model Robustness with Adversarial Input Prioritization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23961
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23961
- Authors: Sheikh Md Mushfiqur Rahman; Nasir Eisty
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves up to 0.95 average fault detection rate (FDR) for black-box adversarial test prioritization without internal model access

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Learning-Based Testing (LBT) approach for prioritizing adversarial test cases to improve the robustness of deep neural networks. The method generates a behavioral model that mimics the target DNN's decision boundaries and applies mutation operators to create mutants. Test cases are then ranked based on their mutation scores across these mutants, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of exposing faults. Unlike prior approaches, this method does not require access to internal model details, making it applicable to black-box scenarios. Experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets using ResNet-20 and VGG-16 models demonstrate superior performance compared to baselines, achieving high fault detection rates and effective guidance for model retraining.

## Method Summary
The proposed LBT approach works by first training a behavioral model (LeNet-5) to approximate the decision boundaries of the target DNN (MUT). This is done iteratively by starting with a small seed dataset, querying the MUT for labels, and augmenting the training data using Jacobian-based heuristics on samples where the Behavioral Model and MUT disagree. Once the behavioral model is trained, mutation operators (Gaussian Fuzzing, Neuron Activation Inverse, and Neuron Switch) are applied to generate mutants. The original behavioral model and its mutants are then executed on adversarial test cases (generated using FGSM and JSMA), and mutation scores are calculated based on output differences. Finally, Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) is used to rank the adversarial inputs, prioritizing those most likely to expose faults in the MUT.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 0.95 average fault detection rate (FDR) for black-box adversarial test prioritization
- Outperforms baselines in test permutation efficiency with APFD up to 0.50
- Provides effective guidance for model retraining, with accuracy improvements of up to 0.24

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by creating a behavioral model that approximates the target DNN's decision boundaries, allowing for mutation testing without internal model access. By generating mutants of the behavioral model and executing adversarial inputs on these mutants, the approach can identify test cases that are most likely to expose faults. The use of SPRT for ranking ensures that the most effective test cases are prioritized, maximizing the fault detection rate while minimizing the number of test cases needed.

## Foundational Learning
- **Behavioral Model Generation**: Training a simpler model to mimic the target DNN's decision boundaries is crucial for enabling mutation testing in black-box scenarios. Quick check: Verify that the behavioral model achieves high similarity with the MUT on a validation set.
- **Mutation Testing**: Applying mutation operators to the behavioral model generates mutants that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of test cases. Quick check: Ensure that generated mutants maintain reasonable accuracy and are neither identical to nor completely random compared to the original model.
- **Jacobian-based Heuristics**: Using Jacobian saliency maps to identify samples where the behavioral model and MUT disagree helps iteratively improve the behavioral model's approximation of the MUT. Quick check: Monitor the convergence of the behavioral model training by tracking the similarity between the behavioral model and MUT over iterations.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Adversarial Test Cases -> Behavioral Model (LeNet-5) -> Mutants (GF, NAI, NS) -> Mutation Scores -> SPRT Ranking
- **Critical Path**: Adversarial test case generation -> Behavioral model training -> Mutant generation -> Mutation score calculation -> SPRT-based prioritization
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Using a simpler behavioral model (LeNet-5) instead of the complex MUT (ResNet-20, VGG-16) reduces computational cost but may introduce approximation errors that affect prioritization quality.
- **Failure Signatures**: Ineffective mutants (score=0) indicate mutation rates that are too low, while random mutants suggest mutation rates that are too high. Underfitted behavioral models result in poor prioritization correlation with MUT faults.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Verify mutant validity by varying mutation rates and checking mutant accuracy.
  2. Assess behavioral model fidelity by measuring similarity with the MUT across different thresholds.
  3. Compare prioritization performance against a baseline black-box adversarial testing method.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: Can the proposed LBT approach be effectively adapted to prioritize test cases for non-deterministic systems or systems that integrate both data-driven and code-based characteristics?
- **Open Question 2**: How can the mutation score calculation be adapted for regression tasks where a softmax function analog is unavailable?
- **Open Question 3**: Does the simplicity of the behavioral model (LeNet-5) limit the scalability or accuracy of prioritization when testing significantly larger or more complex state-of-the-art architectures?

## Limitations
- Underspecified experimental parameters, particularly mutation rates for operators and convergence criteria for behavioral model training
- Reliance on a simple LeNet-5 to approximate complex ResNet-20/VGG-16 decision boundaries may introduce approximation errors
- Practical applicability may be limited by the need for initial seed data and the computational cost of iterative behavioral model training

## Confidence
- **High**: The conceptual framework of using behavioral models and mutation testing for adversarial input prioritization is sound and well-grounded in prior work.
- **Medium**: The reported performance metrics (FDR up to 0.95, APFD up to 0.50, accuracy improvement up to 0.24) are plausible but depend critically on implementation details not fully specified in the paper.
- **Medium**: The claim of being a black-box method is valid, but the practical applicability may be limited by the need for initial seed data and the computational cost of iterative behavioral model training.

## Next Checks
1. **Mutant Validity Verification**: Systematically vary mutation rates for GF, NAI, and NS operators and verify that generated mutants maintain reasonable accuracy (neither identical to nor completely random compared to the original behavioral model).
2. **Behavioral Model Fidelity Assessment**: Measure similarity between the behavioral model and MUT across different similarity thresholds τ to determine the minimum acceptable similarity for effective prioritization.
3. **Baseline Comparison with Known Methods**: Implement and compare against at least one other established black-box adversarial testing method (e.g., MetaSel or Calibrated Adversarial Sampling) using identical datasets and metrics.
