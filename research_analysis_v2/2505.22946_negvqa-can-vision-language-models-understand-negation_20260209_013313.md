# NegVQA: Can Vision Language Models Understand Negation?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.22946
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22946
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Primary result**: 20 VLMs evaluated on NegVQA show substantial performance drop on negation questions (best model: 72.7% vs 92.2% on non-negated)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces NegVQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate vision language models' (VLMs) ability to understand negation. The benchmark consists of 7,379 two-choice questions derived from existing VQA datasets by generating negated versions of original questions. The authors evaluate 20 state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families and find that these models struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting substantial performance drops compared to their responses to the original questions. The study reveals a U-shaped scaling trend where increasing model size initially degrades negation performance before leading to improvements, with the best-performing model (Qwen2-VL-72B) achieving 72.7% accuracy on negated questions versus 92.2% on non-negated questions.

## Method Summary
The authors construct NegVQA by first collecting questions from VMCBench, which spans 20 diverse VQA datasets. They then use GPT-4o to generate negated versions of these questions using a specific prompt. For each question, they convert 4-choice questions to 2-choice by selecting the correct answer plus one random incorrect answer, then invert which is correct. The final benchmark contains 7,379 two-choice negated questions. They evaluate 20 state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families using zero-shot evaluation with a standard prompt format. Performance is measured as binary accuracy on negated questions compared to original non-negated questions, with human baseline at 89% accuracy.

## Key Results
- VLMs show substantial performance drop on negation questions, with best model (Qwen2-VL-72B) achieving 72.7% vs 92.2% on original questions
- U-shaped scaling trend observed: increasing model size initially degrades negation performance before improving
- All evaluated VLMs struggle with negation, showing consistent patterns of affirmative bias across model families
- Human baseline achieves 89% accuracy, indicating the task is solvable with proper reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Negation exposure during training influences VLM negation comprehension.
- Mechanism: VLMs trained on affirmative-dominant corpora may develop "affirmative bias," treating negated queries as semantically equivalent to their affirmative counterparts. When negation tokens appear, the model's learned associations prioritize affirmative patterns rather than inverting the truth condition.
- Core assumption: Training data distribution directly affects negation processing; low negation frequency correlates with poor negation understanding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In the fine-tuning data of a typical VLM like LLaVA, only 1.1% of conversations contain the word 'not.'" (Section 3.2)
  - [section] "Enhancing VLMs' ability to understand negation through training represents a promising direction for future research." (Section 3.2)
  - [corpus] Related work "Vision-Language Models Do Not Understand Negation" (arXiv:2501.09425) directly addresses affirmative bias in VLMs, supporting this mechanism.
- Break condition: If models with high negation exposure in training data still fail negation benchmarks, this mechanism is insufficient.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Negation understanding emerges as a distinct capability that scales non-monotonically with model size.
- Mechanism: Smaller models lack capacity to represent negation as an operator and simply ignore it. Medium-scale models improve at affirmative QA, making their negation-ignorance more detrimental (wrong answers become more confidently wrong). Large-scale models develop sufficient representational capacity to treat negation as a compositional operator.
- Core assumption: Negation processing requires meta-linguistic awareness that emerges only at sufficient model scale.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We uncover a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements."
  - [section] "Conceptually, this U-shaped trend can be understood as the composition of two underlying capabilities: original question answering, which tends to improve steadily with model scale, and negation understanding, which follows a tanh-like activation curve." (Section 3.2)
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific U-shaped mechanism in VLMs; related work on LLM scaling (Wei et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023 cited in paper) shows similar patterns in language models.
- Break condition: If U-shaped scaling disappears with different training regimes or architectures, the mechanism is architecture-dependent rather than scale-dependent.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Negation understanding requires grounding visual absence/non-match, not just linguistic processing.
- Mechanism: Negated VQA questions (e.g., "What is NOT in the image?") require models to: (1) parse the negation linguistically, (2) enumerate candidates, (3) verify visual absence for each candidate. This differs from affirmative QA where visual presence confirmation suffices.
- Core assumption: Visual negation comprehension is harder than linguistic negation alone because it requires exhaustive visual search and absence verification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The dataset ensures diversity in negation forms, covering cases related to objects, attributes, logical reasoning, spatial relationships, and more." (Section 2.2)
  - [section] Human baseline achieves 89% accuracy vs. best VLM at 72.7%, suggesting the task is fundamentally solvable with proper reasoning. (Section 3.2)
  - [corpus] "What 'Not' to Detect" (arXiv:2510.13232) addresses negation-aware detection, supporting the visual grounding difficulty hypothesis.
- Break condition: If models fail equally on purely linguistic negation tasks without visual components, visual grounding is not the primary bottleneck.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Affirmative bias in language models**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that models default to affirmative interpretations explains why simply adding "not" doesn't invert model behavior.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model might answer "What color is NOT the car?" by describing the car's actual color?

- Concept: **Compositional generalization**
  - Why needed here: Negation requires models to compose the negation operator with existing representations rather than memorizing negated patterns.
  - Quick check question: How would you test whether a model understands negation compositionally versus pattern-matching on "not" + attribute combinations?

- Concept: **Inverse and U-shaped scaling laws**
  - Why needed here: The counterintuitive finding that larger models can perform worse requires understanding non-monotonic scaling phenomena.
  - Quick check question: What conditions could cause model performance to decrease with scale on a specific capability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Vision encoder (CLIP variants) -> Projector (Linear/MLP) -> Language model backbone -> Instruction-tuning data
- Critical path: 1. Negation token enters via text input → 2. Language model processes query → 3. Model must bind negation scope to visual verification → 4. Model outputs answer reflecting inverted truth condition. Failure most likely at step 3.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Synthetic negation augmentation** vs. **natural negation data**: Synthetic (GPT-4o generated) ensures coverage but may not reflect real-world negation patterns.
  - **Two-choice format** vs. **open-ended**: Two-choice enables controlled evaluation but under-tests generative negation handling.
  - **Zero-shot evaluation** vs. **few-shot**: Zero-shot reveals base capabilities but may underestimate prompted negation understanding.
- Failure signatures:
  - **Affirmative answering**: Model answers negated question as if affirmative (e.g., "What is NOT the color?" → names actual color).
  - **Random guessing at medium scale**: U-shaped curve trough where models are confident but wrong.
  - **Scope errors**: Negation applied to wrong part of query (e.g., negating background conditions instead of main question).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Negation exposure ablation**: Fine-tune a base VLM with varying percentages (1%, 5%, 10%, 20%) of negated instruction data; measure NegVQA performance to establish dose-response relationship.
  2. **Negation scope probing**: Construct controlled variants where negation scope is unambiguous (e.g., "What color is the car that is NOT red?" vs. "What is NOT the color of the car?"); identify which scope confusions persist at scale.
  3. **Cross-modal negation transfer**: Test whether models that handle linguistic negation well (on text-only NLI tasks) transfer this to visual negation; establish whether the bottleneck is linguistic or multimodal.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can augmenting instruction-tuning datasets with curated negation examples effectively close the performance gap between negated and non-negated questions without impairing general capabilities? (Untested intervention mentioned in Limitations)
- **Open Question 2**: Does the observed U-shaped scaling trend persist or shift when employing few-shot prompting? (Current study focuses exclusively on zero-shot evaluation)
- **Open Question 3**: To what extent does the multiple-choice evaluation format constrain the generalizability of these findings to open-ended, real-world VLM applications? (Authors acknowledge this limitation but don't address it)

## Limitations

- Benchmark construction relies entirely on GPT-4o for negation generation, potentially introducing systematic biases in how negation is formulated
- 3% error rate in negation generation represents non-trivial contamination of evaluation data
- Two-choice format may underestimate VLM capabilities compared to real-world open-ended applications
- Zero-shot evaluation methodology limits understanding of how prompting strategies might mitigate negation failures

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The empirical finding that VLMs struggle with negation compared to affirmative questions (72.7% vs 92.2% for Qwen2-VL-72B) is well-supported by systematic evaluation across 20 models and seven model families.

**Medium Confidence**: The attribution of negation failures primarily to affirmative bias in training data is plausible given the 1.1% negation exposure statistic, but alternative explanations are not fully ruled out.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about specific causes of negation failures and generalizability of U-shaped pattern to other capabilities or model architectures would require further investigation.

## Next Checks

1. **Negation Generation Quality Audit**: Conduct systematic human evaluation of the 7,379 negated questions to quantify and characterize types of generation errors beyond reported 3%.

2. **Prompt Engineering Ablation**: Test whether different prompting strategies (chain-of-thought, explicit negation scoping instructions, multi-step reasoning) can significantly improve negation performance.

3. **Cross-Domain Negation Transfer**: Evaluate same VLMs on complementary benchmark of purely linguistic negation understanding to determine whether visual negation failures stem from multimodal integration challenges or broader negation comprehension deficits.
