# A Qubit-Efficient Hybrid Quantum Encoding Mechanism for Quantum Machine Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.19275
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19275
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposed qPGA achieves >99% accuracy on MNIST/FMNIST with significantly fewer qubits than quantum autoencoders while preserving local data structure

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis (qPGA), a non-invertible classical dimensionality reduction method designed specifically for quantum amplitude encoding. By leveraging Riemannian geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, qPGA preserves neighborhood structure and global variance while dramatically reducing qubit requirements for noisy quantum systems. The method decouples heavy computation from quantum hardware, enabling strict theoretical bounds on resource usage relative to noise levels. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate superior local structure preservation compared to quantum and hybrid autoencoders, achieving over 99% accuracy on classification tasks with minimal qubit counts.

## Method Summary
qPGA reduces high-dimensional classical data (N=64 or N=1024) to low-dimensional amplitude vectors on a Unit Hilbert Sphere for noise-resilient QML classification. The method normalizes data to the sphere, computes the Fréchet mean, maps to tangent space via Logarithmic Map, performs PCA to retain variance (typically 75%), then maps back to a lower-dimensional sphere via Exponential Map. The resulting amplitude vectors are encoded into ⌈log₂D⌉ qubits for downstream QSVM or Quantum Circuit Classifier tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves >99% accuracy and F1-score on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST for downstream QML classification tasks
- Demonstrates superior local data structure preservation versus quantum/hybrid autoencoders (higher Trustworthiness/Continuity metrics)
- Provides theoretical bounds on qubit requirements that account for noise tolerance (q ≤ ⌊log(1-Pmax)/log(1-p)⌋)
- Shows inherent resistance to reconstruction attacks due to non-invertible nature

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Aligning dimensionality reduction with non-Euclidean geometry of quantum states preserves local data neighborhoods more effectively than standard Euclidean reduction.
- **Mechanism:** Projects classical data onto the Unit Hilbert Sphere (UHS), calculates Fréchet mean, maps to tangent space (Logarithmic Map), performs PCA, maps back to lower-dimensional UHS (Exponential Map).
- **Core assumption:** High-dimensional data structure is better preserved when curvature of target embedding space is respected rather than projecting onto flat Euclidean hyperplane.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "qPGA leverages Riemannian geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, preserving the neighborhood structure." [section 4] Describes specific algorithm steps: Mapping to UHS → Log Map → PCA → Exp Map.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Decoupling feature extraction from quantum hardware allows for strict theoretical bounds on resource requirements relative to noise.
- **Mechanism:** Executes computationally heavy dimensionality reduction classically, fixing latent dimension D before touching QPU. Number of qubits q is strictly determined by desired variance β and maximum tolerable system error Pmax.
- **Core assumption:** Qubit errors occur independently. If errors are correlated (e.g., crosstalk), theoretical upper bound for qubits becomes optimistic.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Executed classically... significantly reducing qubit requirements." [section 5] Proposition 5.3 explicitly bounds qubits: ⌈log₂D⌉ ≤ q ≤ ⌊log(1-Pmax)/log(1-p)⌋.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Non-invertible nature of compression mechanism provides inherent resistance to data reconstruction attacks.
- **Mechanism:** Discards N-D least significant components during tangent space PCA. Non-linear geometric mapping makes reversing transformation mathematically difficult without decoder model.
- **Core assumption:** Adversaries do not have access to generative model trained to reverse specific manifold projection, but rely on standard geometric inversion.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Enhances resistance to reconstruction attacks due to its non-invertible nature." [section 7] Shows high MSE for qPGA reconstruction attempts compared to Hybrid Quantum Autoencoders.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Amplitude Encoding & the Unit Hilbert Sphere**
  - **Why needed here:** Method is explicitly designed for amplitude encoding where data vectors must be normalized to unit norm (L2 = 1). This constraint forces data to lie on surface of hypersphere (S^(N-1)), not flat space, dictating use of Riemannian geometry.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does representing classical data as quantum amplitudes force us to think about geometry on a sphere rather than a plane?

- **Concept: Riemannian Manifolds & Tangent Spaces**
  - **Why needed here:** Core algorithm works by moving data from curved sphere to flat "tangent space" (linearization) to perform PCA, then moving it back. Understanding this "unwrapping" process is key to algorithm.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the purpose of the Logarithmic Map in this algorithm? (Hint: It moves data from curved to flat space).

- **Concept: The NISQ Constraint**
  - **Why needed here:** Entire motivation is limited number of qubits and high noise in current devices. "Qubit-efficiency" is primary success metric.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is dimensionality reduction a critical pre-processing step for amplitude encoding on Near-term Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (Classical Dataset) → Pre-processor (Classical: Normalization/Kernel Map → Fréchet Mean → Log Map → PCA → Exp Map) → Quantum Encoder (Amplitude Embedding) → Downstream Task (QSVM/Quantum Circuit Classifier)

- **Critical path:** Calculation of Fréchet Mean and choice of Kernel Feature Map. If mean is not converged or kernel is mismatched to data, tangent space projection (PCA) will capture distorted variance.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Kernel Choice:** Paper notes kernel selection acts as hyperparameter. Linear is fast but may miss non-linear patterns; RBF/Polynomial capture more but require tuning.
  - **Variance vs. Noise:** Can increase latent dimension D to capture more variance, but this requires more qubits. As q increases, probability of system error rises exponentially.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **High Reconstruction MSE:** Expected behavior (feature, not bug), but verify not due to code errors in Log/Exp map implementation.
  - **Accuracy Drop on Hardware:** If accuracy plummets on real hardware vs. simulator, likely violated theoretical qubit bounds for device's specific noise level.
  - **Sharp Drop in Trustworthiness:** Indicates wrong kernel was used or PCA components (D) were set too low for dataset complexity.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Replicate the "Toy" Geometry:** Implement just Log Map → PCA → Exp Map on simple 3D sphere dataset (e.g., points on globe) to visualize how algorithm flattens and reconstructs data.
  2. **Noise Boundary Test:** Using formula in Section 5, calculate maximum qubits allowed for noise rate p=0.1 and Pmax=0.5. Compare theoretical limit to empirical results in Section 9 (Fig 10).
  3. **Invertibility Check:** Train standard decoder (neural network) to try to reverse qPGA latent vectors back to original images. Compare difficulty against reversing standard classical Autoencoder.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How do correlated qubit errors impact theoretical bounds on qubit requirements for qPGA algorithm?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors acknowledge theoretical bounds (Lemma 5.2) rely on independent error assumption and state "future research should aim to extend this framework by incorporating more sophisticated, correlated noise models."
  - **Why unresolved:** Realistic noise (e.g., crosstalk, spatial correlations) violates independence assumption (1-p)^q, potentially making current upper bound optimistic.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Revised theoretical bounds derived using cluster expansion or specific correlation structures that accurately model hardware noise.

- **Open Question 2:** Can systematic heuristics be developed for optimal kernel selection in qPGA based on intrinsic dataset properties?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Paper notes choice of kernel significantly impacts performance and suggests "developing heuristics or automated methods for optimal kernel selection based on dataset properties" as future direction.
  - **Why unresolved:** Currently, kernel selection treated as tunable hyperparameter requiring manual experimentation, lacking data-driven rule for selection.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Defined metric or algorithm that predicts optimal kernel (e.g., Linear vs. RBF) based on dataset characteristics like intrinsic dimensionality or cluster shape.

- **Open Question 3:** Can geometric principles of qPGA be adapted for quantum encoding schemes that do not utilize amplitude encoding?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors conclude it would be "valuable to investigate whether analogous geometry-preserving methods can be developed for other quantum encoding schemes that do not yield unit-normed quantum states with spherical geometry."
  - **Why unresolved:** qPGA explicitly designed for Unit Hilbert Sphere geometry of amplitude vectors; other encodings (e.g., basis encoding) operate on different manifolds.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Modified qPGA framework or new geometric algorithm tailored for non-spherical state spaces used in phase or basis encoding.

## Limitations
- Theoretical qubit bounds assume independent, uniform qubit error rates, potentially optimistic for real hardware with correlated noise (crosstalk, leakage)
- Kernel selection treated as hyperparameter without systematic tuning procedure or ablation study quantifying impact on different datasets
- Experiments limited to small subsets (1,200 images) of simple datasets; performance on larger, more complex datasets unverified

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** qPGA reduces qubit requirements compared to naive amplitude encoding (strongly supported by theoretical bounds and consistent empirical results)
- **Medium Confidence:** Superior local neighborhood preservation (higher Trustworthiness/Continuity) is well-supported but dataset-specific
- **Medium Confidence:** Enhanced resistance to reconstruction attacks due to non-invertibility is supported but only against naive geometric inversion

## Next Checks

1. **Stress Test the Noise Bounds:** Implement QASM simulator with correlated noise models (e.g., crosstalk between neighboring qubits) and verify if empirical maximum qubit count before accuracy collapse aligns with theoretical bound from Proposition 5.3

2. **Kernel Ablation Study:** Systematically test qPGA with linear, RBF, and polynomial kernels on all three datasets (MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10). Report variance explained, Trustworthiness/Continuity scores, and downstream classification accuracy for each

3. **Scalability Test on Complex Data:** Apply qPGA to more complex, multi-class dataset (e.g., full CIFAR-10 or dataset with >10 classes and higher resolution) and evaluate if method can still achieve high accuracy with reasonable qubit budget
