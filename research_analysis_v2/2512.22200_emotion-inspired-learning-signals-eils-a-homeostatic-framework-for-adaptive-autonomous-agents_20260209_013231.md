# Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS): A Homeostatic Framework for Adaptive Autonomous Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.22200
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22200
- Reference count: 32
- Replaces static RL optimization with dynamic, bio-inspired internal regulation via Stress, Curiosity, and Confidence signals

## Executive Summary
EILS introduces Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals, a homeostatic framework that replaces static RL optimization with dynamic, bio-inspired internal regulation. By modeling emotions as continuous appraisal signals—Stress (plasticity), Curiosity (exploration), and Confidence (stability)—EILS enables agents to self-tune hyperparameters in real time based on interaction history. In non-stationary CartPole tasks, EILS agents recovered performance 94% faster than PPO baselines by modulating learning rates via stress. On sparse-reward GridWorlds, EILS achieved 88.7% success versus 12.4% for vanilla PPO, driven by homeostatic curiosity regulation.

## Method Summary
EILS wraps PPO with an Internal State Module (ISM) that computes three homeostatic signals: Stress (σ) from negative TD errors, Curiosity (κ) from forward dynamics model prediction error, and Confidence (φ) from value function variance. These signals modulate learning rate, entropy coefficient, and clip range respectively. The ISM adds <5% computational overhead and operates in O(1) time via exponential moving averages. EILS is tested on Dynamic CartPole (physics shift), Sparse Maze (20×20 GridWorld), and Cognitive Reversal tasks.

## Key Results
- Dynamic CartPole: 94% faster recovery (episodes to ≥195 reward) via stress-triggered learning rate modulation
- Sparse Maze: 88.7% success rate vs 12.4% for vanilla PPO via homeostatic curiosity regulation
- Computational overhead: <5% additional cost from ISM and forward dynamics model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Stress-Triggered Plasticity Recovery
Accumulating negative prediction errors signal distribution shift, triggering rapid learning rate increases for policy restructure. Stress (σ_t) computed as EMA of ReLU-rectified negative TD-error. Learning rate modulated via α_t = α_base · (1 + λ_σ · tanh(σ_t)). When environment shifts, negative TD-errors spike → σ_t rises → α_t boosts up to 6× base rate, enabling "unlearning" of obsolete behaviors.

### Mechanism 2: Homeostatic Curiosity-Entropy Regulation
Forward dynamics model error drives exploration through entropy bonus, regulated by setpoint to prevent fixation on inherently unpredictable states. Curiosity (κ_t) = EMA of ||f_dyn(s_t, a_t) - s_{t+1}||². Entropy coefficient β_t = β_min + (β_max - β_min) · sigmoid(κ_set - κ_t). When κ_t < κ_set (boredom), sigmoid increases → β_t rises → policy entropy forced up.

### Mechanism 3: Confidence-Adapted Trust Regions
Value function stability inversely modulates PPO clip range, protecting converged policies from catastrophic updates. Confidence (φ_t) = 1 / (1 + Var(V_{t-H:t})). Clip range ε_t = ε_base · (1 - λ_φ · φ_t). When φ_t ≈ 1 (stable values), ε_t shrinks → policy updates constrained.

## Foundational Learning

- **Temporal Difference (TD) Error**
  - Why needed here: δ_t = r_t + γV(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t) is the raw signal for Stress calculation (rectified negative component only)
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why EILS uses ReLU(-δ_t) rather than |δ_t| for stress?

- **Forward Dynamics Models in RL**
  - Why needed here: The f_dyn(s_t, a_t) → ŝ_{t+1} predictor provides curiosity signal via prediction error; trained self-supervised
  - Quick check question: What's the "Noisy-TV problem" and how does EILS's homeostatic setpoint address it?

- **PPO Trust Regions (Clip Range)**
  - Why needed here: EILS modulates ε adaptively via Confidence; understanding why clip range protects policies is prerequisite
  - Quick check question: Why would shrinking clip range when φ_t is high protect against catastrophic forgetting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Policy Network (π_θ) -> Value Head (V_ω) -> TD Error Computation -> Stress Signal (σ_t) -> Learning Rate Modulation; Forward Dynamics Model (f_ψ) -> Curiosity Signal (κ_t) -> Entropy Coefficient Modulation; Value Buffer -> Confidence Signal (φ_t) -> Clip Range Modulation

- **Critical path**: Environment step → collect (s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1}) → Compute δ_t → update σ_t via EMA → Compute forward model error → update κ_t via EMA → Update V(s) buffer → compute Var → update φ_t → Apply modulation: α_t, β_t, ε_t = g(ISM) → PPO update with adaptive hyperparameters → Train forward model on prediction loss

- **Design tradeoffs**: Stress decay η_σ: Lower = longer emotional memory (better for sparse rewards), but slower recovery from false alarms; Curiosity setpoint κ_set: Higher = more persistent exploration, but risk of never exploiting; Modulation gains (λ_σ, λ_φ): Too high = hyper-reactive; too low = negligible effect; Forward model capacity: Larger models track complex dynamics but add overhead

- **Failure signatures**: Chronic high stress: Learning rate perpetually elevated → loss divergence (check: is environment non-stationary or just noisy?); Stuck in exploration: κ_t never decays → β_t stays high → no convergence (check: is environment inherently stochastic?); Premature rigidity: φ_t → 1 too early → ε_t collapses → can't adapt (check: is value function actually converged or undertrained?)

- **First 3 experiments**: Static CartPole baseline: Verify EILS doesn't harm standard performance; Ablation on Dynamic CartPole: Run EILS-Full vs EILS-NoStress (λ_σ=0) vs EILS-NoCuriosity (κ fixed); Sparse reward scaling test: GridWorld with varying sparsity (1 goal vs 3 goals)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can internal confidence signals (ϕ_t) effectively mitigate hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) during open-ended generation? The Conclusion explicitly states future work will "explore the application of EILS to Large Language Models... exploring whether internal confidence signals can mitigate hallucination." This remains unresolved as current experiments are restricted to DRL control tasks.

### Open Question 2
Can the sensitivity hyperparameters (λ_σ, λ_κ) be meta-learned automatically to prevent hyper-reactivity in noisy environments? Section VII.C notes that EILS introduces new hyperparameters that require tuning and explicitly proposes that "Future work will explore meta-learning these sensitivities automatically." Currently, modulation gains are tuned via grid search, risking misinterpretation of stochastic noise as distribution shift.

### Open Question 3
Does EILS maintain its computational efficiency and adaptation capabilities when scaled to high-dimensional continuous control or visual domains? While the paper claims scalability, the "Experimental Setup" tests only low-dimensional, simple environments. It is unclear if the Forward Dynamics Model can handle high-dimensional visual state spaces without significant overhead or instability.

## Limitations

- Introduces new hyperparameters (η_σ, κ_set, λ_φ) whose optimal values depend heavily on environment characteristics
- Generalization to continuous control tasks and truly stochastic environments remains untested
- Computational overhead claims (<5%) assume lightweight Forward Dynamics Model implementation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Dynamic CartPole recovery times (94% faster) - directly measurable from episode data
- **Medium Confidence**: Sparse Maze success rate improvements (88.7% vs 12.4%) - relies on specific environment implementation
- **Medium Confidence**: <5% computational overhead - measurement depends on hardware baseline
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about preventing "catastrophic forgetting" in continuous tasks - not empirically demonstrated

## Next Checks

1. **Noise Sensitivity Test**: Run Dynamic CartPole with injected observation noise (Gaussian σ=0.1) to verify Stress signal doesn't overreact to stochasticity rather than distribution shift
2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary η_σ ∈ {0.95, 0.99, 0.999} and κ_set ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 1.0} across all three environments to characterize performance bounds
3. **Computational Profiling**: Measure wall-clock time per PPO step for EILS vs vanilla PPO across different Forward Model sizes (hidden layers: 64, 128, 256 units) to verify claimed overhead
