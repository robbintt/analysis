# Quantifying Adversarial Uncertainty in Evidential Deep Learning using Conflict Resolution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.05937
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05937
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Post-hoc method that reduces OOD coverage by up to 55% and adversarial coverage by up to 90% without retraining

## Executive Summary
C-EDL introduces a post-hoc uncertainty quantification method for evidential deep learning that enhances robustness to out-of-distribution and adversarial inputs. The method generates diverse, label-preserving transformations of each input, quantifies disagreement across these views through intra- and inter-class conflict measures, and applies conflict-aware evidence reduction when needed. C-EDL requires no retraining and adds minimal computational overhead while maintaining near-ceiling accuracy on clean in-distribution data.

Extensive experiments across nine datasets show C-EDL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for both OOD detection and adversarial robustness. The method provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates that effectively separate ID from OOD and adversarial inputs across multiple decision thresholds, achieving up to 90% reduction in adversarial coverage compared to baseline EDL models.

## Method Summary
C-EDL operates on pre-trained evidential deep learning models by generating T metamorphic transformations of each input (e.g., rotation, shift, noise), passing each through the frozen EDL model to collect Dirichlet parameter vectors, then computing conflict scores that measure disagreement across transformations. The method calculates both intra-class variability (Cintra) and inter-class contradiction (Cinter), combining them into a bounded conflict score C ∈ (0,1]. When conflict exceeds thresholds, evidence is reduced proportionally using exponential decay exp(-δC), which increases uncertainty mass while preserving relative class rankings. This post-hoc approach requires no retraining and adds only linear computational overhead relative to the number of transformations.

## Key Results
- Reduces OOD coverage by up to 55% compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- Reduces adversarial coverage by up to 90% against gradient-based (L2PGD, FGSM) and non-gradient (Salt-and-Pepper) attacks
- Maintains near-ceiling ID accuracy (95-99%) while dramatically improving uncertainty separation
- Metamorphic transformations consistently outperform Monte Carlo sampling alternatives
- Works across multiple datasets including MNIST variants, CIFAR, SVHN, Oxford Flowers, and Deep Weeds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Diverse, label-preserving transformations expose representational disagreement that correlates with out-of-distribution and adversarial inputs.
- **Mechanism:** C-EDL applies T metamorphic transformations to each input, passes each through a frozen EDL model, and collects the resulting Dirichlet parameter vectors. When the model lacks invariance to semantically equivalent perturbations, evidence vectors diverge—signaling epistemic uncertainty.
- **Core assumption:** Transformation invariance holds for in-distribution data but breaks for OOD/adversarial inputs.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.1]: "Each τt(x) serves as a distinct but semantically equivalent view... its outputs across {τt(x)} can differ, providing a signal of uncertainty."
  - [Section 5.1]: "Metamorphic transformations consistently outperform Monte Carlo sampling... structured and semantically controlled perturbations yield better OOD and adversarial detection."
  - [corpus]: Related work on density-aware EDL (arXiv:2602.01477) similarly leverages feature space density for improved calibration under shift.
- **Break condition:** If transformations corrupt semantic content or if the model is already highly invariant to chosen augmentations, disagreement signal weakens.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Combined intra-class variability and inter-class contradiction provide a bounded conflict score C ∈ (0,1] that monotonically increases with representational disagreement.
- **Mechanism:** Cintra measures normalized evidence fluctuation per class across transformations (coefficient of variation). Cinter measures pairwise class contradiction when multiple classes receive high evidence simultaneously. These combine via inclusion-exclusion (Equation 7) with a quadratic penalty on asymmetric disagreement controlled by λ.
- **Core assumption:** Both instability of evidence per class AND competing class activations indicate genuine model uncertainty rather than noise.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.2]: "C tends towards 0 if and only if all transformations produce identical Dirichlet parameters concentrated on a single class."
  - [Appendix A.1]: Formal proof of monotonicity for λ ∈ [0, ½].
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; corpus papers focus on single-view uncertainty quantification.
- **Break condition:** If λ > 0.5, monotonicity is lost (quadratic penalty overpowers linear terms). Theorem 1 guarantees only break at asymmetric conflict extremes.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Conflict-proportional evidence reduction via exponential decay (exp(-δC)) amplifies uncertainty mass while preserving relative class rankings.
- **Mechanism:** Aggregated Dirichlet parameters are scaled by exp(-δC). When C is high, total Dirichlet strength Š drops, directly increasing uncertainty mass ũ = K/Š (Equation 10). This is post-hoc—no gradient updates or retraining.
- **Core assumption:** Evidence magnitude correlates with confidence; reducing magnitude proportionally to conflict calibrates uncertainty without changing the prediction's argmax.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.2]: "This decay operation ensures that the shape of the original distribution remains unchanged, while the magnitude of evidence is reduced proportionally to conflict."
  - [Table 1]: C-EDL maintains near-ceiling ID accuracy (95-99%) while dramatically reducing OOD/adversarial coverage.
  - [corpus]: Density-Informed Pseudo-Counts (arXiv:2602.01477) similarly scales evidence post-hoc using density estimates, achieving comparable calibration gains.
- **Break condition:** If δ is set too high, even moderate conflict can collapse evidence to near-zero, causing excessive abstention on legitimate ID data (see ablation Table 6: δ=2.0 reduces ID coverage to 77.5%).

## Foundational Learning

- **Dirichlet Distribution Parameterization**
  - Why needed here: EDL outputs Dirichlet parameters α (not logits). Understanding how α relates to belief (bk), uncertainty (u), and expected probabilities is essential.
  - Quick check question: If α = [5, 2, 1] for a 3-class problem, what is the uncertainty mass u? (Answer: u = K/S = 3/8 = 0.375)

- **Evidence vs. Probability Distinction**
  - Why needed here: C-EDL operates on evidence vectors, not probabilities. Evidence is non-negative and additive; probability is normalized.
  - Quick check question: Why does reducing α_k values increase uncertainty without changing which class has highest probability? (Answer: Uncertainty u = K/S depends on sum; ranking depends on ratios, preserved by uniform scaling.)

- **Post-Hoc vs. In-Training Methods**
  - Why needed here: C-EDL requires a pre-trained EDL model. Understanding what can be modified post-hoc (evidence aggregation, scaling) vs. what requires retraining (network weights) clarifies integration paths.
  - Quick check question: Can C-EDL improve a model trained with cross-entropy loss? (Answer: No—requires EDL-trained model that outputs Dirichlet parameters.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input x → T Metamorphic Transformations {τ₁...τₜ} → T×EDL Forward Passes → Evidence Set A = {α⁽¹⁾...α⁽ᵀ⁾} → Conflict Calculation (Cintra + Cinter → C) → Evidence Reduction (α̃ = ᾱ × exp(-δC)) → Final Dirichlet {beliefs, uncertainty, probabilities}

- **Critical path:**
  1. Transformation selection (must be label-preserving for ID data)
  2. Pre-trained EDL model quality (C-EDL inherits its calibration)
  3. Conflict threshold sensitivity (δ parameter)
  4. ID-OOD threshold selection (differential entropy, mutual information, or total evidence)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - T (transformations): More T → better conflict signal but linear inference cost increase (Table 6: T=50 takes 48.3s vs. T=5 at 5.1s)
  - δ (decay sensitivity): Higher δ → more aggressive abstention, lower ID coverage
  - Transformation strength: Stronger augmentations → better OOD/adversarial detection but potential ID coverage drop (Table 8: ±30° rotation reduces ID coverage by 8.6%)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Excessive ID abstention (>10% drop from baseline): δ too high or transformations too aggressive
  - Poor OOD separation (OOD coverage > ID coverage): T too low or transformation set lacks diversity
  - Non-monotonic behavior under increasing perturbation: λ set > 0.5 (breaks Theorem 1 guarantee)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline sanity check:** Apply C-EDL to pre-trained EDL on MNIST→FashionMNIST with T=5, δ=1.0, default transformations. Verify ID accuracy >95%, OOD coverage drops vs. vanilla EDL.
  2. **Ablation sweep δ:** Fix T=5, vary δ ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 1.5}. Plot ID coverage vs. adversarial coverage tradeoff curve to select operating point.
  3. **Transformation diversity test:** Compare rotate-only vs. shift-only vs. noise-only vs. combined. Measure OOD/adversarial coverage reduction per transformation type to identify minimal effective set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can C-EDL be effectively adapted to object detection tasks while maintaining its robustness to OOD and adversarial inputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in their conclusion: "Future research directions include exploring the C-EDL adaptation to detection tasks."
- Why unresolved: C-EDL was designed and evaluated only on image classification tasks. Object detection introduces additional complexities including bounding box regression, multi-scale predictions, and class imbalance that may interact differently with the conflict resolution mechanism.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and evaluation of C-EDL on standard detection benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Pascal VOC), measuring both detection accuracy and uncertainty calibration for ID, OOD, and adversarial inputs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the minimal set of metamorphic transformations required to achieve near-optimal OOD and adversarial detection performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify this as a future direction: "empowering C-EDL to search for the smallest set of augmentations without sacrificing performance."
- Why unresolved: The ablation study (Table 6) shows a trade-off between transformation count T and performance, but does not systematically explore which specific transformations are most critical or whether adaptive/sparse transformation selection could reduce computational overhead while preserving robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study quantifying the contribution of each transformation type (rotation, shift, noise) to OOD/adversarial detection across different datasets and attack types, followed by development of an adaptive transformation selection mechanism.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does C-EDL perform on non-image modalities such as text, audio, and tabular data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] All experiments were conducted exclusively on image datasets (MNIST variants, CIFAR, Flowers, Weeds). The metamorphic transformations used (rotation, shift, noise) are image-specific.
- Why unresolved: Different data modalities require different notions of "label-preserving transformations." It remains unclear whether the conflict resolution mechanism generalizes or requires modality-specific redesign.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of C-EDL on text classification (with synonym substitution, back-translation as transformations), audio classification, and tabular data tasks, comparing against modality-appropriate baselines.

## Limitations
- Dataset generalization gap: All experiments focus on standard computer vision benchmarks; effectiveness on specialized domains (medical imaging, time-series) remains untested
- Transformation sensitivity: Performance critically depends on selecting appropriate label-preserving transformations, which may not be obvious for all domains
- No theoretical calibration guarantees: Despite empirical success, lacks formal guarantees about uncertainty calibration under distribution shift

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Claims about maintaining near-ceiling ID accuracy (95-99%) are strongly supported by extensive experiments across 9 datasets
- **Medium confidence:** Claims about C-EDL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods (up to 55% reduction in OOD coverage, 90% reduction in adversarial coverage) are well-supported within tested domains but may not generalize to all data types
- **Low confidence:** Claims about C-EDL's applicability to non-image domains or performance with alternative transformation sets are speculative, as paper only tests image-specific augmentations

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain robustness test:** Apply C-EDL to non-image datasets (e.g., UCI datasets, time-series, or text classification) using modality-appropriate transformations. Measure whether the 55% OOD and 90% adversarial coverage reductions hold.

2. **Transformation ablation study:** Systematically vary transformation strength parameters (±5° to ±45° rotation, ±1 to ±10 pixel shift) and measure the tradeoff between ID coverage preservation and OOD/adversarial detection performance. Identify the optimal transformation strength per dataset.

3. **Calibration benchmarking:** Conduct proper calibration analysis (e.g., Expected Calibration Error, reliability diagrams) comparing C-EDL against vanilla EDL and other uncertainty quantification methods across in-distribution, OOD, and adversarial test sets. Verify that uncertainty estimates are not just discriminative but also well-calibrated.
