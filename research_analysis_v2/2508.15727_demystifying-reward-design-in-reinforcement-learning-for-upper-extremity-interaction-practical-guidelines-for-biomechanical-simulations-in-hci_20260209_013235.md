- Authors propose systematic guidelines for designing reward functions in RL-based biomechanical simulations of upper extremity interaction in HCI

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of designing effective reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL)-based biomechanical simulations of upper extremity interaction in human-computer interaction (HCI). The authors systematically analyze the impact of three key reward components—task completion bonuses, distance-based guidance, and effort minimization—on tasks like pointing, tracking, and choice reaction. Through over 500 trained policies, they demonstrate that task success and completion times are robust to weight changes within reasonable ranges, as long as basic principles are followed. The study proposes practical, sequential guidelines for reward function design, validated on keyboard typing and remote control tasks, demonstrating their applicability across diverse HCI scenarios.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted systematic experiments using the User-in-the-Box framework with the MoBL Arms Model (5 DoFs, 26 muscles) to evaluate how different reward components affect learning outcomes. They trained policies using SAC algorithm with modular reward functions combining task bonuses, distance terms (absolute, squared, exponential), and optional effort models (EJK, DC, CTC, JAC). The study varied reward weights across multiple tasks (pointing, tracking, choice reaction, keyboard typing, remote control) and analyzed success rates, completion times, and movement regularity. Over 500 policies were trained and analyzed, with results validated on new tasks including keyboard typing and remote control.

## Key Results
- Distance guidance is essential for learning goal-directed movements; agents fail to complete tasks without it
- Task completion bonuses ensure task success by forcing agents to learn specific action patterns (force, timing, precision)
- Effort terms are optional for task success but help regularize movement quality when appropriately scaled; excessive effort penalties prevent movement initiation
- Success rates and completion times are robust to weight changes within reasonable ranges when following basic reward design principles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Distance-based guidance terms are necessary for learning goal-directed movements in sparse-reward biomechanical tasks.
- Mechanism: Distance rewards provide dense, continuous feedback that creates a gradient toward target states, enabling credit assignment across long action sequences where sparse task bonuses alone fail to propagate learning signals.
- Core assumption: The biomechanical agent can learn smooth motor control when given continuous proximity feedback, but cannot discover goal-directed behavior from sparse rewards alone due to high-dimensional action spaces and complex dynamics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that proximity incentives are essential for guiding movement, while completion bonuses ensure task success."
  - [section 4.1.1] "With task bonus only... agents fail to learn generalized behavior... With distance term only... agents learn to identify the correct button and move towards it, they fail to press buttons properly and resort to side contacts."
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support; related work (What Makes a Model Breathe?) discusses reward component interplay but does not isolate distance guidance as a necessary condition.
- Break condition: If the task already provides frequent, informative reward signals (e.g., continuous tracking with dense performance metrics), distance guidance may become redundant or introduce conflicting gradients.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Task completion bonuses convert proximity behavior into successful task execution by incentivizing the final, often constraint-based action (e.g., pressing with sufficient force, maintaining dwell time).
- Mechanism: A sparse bonus awarded only upon successful completion creates a non-negotiable objective that forces the agent to learn the specific action patterns (force, timing, precision) required to satisfy task constraints, which distance rewards alone do not encode.
- Core assumption: The agent has already learned to approach the target via distance guidance; the bonus then shapes the final phase of behavior to meet task-specific success criteria.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...task bonuses ensure task success."
  - [section 4.1.1] "Combining distance and task bonus results in successful movements... with one caveat: the choice of the distance function influences the qualitative behavior..."
  - [section 4.3, G2] "Include a task bonus to ensure task success. Without this bonus, agents often adopt suboptimal strategies, such as touching buttons from the side..."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation; neighboring papers do not systematically isolate task bonus effects.
- Break condition: If the task success condition is trivially satisfied by proximity (e.g., simply reaching a location with no force or dwell requirements), the bonus becomes redundant with distance guidance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Effort terms are optional for task success but can regularize movement quality when appropriately scaled; excessive effort penalties prevent movement initiation.
- Mechanism: Effort penalties (e.g., jerk, torque change, squared muscle activations) shape the trajectory among the many redundant solutions that satisfy the task, favoring smoother or more efficient movements, but when overweighted they suppress exploration and prevent the agent from discovering any viable policy.
- Core assumption: The overactuated musculoskeletal system admits many solutions to the same task; effort terms select among them without altering task success if properly balanced.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Effort terms, though optional, help refine motion regularity when appropriately scaled."
  - [section 4.1.1] "Effort weights greater than 10 prevent the agent with the JAC, CTC, and EJK models from completing the task..."
  - [section 4.3, G4] "Try without effort models first. If instabilities arise (e.g., excessive trembling), add an effort model."
  - [corpus] Limited corpus support; related work discusses effort models for plausibility but not their optional role or failure modes.
- Break condition: If effort weight is set too high relative to distance/bonus weights, the agent will not move or will fail to reach the target; if task already induces smooth movements (e.g., tracking), effort terms may be unnecessary.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Reward shaping in RL** (dense vs. sparse rewards, potential-based shaping)
  - Why needed here: The entire paper is an empirical study of how to shape rewards for biomechanical RL; without understanding shaping fundamentals, the guidelines will seem ad-hoc.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why adding a distance term to a sparse bonus reward does not necessarily change the optimal policy?

- Concept: **Overactuated musculoskeletal control** (redundancy in joint/muscle activations)
  - Why needed here: Effort terms are only meaningful because there are infinitely many muscle activation patterns that achieve the same movement; understanding this clarifies why effort can be tuned without affecting task success.
  - Quick check question: Why does penalizing muscle activation magnitude not necessarily change where the hand ends up?

- Concept: **Fitts' Law and motor control principles** (speed-accuracy tradeoffs, movement regularity)
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates plausibility in part by whether movements exhibit known motor control characteristics; interpreting results requires knowing what "plausible" movement looks like.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for a simulated movement to "follow Fitts' Law"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SAC Agent -> Reward Function (Task Bonus + Distance Term + Optional Effort) -> User-in-the-Box Environment -> MoBL Arms Model (5 DoFs, 26 muscles)
- Critical path:
  1. Implement distance term using MuJoCo distance sensors between fingertip and target
  2. Add sparse task bonus triggered by success condition (button press, dwell time, etc.)
  3. Train policy; only add effort term if movement instabilities (trembling, jitter) appear
  4. Tune weights: bonus weight high enough to ensure completion (0.5–100 range worked); distance weight ≥1; effort weight <2 unless movement quality issues persist
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Exponential vs. absolute vs. squared distance: exponential shows more variability across effort models; absolute most robust; squared can slow completion
  - Effort model choice: DC (squared muscle controls) most robust to weight changes; JAC/CTC more sensitive
  - Bonus weight: too low → agent approaches but doesn't complete; too high → slower training convergence
- Failure signatures:
  - Agent approaches target but doesn't press/dwell → bonus weight too low or missing
  - Agent doesn't move at all → effort weight too high or bonus-only reward
  - Agent touches target from side, wrong angle → distance-only reward, missing task bonus
  - Trembling, jittery movement → add effort term or reduce distance weight
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with exponential distance (w=1) + task bonus (w=8), no effort term; verify >90% success rate
  2. If instabilities observed, add DC effort model (w=1) and compare smoothness metrics
  3. Systematically vary bonus weight (0.25, 0.5, 8, 50) with fixed distance/effort to identify minimum viable bonus for your task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How do the proposed reward design guidelines generalize to biomechanical models that include head or eye movements, or actuable fingers?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work should also test our guidelines for a wider range of biomechanical models, e.g., including head or eye movements or actuable fingers"
  - Why unresolved: The study only evaluated the MoBL Arms Model with 5 DoFs and 26 muscles, leaving untested whether the guidelines transfer to models with different actuation patterns and degrees of freedom.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Apply the sequential guidelines to models with head/eye articulation or finger actuation; compare success rates, completion times, and movement plausibility across configurations.

- Question: What quantitative metrics can reliably assess motion plausibility of predicted movements while reducing reliance on subjective manual video inspection?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors call for "more quantitative metrics to assess the motion plausibility of predicted movements and reduce reliance on manual inspection of movement videos prone to subjectivity"
  - Why unresolved: Current evaluation relies on qualitative behavioral observations from evaluation videos, which introduces subjectivity and limits scalability of assessment.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Develop and validate automated metrics (e.g., kinematic similarity to human motion capture data, compliance with established motor laws like Fitts' Law) that correlate with expert human judgment of plausibility.

- Question: How do shaped reward terms systematically bias learned behaviors toward certain targets or body postures?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "potential biases introduced by shaped reward terms, such as favoring certain targets or body postures, require further investigation to ensure that learned behaviors remain natural and unbiased"
  - Why unresolved: The paper observed qualitative differences (e.g., absolute vs. squared distance terms causing agents to remain left vs. right of targets), but the systematic nature and causes of these biases remain uncharacterized.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Systematically vary target positions and postures while measuring whether specific distance formulations produce consistent directional or postural preferences.

- Question: How do additional reward components such as ergonomics, novelty, or multi-agent collaboration interact with the three core components (distance, bonus, effort)?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "Moreover, additional reward components incentivizing aspects beyond success criteria such as ergonomics (e.g. reducing discomfort or pain), novelty or multi-agent collaboration could be integrated. The interplay between these additional factors and the three core reward components considered in this paper warrants further investigation."
  - Why unresolved: The study deliberately constrained scope to three components; real-world HCI applications often require modeling fatigue, discomfort, or collaborative scenarios.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Augment the reward function with ergonomic or collaborative terms; analyze sensitivity and trade-offs between these and the core components.

## Limitations
- The study only evaluated one musculoskeletal model (MoBL Arms with 5 DoFs, 26 muscles), limiting generalizability to other biomechanical configurations
- Effort model coefficients were not systematically optimized, relying instead on literature values
- SAC hyperparameters were not explored, potentially affecting the robustness of the reward design principles
- Manual video inspection introduces subjectivity in assessing movement plausibility

## Confidence

- High confidence: The necessity of distance guidance for task completion and the role of task bonuses in ensuring successful execution are well-supported by consistent failure patterns across multiple task types
- Medium confidence: The optional nature of effort terms and their scaling thresholds are empirically validated but may depend on specific musculoskeletal model parameters and task contexts not fully explored
- Low confidence: Cross-task generalizability beyond the validated scenarios (pointing, tracking, choice reaction, keyboard typing, remote control) requires further testing

## Next Checks
1. Test the reward design guidelines on a fundamentally different HCI task (e.g., handwriting or manipulation) to assess generalizability beyond upper extremity pointing and selection
2. Conduct hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for SAC (learning rate, entropy coefficient) to determine robustness of the reward design principles to RL algorithm configuration
3. Systematically vary effort model coefficients (c1, c2, c3) to identify optimal scaling relationships and validate whether current "informed by literature" values are task-optimal
