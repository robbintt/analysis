# Value Under Ignorance in Universal Artificial Intelligence

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17086

- This paper extends AIXI to general utility functions and rigorously handles semimeasure loss via Carathéodory extension theorem

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental limitation of AIXI's reward-based utility functions by extending universal artificial intelligence to arbitrary continuous utility functions on interaction histories. The key innovation is a rigorous mathematical framework for handling defective semimeasures (which arise from uncomputable environments) by interpreting the "lost" probability mass as either genuine termination events or total epistemic ignorance. The authors prove that pre-semimeasures on cylinder sets can be uniquely extended to termination semimeasures on Cantor space, enabling integration of general utility functions via Choquet integrals. This recovers standard AIXI as a special case while providing theoretical foundations for modular utility design in universal agents.

## Method Summary
The authors employ Carathéodory's extension theorem to bridge from superadditive functions on cylinder sets (pre-semimeasures) to measures on σ-algebras, creating termination semimeasures that assign lost probability mass to finite termination events. They establish equivalence between Choquet integrals with respect to semimeasures and Lebesgue integrals with respect to the extended probability measures. By relating these Choquet integrals to recursive value functions, they recover standard AIXI while enabling integration of general utility functions. The framework characterizes when optimal policies exist (for continuous utilities) and analyzes computability properties, finding that Choquet-based value functions are lower semicomputable under certain conditions.

## Key Results
- Pre-semimeasures on cylinder sets can be uniquely extended to termination semimeasures on Cantor space via Carathéodory's extension theorem
- Choquet integral with respect to a semimeasure equals Lebesgue integral with respect to the extended probability measure
- The Choquet integral equals minimum expected utility over the credal set Core(ν), recovering standard AIXI as special case
- Optimal policies exist for continuous utility functions; value functions are lower semicomputable under specific conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-semimeasures on cylinder sets can be uniquely extended to full semimeasures on a σ-algebra, enabling rigorous integration of utility functions.
- Mechanism: Carathéodory's extension theorem bridges from superadditive functions on cylinder sets to measures on σ-algebras. The "lost" probability mass (semimeasure loss L_ν(x) = ν(x) - Σ_a ν(xa)) is assigned to finite termination events, creating a termination semimeasure over Ω' = A* ∪ A^∞.
- Core assumption: The semimeasure loss represents either genuine termination probability or epistemic limitation—not mathematical error.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "They rigorously extend pre-semimeasures to termination semimeasures on Cantor space using Carathéodory's extension theorem"
  - [section 4, Theorem 7] Full proof that ν₀ extends uniquely to P on (Ω', F') with ν(S) := Σ_{xA^∞⊆S} P(x) + P(S)
  - [corpus] Related work on embedded agency failures (arxiv:2505.17882) discusses semimeasure defects but doesn't provide this extension
- Break condition: If semimeasure loss cannot be interpreted as either death or ignorance, the extension lacks semantic grounding.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Choquet integral with respect to a semimeasure equals the Lebesgue integral with respect to the extended probability measure P_ν.
- Mechanism: For non-negative f, ∫_C f dν = ∫ f dP_ν where f'(ω) = f(ω) and f'(x) = inf_{ω∈xA^∞} f(ω) for finite sequences. This connects imprecise probability integration to standard measure theory.
- Core assumption: The utility function is measurable and the semimeasure is a termination semimeasure (constructed via the extension theorem).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By relating Choquet integrals to recursive value functions, they recover standard AIXI as a special case"
  - [section 6, Lemma 12] Direct statement: ∫ f dP_ν = ∫_C f dν
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; corpus papers don't address Choquet integration
- Break condition: If f is not bounded below on cylinders, the infimum assignment fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Choquet integral equals the minimum expected utility over the credal set Core(ν), making it pessimistic by construction.
- Mechanism: Core(ν) = {probability measures p : p(A) ≥ ν(A) ∀A}. The Choquet integral's min-over-core structure concentrates semimeasure loss on worst-case continuations, which—when utility is cumulative reward—recovers the recursive value function (death = zero future rewards).
- Core assumption: Decision-making under imprecise probability should use max-min (pessimistic) reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6, p.9] "C∫ f dν = min_{p∈Core(ν)} ∫ f dp" with reference to Gilboa & Schmeidler
  - [section 6, p.9-10] Explains why this recovers V^π_ν: worst histories have r_{t+1:∞} = 0
  - [corpus] No corpus papers engage with this specific result
- Break condition: If utility functions can assign negative values to "death" states, the equivalence with recursive value fails (see perilous environment example).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Pre-semimeasures vs. Measures**
  - Why needed here: Pre-semimeasures only satisfy ν(x) ≥ Σ_a ν(xa) (superadditivity), not additivity. This defect is the central problem the paper solves.
  - Quick check question: Given ν₀(ϵ) = 1 and ν₀(x) = 2^(-|x|-1) for |x| > 0, what is the semimeasure loss at the empty string?

- Concept: **Cantor Space Topology**
  - Why needed here: Interaction histories are infinite sequences; cylinder sets (sequences sharing a prefix) generate the topology. Continuity of utility functions is defined relative to this topology.
  - Quick check question: Is the function f(ω) = "length of longest run of 0s in ω" continuous on Cantor space?

- Concept: **Choquet Integral**
  - Why needed here: Standard expectation requires probability measures. The Choquet integral ∫_C f dν = ∫₀^∞ ν(f ≥ b)db generalizes integration to capacities (non-additive set functions).
  - Quick check question: For a semimeasure ν with ν(Ω) = 0.8, how does the Choquet integral of f ≡ 1 differ from 1?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Pre-semimeasure ν₀**: Defined on cylinder sets; represents agent's belief over interaction histories
  - **Extension operator**: Maps ν₀ → (P_ν, ν) via Carathéodory; P_ν is on Ω' = A* ∪ A^∞, ν on Ω = A^∞
  - **Utility function u**: H* ∪ H^∞ → ℝ^+, must be continuous for optimal policy existence
  - **Value function V^π_{ν,u}**: Either ∫ u dP_ν (Lebesgue) or ∫_C u dν (Choquet)—equivalent under conditions
  - **Credal set Core(ν)**: All probability measures dominating ν; enables alternative decision rules

- Critical path:
  1. Define pre-semimeasure on action-percept cylinders
  2. Apply Carathéodory extension → termination semimeasure
  3. Choose interpretation: death (assign utilities to finite histories) or ignorance (use Choquet/credal set)
  4. For Choquet path: verify u is l.s.c. → V^π_{ν,u} is l.s.c. → can approximate optimal policy
  5. For death path: ensure 0 ∈ R if using reward-sum utility, else lower semicomputability may fail

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Death vs. Ignorance interpretation**: Death interpretation is more intuitive but may break computability; ignorance (Choquet) preserves l.s.c. but requires pessimistic decision rule
  - **Lebesgue vs. Choquet integral**: Equivalent when u matches the extended-space formulation; Choquet is better behaved computationally
  - **Continuous vs. discontinuous utility**: Discontinuous utilities may have no optimal policy (Example 15)

- Failure signatures:
  - **No optimal policy exists**: Utility function not continuous; check for "always better to delay" patterns
  - **Value function not lower semicomputable**: Using death interpretation with negative rewards and no zero in reward set
  - **Integration undefined**: Pre-semimeasure not properly extended to σ-algebra

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Verify Theorem 7 extension**: Implement pre-semimeasure → termination semimeasure for simple defective environment (Example 8's ν_d with binary alphabet); confirm P(ϵ) = 1/2, P(B^∞) = 1/2
  2. **Test Choquet = recursive value**: For environment with 0 in reward set, compute both C∫ (Σ_t γ^t r_t) dν^π and V^π_ν directly; verify equality per Theorem 11
  3. **Lower semicomputability stress test**: Construct utility u_r with R excluding 0 and including negative values; demonstrate that V^π_{ν,u_r} fails to be l.s.c. even when u_r is continuous

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a philosophically justified normalization scheme for semimeasures be developed that improves upon Solomonoff normalization while preserving computability properties?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We might instead search for a philosophically justified normalization, following Solomonoff."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies normalization as an alternative to the Choquet integral approach but does not develop or compare specific normalization schemes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal characterization of normalization properties that preserve lower semicomputability while addressing the semimeasure loss ambiguity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What utility function classes beyond continuous functions yield optimal policies with tractable hypercomputability levels (e.g., Δ⁰₂ or lower in the arithmetic hierarchy)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "In future work, we intend to investigate an even larger class of utility functions with hypercomputability levels higher in the arithmetic hierarchy."
- Why unresolved: The current work establishes results only for continuous utility functions and lower semicomputable value functions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Classification theorems mapping utility function properties (e.g., discontinuity type, unboundedness) to specific arithmetic hierarchy levels.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the semimeasure loss in universal agents correlate with actual termination probabilities in any natural class of environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We are not aware of strong arguments that the semimeasure loss tends to coincide with a chance of death."
- Why unresolved: The paper presents two interpretations (death vs. total ignorance) but provides no criterion for selecting between them or evidence they coincide empirically.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal theorems relating Lᵥ(x) to objective termination frequencies under specific environment classes, or counterexamples showing divergence.

## Limitations
- The philosophical interpretation of semimeasure loss as either termination probability or epistemic ignorance remains ambiguous
- Practical implementation of universal mixtures with uncomputable weights w_ν = 2^{-K(ν)} is not addressed
- Lower semicomputability results depend on specific conditions (e.g., reward set containing zero) that may not hold in all applications

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The extension of pre-semimeasures to termination semimeasures via Carathéodory's theorem (Theorem 7), and the equivalence between Choquet integrals and recursive value functions when reward set includes zero (Theorem 11)
- **Medium Confidence**: The characterization of optimal policy existence for continuous utility functions (Theorem 14) and the lower semicomputability results for Choquet-based value functions
- **Low Confidence**: The practical computability implications of the theoretical results, particularly regarding the implementation of universal mixtures with uncomputable weights w_ν = 2^{-K(ν)}

## Next Checks
1. **Implementation verification**: Code the semimeasure extension (Theorem 7) for Example 8's defective environment and verify the probability distribution P_ν matches theoretical predictions (P(ϵ) = 1/2, P(B^∞) = 1/2).

2. **Choquet-recursion equivalence test**: For a simple environment where reward set includes zero, implement both the Choquet integral calculation and direct recursive value function computation to verify Theorem 11's equality holds in practice.

3. **Failure mode demonstration**: Construct a continuous utility function excluding zero and including negative values, then demonstrate that the resulting value function fails to be lower semicomputable, illustrating the importance of Assumption 1's conditions.
