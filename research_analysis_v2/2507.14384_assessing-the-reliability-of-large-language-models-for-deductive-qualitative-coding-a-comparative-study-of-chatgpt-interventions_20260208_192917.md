# Assessing the Reliability of Large Language Models for Deductive Qualitative Coding: A Comparative Study of ChatGPT Interventions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.14384
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14384
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Primary result**: Step-by-Step Task Decomposition intervention achieved accuracy = 0.775, kappa = 0.744, alpha = 0.746, meeting substantial agreement thresholds

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates ChatGPT's performance for structured deductive qualitative coding using the Comparative Agendas Project Master Codebook across four intervention strategies. The Step-by-Step Task Decomposition method significantly outperformed other approaches, achieving substantial inter-rater reliability (kappa = 0.744, alpha = 0.746) while demonstrating stable agreement across repeated samples. The research confirms that targeted, custom-tailored interventions can produce reliability levels suitable for integration into rigorous qualitative coding workflows, particularly for legal text classification.

## Method Summary
The study tested four intervention strategies—zero-shot, few-shot, definition-based, and Step-by-Step Task Decomposition—on U.S. Supreme Court case summaries from the CAP dataset. Data was preprocessed to remove missing values, duplicates, and short summaries (<2 sentences), resulting in 9,330 tuples. Numeric labels were mapped to categorical strings to leverage ChatGPT's semantic understanding. Thirty stratified random samples of 50 cases each were used for chi-squared validity. The Step-by-Step approach forced explicit reasoning through actor identification, policy issue isolation, and criterion mapping before output.

## Key Results
- Step-by-Step Task Decomposition achieved the highest reliability (accuracy = 0.775, kappa = 0.744, alpha = 0.746)
- Intervention strategies significantly influenced classification behavior (Cramér's V values: 0.359 to 0.613)
- Categorical labels outperformed numerical labels by leveraging ChatGPT's prior semantic knowledge
- ChatGPT maintained high F1 scores in low-support subclasses despite semantic ambiguity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decomposing classification into explicit reasoning steps improves reliability by anchoring decisions to textual evidence.
- Mechanism: The Step-by-Step Task Decomposition intervention forces the model to identify actors/institutions, isolate the policy issue, map to class criteria, and articulate rationale before output—reducing semantic drift and premature commitment to broad categories.
- Core assumption: The model's reasoning chain reflects genuine evidence-to-label alignment rather than post-hoc justification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The Step-by-Step Task Decomposition strategy achieved the strongest reliability (accuracy = 0.775, kappa = 0.744, alpha = 0.746)."
  - [section 4.4.4] "ChatGPT was asked to identify the actors, institutions, and organizations involved, determine the policy issue at the center of the case, and evaluate whether it falls within one of the codified CAP major classes."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; related work on LLMs for qualitative analysis mentions alignment and calibration but does not isolate task decomposition as a mechanism.
- Break condition: If summaries exceed the model's effective context window or contain >3 competing thematic loci without explicit precedence rules, decomposition yields contradictory justifications.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Intervention design materially alters classification behavior, with effect sizes indicating practical—not just statistical—significance.
- Mechanism: Different prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, definitions, interactive) prime distinct priors and decision boundaries, producing divergent label distributions even on identical inputs.
- Core assumption: Cramér's V between methods reflects meaningful conceptual shifts rather than random variation or prompt artifacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Chi-squared and effect size analyses confirmed that intervention strategies significantly influenced classification behavior, with Cramér's V values ranging from 0.359 to 0.613."
  - [section 5.3] "The strongest divergence was observed between the few-shot and definition-based methods (χ2 = 1147.72, V = 0.613)."
  - [corpus] Weak; neighboring papers discuss consistency and calibration but do not report comparable effect-size analyses across prompt interventions.
- Break condition: If within-method variance exceeds between-method variance (e.g., under high label ambiguity), intervention effects become unstable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Categorical labels outperform numerical labels because they leverage the model's pre-existing semantic knowledge rather than requiring de novo association learning.
- Mechanism: The model maps text to concept labels directly via distributional semantics, bypassing the need to learn arbitrary numeric-to-concept mappings from limited examples.
- Core assumption: The model's pretraining includes sufficient exposure to policy-domain terminology and label semantics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "We found that ChatGPT performs significantly better with categorical labels than numerical labels... ChatGPT can leverage its prior contextual semantic understanding to apply nominal labels."
  - [abstract] Not explicitly stated; inferred from methods.
  - [corpus] Not directly addressed in neighboring papers.
- Break condition: If categorical labels share high semantic overlap (e.g., "Civil Rights" vs. "Labor" in entertainment-industry labor cases), prior knowledge introduces systematic bias rather than advantage.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Inter-rater reliability (Cohen's κ, Krippendorff's α)
  - Why needed here: These metrics distinguish raw agreement from chance-corrected consistency; the paper uses κ = 0.61–0.80 as "substantial" and α ≥ 0.667 as acceptable for tentative conclusions.
  - Quick check question: If κ = 0.74 and α = 0.75 for the interactive intervention, what reliability threshold does this meet?

- Concept: Deductive vs. inductive coding
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly tests deductive classification (applying a pre-defined codebook) rather than inductive theme discovery, which changes the validity criteria.
  - Quick check question: Does deductive coding require a pre-validated codebook, or can it emerge from the data?

- Concept: Stratified random sampling for chi-squared validity
  - Why needed here: The χ² test requires expected frequencies ≥5; stratification preserves class proportions while meeting this assumption across 30 samples of 50 cases each.
  - Quick check question: Why would simple random sampling risk violating chi-squared assumptions in skewed label distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input preprocessing -> Sampling layer -> Intervention module -> Evaluation layer -> Feedback loop

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess data and validate class distributions
  2. Run baseline (zero-shot) to establish floor performance
  3. Apply step-by-step intervention with cross-examination on training instances
  4. Generate classification; compute metrics; analyze errors
  5. Iterate until κ ≥ 0.70 or degradation threshold (~30–40 items) is observed

- Design tradeoffs:
  - RoBERTa achieves higher raw metrics (κ = 0.75) but lacks explainability; ChatGPT offers auditable reasoning chains at slight performance cost
  - More context (definitions, examples) increases volatility (higher within-method variance) vs. simpler prompts (more stable but lower performance)
  - Batch size limited by "instruction decay" observed at ~30–40 items per session

- Failure signatures:
  - High disagreement in semantically broad classes (Government Operations, Law and Crime) signals need for explicit precedence rules
  - Model defaulting to generic labels mid-batch indicates instruction decay
  - Consistent misalignment with ground truth on specific class pairs (e.g., Labor vs. Culture in entertainment cases) suggests implicit human-coder heuristics not captured in definitions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate zero-shot vs. step-by-step comparison on a held-out 500-case subset; confirm κ difference > 0.30
  2. Test instruction decay threshold: classify 100 cases in single session; measure κ sliding window every 10 items
  3. Add explicit precedence rules for high-disagreement classes (e.g., "apply Law and Crime only if no other category fits"); re-run step-by-step and compare Cramér's V reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the specific threshold for performance degradation ("instruction decay") in LLMs during extended deductive coding sessions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that performance degradation typically occurred between the 30th and 40th summary and state that "Robustly quantifying this threshold represents a promising direction for future research."
- Why unresolved: The study identified the existence of instruction decay qualitatively but did not rigorously measure the exact context window or token limit where reliability statistically significantly drops.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment varying batch sizes and measuring inter-rater reliability scores at specific intervals (e.g., every 10 summaries) to pinpoint the failure point.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does supplying LLMs with explicit, deterministic rules derived from experts improve classification accuracy compared to definition-based interventions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that "A potential method to avoid these mislabelings is to supply the model with explicit rules that deterministically produce label outputs... This suggests a path for a future study."
- Why unresolved: The current study tested definitions and examples but did not test rule-based heuristics (e.g., "if keyword X appears, always choose label Y") to resolve semantic ambiguity.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating a "Rule-Based" intervention against the "Definition-Based" and "Step-by-Step" interventions on the same dataset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the Step-by-Step Task Decomposition strategy maintain high reliability when applied to non-legal datasets or less structured codebooks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors answer Q3 ("Can a generative chatbot serve as a qualitative coding assistant?") provisionally, acknowledging that "further studies are needed to generalize these findings beyond our specific task" of legal summaries.
- Why unresolved: The findings are based solely on U.S. Supreme Court case summaries, which may have distinct semantic properties compared to interviews or ethnographic data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the Step-by-Step Task Decomposition method on qualitative datasets from different domains (e.g., healthcare interviews, social media) to verify if Kappa scores remain above 0.74.

## Limitations
- Findings confined to Supreme Court case summaries with pre-defined 21-class codebook, limiting generalizability
- Performance degradation after 30-40 items per session suggests scalability constraints for larger coding tasks
- Effect of semantic ambiguity in broad classes remains unresolved, with stability across different model versions unknown

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Interactive step-by-step prompting mechanism's effectiveness, supported by statistically significant improvements over baseline methods
- **Medium confidence**: Categorical label advantage claim, as this finding lacks direct citation support in the corpus
- **Low confidence**: Precise thresholds for instruction decay, which were inferred rather than directly measured

## Next Checks
1. Test instruction decay empirically by classifying 100 cases in a single session and measuring sliding window reliability every 10 items
2. Apply the same prompting strategies to a different qualitative dataset (e.g., interview transcripts) to assess domain transferability
3. Implement explicit precedence rules for high-disagreement classes and measure the reduction in Cramér's V values between intervention methods
