# Quantized-Tinyllava: a new multimodal foundation model enables efficient split learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.23402
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23402
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Achieves 87.5% communication reduction with 2-bit quantization while maintaining model performance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the communication overhead and privacy concerns in distributed training of multimodal foundation models across sensitive domains. The authors propose Quantized-TinyLLaVA, a multimodal foundation model with an integrated split learning framework that employs quantization techniques to compress intermediate features before transmission. Two compression methods are introduced: RD-FSQ, which improves upon FSQ with linear scaling and distortion regularization, and an adapted QLoRA for arbitrary bit precision. A principled criterion based on entropy coding theory is derived to determine the optimal quantization bit width.

## Method Summary
The framework partitions TinyLLaVA between client and server, with the client handling image encoding through a SigLip-SO400M vision tower, a 2-layer MLP connector, and a compressor (either RD-FSQ or QLoRA). The server processes reconstructed embeddings through an OpenELM-270M language model. Features are quantized before transmission using either RD-FSQ with linear scaling and commitment loss, or block-wise QLoRA quantization with generalized NF codebooks. The optimal bit-width is determined by estimating feature entropy via KDE. The framework is trained in two stages: pretraining (connector+compressor only) followed by fine-tuning (all components), using straight-through estimator for gradient flow through quantization operations.

## Key Results
- RD-FSQ at 2-bit achieves 97.9% of original model performance vs. 93.0% for baseline FSQ
- QLoRA 2-bit reduces communication from 1038.47GB to 177.01GB (83% reduction)
- Compressed representations exhibit enhanced resilience against feature inversion attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: RD-FSQ (Robust and Distortion-aware Finite Scalar Quantization)
- Replaces tanh scaling with linear scaling and adds distortion regularization
- Uses 3σ clipping with linear scaling to (-1, 1), quantization via rounding to d discrete levels
- Commitment loss (cosine similarity between original and quantized values) penalizes distortion during training
- Core assumption: Intermediate features have approximately bounded distributions where outliers can be clipped

### Mechanism 2: b-bit QLoRA Feature Quantization
- Block-wise quantization using generalized NF codebooks enables reconstruction at arbitrary bit precision
- Features are reshaped into blocks, normalized per-block, mapped to nearest codebook entry
- Transmission uses indices plus compressed scaling factors; server reconstructs via dequantization
- Core assumption: Feature values within blocks follow approximately normal distributions

### Mechanism 3: Entropy-Based Optimal Bit Width Selection
- Shannon's source coding theorem provides criterion for minimum bit-width selection
- Estimate feature entropy H(X) via KDE with Scott's Rule bandwidth
- Theorem implies optimal code length satisfies H(X)/log₂(a) ≤ E[S] < H(X)/log₂(a) + 1
- Set bit-width b ≥ H(X)

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Split Learning**
  - Why needed: Understanding how model partitioning between client and server enables privacy-preserving distributed training
  - Quick check: Can you explain where the "cut layer" occurs and what data flows between client and server?

- **Concept: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Straight-Through Estimator (STE)**
  - Why needed: Gradients cannot flow through discrete rounding operations; STE approximation is essential for end-to-end training
  - Quick check: What does STE assume about the gradient relationship between quantized and original values?

- **Concept: Shannon Entropy and Source Coding**
  - Why needed: Provides theoretical foundation for bit-width selection criterion
  - Quick check: Why does entropy provide a lower bound on representation size?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Vision Tower (SigLip-SO400M) -> Connector (2-layer MLP) -> Compressor (RD-FSQ or QLoRA) -> Language Model (OpenELM-270M)

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Implement and validate compressor modules independently (forward pass reconstruction quality)
  2. Integrate compressor into split learning pipeline with gradient flow via STE
  3. Tune commitment loss weight α for RD-FSQ
  4. Estimate entropy on your data to confirm 2-bit sufficiency

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - RD-FSQ: Better privacy + lower overhead; slightly lower performance than QLoRA at higher bits
  - QLoRA: Better performance at 3-4 bits; higher overhead due to scaling factor transmission; weaker privacy
  - Bit-width: 2-bit is theoretically optimal per entropy; 1-bit causes significant degradation

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Features all mapping to same quantization level → check input distribution and scaling bounds
  - Exploding gradients during split learning → verify STE implementation and commitment loss weighting
  - Attack model reconstructs clear images → insufficient quantization or wrong method selection

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate entropy estimation on your dataset using KDE to verify 2-bit applicability before full training
  2. Compare RD-FSQ vs. QLoRA reconstruction error on held-out features (MSE, cosine similarity) without training to isolate compression quality
  3. Train feature inversion attack model on your compressed representations to quantify privacy before deploying in sensitive domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several limitations suggest areas for future work including multi-partition split learning, evaluation against other privacy attacks, gradient quantization, and hybrid compression strategies.

## Limitations
- Unknown hyperparameters (commitment loss weight α, block size G for QLoRA) make exact reproduction difficult
- Entropy estimation assumes stationary distributions which may not hold in practice
- Only evaluated against feature inversion attacks, not other privacy attack types

## Confidence
- **High confidence (8-10/10)**: RD-FSQ improves upon baseline FSQ; entropy-based bit-width selection is theoretically sound; compressed representations show enhanced privacy
- **Medium confidence (5-7/10)**: 87.5% communication reduction with 2-bit quantization depends on unknown hyperparameters; performance trade-offs may vary with different datasets
- **Low confidence (1-4/10)**: Generalization of entropy-based selection criterion to non-stationary distributions; privacy benefits across diverse attack models

## Next Checks
1. Estimate feature entropy using KDE with Scott's Rule on your own data before implementing full training to verify that 2-bit is indeed sufficient
2. Implement both RD-FSQ and QLoRA and measure reconstruction error (MSE, cosine similarity) on held-out features without training to isolate compression quality
3. Train a feature inversion attack model on compressed representations from your dataset to quantify privacy benefits before deploying in sensitive domains
