# Policy Regularization on Globally Accessible States in Cross-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.06893
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06893
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ASOR achieves 0.45 average score on cross-domain transfer tasks compared to 0.11-0.40 for other methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of training policies in non-stationary environments where dynamics shift across different conditions. Existing Imitation from Observation (IfO) methods assume expert state distributions are similar across dynamics, but this fails when certain states become inaccessible. The authors propose a novel framework that combines reward maximization with IfO using F-distance regularized policy optimization, focusing only on globally accessible states. They develop a practical algorithm called ASOR that can be added to various RL approaches. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show ASOR significantly improves state-of-the-art cross-domain policy transfer algorithms.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a framework that combines reward maximization with imitation from observation (IfO) using F-distance regularized policy optimization. The key insight is that policies should focus on globally accessible states rather than trying to match expert behavior on states that may become unreachable under different dynamics. ASOR implements this by regularizing the policy to stay close to the expert's state distribution while still optimizing for rewards. The algorithm can be added to existing RL approaches and has been tested in offline RL, online continuous control, and large-scale game environments.

## Key Results
- ASOR achieves 0.45 average score on cross-domain transfer tasks, outperforming other methods (0.11-0.40)
- The algorithm works across multiple settings: offline RL, online continuous control, and large-scale games
- The approach shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art cross-domain policy transfer algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by recognizing that in non-stationary environments with shifting dynamics, not all expert states remain accessible. By focusing regularization only on globally accessible states, the policy avoids wasting effort trying to match expert behavior on unreachable states. The F-distance regularization ensures the policy stays close to expert behavior where it matters most, while still optimizing for rewards in the current dynamics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-dynamics policy transfer**: Needed because real-world environments often have varying conditions; quick check: can the policy adapt to unseen dynamics changes
- **Imitation from Observation (IfO)**: Allows learning from state trajectories without action labels; quick check: does the expert provide only state sequences
- **F-distance regularization**: Measures distributional distance between policies; quick check: is the regularization term differentiable and computationally tractable
- **Globally accessible states**: States reachable across all dynamics conditions; quick check: can we identify these states before training

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: State observation -> F-distance regularization module -> Policy network -> Action output -> Environment -> Reward/State feedback

**Critical path**: The F-distance regularization between current policy and expert policy is the core mechanism that enables cross-dynamics transfer. This regularization is applied only to globally accessible states.

**Design tradeoffs**: The approach trades off between pure reward maximization and expert imitation, focusing only on states that matter across dynamics. This avoids the pitfall of trying to imitate expert behavior on unreachable states.

**Failure signatures**: If the F-distance regularization is too strong, the policy may fail to adapt to new dynamics. If too weak, it may lose the benefits of expert guidance.

**First experiments**:
1. Test ASOR on a simple pendulum environment with varying gravity
2. Compare performance with and without F-distance regularization on the same task
3. Evaluate sensitivity to regularization strength parameter

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The definition of "globally accessible" states remains somewhat abstract
- Experimental validation relies heavily on DeepMind Control Suite, which may not capture real-world complexity
- Comparison with other cross-domain transfer methods is limited to a specific set of algorithms

## Confidence
- High confidence: The mathematical formulation of the F-distance regularization and overall framework design
- Medium confidence: The empirical results showing performance improvements on benchmark tasks
- Low confidence: Claims about generalization to complex real-world scenarios and scalability to more diverse dynamics shifts

## Next Checks
1. Test ASOR on more diverse benchmark environments with varying degrees of dynamics shift, including robotic manipulation tasks with contact-rich interactions
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (reward maximization vs. IfO regularization) to the final performance
3. Evaluate the algorithm's robustness to different dataset qualities and quantities in the offline RL setting, including scenarios with limited expert demonstrations
