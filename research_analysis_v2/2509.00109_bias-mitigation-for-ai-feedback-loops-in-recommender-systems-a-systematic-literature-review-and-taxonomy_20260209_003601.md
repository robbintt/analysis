core_contribution: This study addresses the problem of bias amplification in recommender
  systems due to feedback loops, where AI models continually retrain on user reactions
  to their own predictions, leading to self-reinforcing biases that harm fairness
  and system performance. The research fills a gap in the literature by focusing on
  bias mitigation strategies evaluated in dynamic environments with multi-round retraining
  or live A/B tests.

# Bias Mitigation for AI-Feedback Loops in Recommender Systems: A Systematic Literature Review and Taxonomy

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.00109
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00109
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Taxonomy of 24 bias mitigation techniques in recommender systems with dynamic feedback loops across six dimensions

## Executive Summary
This systematic literature review addresses the critical problem of bias amplification in recommender systems caused by AI feedback loops, where models continually retrain on user reactions to their own predictions. The study fills a significant gap in the literature by focusing specifically on bias mitigation strategies that have been evaluated in dynamic environments with multi-round retraining or live A/B tests. Through comprehensive analysis of 24 primary studies published between 2019 and 2025, the authors developed a taxonomy organizing bias mitigation techniques across six key dimensions, providing practitioners with a practical framework for selecting robust methods.

The research reveals that while in-processing techniques dominate the field (71% of studies), most evaluations focus primarily on performance metrics rather than fairness considerations. The taxonomy introduces six sub-classes within established mitigation frameworks and four recommender-system-specific classes, highlighting both the current state of research and urgent gaps that need addressing. The findings emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation metrics and shared simulators to advance the field, while providing a valuable roadmap for both researchers and practitioners working to mitigate bias in AI-driven recommendation systems.

## Method Summary
The study conducted a systematic literature review using three academic databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and ArXiv) with specific search queries covering papers from 2019 to 2025. The screening process involved two stages: initial screening of title and abstract using an LLM assistant (gpt-4o-mini), followed by full-text review against three inclusion criteria - presence of ML model feedback loop, applied bias mitigation, and evaluation via simulation or live A/B testing with multi-round retraining. The taxonomy was constructed using the Nickerson et al. conceptual-to-empirical framework through iterative refinement, organizing findings across six dimensions: mitigation type, biases addressed, dynamic testing type, evaluation focus, application domain, and ML model task.

## Key Results
- In-processing techniques dominate bias mitigation research (71% of studies), while post-processing methods remain underutilized
- Only 29% of studies evaluate both performance and fairness metrics, with most focusing primarily on performance
- Six sub-classes identified within established mitigation frameworks, plus four recommender-system-specific classes
- Most studies concentrate on news and music recommendations, with underrepresentation in e-commerce and social media domains
- Critical gaps identified in shared simulators and comprehensive evaluation metrics for bias mitigation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The systematic approach works by creating a comprehensive framework that captures the complex interactions between bias mitigation techniques and dynamic feedback loops in recommender systems. By focusing on studies that evaluate methods in realistic, dynamic environments rather than static offline settings, the taxonomy reflects techniques that can actually perform under real-world conditions where feedback loops amplify biases over time.

## Foundational Learning
- **Feedback Loops in Recommender Systems**: Understanding how user interactions with recommendations create self-reinforcing patterns that amplify biases - needed to grasp why static bias mitigation fails
- **Bias Types in Recommendation**: Familiarity with popularity bias, exposure bias, and demographic biases - needed to understand which mitigation strategies target which problems
- **Dynamic vs Static Evaluation**: Knowledge of simulation environments and multi-round retraining vs simple train-test splits - needed to appreciate why this study focuses on dynamic testing
- **Mitigation Technique Categories**: Understanding in-processing, post-processing, causal inference, and add-on approaches - needed to navigate the taxonomy structure
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Knowledge of both performance metrics (accuracy, NDCG) and fairness metrics (demographic parity, equal opportunity) - needed to interpret evaluation focus findings

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Search Query -> Database Aggregation -> LLM Screening -> Full-Text Review -> Taxonomy Construction -> Classification

**Critical Path**: Database search and aggregation → Two-stage screening → Full-text review → Taxonomy construction → Classification mapping

**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice to focus only on dynamically tested methods means excluding potentially innovative offline techniques that may not scale to real-world conditions, but ensures practical relevance

**Failure Signatures**: Including static-only studies would dilute the taxonomy's practical value; misclassifying individual vs ML model feedback loops would compromise the study's focus

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify that all 24 included studies explicitly describe multi-round retraining or live A/B testing in their evaluation sections
2. Test the taxonomy classification on a sample of recent papers not included in the original review
3. Replicate the database search with the exact queries to confirm the initial paper pool size matches the reported 1,221 candidates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several critical open questions: the shortage of shared simulators for testing bias mitigation in realistic feedback loop scenarios, the need for more comprehensive evaluation metrics that combine performance and fairness measures, and the underrepresentation of certain application domains like e-commerce and social media. Additionally, the study calls for more research on post-processing techniques and add-on methods, which are currently underutilized despite their potential for flexible deployment.

## Limitations
- The use of automated screening with gpt-4o-mini introduces potential selection bias that cannot be fully replicated without access to the exact prompt
- Subjective interpretation of "ML Model feedback loop" vs "Individual feedback loop" may lead to inconsistent inclusion across reviewers
- The taxonomy may not capture emerging techniques developed after the mid-2025 review cutoff
- Concentration of studies in news and music recommendations limits generalizability to other domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The six-dimensional taxonomy structure and classification into In-Processing, Post-Processing, Causal Inference, Add-On, and Other categories are well-supported by the reviewed literature.

**Medium Confidence**: The dominance of in-processing techniques (71%) and the finding that only 29% of studies evaluate both performance and fairness are robust observations, though potentially influenced by publication bias.

**Low Confidence**: The generalizability across different application domains is limited by the concentration of studies in specific domains like news and music recommendations.

## Next Checks
1. Manually review the first 50 papers identified by the search queries to verify alignment with the automated screening results and inclusion criteria
2. Conduct a focused search for recent papers (2024-2025) in top-tier venues to identify potential bias mitigation techniques not captured in the original taxonomy
3. Extract and categorize all evaluation metrics used across the 24 studies to verify the claim about performance-focused evaluations and identify gaps in fairness metric adoption
