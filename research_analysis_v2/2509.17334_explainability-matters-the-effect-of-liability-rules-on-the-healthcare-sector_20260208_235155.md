# Explainability matters: The effect of liability rules on the healthcare sector

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.17334
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17334
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Explainability of AI systems in healthcare determines liability allocation and defensive medicine practices, with opaque systems incentivizing strategic compliance while explainable systems enable professional judgment.

## Executive Summary
This paper analyzes how the explainability of artificial intelligence systems in healthcare affects liability determination and defensive medicine practices. Using game-theoretic models, it compares two extreme scenarios: an opaque "Oracle" that provides diagnoses without explanation and an explainable "AI Colleague" that justifies its conclusions. The study reveals that with opaque AIS, practitioners strategically align with AI recommendations to minimize liability, potentially leading to defensive medicine. In contrast, explainable AIS enables practitioners to detect errors and maintain professional judgment, shifting primary liability to manufacturers when explanations fail to match reasoning.

## Method Summary
The paper employs game-theoretic expected payoff calculations to model practitioner decision-making under different AIS scenarios. For the opaque "Oracle" case, it derives thresholds where practitioners become indifferent between agreeing and disagreeing with AIS recommendations. For the explainable "AI Colleague" case, it models error detection capabilities and establishes conditions where independent assessment becomes preferable to systematic agreement. The analysis uses theoretical payoff structures with variables for accuracy (p), explainability (E), diligence (k), and liability parameters (L, X) to determine strategic behavior.

## Key Results
- With opaque AIS, practitioners strategically agree with AI recommendations even at low accuracy to minimize liability exposure
- Explainable AIS enables practitioners to detect errors and maintain independent judgment, reducing defensive medicine
- Manufacturer liability shifts from diagnostic accuracy to explanation fidelity when AIS is explainable
- Policy makers should prioritize explainability alongside accuracy when certifying medical AIS

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Strategic Liability Minimization Under Opacity
- Claim: When AIS provides no explanation (Oracle), practitioners strategically agree with AI recommendations to minimize personal liability, even when AI accuracy is low.
- Mechanism: Game-theoretic expected payoff calculation shows that agreement with opaque AIS yields expected payoff EA = X - p*X, while disagreement yields ED = -p*L. When shared liability X approaches 0, practitioners are incentivized to agree even at low accuracy (p' → 0), as this allows potential liability shifting to manufacturers.
- Core assumption: Practitioners rationally optimize to minimize liability exposure rather than maximize diagnostic accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using game-theoretic models, the study shows that with an opaque AIS, medical practitioners tend to strategically align with AIS recommendations to minimize liability"
  - [section 3.1] "Even with low AIS accuracy... the practitioner would benefit more by strategically aligning with the AIS... a strategic agreement with the AIS, indeed, can be viewed as a form of defensive medicine"
  - [corpus] Related papers (Unlocking the Black Box, Beyond Explainability) discuss explainability requirements but do not provide competing behavioral models of liability-driven compliance
- Break condition: If liability is never shared (X = -L always), or if practitioners face no liability regardless of decisions, the strategic incentive collapses.

### Mechanism 2: Error Detection Capability Mediated by Explainability
- Claim: Explainability enables practitioners to detect AI errors, transforming AIS from authority to tool.
- Mechanism: Practitioner error detection rate dm = k * p * E (diligence × accuracy × explainability). When E → 1, threshold diligence k' → 0.5, meaning even less diligent practitioners can identify errors and benefit from independent assessment over systematic agreement.
- Core assumption: Error detection requires both practitioner diligence (k) and system explainability (E); neither alone suffices.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "an explainable AIS enables practitioners to detect errors and maintain professional judgment"
  - [section 3.2] "For a highly explainable AIS, given its accuracy, even a less diligent, skilled, and attentive practitioner is better off identifying AIS errors and undergoing an independent assessment rather than systematically agreeing"
  - [corpus] Corpus lacks empirical validation of dm = f(p, E, k); this remains a theoretical model
- Break condition: If practitioners lack domain expertise (k → 0), or if explanations are incomprehensible despite being provided (low effective E), error detection fails.

### Mechanism 3: Manufacturer Liability via Explanation-Output Discrepancy
- Claim: With explainable AIS, manufacturer liability shifts from diagnostic accuracy to explanation fidelity.
- Mechanism: When explanation does not match the actual reasoning (hallucinated or misleading explanation), liability swings to manufacturer. Two failure modes: (1) facade of correctness masks wrong output; (2) incorrect explanation induces doubt about correct output.
- Core assumption: Discrepancy between explanation and internal reasoning is detectable post-hoc through legal investigation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "The relevant aspect here is not the accuracy of the AIS, but the discrepancy between its conclusion and the incorrect explanation"
  - [section 4] "From the manufacturer's viewpoint, explainability takes precedence over accuracy itself once the latter satisfies the AIS certification requirement"
  - [corpus] EU AI Act analysis (Unlocking the Black Box) discusses explainability requirements but does not model manufacturer liability incentives
- Break condition: If explanation-output discrepancies are undetectable or legally inactionable, manufacturer liability cannot be enforced.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Game-theoretic expected payoff**
  - Why needed here: The paper models practitioner decisions as rational optimization under uncertainty using payoff matrices. Understanding dominant strategies and indifference thresholds (k', p') is essential to follow the argument.
  - Quick check question: Given EA = X - p*X and ED = -p*L, what happens to the agreement strategy when shared liability X = 0?

- **Concept: Defensive medicine**
  - Why needed here: The paper argues opaque AI induces a new form of defensive medicine—strategic compliance rather than additional testing. Distinguishing this from careful practice is central.
  - Quick check question: How does AI-induced defensive medicine differ from ordering unnecessary tests?

- **Concept: Tort vs product liability**
  - Why needed here: Liability shifts between fault-based negligence (practitioner) and strict product liability (manufacturer). The paper's mechanism depends on this legal architecture.
  - Quick check question: Why might a patient prefer suing a practitioner over a manufacturer even if the AI caused the error?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Practitioner (inputs: patient data, AIS output, explanation; decision: agree/disagree; diligence coefficient k)
  - AIS (inputs: patient data; outputs: diagnosis + explanation with explainability E, accuracy p)
  - Legal framework (liability rules, burden of proof, causation standards)
  - Manufacturer (liability when explanation-output discrepancy proven)

- **Critical path:**
  1. AIS produces output + explanation (E variable)
  2. Practitioner assesses using diligence (k) and explanation (E)
  3. Decision: systematic agreement vs independent assessment
  4. Outcome: liability assigned based on actual correctness and decision path
  5. Behavioral feedback: practitioners learn liability-minimizing strategy

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Higher explainability (E) reduces defensive medicine but increases practitioner liability exposure
  - Higher accuracy (p) strengthens agreement incentives under opacity
  - Certification standards: accuracy-only vs accuracy + explainability requirements
  - Manufacturer liability scope: diagnostic errors vs explanation failures

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Opaque AIS + high accuracy → strategic compliance, erosion of professional judgment
  - Explainable AIS + low practitioner diligence (k < k') → false confidence in independent assessment
  - Explanation-output mismatch → liability disputes, manufacturer exposure
  - Shared liability X ≈ 0 → agreement becomes dominant strategy regardless of p

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Simulate practitioner behavior under varying (p, E, k) tuples:** Implement the payoff models for Oracle and AI Colleague scenarios. Vary p from 0.5–0.95, E from 0–1, k from 0.3–1.0. Identify regions where systematic agreement dominates vs independent assessment. Validate k' threshold equation.
  2. **Stress-test the shared liability assumption (X):** The model's conclusions depend heavily on X value. Run sensitivity analysis: what values of X would flip the dominant strategy? Is X = 0 realistic under actual legal precedents?
  3. **Map explanation-output discrepancy scenarios:** Enumerate failure modes where manufacturer liability would attach: (a) no explanation provided, (b) explanation contradicts internal reasoning, (c) explanation is technically correct but misleading. For each, define what evidence would be required to prove manufacturer liability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can policy makers operationalize "explainability" as a quantitative or qualitative certification criterion for medical AIS, beyond simple accuracy metrics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conclude that policy makers "should not focus solely nor primarily on overall accuracy but also consider explainability" when certifying AIS, though specific standards are not defined.
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes the theoretical necessity of explainability for liability distribution but leaves the practical implementation of such standards for regulators to define.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proposed regulatory framework or standard (e.g., an extension to ISO/IEC 42001) that defines acceptable levels of explainability for different risk classes of medical diagnostics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the empirical relationship between the level of AIS explainability ($E$) and a medical practitioner's actual ability to detect system errors ($d_m$)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The game-theoretic model assumes a functional relationship $d_m = k \cdot p \cdot E$ (Equation 4), postulating that higher explainability linearly improves error detection, but this is a simplifying assumption rather than a proven fact.
- Why unresolved: While intuitively plausible, the specific gain in error detection capability derived from ante-hoc versus post-hoc explainability methods remains unquantified by empirical studies in this theoretical paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: Clinical trial data comparing the error detection rates of practitioners using "Oracle" systems versus "AI Colleague" systems across varying levels of technical explainability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can legal frameworks distinguish between manufacturer liability for "erroneous explanations" and practitioner liability for failing to interpret correct explanations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests a shift where manufacturers are liable if an "explanation does not accurately reflect the reasoning of AIS," but acknowledges the difficulty in distinguishing this from a practitioner simply misinterpreting a valid explanation.
- Why unresolved: The legal distinction relies on proving a "discrepancy" between output and reasoning, which requires a technical ability to audit the AI's internal logic that current legal evidentiary standards may lack.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case law or statutory examples where "explanation defectiveness" is successfully litigated, establishing a precedent for the "AI Colleague" liability model.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the variance in "shared liability" ($X$) across different legal jurisdictions (e.g., US vs. EU) quantitatively affect the threshold for defensive medicine in opaque "Oracle" systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The model identifies a critical accuracy threshold $p' = X / (X - L)$ where practitioners become indifferent to agreeing with the AI; however, the actual value of $X$ (shared liability) is noted to fluctuate heavily based on local tort laws and litigation costs.
- Why unresolved: The paper treats $X$ as a hypothetical parameter, leaving the specific impact of regional legal differences on the "defensive medicine" incentive structure unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative legal study correlating specific national liability rules with the observed rates of AI compliance and defensive medicine in clinical settings.

## Limitations

- Theoretical model relies on unvalidated assumptions about practitioner error detection capability (d_m = k·p·E)
- Binary outcome framework ignores probabilistic uncertainty and partial liability scenarios common in actual tort cases
- Assumes practitioners can perfectly detect errors when explainability is sufficient, potentially overestimating human-AI collaboration capabilities

## Confidence

- Strategic liability minimization under opacity: Medium — theoretically sound but lacks empirical behavioral validation
- Error detection capability via explainability: Low — functional form is asserted without evidence
- Manufacturer liability via explanation-output discrepancy: Medium — logically coherent but untested in real legal contexts

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical calibration of the d_m function:** Conduct experiments with healthcare practitioners assessing AIS explanations across varying accuracy levels and explainability qualities. Measure actual error detection rates to validate or replace the assumed d_m = k·p·E relationship.

2. **Legal precedent mapping:** Survey medical malpractice cases involving AI diagnostics to identify actual shared liability values (X) and understand how courts attribute fault between practitioners and manufacturers in cases of AI explanation failure.

3. **Bounded rationality testing:** Model practitioner behavior under uncertainty about AIS accuracy and explanation fidelity. Compare outcomes when practitioners use heuristics versus the rational optimization assumed in the current framework.
