# Towards a Signal Detection Based Measure for Assessing Information Quality of Explainable Recommender Systems

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: First objective metric (Veracity) to assess information quality of explanations in XRS using SDT, decomposed into Fidelity and Attunement dimensions

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap in explainable recommender systems (XRS) evaluation by proposing an objective metric based on Signal Detection Theory (SDT) to measure explanation "Veracity" - the information quality of explanations. The authors decompose Veracity into two orthogonal dimensions: Fidelity (accuracy of information about recommended items) and Attunement (reflection of user preferences). The method applies SDT to separately assess these dimensions and combines them using either restrictive or permissive approaches. Experiments using four cases with varying explanation quality levels showed the metric successfully differentiated between quality levels, with sensitivity values increasing proportionally with explanation quality. The restrictive version of Veracity provided better differentiation than the permissive version, offering a promising diagnostic tool for XRS development.

## Method Summary
The method constructs ground truth by extracting item features from knowledge graphs and user preferences from historical ratings (3+ stars = liked, <3 = disliked). Each explanation statement is classified into SDT outcomes (Hit, Miss, False Alarm, Correct Rejection) for both Fidelity and Attunement dimensions. The restrictive approach combines these outcomes by fully weighting incorrect outcomes when dimensions conflict, while permissive rewards correct outcomes. Sensitivity (A′) and bias (B′′D) are calculated for each dimension and the composite Veracity metric, with A′ ranging from 0.5 (random detection) to 1.0 (perfect discrimination).

## Key Results
- Veracity sensitivity (A′) increased proportionally with explanation quality: Case 1 (0.532-0.675) → Case 4 (0.967-0.983)
- Restrictive Veracity combination outperformed permissive approach in differentiating quality levels
- B′′D values remained near zero across all cases, indicating minimal systematic bias
- Dimensional structure successfully isolated Fidelity and Attunement failures for diagnostic purposes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dimensional Decomposition of Explanation Veracity
- Claim: Decomposing veracity into orthogonal dimensions (Fidelity and Attunement) enables isolated diagnosis of explanation failures.
- Mechanism: Each explanation statement is evaluated against two independent ground truths: (1) item attributes (Fidelity) and (2) user preferences derived from historical ratings (Attunement). This produces separate SDT outcomes per dimension.
- Core assumption: Explanation statements can be unambiguously mapped to verifiable claims about items and user preferences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We decompose Veracity into two dimensions: Fidelity and Attunement. Fidelity refers to whether the explanation includes accurate information about the recommended item. Attunement evaluates whether the explanation reflects the target user's preferences."
  - [Page 3, Section III] "Practically, any statement in an explanation can be assessed for Fidelity by determining the SDT outcome (H, M, FA, CR) with respect to the truthful of a given statement about the object being recommended."
  - [corpus] Related work on explainable evaluation metrics (EXPERT, arXiv:2506.24016) similarly decomposes evaluation into structured criteria, but does not use SDT.

### Mechanism 2: Signal Detection Theory Separates Sensitivity from Bias
- Claim: SDT enables objective quantification of explanation quality by distinguishing detection capability (sensitivity) from decision criteria (bias).
- Mechanism: Non-parametric sensitivity A′ (Equation 3) ranges from 0.5 (random detection) to 1.0 (perfect discrimination), computed from hit rate and false alarm rate. Bias B′′D (Equation 4) captures conservative vs. liberal reporting tendencies.
- Core assumption: The four SDT outcomes (H, M, FA, CR) adequately characterize the decision space for explanation truthfulness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 3, Section II-B] "SDT's critical feature is its ability to distinguish between the decision maker's sensitivity (their ability to differentiate between signal and noise/uncertainty) and the criteria it uses to make decision (its response bias)."
  - [Page 5, Table II] Experimental results show A′ values increasing proportionally with explanation quality (Case 1: 0.532-0.675 → Case 4: 0.967-0.983) while B′′D remains near zero.
  - [corpus] No corpus papers apply SDT to explanation evaluation; this appears novel to the XRS domain.

### Mechanism 3: Restrictive Combination Penalizes Partial Failures
- Claim: The restrictive approach to combining Fidelity and Attunement outcomes provides better diagnostic differentiation than permissive combination.
- Mechanism: When Fidelity and Attunement outcomes conflict (one correct, one incorrect), restrictive counting assigns full weight to the incorrect outcome (M or FA) while permissive assigns full weight to correct (H or CR). This makes restrictive more sensitive to partial explanation failures.
- Core assumption: Both Fidelity and Attunement are necessary for high-quality explanations; partial correctness is insufficient.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 3-4, Section III] "In this situation, the restrictive approach gives full weight to the M or FA outcome, while the permissive approach gives it to the H or CR one."
  - [Page 5, Results] "The permissive version... rated explanation performance when exclusively either Fidelity or Attunement were high (Cases 2 and 3) as being comparable to situations where both were high (Case 4)... our recommendation would be to use the restrictive version moving forward."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Signal Detection Theory (Hit Rate, False Alarm Rate, Sensitivity, Bias)
  - Why needed here: SDT provides the mathematical framework for computing veracity. Without understanding how HR and FAR map to A′ sensitivity, you cannot interpret the metric outputs or diagnose what's driving low scores.
  - Quick check question: If an explanation system has high hit rate (0.9) but also high false alarm rate (0.7), what would you expect the A′ sensitivity to be, and what does this indicate about explanation quality?

- Concept: Explainable Recommender System Evaluation Paradigms
  - Why needed here: The paper positions itself against existing evaluation methods (offline metrics like MEP/MER, online behavioral metrics, subjective user studies). Understanding this landscape clarifies why an objective, content-focused metric fills a gap.
  - Quick check question: Why does BLEU/ROUGE fail to capture explanation quality in recommender systems, according to the paper's argument?

- Concept: Knowledge Graph-Based Recommendation
  - Why needed here: The experimental setup uses knowledge graphs to ground item features and user preferences. Understanding how entities and relations are represented helps implement the ground truth labeling pipeline.
  - Quick check question: In the experimental setup, how were user-liked vs. user-disliked features determined from historical ratings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Ground Truth Labeler -> SDT Outcome Classifier -> Veracity Combiner -> Sensitivity/Bias Calculator
- Critical path: Ground truth extraction → SDT classification → Outcome combination → Metric aggregation. Errors in ground truth labeling propagate through all downstream components.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Restrictive vs. Permissive: Restrictive provides better differentiation but may be too harsh for low-stakes domains; permissive masks partial failures.
  - Binary vs. Graded outcomes: Current design uses discrete SDT outcomes; weighted alternatives could capture partial correctness.
  - Per-statement vs. Per-explanation aggregation: Paper evaluates at statement level; holistic explanation-level metrics may differ.
- Failure signatures:
  - A′ ≈ 0.5 across all cases → Ground truth labels are random or explanation features are uninformative
  - B′′D strongly positive or negative → Systematic bias in how explanations are generated (over-claiming vs. under-claiming)
  - Large gap between Fidelity A′ and Attunement A′ → Explanation generator optimizes one dimension at expense of other
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the four-case validation on a different dataset (e.g., Amazon product reviews) to verify metric generalization beyond MovieLens.
  2. Vary the rating threshold for "liked" vs. "disliked" features (currently 3 stars) to test sensitivity to ground truth definition.
  3. Compare restrictive Veracity A′ against human subjective ratings (Table I factors) to establish convergent validity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do Veracity bias (B''D) values change when criterion thresholds for Fidelity and Attunement judgments are systematically varied?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "This work did not vary the criterion threshold used in the judgments the XRS made in relation to Fidelity or Attunement. Future work could investigate how B''D values for Veracity change in response to such variation."
- Why unresolved: The experiment used a single threshold configuration (3-star rating threshold for user preferences), leaving unexplored how conservative versus liberal decision criteria affect bias measurements.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment manipulating the rating threshold (e.g., 2, 3, 4 stars) and analyzing resulting B''D values for Fidelity, Attunement, and Veracity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What alternative methods for combining Fidelity and Attunement SDT outcomes (beyond restrictive and permissive approaches) would better capture Veracity, and in what contexts should each be applied?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose "a balanced method could potentially split outcomes between the inconsistent versions" and suggest "Fidelity and Attunement outcomes could have different implications for different applications. This might suggest some form of weighting."
- Why unresolved: Only two combination methods were tested, and neither may be optimal for all application contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation of weighted, balanced, or context-specific combination schemes across diverse XRS applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How strongly does Veracity (and its Fidelity and Attunement dimensions) correlate with human subjective ratings on the seven explanatory factors (transparency, trust, satisfaction, etc.)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "Future work should investigate how variation in Veracity (and its Fidelity and Attunement dimensions) impact human subjective ratings for the dimensions from Table I. If there is a strong correlation, the measures introduced here could potentially be used instead of user studies."
- Why unresolved: No human evaluation was conducted; the relationship between objective Veracity scores and subjective user perceptions remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: A user study collecting subjective ratings alongside Veracity measurements to compute correlation coefficients.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does the Veracity metric generalize effectively to other explanation types (sentence-based, image-based) and domains beyond movie recommendations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The experiment used only MovieLens data and feature-based explanations ("this product has X feature, which you may like"), yet the paper discusses multiple explanation types (template-based, generation-based, image-based) and the metric is proposed as a general approach for XRS evaluation.
- Why unresolved: The SDT framework was only validated on one explanation format in one domain; applicability to complex natural language or visual explanations is untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the metric to sentence-generation XRS, image-based explanations, or other domains (e-commerce, music) with appropriate ground-truth definitions.

## Limitations
- Ground truth construction using 3-star threshold may not capture nuanced user preferences, potentially inflating Attunement sensitivity estimates
- Results validated only on MovieLens 1M with explicit metadata features; generalizability to other domains remains untested
- B′′D values near zero don't distinguish between genuinely unbiased systems and low-sensitivity scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: SDT framework correctly distinguishes sensitivity from bias; restrictive Veracity better differentiates quality levels than permissive
- **Medium confidence**: Dimensional decomposition captures orthogonal aspects of explanation quality; the metric works for MovieLens knowledge graph features
- **Low confidence**: Metric generalizes beyond MovieLens to other domains; the 3-star threshold optimally separates user preferences

## Next Checks
1. Apply the Veracity metric to Amazon product reviews dataset with textual explanations to test domain transferability
2. Vary the rating threshold (2.5, 3.0, 3.5 stars) for defining user preferences and measure impact on Attunement sensitivity
3. Compare Veracity A′ scores against structured human ratings (Table I factors) on the same explanation sets to establish convergent validity
