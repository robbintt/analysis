# Pay More Attention To Audio: Mitigating Imbalance of Cross-Modal Attention in Large Audio Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.18816
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18816
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: MATA increases Qwen2.5-Omni accuracy from 71.1% to 73.6% on MMAU and Ke-Omni-R-7B from 64.1% to 66.8% on MMAR

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of audio-textual attention imbalance in large audio-language models (LALMs), where models prioritize text over acoustic information during multi-modal reasoning tasks. The authors propose MATA, a training-free method that dynamically enhances audio token attention in the self-attention mechanism by intervening post raw attention scoring, specifically targeting the last token in intermediate decoder layers. Experiments on the MMAU and MMAR benchmarks show consistent performance improvements, with MATA surpassing the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash for the first time on MMAR.

## Method Summary
MATA is a training-free method that modifies self-attention by amplifying raw attention scores to audio tokens by factor (1 + α) where α = 0.1, applied only to the last token's query (position L-1) in decoder layers 10-20, before softmax normalization. The method intervenes post raw attention scoring but pre-softmax, scaling attention scores for audio token positions while preserving the relative attention distribution structure. This approach is designed to address the audio-textual attention imbalance that occurs particularly in intermediate decoder layers where multi-modal fusion happens.

## Key Results
- MATA increases Qwen2.5-Omni's accuracy from 71.1% to 73.6% on MMAU benchmark
- MATA boosts RL-fine-tuned Ke-Omni-R-7B model's performance from 64.1% to 66.8% on MMAR benchmark
- MATA surpasses proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash on MMAR for the first time

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Intermediate decoder layers serve as the primary site for audio-text fusion, where attention imbalance most critically impacts reasoning.
- Mechanism: During autoregressive decoding, each new token prediction depends on attention-weighted combinations of all prior tokens. In intermediate layers, if audio tokens receive disproportionately low attention weights, the acoustic information is effectively diluted before propagating to deeper layers for output generation. MATA amplifies raw attention scores for audio tokens at this fusion bottleneck.
- Core assumption: Multi-modal information integration occurs predominantly in intermediate layers rather than early or late layers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "particularly in the multi-modal fusion layers of the Transformer architecture"
  - [section 3] "intermediate layers of the Transformer architecture, the primary locus of multi-modal information integration"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; "CORD" paper discusses audio-text reasoning gaps but doesn't address layer-specific fusion.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Intervening on the last token's attention scores suffices because it is the key determinant of the next output token.
- Mechanism: In autoregressive generation, the last token's query vector determines what information to retrieve from the KV cache. By amplifying only the last token's attention to audio tokens (pre-softmax), MATA shifts the next-token prediction to incorporate more acoustic context without modifying the entire attention distribution.
- Core assumption: The last token's attention pattern is sufficiently representative of the model's audio-text balance for the current prediction step.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "MATA is applied only to the attention scores of the last token in the sequence. This token is a key determinant of the next output"
  - [abstract] "targeting only the last token in intermediate layers without introducing additional parameters"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for last-token-specific intervention efficacy.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pre-softmax score amplification preserves attention distribution structure while shifting relative importance toward audio tokens.
- Mechanism: Raw attention scores A are scaled as Â = (1+α)·A for audio positions before softmax normalization. Since softmax is monotonic, increasing audio token scores by a multiplicative factor increases their post-softmax probability mass while maintaining the relative ranking among all tokens.
- Core assumption: A multiplicative enhancement (rather than additive) maintains numerical stability and doesn't disrupt the attention mechanism's calibration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "MATA intervenes in the self-attention computation process after the raw attention scores are calculated but before the softmax function is applied"
  - [section 4.4] "excessive audio attention amplification may disrupt the delicate balance" (α=0.15 underperforms α=0.10)
  - [corpus] No corpus papers validate pre-softmax intervention strategies for audio modality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Self-attention mechanism and softmax normalization**
  - Why needed here: MATA operates by modifying pre-softmax attention scores; understanding how dot-product attention flows through softmax to produce attention weights is essential for grasping why the intervention works.
  - Quick check question: If you double the attention score for a token before softmax, does its post-softmax weight double? Why or why not?

- Concept: **Transformer decoder layer functions (early vs. intermediate vs. late)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core finding is that intervention location matters critically—early layers fail catastrophically, intermediate layers succeed, late layers provide minimal benefit.
  - Quick check question: What functional role do intermediate decoder layers typically play in processing multi-modal inputs versus early embedding layers?

- Concept: **Autoregressive token generation in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: MATA targets only the last token at each generation step; understanding the causal structure of autoregressive decoding explains why this is sufficient.
  - Quick check question: During autoregressive generation, which token's query vector determines the next output, and what does it attend over?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio encoder -> Text tokenizer -> Transformer decoder (28 layers) -> Self-attention module -> MATA intervention -> Final projection
- Critical path:
  1. Audio and text tokens concatenated in sequence
  2. Forward pass through decoder layers 0-9 (early encoding; DO NOT intervene here)
  3. Layers 10-20: Apply MATA to last token's attention scores targeting audio token indices
  4. Layers 21-27 (late processing; intervention ineffective but not catastrophic)
  5. Final projection → next token prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **α value**: 0.10 optimal; 0.05 under-amplifies, 0.15 over-amplifies and degrades performance
  - **Layer selection**: Intermediate layers critical; early intervention (layers 0-10) causes catastrophic collapse (0.9% accuracy)
  - **Token targeting**: Only last token vs. all tokens—paper finds last-token-only sufficient and computationally minimal

- Failure signatures:
  - **Early layer intervention**: Accuracy drops to <2% (near-random); model fails to form coherent representations
  - **Excessive α**: Performance plateaus or degrades as model over-prioritizes audio and loses text instruction grounding
  - **Late-layer-only intervention**: No improvement over baseline; fusion already completed

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline attention visualization**: Extract and average attention weights across decoder layers on a held-out sample to confirm audio-text imbalance in intermediate layers before implementing MATA.
  2. **Layer sweep ablation**: Test MATA (α=0.10) on layer ranges [0-10], [5-15], [10-20], [15-25], [20-28] to validate the intermediate-layer hypothesis on your target architecture.
  3. **α sensitivity analysis**: Grid search α ∈ {0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20} on a validation split to identify the optimal enhancement strength for your specific model and task distribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does MATA generalize effectively to LALM architectures with significantly different attention mechanisms or encoder configurations beyond the Qwen family?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "we plan to extend the MATA method to a broader range of LALM architectures."
- Why unresolved: The experiments are restricted to the Qwen2-Audio and Qwen2.5-Omni models, leaving the method's efficacy on other architectures (e.g., SALMONN, Audio Flamingo) unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application and consistent performance gains on non-Qwen baselines or encoder-decoder architectures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the selection of intervention layers be automated rather than manually specified?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Ablation studies show that intervening on the wrong layers (e.g., 0-10) causes catastrophic failure, yet the optimal range (10-20) appears to be selected via empirical tuning.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a theoretical or algorithmic method for identifying the "intermediate layers" responsible for multi-modal fusion in arbitrary models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A dynamic detection mechanism that identifies optimal fusion layers without requiring manual hyperparameter search.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the MATA intervention strategy transferable to other multi-modal domains, such as Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly propose to "explore its application in other multi-modal models."
- Why unresolved: While the authors cite attention imbalance in LVLMs, the proposed solution specifically targets audio token indices and has not been tested on visual modality tokens.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the post-raw-score intervention to vision-language benchmarks showing reduced hallucinations or improved reasoning.

## Limitations

- Architecture-specific assumptions about intermediate layers being the primary site of audio-text fusion may not generalize to models with different depths or attention mechanisms
- Token identification challenge: The method requires precise identification of audio token indices [a_s, a_e] which is not specified in the paper
- Unvalidated assumption that last-token-only intervention is sufficient for addressing attention imbalance across the entire generation process

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The experimental results on MMAU and MMAR benchmarks are clearly presented and show consistent performance improvements when MATA is applied to the correct layer range (10-20) with α=0.10. The failure modes (early layer intervention causing catastrophic collapse, excessive α causing degradation) are well-documented and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence**: The core hypothesis that intermediate layers are the primary locus of multi-modal fusion is supported by the experimental results but relies on a single architectural paradigm. The mechanism explaining why pre-softmax amplification preserves attention distribution structure is theoretically sound but not empirically validated through ablation studies of the intervention location within the attention computation pipeline.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that last-token-only intervention is sufficient lacks direct empirical validation. The paper does not compare against interventions on multiple tokens or investigate the impact of different token targeting strategies. The assumption that this approach will generalize across different audio-language model architectures is not supported by evidence.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Architecture Validation**: Implement MATA on at least two different LALM architectures (e.g., Qwen2.5-Omni, Gemini, or another open-source model) to verify that the intermediate layer hypothesis (layers 10-20) holds across architectures with different depths and attention mechanisms. Test whether the optimal α value remains consistent or requires recalibration.

2. **Token Targeting Ablation**: Conduct a systematic ablation study comparing MATA variants: (a) last-token-only intervention, (b) all-token intervention, (c) random subset of tokens, and (d) sliding window of recent tokens. Measure whether the last-token-only approach provides optimal performance or if alternative targeting strategies yield better results.

3. **Attention Pattern Analysis**: Before and after MATA application, extract and visualize attention distributions across layers for both audio and text tokens on a diverse set of MMAU samples. Quantify the change in audio attention mass and correlate these changes with performance improvements to validate that the method actually shifts attention toward acoustic information as claimed.
