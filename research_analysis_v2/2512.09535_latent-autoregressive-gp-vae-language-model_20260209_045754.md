# Latent-Autoregressive GP-VAE Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.09535
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09535
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: Proof-of-concept that temporal dynamics in language modeling can be shifted to a continuous latent space governed by a Gaussian process prior, enabling fully parallel token generation and stable training.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a latent-autoregressive GP-VAE language model that moves temporal dynamics from the observation space into a continuous latent space governed by a Gaussian process prior. The model exploits the GP's analytic causal factorization to induce purely latent autoregression, enabling fully parallel token generation. Experiments on WikiText-2 show stable training, consistent behavior between sequential and parallel latent sampling variants, and improved perplexity relative to a minimal autoregressive baseline. The correlated GP prior is actively used, as evidenced by KL regularization effects and ablation studies.

## Method Summary
The method uses a causal TCN encoder to parameterize a diagonal Gaussian posterior over latent variables z₁:T given observations x₁:T. A Gaussian process prior with learnable RBF kernel parameters governs the latent dynamics, with the kernel covariance matrix K_tt computed analytically. The model implements two variants: TCN-SEQ uses sequential GP conditioning, while TCN-PARA uses Cholesky decomposition for block sampling. A parallel decoder with tied embeddings and positional encoding reconstructs tokens from latents. Training uses ELBO per token with KL warm-up and a KL cap target of ~12 nats, plus embedding regularization. The GP's analytic causal factorization enables parallel generation without autoregressive decoding.

## Key Results
- Stable training achieved with KL regularization maintaining ~12 nats per token
- TCN-PARA and TCN-SEQ variants produce consistent perplexity on continuous generation
- Improved perplexity relative to minimal autoregressive baseline on WikiText-2
- Ablation studies confirm the correlated GP prior is actively shaping latent dynamics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model works by shifting temporal dependencies from the observation space to the latent space via a Gaussian process prior. The GP's analytic causal factorization enables efficient computation of the latent distribution while maintaining temporal structure. The KL regularization between the approximate posterior and GP prior ensures the latents capture meaningful temporal dynamics. By conditioning generation on these temporally-structured latents rather than performing autoregressive decoding, the model achieves parallel generation while preserving sequential coherence.

## Foundational Learning

**Gaussian Processes**: Probabilistic models defining distributions over functions, parameterized by a mean and covariance function. Why needed: Provides the analytical framework for temporal structure in continuous latent space. Quick check: Verify kernel parameters (lengthscale, variance) are positive and covariance matrix is positive definite.

**Variational Autoencoders**: Framework for learning latent variable models using an approximate posterior and KL regularization. Why needed: Enables tractable inference of latent variables from observations. Quick check: Monitor ELBO decomposition to ensure reconstruction loss and KL components are well-behaved.

**Autoregressive Modeling**: Generating sequences where each token depends on previous tokens. Why needed: Traditional approach for language modeling that this work aims to replace with latent-autoregression. Quick check: Compare perplexity metrics between this model and standard autoregressive baselines.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: GPT-2 tokenizer -> TCN encoder -> Gaussian posterior -> GP prior -> Cholesky sampling -> Parallel decoder -> Vocabulary distribution

**Critical Path**: Encoder → Posterior → GP Prior → Latent Sampling → Decoder → Reconstruction

**Design Tradeoffs**: TCN encoder chosen for simplicity over expressiveness; parallel decoder enables generation speed but requires careful positional encoding; GP kernel parameters are learnable but computationally expensive for long sequences.

**Failure Signatures**: Latent collapse (KL drops to ~3 nats, PPL degrades); GP Cholesky instability (NaN/divergence); embedding regularization divergence.

**First Experiments**: 1) Train with minimal architecture to verify basic ELBO optimization; 2) Implement KL warm-up schedule and verify KL plateau at target ~12 nats; 3) Compare TCN-SEQ vs TCN-PARA perplexity consistency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can inducing-point approximations or structured kernels effectively scale the latent-autoregressive scheme to long sequences (T >> 64) without inducing numerical instability or latent collapse? Based on explicit discussion of computational constraints and need for scalable GP approximations.

**Open Question 2**: How does the model perform relative to a rigorously tuned, state-of-the-art autoregressive transformer rather than the minimal baseline used here? Based on explicit call for stronger autoregressive baselines to clarify the contribution of the correlated latent component.

**Open Question 3**: Does replacing the simple TCN encoder with a more expressive architecture (e.g., a Transformer) improve the approximate posterior without destabilizing the training dynamics? Based on inferred implications from the deliberately limited encoder capacity discussion.

**Open Question 4**: Is the reported training stability and KL convergence robust across multiple random seeds? Based on explicit acknowledgment that all results are single-seed with unexplored variance across random initializations.

## Limitations

- Current computational complexity limits sequence length to T=64 due to O(T²) GP inference cost
- Encoder architecture deliberately limited in expressiveness, leaving capacity questions unresolved
- No qualitative analysis of what temporal structure the GP latent space actually captures
- All results based on single random seed without variance reporting

## Confidence

- Methodological novelty of latent-autoregressive GP-VAE: High
- Improved perplexity over baseline: Medium
- Consistency between sequential and parallel latent sampling: Medium
- Exact reproducibility: Low

## Next Checks

1. Reconstruct full architecture and training configuration (latent dimension, TCN specifications, decoder dimensions, β schedule, optimizer hyperparameters) from codebase or supplementary material.

2. Verify KL regularization is actively shaping the GP latent dynamics by ablating KL cap and observing latent collapse with degradation in perplexity.

3. Quantitatively compare PPL(cont) distributions from TCN-SEQ and TCN-PARA across multiple random seeds to confirm statistical consistency.
