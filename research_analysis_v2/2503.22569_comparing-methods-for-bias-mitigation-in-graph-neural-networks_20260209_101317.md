# Comparing Methods for Bias Mitigation in Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.22569
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22569
- Reference count: 8
- This paper investigates bias mitigation in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data preparation in generative AI systems using the german credit dataset.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates three bias mitigation methods for Graph Neural Networks: data sparsification (random, stratified, weighted sampling), feature modification (rebalancing gender and customer status), and synthetic data augmentation using GraphSAGE. The german credit dataset serves as the testbed with 1000 nodes (690 male/310 female) and binary good/bad customer labels. Stratified sampling emerges as the most effective sparsification method, reducing statistical parity and equality of opportunity gaps to 1% while maintaining accuracy. Feature modification achieves near-zero fairness gaps but reduces accuracy by ~7%. GraphSAGE-based synthetic augmentation generates realistic female profiles, achieving a 2% gap in fairness metrics while improving overall accuracy, though with a concerning 28% false positive rate gap.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three bias mitigation methods on the german credit dataset using a 3-layer GCN with 200 epochs. Sparsification methods balance the gender ratio (310/310) through random, stratified, or weighted sampling. Feature modification applies redistribution formulas to achieve theoretical fairness bounds by reassigning sensitive attribute values. Synthetic augmentation uses GraphSAGE encoder-decoder architecture with GMM sampling to generate synthetic female profiles up to 690/690 balance. All methods are evaluated on statistical parity gap, equality of opportunity gap, false positive rate gap, and accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- Stratified sampling achieves minimal fairness gaps (1% for statistical parity and equality of opportunity) while maintaining accuracy
- Feature modification achieves near-zero fairness gaps (0-2%) but reduces accuracy by ~7%
- GraphSAGE augmentation achieves 2% fairness gaps while improving overall accuracy, though false positive rate gap increases to 28%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Stratified Sampling for Demographic Balancing
By partitioning nodes into subgroups by the sensitive attribute (gender) and sampling independently from each, stratified sampling enforces equal representation ratios. This prevents the overrepresented group from dominating gradient updates during GCN training. Core assumption: The sensitive attribute is known and can be used to stratify; the relationship between features and labels within each subgroup is representative of the true distribution. Break condition: If the underrepresented subgroup contains too few nodes to sample meaningfully (e.g., <50 samples), stratified sampling may produce high-variance estimates.

### Mechanism 2: Feature Redistribution for Theoretical Fairness Bounds
Randomly reassigning sensitive attribute values (formula: NC = O - X/2) eliminates correlation between the sensitive attribute and prediction outcomes. This breaks the statistical dependency that produces disparate treatment. Core assumption: Other features do not allow inference of the original sensitive attribute; the relationship between features and labels remains valid after redistribution. Break condition: If proxy variables (e.g., occupation, location) strongly correlate with the sensitive attribute, fairness gains will not transfer to real-world deployments.

### Mechanism 3: GraphSAGE-Based Synthetic Augmentation
GraphSAGE learns node embeddings that capture both attribute information and graph neighborhood structure. The decoder reconstructs profiles, and GMM samples from the learned latent distribution of underrepresented nodes, preserving relational integrity while expanding demographic representation. Core assumption: The learned latent space accurately captures the true distribution of minority-group characteristics; synthetic nodes integrate without disrupting existing edge semantics. Break condition: False positive rate gaps increased to 28%—monitor for unintended bias migration to error-type metrics when using augmentation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Message Passing**
  - Why needed here: All mitigation methods are evaluated by training a 3-layer GCN; understanding how node features propagate through graph structure is essential for interpreting why sparsification and augmentation affect fairness.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a GCN aggregates neighbor information during forward propagation?

- Concept: **Fairness Metrics (Statistical Parity, Equality of Opportunity, False Positive Rates)**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates methods using gap differences between groups; selecting the wrong metric for your application can mask discriminatory outcomes.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between statistical parity (equal positive prediction rates) and equality of opportunity (equal true positive rates)?

- Concept: **Inductive vs. Transductive Learning in GNNs**
  - Why needed here: GraphSAGE is an inductive method that can generate embeddings for unseen nodes, enabling synthetic node creation. This distinguishes it from transductive methods that cannot generalize beyond the training graph.
  - Quick check question: Why would an inductive GNN be required for generating synthetic nodes that didn't exist in the original graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: German credit dataset -> Preprocessing (sparsification/feature modification/augmentation) -> 3-layer GCN (200 epochs) -> Evaluation (statistical parity gap, equality of opportunity gap, FPR gap, accuracy)
- Critical path:
  1. Analyze original dataset for demographic imbalance (gender ratio: 690/310 male/female)
  2. Select mitigation method based on acceptable accuracy-fairness tradeoff
  3. Apply transformation (stratified sampling is lowest-risk; augmentation requires GraphSAGE training)
  4. Train GCN on modified dataset
  5. Evaluate all four metrics; flag if FPR gap exceeds acceptable threshold
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Stratified sampling: Best fairness-accuracy balance (1% gaps, no accuracy loss), but discards data
  - Feature modification: Optimal fairness (0-2% gaps), but 7% accuracy drop and limited real-world applicability
  - GraphSAGE augmentation: Good fairness (2% gaps on parity/opportunity), improved accuracy, but 28% FPR gap—requires monitoring
- Failure signatures:
  - FPR gap widening despite improvements in other metrics (observed in augmentation)
  - Proxy variable leakage undermining feature modification gains
  - Synthetic nodes with unrealistic attribute combinations (validate loan amounts, age ranges against original distributions)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce stratified sampling baseline on german credit: confirm 1% gaps, verify accuracy stability
  2. Test augmentation with different GMM component counts (k=2, 4, 8) to assess sensitivity of FPR gap
  3. Apply all three methods to a second dataset with different sensitive attributes (e.g., age groups) to test generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can feature modification strategies be adapted for datasets where non-sensitive attributes contain indirect patterns that allow the inference of sensitive attributes? The authors state that their feature modification method is suitable because features do not reveal the original attribute, but note it is "not generally suitable as in some datasets, indirect patterns... may allow sensitive attributes to be inferred." This assumes independence between modified attributes and other features, a condition often violated in real-world data, limiting the method's generalizability.

### Open Question 2
Does the observed effectiveness of GraphSAGE-based augmentation and stratified sampling generalize to significantly larger or more complex graph topologies? The study is confined to the "german credit dataset," which contains only 1000 nodes and simple relational structures. The scalability of these mitigation techniques is unknown; GraphSAGE performance and the fidelity of synthetic data may degrade or shift on large-scale networks (e.g., social networks) with different structural properties.

### Open Question 3
What specific characteristics of the GraphSAGE augmentation caused the false positive rate (FPR) gap to increase to 28% despite improvements in statistical parity? The results show a contradictory outcome where synthetic augmentation reduced statistical parity to 2% but "for false positive rates, the difference increases to 28%," a trade-off noted but not explained. The paper does not investigate why the generated synthetic profiles improved overall accuracy and parity while specifically failing to equalize the error rates (FPR) between groups.

## Limitations
- Evaluation constrained to single dataset (german credit), limiting generalizability
- Graph construction methodology not specified, affecting reproducibility
- FPR gap increase in augmentation (28%) concerning but not deeply analyzed for underlying causes
- Feature modification's theoretical fairness gains may not transfer to real-world settings due to proxy variable leakage

## Confidence
- Stratified sampling effectiveness: High (supported by direct results and intuitive mechanism)
- Feature modification as theoretical baseline: Medium (achieved results but limited real-world applicability)
- GraphSAGE augmentation FPR concerns: Medium-Low (results show improvement but with notable negative side effects not fully explained)

## Next Checks
1. Test augmentation sensitivity to GMM component count (k=2, 4, 8) to identify optimal configuration that minimizes FPR gap
2. Apply all three methods to a second dataset with different sensitive attributes to validate generalizability beyond gender-based credit data
3. Conduct feature importance analysis on synthetic nodes to verify they capture meaningful minority-group characteristics rather than noise
