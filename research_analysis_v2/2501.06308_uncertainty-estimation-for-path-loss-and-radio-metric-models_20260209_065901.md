# Uncertainty Estimation for Path Loss and Radio Metric Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.06308
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06308
- Reference count: 9
- Key outcome: CPS with difficulty estimators achieves 89-90% effective coverage and adaptive prediction intervals for radio metrics across Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal.

## Executive Summary
This paper applies Conformal Predictive Systems (CPS) with difficulty estimators to quantify uncertainty in radio metric models (RSRP, RSRQ, RSSI) and path loss models. Using the CREPES framework, the authors generate 95% confidence prediction intervals that adapt to sample difficulty. The methodology demonstrates high effective coverage across geographically distinct test cities while maintaining narrow prediction intervals, with difficulty estimators successfully identifying challenging samples that correlate with higher prediction errors.

## Method Summary
The authors employ the CREPES framework to generate conformal predictive intervals for radio metric and path loss models. The approach uses difficulty estimators (norm std, norm targ strng, Mondrian categories) to stratify samples by prediction difficulty. An inductive conformal setup with calibration holdout enables adaptive interval widths. The methodology is evaluated on crowdsourced 4G radio metric data from Toronto (training), Vancouver (testing), and Montreal (blind testing), with results showing effective coverage of 89-90% and meaningful correlation between difficulty scores and prediction accuracy.

## Key Results
- CPS models achieve 89-90% effective coverage at 95% confidence level across Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal test sets
- Mean prediction interval widths remain narrow while adapting to prediction difficulty
- RMSE decreases monotonically as easier difficulty quartiles are considered, validating difficulty estimator effectiveness
- Toronto-trained CPS models generalize effectively to Vancouver and Montreal without retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CPS framework generates valid prediction intervals by using calibration residuals to determine prediction uncertainty. The key innovation is incorporating difficulty estimators that measure how challenging each prediction is based on feature space density and target strength. By stratifying samples by difficulty, the method can provide tighter intervals for easy samples while maintaining coverage guarantees. The Mondrian approach allows category-specific calibration, enabling the model to handle heterogeneous data distributions across different urban environments.

## Foundational Learning

**Conformal Predictive Systems (CPS)**: A framework for generating prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage probability. Why needed: Provides statistically valid uncertainty quantification for regression models. Quick check: Verify calibration set residuals follow the same distribution as test set residuals.

**CREPES Framework**: Python library implementing CPS with difficulty estimators. Why needed: Provides practical implementation of conformal prediction with stratification capabilities. Quick check: Confirm difficulty estimator hyperparameters are properly tuned via cross-validation.

**Difficulty Estimators**: Metrics that quantify how challenging a prediction is (e.g., feature space density, target strength). Why needed: Enables adaptive interval widths that reflect prediction difficulty. Quick check: Correlate difficulty scores with actual prediction errors on validation set.

**Mondrian Conformal Prediction**: Category-based conformal prediction that allows different calibration for different groups. Why needed: Handles heterogeneous data distributions across urban environments. Quick check: Verify coverage is maintained within each category.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Data -> Base Regression Model -> CPS with Difficulty Estimator -> Adaptive Prediction Intervals

**Critical Path**: The essential workflow is: 1) Train base regression model on historical data, 2) Hold out calibration set, 3) Fit CPS with difficulty estimator using calibration residuals, 4) Generate prediction intervals on new data using calibrated CPS.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The methodology balances coverage probability (fixed at 95%) against interval width. Using difficulty estimators allows narrower intervals for easy samples while maintaining coverage, but requires careful hyperparameter tuning to avoid overfitting to the calibration set.

**Failure Signatures**: Coverage dropping below 89% indicates the calibration set is unrepresentative or too small. Failure to adapt interval widths suggests the difficulty estimator is not capturing meaningful variation in prediction difficulty.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate effective coverage on calibration set before testing on new cities
2. Plot difficulty scores against actual prediction errors to confirm monotonic relationship
3. Compare PI widths across different difficulty quartiles to verify adaptive behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Does implementing "further focused learning" on high-difficulty sample groups significantly improve the accuracy of the underlying radio metric models? The paper suggests this could enhance model performance but doesn't execute the re-training loop to verify gains.

**Open Question 2**: How can difficulty estimators formally distinguish between errors caused by data under-representation versus model architectural limitations? The methodology identifies difficult samples but doesn't attribute the source of difficulty.

**Open Question 3**: What specific interpretability mechanisms can translate difficulty scores into actionable "partial explainability" for network operators? The paper quantifies uncertainty but doesn't demonstrate how to map difficulty to specific physical features explaining prediction uncertainty.

## Limitations

- Reproducibility limited by lack of publicly available trained base models and raw crowdsourced datasets
- Results validated only on 4G data from specific North American urban environments
- Methodology assumes CREPES framework's difficulty estimators generalize, but performance on other geographies or network technologies is unexplored

## Confidence

**High**: Effectiveness of CPS in generating adaptive prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage
**Medium**: Generalizability of difficulty estimators across different urban environments
**Low**: Scalability to other wireless technologies or non-urban settings

## Next Checks

1. Test CPS methodology on 5G datasets to assess applicability to newer network technologies
2. Validate difficulty estimators on datasets from different geographies, such as rural or suburban areas
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of each difficulty estimator on prediction interval performance
