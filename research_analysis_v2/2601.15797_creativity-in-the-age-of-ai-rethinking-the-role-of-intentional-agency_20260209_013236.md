# Creativity in the Age of AI: Rethinking the Role of Intentional Agency

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.15797
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15797
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: The paper argues that the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC) for creativity should be replaced with a consistency requirement, as recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic and biased against AI-generated outputs.

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the long-standing requirement that creativity necessitates intentional agency, arguing that recent advances in generative AI have made this condition both untenable and harmful. Using a conceptual engineering approach, the authors demonstrate through corpus analysis that language around AI creativity is shifting despite AI systems lacking intentional agency. They identify how the IAC now creates systematic bias against AI outputs through producer-identity effects, where evaluators downgrade objectively novel and valuable AI-generated content when they know its source. The paper proposes replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement that preserves the core social function of creativity attribution—identifying reliable sources of novel and valuable outputs—while avoiding the anti-AI bias the IAC currently engenders.

## Method Summary
The authors employ conceptual engineering methodology to analyze whether the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC) should remain a necessary criterion for creativity in the age of AI. They analyze two corpora: Google Ngram Viewer data tracking bigram frequencies from 1900-2022, and the News on the Web (NOW) corpus from 2010-2022, examining phrases like "AI creates" alongside traditional creative agent phrases. The analysis shows increasing linguistic willingness to ascribe creativity to AI systems despite their lack of intentional agency. No machine learning models were trained; the approach is purely corpus linguistic analysis combined with conceptual argumentation.

## Key Results
- Corpus evidence shows increasing linguistic comfort with ascribing creativity to AI, with "AI creates" bigram frequency rising sharply since ~2017
- The IAC creates systematic bias against AI-generated outputs through producer-identity effects, causing evaluators to undervalue objectively novel and valuable products
- A consistency requirement can replace IAC to preserve creativity's social function of identifying reliable sources of novel/valuable outputs while avoiding anti-AI bias

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Intentional Agency Condition (IAC) creates systematic bias against AI-generated outputs, causing evaluators to undervalue objectively novel and valuable products.
- Mechanism: Evaluators employ heuristics (producer-identity effect, effort heuristic) that default to process-first reasoning. When they learn an output is AI-generated, they discount its perceived creativity regardless of blind-evaluation baseline.
- Core assumption: Blind evaluation provides a neutral baseline for creativity assessment; observed biases are distortions rather than corrections.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs"
  - [section 2] Cites Magni et al. (2024), Hattori et al. (2024), Proksch et al. (2024) showing algorithm aversion: participants favored AI outputs when unlabeled but downgraded them when told they were AI-generated.
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support—neighbor papers on agency in AI are recent and uncited (cited_by_count=0), suggesting this mechanism is emerging, not established.
- Break condition: If blind evaluation studies show no producer-identity penalty for AI outputs, the bias mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Linguistic practice is shifting toward ascribing creativity to AI despite lack of intentional agency, undermining intuition-based defenses of IAC.
- Mechanism: Corpus frequency of "AI creates" has risen sharply since ~2017 (Google Ngram, NOW corpus). Authors and journalists increasingly use creativity language for AI, signaling that competent speakers' intuitions no longer uniformly support IAC.
- Core assumption: Corpus bigram frequency tracks genuine conceptual attribution rather than metaphorical or unreflective usage.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI"
  - [section 2] Figure 1 (Ngram) and Figure 2 (NOW) show "AI creates" spike post-2017; authors argue this places pressure on linguistic intuitions underlying IAC.
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "Agency in the Age of AI" (FMR=0.655) addresses related concerns but has 0 citations—evidence is preliminary.
- Break condition: If corpus analysis shows "AI creates" is predominantly ironic, critical, or scare-quoted, the mechanism weakens.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A consistency requirement can replace IAC to preserve the core social function of creativity language (identifying reliable sources of novel/valuable outputs) while avoiding anti-AI bias.
- Mechanism: The IAC's original function was to block investment in accidental or one-off sources. A consistency requirement—requiring that creative outputs come from systems capable of reliably generating them—achieves this without demanding intentional agency.
- Core assumption: Consistency is tractable to assess and provides sufficient grounds for resource allocation decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products"
  - [section 3] Authors argue consistency excludes Gaut's "knocked-over paints" case while including consistent AI systems; no direct empirical test provided.
  - [corpus] No corpus papers test consistency-as-creativity-criterion; mechanism is conceptual, not empirically validated.
- Break condition: If consistency cannot be reliably assessed, or if it fails to exclude accidental production in edge cases, the replacement mechanism is incomplete.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Intentional Agency Condition (IAC)
  - Why needed here: Central target of the paper's critique; understanding what it demands (conscious goal representation) clarifies why AI fails it and why this matters.
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish between a system that "acts" (produces outputs) and one that "acts intentionally" (represents goals in advance)?

- Concept: Conceptual Engineering
  - Why needed here: The authors' methodological framework; they argue concepts should be revised when they no longer serve their social functions.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between describing how a concept *is* used vs. prescribing how it *should* be used to serve a function?

- Concept: Product-First vs. Process-First Approaches
  - Why needed here: Structures the core debate—should creativity be judged by outputs alone, or do we need to inspect the generative process?
  - Quick check question: If two paintings are visually identical, but one was painted intentionally and one was spilled accidentally, would you call both creative? Why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input layer (creative outputs with/without producer-labels) -> Evaluation layer (blind vs. informed assessment) -> Conceptual filter (IAC vs. Consistency vs. Context-sensitive hybrid) -> Output layer (creativity ascription + resource allocation)

- Critical path:
  1. Generate output via human or AI system
  2. Conduct blind evaluation of novelty + value
  3. Apply conceptual filter (IAC or consistency)
  4. Observe whether filter biases evaluation relative to blind baseline
  5. Allocate resources based on filtered judgment

- Design tradeoffs:
  - IAC: Protects expressive authenticity in high-stakes contexts (e.g., love letters, eulogies) but introduces anti-AI bias in instrumental contexts (e.g., scientific hypotheses)
  - Consistency-only: Removes bias but may dilute the "praise" function of creativity language in human-centered domains
  - Context-sensitive (NSD + local IAC): Preserves flexibility but requires domain-specific boundary-drawing—authors do not provide a complete taxonomy

- Failure signatures:
  - Over-application of IAC leads to systematic undervaluation of AI outputs that would pass blind evaluation
  - Under-application of IAC in authenticity-sensitive domains (art, personal communication) erodes trust and expressive value
  - Consistency criterion becomes vacuous if "potential consistency" is unmoored from evidence

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate blind vs. labeled evaluation studies with outputs matched for novelty/value; measure delta in creativity ratings when producer is identified as AI vs. human
  2. Test whether consistency judgments (perceived reliability of future outputs) predict resource allocation independently of producer-identity information
  3. Survey domain experts in authenticity-sensitive fields (e.g., poets, therapists) to identify boundary conditions where IAC is deemed essential vs. dispensable

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Corpus analysis provides suggestive but not conclusive evidence of conceptual shift; frequency increases in "AI creates" could reflect metaphorical or ironic usage rather than genuine attribution of creativity
- The consistency requirement's practical implementation remains underspecified—no clear methodology for assessing "reliable generation" of creative outputs is provided
- Context-sensitive boundaries for IAC retention are described but not rigorously mapped, leaving implementation ambiguity in authenticity-sensitive domains

## Confidence
- High: The documented bias against AI outputs when producer-identity is known (based on cited experimental literature)
- Medium: The claim that IAC is losing its core social function (based on linguistic trends but lacking direct causal evidence)
- Low: The proposed New Standard Definition's universal applicability (conceptually coherent but untested in real-world evaluations)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments testing whether "consistency" judgments about AI systems predict resource allocation independently of producer-identity information
2. Analyze whether "AI creates" bigram usage in corpus data shows irony/skepticism markers (scare quotes, negation, or critical framing) that would undermine the linguistic shift claim
3. Survey practitioners in authenticity-sensitive domains (poets, therapists, etc.) to empirically identify boundary conditions where IAC retention is considered essential vs. dispensable
