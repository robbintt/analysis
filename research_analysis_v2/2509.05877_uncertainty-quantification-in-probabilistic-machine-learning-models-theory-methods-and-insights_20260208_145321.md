# Uncertainty Quantification in Probabilistic Machine Learning Models: Theory, Methods, and Insights

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05877
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05877
- Reference count: 2
- Primary result: Framework estimates epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in GPLVMs, with aleatoric uncertainty overestimated for discontinuous functions and epistemic uncertainty highest for step functions

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a systematic framework for estimating epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in probabilistic machine learning models, with focus on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs). The authors use Random Fourier Features-based Gaussian Processes for scalable approximation of predictive distributions and derive theoretical formulations for both uncertainty types. A Monte Carlo sampling method is proposed to compute these uncertainties, incorporating the uncertainty in training latent variables, test latent variables, and model parameters. Experimental results on synthetic data show that aleatoric uncertainty is accurately estimated for linear functions and overestimated for discontinuous step functions, while epistemic uncertainty is highest for step functions and lowest for smooth periodic functions.

## Method Summary
The method develops a systematic framework for estimating epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in GPLVMs using Random Fourier Features (RFF) for scalable Gaussian Process approximation. The approach first uses variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution of training latent variables, model parameters, and noise covariance. For test points, it optimizes the posterior of the test latent variable given observed outputs. Uncertainty is then computed through Monte Carlo sampling, drawing samples from the posterior distributions of training latent variables, test latent variables, and model parameters to estimate both epistemic and aleatoric components of predictive uncertainty.

## Key Results
- Aleatoric uncertainty accurately estimated for linear functions but significantly overestimated for discontinuous step functions
- Epistemic uncertainty highest for step functions (due to model limitations) and lowest for smooth periodic functions
- RFF-based GPLVM provides scalable uncertainty quantification with estimates stabilizing as the number of random features increases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The total predictive uncertainty can be decomposed into epistemic and aleatoric components, allowing for the separate quantification of model and data uncertainty.
- Mechanism: The law of total covariance (Eq. 5) mathematically separates the variance in the prediction. The first term, representing epistemic uncertainty, measures how much the expected prediction varies due to posterior uncertainty in the model parameters. The second term, representing aleatoric uncertainty, is the expected predictive covariance due to intrinsic data noise under the model's posterior.
- Core assumption: The predictive distribution can be meaningfully approximated by the model, and the RFF-based GP sufficiently captures the covariance structure for the decomposition to hold.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "We derive a theoretical formulation for UQ..."; [section]: Page 2, Equation 5 and the subsequent text define epistemic uncertainty as Cov_p(θ|D)[...] and aleatoric uncertainty as E_p(θ|D)[...]; [corpus]: Corpus evidence is weak for this exact decomposition formula but consistent with general UQ principles.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Monte Carlo sampling over latent variables and model parameters provides a tractable method for estimating the complex integrals required for uncertainty quantification in GPLVMs.
- Mechanism: The method first draws M samples of the training latent variables X(m) from their posterior. For each X(m), it draws L samples of the test latent variable x*(m,ℓ). These samples are used to approximate the expectations and variances in the theoretical uncertainty formulas (Eq. 31, 32), propagating uncertainty from the training data, test data, and model parameters.
- Core assumption: The MCMC or variational inference procedures yield representative samples from the true posteriors p(X|Y), p(x*|...), and p(θ|X,Y).
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "...propose a Monte Carlo sampling-based estimation method..."; [section]: Page 6, Section 5 details the Monte Carlo estimates for epistemic (Eq. 31) and aleatoric (Eq. 32) uncertainty; [corpus]: Corpus evidence is weak for this specific 3-source MC integration approach.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Random Fourier Features (RFF) enable scalable uncertainty quantification by approximating the GP kernel with a finite-dimensional feature map, turning the GP into a Bayesian linear model.
- Mechanism: The kernel κ is approximated by an inner product of random feature vectors φ(x) (Eq. 14-15). This allows the GP function to be represented as a linear model f(x) = φ(x)ᵀθ (Eq. 16). This transformation makes the computation of predictive distributions and their associated uncertainties more efficient, avoiding the O(N³) cost of standard GPs.
- Core assumption: The number of random features J is sufficiently large to accurately approximate the kernel for the given data and function type.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "...employ scalable Random Fourier Features-based Gaussian Processes to approximate predictive distributions efficiently."; [section]: Page 4, Equations 14-16 define the RFF approximation and its integration into the GPLVM; [corpus]: Corpus evidence is weak for direct validation of this scalability claim in UQ but RFF is a known technique for scalable GPs.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Law of Total Variance/Covariance
- Why needed here: This statistical identity is the theoretical engine for separating uncertainty types. Without it, one cannot mathematically justify the additive decomposition T = E + A.
- Quick check question: If you have a random variable Y dependent on another random variable Θ, how would you express Var[Y] as a function of Var[E[Y|Θ]] and E[Var[Y|Θ]]?

### Concept: Gaussian Process (GP) Priors & Posterior Predictive Distribution
- Why needed here: The GPLVM is built entirely on GP priors over functions. Understanding how a GP defines a distribution over functions and how the posterior predictive distribution provides both a mean and a variance is essential.
- Quick check question: What are the two main components of a GP prior, and how does adding data points constrain the possible functions in the posterior?

### Concept: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) / Variational Inference
- Why needed here: The framework relies on drawing samples from complex, non-analytic posterior distributions p(X,θ,Σy|Y). Understanding how these samples are generated is critical for the method's implementation and limitations.
- Quick check question: Why is it generally necessary to use sampling methods like MCMC for inference in Bayesian latent variable models, rather than direct calculation?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
1. Data Ingestion: High-dimensional observations Y (training) and partial test point y*
2. GPLVM Core: Models mapping from latent space X to observed space Y via d_y independent GPs
3. RFF Layer: Approximates GP kernels with a finite set of random Fourier features φ(x), enabling linear model representation
4. Inference Engine: Uses MCMC or variational inference to draw samples from the joint posterior p(X, θ, Σy | Y)
5. Prediction & UQ Module:
   a. Infers posterior of test latent variable p(x* | y_o,*, Y)
   b. Constructs predictive distribution for missing outputs y_u,*
   c. Applies MC sampling to compute epistemic (Eq. 31) and aleatoric (Eq. 32) variances

### Critical path:
Training Data Y -> [Inference Engine] -> Posterior Samples {X(m), θ(m), Σ(m)} -> (with test point y*) -> [Prediction & UQ Module] -> {Prediction, Epistemic Uncertainty, Aleatoric Uncertainty}

### Design tradeoffs:
- **Accuracy vs. Scalability:** Increasing the number of RFF features (J) improves kernel approximation but increases computational cost. Paper experiments (J=10 to 500) show estimates stabilize.
- **UQ Precision vs. Computation:** Increasing MC samples (M, L) improves the precision of uncertainty estimates but linearly increases prediction-time cost.
- **Model Flexibility vs. UQ Reliability:** As shown with the step function, complex/discontinuous functions may fit poorly (high epistemic U), but the UQ correctly signals this limitation.

### Failure signatures:
1. High Aleatoric, Low Epistemic on Complex Functions: May indicate model misspecification where irreducible noise is overestimated because the model cannot capture the function's structure (as seen with the step function).
2. Unstable/Uncalibrated Uncertainty Estimates: Likely caused by insufficient MCMC convergence or too few samples (M, L).
3. Epistemic Uncertainty Not Decreasing with Data: Suggests a problem with the inference of latent variables or parameters; the model is not learning.

### First 3 experiments:
1. Linear Baseline Reproduction: Train the GPLVM on purely linear data and verify that aleatoric uncertainty is estimated accurately (close to the true noise variance) and epistemic uncertainty is low.
2. Discontinuity Probe: Train on a dataset with a sharp discontinuity. Observe if aleatoric uncertainty is overestimated and epistemic uncertainty is high, correctly signaling the model's limitation.
3. Latent Space Sensitivity: On a test point with observed components y_o,*, systematically degrade the observed information and plot the resulting increase in epistemic uncertainty of the latent x* and the final prediction y_u,*.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the uncertainty introduced by the Monte Carlo sampling process itself be quantified and incorporated into the total predictive uncertainty budget?
- Basis: [explicit] The conclusion states: "The computation of uncertainties relied on Monte Carlo simulations, which in turn introduced additional sources of uncertainty. This was not accounted for in this paper and is left for future work."
- Why unresolved: The proposed framework estimates epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty using finite samples (M=100, L=100), which introduces variance (estimation error) that is currently ignored in the final uncertainty budget.
- Evidence: A theoretical derivation of the estimator variance or an empirical analysis showing the convergence of uncertainty estimates as a function of sample size M and L.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the overestimation of aleatoric uncertainty for discontinuous functions be corrected without altering the underlying Gaussian Process assumptions?
- Basis: [inferred] The results show aleatoric uncertainty was "significantly overestimated" for step functions due to the "limited ability of GPs to model discontinuities," suggesting the model attributes functional errors to data noise.
- Why unresolved: The current framework uses standard stationary kernels (RBF) which are ill-suited for step functions, causing a conflation of model misspecification (epistemic) with irreducible noise (aleatoric).
- Evidence: Experiments utilizing non-stationary kernels or change-point detection models within the RFF framework to verify if aleatoric estimates align with the ground truth noise variance (σ²_ε) for discontinuous data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the theoretical bounds on the distortion of epistemic and aleatoric components specifically caused by the Random Fourier Features (RFF) approximation?
- Basis: [inferred] The paper varies the number of random features J empirically and observes changes in uncertainty estimates, but does not provide theoretical guarantees on how the low-rank approximation affects the decomposition.
- Why unresolved: While RFF approximates the kernel, it is unclear if the approximation error biases the decomposition (e.g., systematically underestimating epistemic uncertainty while inflating aleatoric uncertainty) or preserves the relative proportions.
- Evidence: A formal analysis comparing the decomposition of the exact kernel versus the RFF approximation, establishing convergence bounds for the decomposed variance terms as J increases.

## Limitations

- The experimental validation is limited to synthetic data, and real-world performance on noisy, high-dimensional datasets remains untested
- The RFF approximation may introduce approximation error for complex kernel functions
- The assumption that the GPLVM is an appropriate model for the data is critical—severe model misspecification can lead to unreliable uncertainty estimates

## Confidence

- **High:** The theoretical decomposition of uncertainty (Mechanism 1) and the general applicability of the Monte Carlo sampling method (Mechanism 2) are well-supported by established statistical principles
- **Medium:** The specific implementation details of the RFF-based GPLVM and the claimed scalability benefits require further validation on larger, real-world datasets
- **Low:** The paper's conclusions about the interpretability of epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in the presence of model misspecification (e.g., the step function example) are reasonable but could benefit from more rigorous analysis

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce Synthetic Results: Implement the full pipeline on the same synthetic dataset (linear, periodic, step functions) to verify the reported uncertainty estimates and their behavior across function types
2. Test on Real-World Data: Apply the framework to a real-world dataset (e.g., from a domain like robotics or healthcare) to assess its practical utility and robustness to noise and model assumptions
3. Sensitivity Analysis: Systematically vary the number of RFF features (J) and Monte Carlo samples (M, L) to quantify their impact on the accuracy and stability of the uncertainty estimates
