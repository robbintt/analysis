# Mind the Gap! Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.10058
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10058
- **Authors:** Dani Roytburg; Beck Miller
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Over 80% of AI safety and ethics collaborations occur within communities alone, with cross-field connectivity highly concentrated and fragile.

## Executive Summary
This study presents quantitative evidence of a structural schism between AI safety and ethics research communities. Analyzing 6,442 papers from 12 conferences (2020-2025) via co-authorship networks, the authors find that over 80% of collaborations occur within safety or ethics alone. Cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated—5% of papers account for >85% of bridging links. Network perturbation tests show that removing a few central brokers sharply increases segregation, demonstrating fragile integration. These results reveal the divide as institutional, not merely conceptual, with implications for research agendas, policy, and governance.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed a co-authorship network from 6,442 papers across 12 AI conferences (2020-2025), classifying papers as Safety, Ethics, or Mixed using a two-stage filter: keyword matching followed by LLM verification. They analyzed network metrics including homophily (83.1% in-group collaboration), bridge concentration (5% of papers account for >85% of cross-field links), and weighted average shortest path. Statistical significance was validated against label-shuffle and degree-preserving rewiring null models (p<0.01). Perturbation tests involved removing top-degree nodes to measure network fragility.

## Key Results
- Co-authorship networks show 83.1% homophily, indicating over 80% of collaborations occur within either safety or ethics communities exclusively
- Cross-community connectivity is fragile: 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links between safety and ethics communities
- Removing even a small number of central authors dramatically increases network segregation, demonstrating the divide's structural nature

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Co-authorship patterns reveal structural insularity between AI safety and ethics communities.
- Mechanism: Homophily—the tendency to collaborate within one's own community—creates self-reinforcing collaboration clusters. High in-group collaboration rates (83.1%) reduce exposure to cross-disciplinary methods and perspectives.
- Core assumption: Co-authorship accurately reflects active collaboration and intellectual engagement (not just incidental co-listing).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities"
  - [section 4.1] "global homophily of 83.1%... over four out of every five collaborations occur between authors who are exclusively focused on either safety or ethics"
  - [corpus] "Disentangling AI Alignment: A Structured Taxonomy Beyond Safety and Ethics" supports conceptual entanglement but lacks network data
- Break condition: If collaboration shifts to distributed cross-community teams or institutional incentives reward interdisciplinary work.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cross-community connectivity is fragile and depends on a small number of broker nodes.
- Mechanism: A hub-and-spoke topology means most cross-field paths traverse a few central authors. Removing top 1% of authors by degree eliminates 58% of bridge paths.
- Core assumption: Degree centrality correctly identifies critical brokers (vs. alternative centrality measures).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links"
  - [section 4.2] "removing even a small number of these authors or papers dramatically increases network segregation"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support—no external validation of bridge fragility
- Break condition: If new broker authors emerge or collaboration structure flattens to multi-hub topology.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-community collaboration faces longer path lengths than within-community collaboration.
- Mechanism: Weighted average shortest path analysis shows Safety-Ethics pairs require more co-authorship hops to connect than Safety-Safety or Ethics-Ethics pairs. After 5 hops, only 16.9% of SE pairs are connected (vs. 21.5% expected by chance).
- Core assumption: Shorter path lengths meaningfully correlate with easier collaboration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "80% of all Safety-Safety author pairs can be connected within a weighted distance of 6.0, whereas reaching the same fraction of Safety-Ethics pairs requires a longer path"
  - [corpus] No external validation of path-length differences
- Break condition: If structural interventions (shared venues, cross-training) reduce path lengths.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Homophily in networks**
  - Why needed here: Core metric showing insularity; interpreting 83.1% homophily requires understanding baseline expectations.
  - Quick check question: If homophily were 50%, would that indicate integration or segregation?

- Concept: **Null models for network significance**
  - Why needed here: Paper uses label-shuffle and degree-preserving rewiring to confirm structural separation isn't random.
  - Quick check question: Why preserve degree sequence when testing if observed homophily exceeds chance?

- Concept: **Brokerage and betweenness centrality**
  - Why needed here: Explains why removing 1% of high-degree nodes collapses 58% of cross-community paths.
  - Quick check question: Would a node with high degree but low betweenness be a good broker?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data layer: ACL Anthology + DBLP dumps → 102,329 papers filtered to 6,442 via keyword + LLM pipeline
  - Classification layer: Safety/Ethics/Mixed scoring based on keyword ratios
  - Network layer: Author co-authorship graph (4,564 nodes, ≥2 papers) + Paper similarity graph
  - Metrics layer: Homophily, bridge concentration, weighted average shortest path
  - Validation layer: Label-shuffle null (500–2000 reps) + degree-preserving rewiring null

- Critical path:
  1. Keyword filtering → LLM validation → Paper classification
  2. Author aggregation → Network construction
  3. Metric computation → Null model comparison
  4. Perturbation tests (node removal)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Co-authorship vs. citation networks: Authors chose co-authorship for measuring active collaboration; citations are noisier.
  - Conference scope vs. arXiv: Excluded preprints to avoid double-counting and ensure peer-review quality.
  - Single-paper author exclusion: Necessary for density but underrepresents newcomers.

- Failure signatures:
  - High false-positive rate in keyword filtering (41–56%) → required LLM second-stage filter
  - Sparse networks if single-paper authors included → metrics become unstable

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate homophily calculation on a subset; verify ~83% baseline with label-shuffle significance.
  2. Run bridge concentration test: remove top 100 authors by degree, confirm bridge fraction drops toward zero.
  3. Compute weighted ASP distributions for SS/EE/SE pairs; verify SE distribution is right-shifted (p < 0.01 via permutation test).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the exclusion of arXiv preprints and industry technical reports skew the structural representation of the safety-ethics divide?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge in Section 5.1 that their corpus does not capture the full ecosystem, excluding "influential preprints" and "industry technical reports."
- Why unresolved: It remains unclear if the "schism" is an artifact of slow-moving peer review or if it exists equally in fast-moving preprint communities.
- What evidence would resolve it: A replication of the network analysis on a corpus including arXiv preprints and non-academic technical reports.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can mechanistic interpretability tools effectively operationalize the normative audits required by AI ethics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion proposes "Integrative Research Methodologies," suggesting interpretability techniques as "powerful instruments" for conducting algorithmic audits.
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes this pathway but provides no empirical evidence that tools designed for "mechanism" can capture "normative" violations like bias or injustice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical case studies where interpretability methods successfully identify and mitigate specific ethical biases in deployed models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does citation network analysis reveal a different level of intellectual integration than the social isolation found in co-authorship networks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors use co-authorship as a proxy for collaboration in Section 3.2, acknowledging it measures "direct partnership" but not "passive influence" or intellectual exchange.
- Why unresolved: While authors may not co-write (social silo), they may heavily cite each other (intellectual integration); the current study cannot distinguish social separation from conceptual ignorance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study measuring homophily and bridge connectivity in citation networks versus the presented co-authorship networks.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the concentration of "bridge" authors in specific institutions correlate with funding streams?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper identifies "institutional silos" and "funding streams" as drivers of the divide, but the quantitative analysis focuses on paper outputs, not financial inputs.
- Why unresolved: It is unknown if the fragile 5% of bridging papers is driven by specific interdisciplinary grant programs or despite dominant funding incentives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlating the institutional affiliations and funding sources of the "central brokers" against the general population to identify financial drivers of integration.

## Limitations
- The study relies on keyword + LLM filtering, which may introduce false positives/negatives despite reported improvements in precision
- Single-paper authors are excluded to ensure meaningful co-authorship links, potentially underrepresenting emerging researchers
- Co-authorship patterns may not capture all forms of cross-community engagement (e.g., joint workshops, policy forums)

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Structural insularity exists (83.1% homophily, confirmed via two null models, p<0.01)
- **Medium confidence**: Bridge fragility (5% of papers account for 85% of cross-field links; verified via node-removal perturbation tests)
- **Medium confidence**: Path-length differences (SE pairs require longer paths; significance via permutation tests, p<0.01)

## Next Checks

1. **Replicate homophily baseline**: Re-run label-shuffle null model (500+ iterations) on the co-authorship graph; verify 83.1% homophily significantly exceeds chance (p<0.01).

2. **Validate bridge fragility**: Perform node-removal perturbation tests (remove top 100 authors by degree); confirm bridge path fraction drops sharply toward zero.

3. **Test path-length significance**: Run weighted ASP permutation tests for SS/EE/SE pairs (10,000 iterations); verify SE distribution is right-shifted vs. SS/EE (p<0.01).
