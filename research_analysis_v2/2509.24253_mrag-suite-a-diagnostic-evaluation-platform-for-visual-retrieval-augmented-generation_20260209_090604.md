# MRAG-Suite: A Diagnostic Evaluation Platform for Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24253
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24253
- Reference count: 26
- MRAG-Suite consolidates 8 multimodal benchmarks and introduces difficulty-based/ambiguity-aware filtering with MM-RAGChecker for claim-level diagnostics.

## Executive Summary
MRAG-Suite addresses the lack of systematic evaluation for Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Visual RAG) by providing a diagnostic platform that consolidates eight heterogeneous multimodal benchmarks under unified formats. It introduces difficulty-based and ambiguity-aware filtering strategies, along with MM-RAGChecker, a claim-level diagnostic tool for multimodal grounding. Experiments demonstrate that Visual RAG systems experience substantial accuracy reductions under difficult and ambiguous queries, with prevalent hallucinations. MM-RAGChecker effectively diagnoses these issues, providing actionable signals for improving evidence selection and justification in Visual RAG systems.

## Method Summary
MRAG-Suite consolidates eight heterogeneous multimodal benchmarks (WebQA, Chart-RAG, Visual-RAG, MRAG-Bench, VisRAG-ArXiv/Plot/Slide/Doc) into unified formats with question-answer-evidence triples. The platform implements a two-step filtering pipeline: first removing questions easily answered by closed-book models (>0.9 confidence), then applying difficulty-based filtering that drops ~10% of easiest questions per domain. MM-RAGChecker provides claim-level diagnostics through a three-stage process: claim extraction via LLM splitter, per-evidence 3-way judging (top K=3 per modality, temp=0), and aggregation with precedence rules. The platform supports three retrieval modes (gt_only, gt_plus_distractors, distractors_only) using CLIP ViT-L/14 for images, DPR/SBERT for text, and FAISS indexing.

## Key Results
- Visual RAG systems show substantial accuracy reductions under difficult (70-75%) and ambiguous (65-72%) queries compared to easy (86-90%)
- Hallucination rates increase dramatically (9.5-15.4 percentage points) when ambiguous distractors are added
- MM-RAGChecker diagnostics reveal modality skew issues with low text context precision (28-31%) vs high image precision

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The platform works by creating controlled evaluation conditions that expose weaknesses in Visual RAG systems through systematic difficulty and ambiguity manipulation. By filtering out easy questions and introducing carefully selected distractors, it reveals performance degradation patterns that standard benchmarks miss. The MM-RAGChecker component provides granular diagnostic signals at the claim level, identifying specific failure modes like modality bias and evidence under-utilization that aggregate metrics cannot capture.

## Foundational Learning

**Unified Multimodal Format** - Why needed: Standardizes heterogeneous benchmarks for fair comparison. Quick check: Verify all 8 sources normalize to {question, short_answer, long_answer, evidence_imgs, evidence_txts}.

**Two-Step Filtering Pipeline** - Why needed: Ensures evaluation focuses on genuinely challenging queries. Quick check: Confirm closed-book model confidence threshold >0.9 removes 10-15% of questions.

**MM-RAGChecker 3-Way Judging** - Why needed: Provides fine-grained diagnostic signals beyond binary accuracy. Quick check: Validate 3-way entailment (Entailment, Contradiction, Neutral) aggregation rules.

**Cross-Modality Balance** - Why needed: Identifies modality bias in evidence utilization. Quick check: Monitor |∆CR|/|∆CP| gaps across filtered datasets.

**Distractor Sampling Strategy** - Why needed: Creates realistic ambiguity scenarios. Quick check: Verify CLIP-similar distractors maintain domain relevance while being misleading.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: WebQA, Chart-RAG, Visual-RAG, MRAG-Bench, VisRAG-ArXiv, VisRAG-Plot, VisRAG-Slide, VisRAG-Doc -> Unified Format Normalizer -> Two-Step Filter -> MM-RAGChecker -> Diagnostic Metrics

**Critical Path**: Retrieval -> Evidence Selection -> Answer Generation -> MM-RAGChecker Diagnostics -> Performance Analysis

**Design Tradeoffs**: Unified format sacrifices some source-specific nuances for comparability; difficulty filtering may exclude some real-world easy queries but ensures focus on challenging cases; automated judges trade expert-level precision for scalability.

**Failure Signatures**: High hallucination on visually demanding queries (74-85% on Visual-RAG); low text context precision (28-31%) vs high image precision; modality skew committing to single evidence type.

**First Experiments**:
1. Replicate two-step filtering pipeline and verify difficulty/ambiguity distributions
2. Implement MM-RAGChecker with baseline LLaVA-v1.6-34B and reproduce diagnostic scores
3. Test retrieval modes (gt_only vs gt_plus_distractors) to confirm accuracy gaps and hallucination increases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can an integrated ambiguity detection and clarification pipeline significantly reduce the interpretation conflation and hallucination rates observed in Visual RAG systems? The current work identifies "interpretation conflation" as a dominant error pattern and states results "motivate an ambiguity detection & clarification step before final answer generation," but does not implement or evaluate such mitigation.

**Open Question 2**: How can Visual RAG architectures be modified to better balance cross-modality reasoning rather than committing to a single evidence type? The paper identifies "modality skew" where models commit to either text or images instead of reconciling both, but evaluates existing systems rather than proposing corrective training objectives.

**Open Question 3**: How reliably do MM-RAGChecker's automated claim-level diagnostics align with human expert evaluations in high-specialization domains like scholarly PDFs or technical plots? The Limitations section notes that automated judges "can diverge from expert assessments in domain-specific cases," but does not quantify this against human ground truth.

## Limitations

- Specific judge models and prompts for MM-RAGChecker 3-way entailment remain underspecified
- Distractor sampling procedure details unclear, affecting downstream results
- Gold claim mining process from reference long answers for Claim Recall computation not fully specified
- Filtered splits' difficulty calibration depends on closed-book model confidence thresholds that may not generalize

## Confidence

High: Core contribution (unified benchmark and filtering strategy)
Medium: Diagnostic methodology (due to unspecified judge models and prompts)

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the two-step filtering pipeline and verify the resulting difficulty/ambiguity distributions match reported statistics
2. Implement MM-RAGChecker with specified VLMs and reproduce the baseline LLaVA-v1.6-34B diagnostic scores
3. Test retrieval modes (gt_only vs gt_plus_distractors) to confirm reported accuracy gaps and hallucination increases
