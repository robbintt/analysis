# QuProFS: An Evolutionary Training-free Approach to Efficient Quantum Feature Map Search

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.07104
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07104
- **Reference count:** 37
- **Primary result:** Training-free quantum architecture search using proxy metrics achieves competitive accuracy with up to 2× speedup over gradient-based methods

## Executive Summary
QuProFS addresses the challenge of efficient quantum feature map search by eliminating gradient-based training through an ensemble of training-free proxy metrics. The framework combines hardware-aware circuit generation with evolutionary search, using expressivity, trainability, hardware robustness, and kernel-target alignment to rank circuits without parameter optimization. Evaluated across synthetic, classical, and quantum-native datasets on both simulators and real IBM Quantum hardware, QuProFS demonstrates competitive or superior accuracy while significantly reducing architecture search runtime compared to state-of-the-art QAS methods.

## Method Summary
QuProFS employs a 5-step evolutionary pipeline: (1) sample 150 hardware-aware circuits using native gates and qubit connectivity constraints, (2) filter 80% via kernel-target alignment on subsampled data, (3) compute proxies including expressivity (KL divergence to Haar), local effective dimension (LED), and hardware robustness metrics, (4) aggregate ranks using a hybrid formula that prioritizes top-ranked performance for dataset compatibility and mid-ranked stability for robustness, and (5) evolve via layer augmentation and 40% gate pruning to explore new architectures. The method uses QSVM for final evaluation without iterative training.

## Key Results
- Achieves competitive or superior classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art QAS methods across diverse datasets
- Demonstrates up to 2× speedup in architecture search runtime through training-free proxy evaluation
- Improves sampling efficiency by avoiding gradient-based optimization and barren plateaus
- Maintains hardware compatibility through native gate sets and adjacency constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Proxy-Based Gradient Bypass
The framework replaces gradient-based optimization with training-free proxy metrics (expressivity, LED, KTA) that serve as surrogate loss functions, avoiding barren plateaus while maintaining correlation with downstream task performance.

### Mechanism 2: Hybrid Rank Aggregation (sAZ)
A non-linear aggregation strategy splits proxies into two groups: M1 favors circuits with best raw scores for dataset compatibility, while M2 favors mid-range scores for robustness to avoid extremes like excessive depth or entanglement.

### Mechanism 3: Evolutionary Pruning as Exploration
Randomized gate pruning (40% rate) increases search diversity by exploring shallower architectures that often achieve better kernel-target alignment than dense, unpruned circuits.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Quantum Kernel Estimation (QKE)**
  - **Why needed here:** Essential for understanding Kernel Target Alignment as primary filter; κ(x_i, x_j) = |⟨φ(x_i)|φ(x_j)⟩|² computed via measurement statistics
  - **Quick check:** How does statistical noise in estimating |⟨φ|φ'⟩|² affect KTA filter reliability with small subsample sizes?

- **Concept: Barren Plateaus**
  - **Why needed here:** Explains why training-free approach is positioned as solution to flat training landscapes in gradient-based QAS
  - **Quick check:** Why does gradient variance vanish exponentially with qubit count in random circuits, and how does training-free approach sidestep this?

- **Concept: Haar Measure and Expressivity**
  - **Why needed here:** Expressivity proxy calculated via KL divergence against Haar distribution to measure state space exploration
  - **Quick check:** If output distribution perfectly matches Haar, does that guarantee good classification performance or just maximal state space exploration?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Sampler -> Filter (KTA) -> Scorer (proxies) -> Aggregator (sAZ) -> Evolver (prune + augment) -> Re-feed to Filter
- **Critical path:** KTA Filtering step is primary computational bottleneck; subsample size M must balance estimation accuracy (quadratic cost O(M²)) against runtime efficiency
- **Design tradeoffs:** Native gates vs universal gates reduces search space but avoids transpilation overhead; LED calculation costly, so data subsampling (60 circuits) trades accuracy for speed
- **Failure signatures:** Kernel concentration (Frobenius norm ||F - 1|| high), proxy-reality divergence (high sAZ but poor hardware performance), excessive CNOT count (>10-15 per qubit)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Scatter plot KTA scores vs QSVM accuracy for 100 random circuits to validate filter sufficiency
  2. Ablation on pruning rates {0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6} on Two Curves dataset to confirm moderate pruning improves KTA
  3. Swap sAZ aggregation for linear rank sum to test if mid-ranked prioritization prevents overfitting on Bars & Stripes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** What theoretical framework links training-free proxy metrics to generalization performance?
  - Basis: High proxy scores often fail to predict downstream accuracy; need theory linking proxies to generalization
  - Evidence needed: Proof or consistent empirical correlation showing specific proxy scores predict test accuracy across diverse datasets and noise models

- **Open Question 2:** How can search strategies adapt to avoid local optima in larger quantum circuit spaces?
  - Basis: Evolutionary strategy may face challenges in larger search spaces due to local optima and limited exploration
  - Evidence needed: Demonstration of convergence and performance stability on circuits with >20 qubits compared to other search strategies

- **Open Question 3:** Can alternative routing methods like SWAP networks improve hardware compatibility vs efficiency trade-off?
  - Basis: Restricting two-qubit gates to adjacent qubits increases depth; deeper exploration of alternatives like SWAP networks or teleportation-based routing needed
  - Evidence needed: Comparative analysis showing non-adjacent routing yields lower total depth or higher fidelity while maintaining accuracy

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation of ensemble proxy approach's universality across diverse data distributions
- Fixed 40% pruning rate may not be optimal across all problem domains
- Runtime speedup claims (2×) are dataset-dependent and may not generalize to larger-scale problems

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Training-free proxy metrics mechanism is well-established in QAS literature and logically sound given barren plateau problem
- **Medium Confidence:** Hybrid rank aggregation strategy shows promise but requires more rigorous ablation studies to confirm universal benefit
- **Medium Confidence:** Evolutionary pruning mechanism demonstrates effectiveness but optimal pruning rate likely depends on circuit depth and noise characteristics

## Next Checks

1. **Proxy Correlation Validation:** Generate scatter plots of KTA scores versus final QSVM accuracy for 100 random circuits per dataset to quantify correlation strength and determine if KTA alone suffices for filtering

2. **Ablation on Aggregation Strategy:** Replace hybrid sAZ aggregation with simple linear rank sum to test whether mid-ranked prioritization genuinely prevents overfitting or introduces bias

3. **Hardware Sensitivity Analysis:** Run QuProFS on multiple real quantum devices with varying noise characteristics to assess whether hardware-aware generation and robustness metrics maintain effectiveness across different hardware profiles
