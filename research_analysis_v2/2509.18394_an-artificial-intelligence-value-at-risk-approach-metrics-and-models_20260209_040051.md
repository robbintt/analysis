# An Artificial Intelligence Value at Risk Approach: Metrics and Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.18394
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18394
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Proposes AI-VaR model yielding $55,884 expected loss and $81,589 VaR at 95% confidence for synthetic case example

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the gap between emerging AI regulations and practical quantitative risk management methods by proposing a framework that integrates legal, operational, and security dimensions using established risk modeling techniques. The core innovation is translating multidimensional AI risks (data protection, fairness, accuracy, robustness, information security) into a single monetary Value at Risk metric through FAIR model ontology and Monte Carlo simulation. A case example demonstrates the approach with $55,884 expected annual loss and $81,589 AI-VaR at 95% confidence, providing decision-makers with a comparable risk metric across AI dimensions.

## Method Summary
The framework decomposes AI risk into five dimensions and models each using technical metrics (accuracy, recall, fairness metrics) to calibrate FAIR ontology factors (Threat Event Frequency, Vulnerability, Loss Magnitude). A Monte Carlo simulation propagates uncertainty through these inputs to generate a loss distribution, from which a truncated quantile Value at Risk is calculated. The case example applies this to a data poisoning scenario with biased ranking algorithm, using PERT distributions for uncertain inputs and secondary loss integration for fairness violations.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates AI-VaR framework with synthetic case example yielding $55,884 expected annual loss
- Shows AI-VaR of $81,589 at 95% confidence level (P10=$30,743, P90=$87,879)
- Proposes integration of ML metrics (accuracy, recall, fairness metrics) directly into FAIR model factors as technical calibration
- Establishes framework for combining disparate risk dimensions through information security scenario modeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Translating multidimensional AI risks into single monetary AI-VaR creates comparable metric for decision-makers, conditional on accurate calibration of loss probabilities
- **Mechanism**: Decomposes risk into five dimensions, models using risk ontology where technical metrics calibrate probability factors, Monte Carlo simulation aggregates uncertainties into loss distribution, extracts single monetary VaR
- **Core assumption**: Reliable causal/correlational link between technical metric degradation and financial loss through jurimetrical analysis of regulatory fines
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] AI-VaR estimates annual expected loss from AI risk scenarios; [section 5] ALE=$55,884, P10=$30,743, P90=$87,879, 95th confidence loss=$81,589
- **Break condition**: Fails if "sanctioning psychology" cannot be modeled predictably or link between technical anomaly and financial consequence is speculative

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Integrating disparate risk dimensions into single information security scenario allows holistic risk assessment, conditional on assumption that AI risks are interconnected or share common threat vectors
- **Mechanism**: Uses information security risk scenario as "holy grail" for integration, models primary scenario (e.g., data poisoning) and incorporates other dimensions as secondary losses or factors affecting resistance strength
- **Core assumption**: Most significant AI risks can be framed within security/adversarial context or their financial impacts can be cleanly additive as secondary effects
- **Evidence anchors**: [section 4.4] Combine data protection, fairness, accuracy, robustness into information security model; [section 5] Include AI risk dimensions in classic FAIR model with average of Personal Data VaR and Fairness VaR as secondary loss
- **Break condition**: Integration breaks if risk scenarios are fundamentally orthogonal and cannot be realistically combined into single event frequency model

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Directly mapping standard ML metrics to risk model factors reduces reliance on subjective qualitative assessments, conditional on correct interpretation of what metric implies for system vulnerability
- **Mechanism**: Uses quantitative ML metrics instead of subjective ratings; accuracy/recall on poisoned dataset inform "Resistance Strength", fairness metrics calibrate "Vulnerability" of user groups to discrimination
- **Core assumption**: These metrics are reliable proxies for system's resilience to failure/attack and technical/governance teams share common understanding
- **Evidence anchors**: [section 3.1] Logistic regression model provides probability for each patient, accuracy/recall plotted; [section 2.2.1] Apply fairness metrics to unveil bias, use statistical parity difference and average odds difference
- **Break condition**: Fails if technical metric is gamed or fails to capture nuance of risk, leading to dangerous underestimation of vulnerability

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) Model**
  - **Why needed here**: Core ontology used to structure all risk scenarios; without understanding its factors you cannot build described models
  - **Quick check question**: Can you distinguish between "Threat Event Frequency" (how often attack occurs) and "Vulnerability" (probability attack succeeds) in context of data poisoning attempt?

- **Concept: Monte Carlo Simulation & Probability Distributions**
  - **Why needed here**: Framework relies on this to handle uncertainty; inputs are not single numbers but ranges forming distribution, simulation propagates these to create final risk distribution
  - **Quick check question**: If model's input for "Loss Magnitude" is defined as Min=$1k, ML=$4k, Max=$8k, why is single-point average estimate insufficient for risk management?

- **Concept: Standard ML Metrics (Accuracy, Recall, Precision, RMSE) & Fairness Metrics**
  - **Why needed here**: These are quantitative fuel for risk model; you must understand what they measure to correctly calibrate "Resistance Strength" and "Vulnerability" factors
  - **Quick check question**: If AI system has high accuracy (95%) but low recall (20%) for detecting critical failure mode, how would this imbalance affect "Resistance Strength" factor in risk model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Layer (datasets, model metrics, regulatory fine data) -> Calibration Layer (mapping metrics to FAIR ontology factors, PERT/Beta distribution fitting) -> Simulation Engine (Monte Carlo) -> Output Layer (Loss Exceedance Curve, AI-VaR, Annual Loss Expectancy)

- **Critical path**: Calibration is most critical path; must move from technical finding (e.g., "statistical parity difference is 0.4") to model input (e.g., "Vulnerability is 40%"). This requires both technical and legal/regulatory expertise; errors here propagate exponentially through Monte Carlo simulation

- **Design tradeoffs**: Primary tradeoff is between model granularity and actionability; detailed model capturing all nuances is ideal but may be too complex to maintain, simpler model is easier to implement but relies on broad estimations for "Secondary Loss Magnitude" which may not capture extreme tail risks

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Garbage In, Gospel Out**: Over-reliance on precise-looking monetary output (AI-VaR=$81,589) despite inputs being broad estimates; model's precision masks deep uncertainty in calibration
  - **Metric Gaming**: Optimizing for specific fairness metric used in risk model could worsen other forms of bias, inadvertently creating new unmodeled risks
  - **Static Model in Dynamic World**: Risk model based on snapshot of model performance and threat landscape; if model drifts or new attack vectors emerge, static VaR becomes misleadingly low

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Single-Dimension Calibration**: Take one fairness metric (e.g., demographic parity) from test dataset and attempt to quantify potential financial impact by researching historical regulatory fines for discrimination
  2. **Build Minimal FAIR Model**: Implement basic Monte Carlo simulation for single well-defined risk scenario (e.g., "Prompt Injection leading to Data Leak") using PERT distributions for Threat Frequency and Loss Magnitude
  3. **Run Sensitivity Analysis**: In minimal model, vary "Resistance Strength" factor up/down by 10% and observe impact on final AI-VaR to understand which inputs model is most sensitive to

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can proposed AI-VaR framework be effectively scaled and validated using real-world industrial data, as opposed to synthetic examples provided?
- **Basis in paper**: [Explicit] Examples "pretend to be very basic and understandable, providing simple ideas that can be developed regarding specific AI customized environments"
- **Why unresolved**: Paper demonstrates model using hypothetical datasets (e.g., 10 patients, 20 job candidates) to prove concept, leaving practical application in complex live production environments untested
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Longitudinal study applying AI-VaR model to deployed enterprise AI system, comparing predicted Annual Loss Expectancy against actual realized losses over fiscal year

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How does current scarcity of historical enforcement data (administrative fines) specifically affect calibration accuracy of Fairness Value at Risk (F-VaR) component?
- **Basis in paper**: [Explicit] "In the near future, we may also get fairness-related data coming from existing administrative fines issued by National AI authorities," implying current data is insufficient for precise calibration
- **Why unresolved**: Model relies on estimating "sanctioning psychology" of authorities, but without robust dataset of past fines for fairness violations, "Secondary Loss Magnitude" remains speculative
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Statistical analysis showing convergence of model's predicted fines with actual penalties issued by National Competent AI Authorities once enforcement begins

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Is mapping accuracy and robustness metrics primarily to "Resistance Strength" sufficient for capturing their impact on financial loss, or do they require independent loss probability functions?
- **Basis in paper**: [Inferred] Paper suggests integrating these metrics "as resilience strength" or sometimes as secondary losses, noting integration of four dimensions is "very challenging but feasible"
- **Why unresolved**: Paper assumes linear translation of technical performance (accuracy/robustness) into security resistance strength, which may not account for non-linear failure modes where high accuracy still results in catastrophic financial loss
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative modeling analyzing sensitivity of final AI-VaR figure to variations in technical performance metrics when applied as resistance strength versus direct operational loss drivers

## Limitations

- **Calibration Challenge**: Framework's effectiveness hinges on accurately mapping technical ML metrics to financial loss estimates, requiring extensive jurimetrical analysis that lacks empirical validation
- **Distribution Assumptions**: Paper does not specify exact distribution types for input factors, only mentioning PERT and Monte Carlo simulation; different distribution assumptions could significantly impact final AI-VaR estimates
- **Static Nature**: Proposed model represents snapshot in time; AI systems and threat landscapes evolve rapidly, potentially rendering static VaR calculations obsolete without regular recalibration

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Conceptual framework of decomposing AI risk into five dimensions and using FAIR model ontology is well-established and theoretically sound; basic mechanics of Monte Carlo simulation for risk aggregation are standard practice
- **Medium Confidence**: Case example methodology is described with sufficient detail to understand approach but lacks complete mathematical specification for truncated quantile VaR calculation; integration of multiple risk dimensions through secondary losses is conceptually valid but requires more rigorous demonstration
- **Low Confidence**: Calibration of fairness metrics to financial impact relies heavily on jurimetrical analysis without demonstrating this process; assumption that disparate risk dimensions can be meaningfully combined into single information security scenarios may not hold for all AI risk contexts

## Next Checks

1. **Distribution Sensitivity Analysis**: Reproduce case example using different distribution assumptions (triangular, beta-PERT, uniform) for same input parameters to quantify impact on AI-VaR estimates

2. **Calibration Validation**: Select one specific AI risk scenario (e.g., data poisoning) and attempt to independently validate calibration between technical degradation metrics and financial impact using public regulatory fine data

3. **Dimension Integration Test**: Test integration mechanism by creating two separate risk models (one for data protection, one for fairness) and attempting to combine them using secondary loss approach; compare with running them as independent scenarios
