# Sentiment-Aware Extractive and Abstractive Summarization for Unstructured Text Mining

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.20404
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20404
- **Reference count**: 2
- **Primary result**: Sentiment-aware summarization framework improves ROUGE scores on Reddit-TIFU and DialogSum datasets by integrating emotion-cause extraction and sentiment-weighted training

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of summarizing fragmented, emotion-rich user-generated content on social media platforms where traditional summarization methods optimized for structured news struggle to capture emotional cues and thematic relevance. The authors propose a framework extending both extractive (TextRank) and abstractive (UniLM) approaches by integrating sentiment signals into ranking and generation processes. ECPE-TextRank modifies sentence similarity scoring with emotion-cause pair extraction and topic modeling, while Senti-UniLM modifies the training objective with sentiment-weighted token importance. Experiments on Reddit-TIFU and DialogSum datasets show both models outperform baselines, with Senti-UniLM achieving ROUGE-1 scores of 0.6774 and 0.5893 respectively.

## Method Summary
The framework introduces two sentiment-aware summarization approaches. ECPE-TextRank extends traditional TextRank by replacing lexical similarity with a composite function incorporating emotion similarity (via cosine distance of emotion-cause embeddings from Integrated Gradients attribution) and topic similarity (via LDA topic distributions). Senti-UniLM modifies UniLM's training objective by weighting the cross-entropy loss with token-level sentiment importance, computed as a combination of Integrated Gradients attribution scores and sentence-level sentiment probabilities. Both approaches rely on a sentiment model F for attribution and probability estimation, with hyperparameters controlling the relative influence of sentiment and topic signals.

## Key Results
- Senti-UniLM achieves ROUGE-1 scores of 0.6774 on Reddit-TIFU and 0.5893 on DialogSum datasets
- ECPE-TextRank shows consistent improvements across ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L metrics on both datasets
- Ablation studies confirm complementary contributions of sentiment and topic modules
- Both models outperform baseline TextRank and UniLM approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Composite Similarity Function for Extractive Ranking
Standard TextRank computes sentence similarity via lexical overlap (wij). ECPE-TextRank replaces this with a composite function Ω(si, sj) = wij + a·Ψ(si, sj) + b·Θ(si, sj), where Ψ captures emotional similarity via cosine distance between emotion-cause embeddings, and Θ captures topic similarity via LDA topic distributions. The core assumption is that sentences sharing emotional expressions and thematic content should rank higher in importance, even with limited lexical overlap.

### Mechanism 2: Sentiment-Weighted Training Objective
Senti-UniLM reweights the seq2seq loss by token-level sentiment importance. Standard UniLM treats all summary tokens equally in cross-entropy loss. Senti-UniLM assigns each token a weight λi = σ(Φ(xi) + β·p(s)), combining normalized IG attribution Φ(xi) with sentence-level sentiment probability p(s). The loss becomes LSenti = −Σ λt·log P(st|s<t, D), amplifying gradients for emotionally important tokens. The core assumption is that tokens contributing more to sentiment prediction should receive stronger learning signal during fine-tuning.

### Mechanism 3: Integrated Gradients for Emotion-Cause Attribution
Gradient-based attribution identifies which tokens drive sentiment predictions, enabling extraction of "emotion cause sets" for similarity computation. IG computes Φi(x) = (xi − x'i)·∫∂F(x' + α(x−x'))/∂xi dα, integrating gradients along a path from baseline (zero embedding) to input. Top-k tokens by attribution score form R(S), representing salient sentiment contributors. The core assumption is that gradient flow through sentiment model F reliably indicates which words cause emotional predictions.

## Foundational Learning

- **TextRank / Graph-based Centrality Ranking**
  - Why needed here: ECPE-TextRank extends TextRank's iterative PageRank-style scoring; understanding the base algorithm clarifies what the modifications change.
  - Quick check question: Given damping factor d=0.85, can you trace how a sentence's importance score propagates to its neighbors over iterations?

- **Transformer Seq2Seq with Unified Masking (UniLM)**
  - Why needed here: Senti-UniLM builds on UniLM's pretrained encoder-decoder architecture; understanding its attention masking explains where sentiment weights attach.
  - Quick check question: How does UniLM's unified pretraining differ from separate BERT (encoder-only) and GPT (decoder-only) paradigms?

- **Integrated Gradients for Feature Attribution**
  - Why needed here: Both proposed models depend on IG for token-level sentiment importance; misunderstanding IG leads to misinterpreting what "sentiment-aware" means operationally.
  - Quick check question: Why does IG require a baseline input, and what happens if you choose a poor baseline?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  - ECPE-TextRank branch: Input sentences → Sentiment Model F → IG Attribution → Emotion-Cause Sets R(S) → Emotion Similarity Ψ; parallel LDA → Topic Similarity Θ; combine with lexical wij → Composite Ω → TextRank iteration → Top-L sentence selection
  - Senti-UniLM branch: Input + Reference → Sentiment Model F → IG Attribution Φ(xi) + Sentence Sentiment p(s) → Token Weights λi → Weighted Cross-Entropy → UniLM fine-tuning

- **Critical path**:
  1. Sentiment model F quality gates both branches—if F is inaccurate, IG attributions and sentence probabilities are unreliable.
  2. Hyperparameters a (emotion weight) and b (topic weight) control extractive branch; β controls abstractive branch's sentence-level influence.
  3. IG approximation steps (m) affect attribution precision vs. computation cost.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Parameter sensitivity: a=0.1 optimal; a > 0.5 causes substantial decline
  - b varies by metric: 0.35 (ROUGE-1), 0.60 (ROUGE-2), 0.15 (ROUGE-L)—no single optimal value
  - Assumption: Extractive and abstractive branches are independent; no cross-branch feedback

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Excessive a values producing incoherent summaries dominated by emotional keywords
  - Missing or sparse emotional expressions leading to degenerate R(S) sets
  - IG misattribution on negated sentiment ("not bad") assigning weight to wrong tokens
  - ROUGE gains not reflecting qualitative sentiment preservation

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate ablation study (w/o senti, w/o topic, w/o both) on held-out subset to verify complementary contributions
  2. Parameter sweep a, b ∈ [0, 1] step 0.05 to validate sensitivity curves and identify dataset-specific optima
  3. Qualitative error analysis on 20-30 examples with complex sentiment (sarcasm, mixed emotions, negation) to characterize IG attribution failures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the framework effectively adapt to diverse Information Systems contexts beyond the specific datasets tested?
- Basis in paper: The authors state that future work will "explore domain adaptation for diverse IS contexts."
- Why unresolved: The current study validates the framework only on Reddit-TIFU (forum posts) and DialogSum (dialogues), leaving performance in other domains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation results from applying the framework to diverse domains such as clinical notes, legal documents, or real-time customer service logs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does integrating fine-grained emotion categories improve summarization performance compared to the current sentiment-weighted approach?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion identifies "more sophisticated sentiment modeling (e.g., fine-grained emotion categories)" as a specific avenue for future research.
- Why unresolved: The current Senti-UniLM model relies on general sentiment probabilities and token importance, rather than distinguishing between specific emotional states.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing performance metrics when the model is trained with datasets annotated with specific emotions (e.g., joy, anger, surprise) versus general polarity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does high performance on ROUGE metrics guarantee the accurate capture of emotional nuances in generated summaries?
- Basis in paper: The paper claims the framework "enhances the capture of emotional nuances," but relies exclusively on ROUGE (lexical overlap) for evaluation, which does not inherently measure semantic sentiment preservation.
- Why unresolved: It remains unclear if the higher ROUGE scores indicate better sentiment capture or simply improved selection of keywords unrelated to the emotional tone.
- What evidence would resolve it: A correlation analysis between ROUGE scores and human evaluations specifically rating the "emotional fidelity" of the generated summaries.

## Limitations

- The framework critically depends on the quality of the underlying sentiment model F, with no specification of which model or checkpoint was used
- High parameter sensitivity with dataset-specific optimal values makes generalization and reproducibility challenging
- Evaluation relies exclusively on ROUGE metrics, which measure lexical overlap rather than sentiment preservation or coherence

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The general framework design combining sentiment and topic signals with traditional summarization approaches is methodologically sound. The mathematical formulations for composite similarity (Ω), sentiment-weighted loss (LSenti), and Integrated Gradients attribution (Φ) are correctly specified and implementable.

**Medium Confidence**: The reported ROUGE score improvements (0.6774 and 0.5893 for Senti-UniLM) appear technically achievable given the methodology, though absolute values depend heavily on unreported implementation details and parameter choices.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about qualitative improvements in emotional nuance capture and thematic relevance are not empirically validated through sentiment-specific metrics or human evaluation.

## Next Checks

1. Implement additional evaluation metrics beyond ROUGE, including sentiment classification accuracy on generated summaries, human evaluation of emotional content preservation, and sentiment coherence scoring to verify that ROUGE improvements correspond to actual sentiment-aware summarization quality.

2. Conduct systematic grid searches over a ∈ [0, 1], b ∈ [0, 1], and β ∈ [0, 1] on both datasets to characterize the full performance landscape, identify optimal parameter sets, and determine whether reported values are truly optimal or merely convenient choices.

3. Perform qualitative analysis on 20-30 examples containing negation, sarcasm, mixed emotions, and long-range dependencies to characterize Integrated Gradients attribution failures and determine whether sentiment-aware improvements hold for challenging linguistic phenomena.
