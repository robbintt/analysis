# Constrained Network Adversarial Attacks: Validity, Robustness, and Transferability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.01328
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01328
- Reference count: 29
- Up to 80.3% of adversarial examples generated by existing algorithms are invalid due to constraint violations

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the critical issue of adversarial attacks on ML-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) in IoT environments, focusing on the frequent violation of domain-specific constraints by existing attack methodologies. The authors propose a novel validation process that incorporates numerical and categorical dependencies to ensure the feasibility of adversarial examples. They demonstrate that simpler surrogate models like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) generate more valid adversarial examples compared to complex architectures such as CNNs and LSTMs, and that enforcing domain constraints significantly reduces the measured vulnerability of ML/DL models to adversarial attacks.

## Method Summary
The study uses the NSL-KDD dataset with one-hot encoding for categorical features and min-max normalization. An MLP surrogate model (3 hidden layers: 512, 256, 64 units; ReLU; dropout 0.01; sigmoid output; Adam + cross-entropy) generates adversarial examples from malicious traffic only. Seven attack algorithms (FGSM, C&W, JSMA, DeepFool, PGD, ZOO, BIM) are evaluated. A formal constraint filter (Algorithm 1) enforces binary bounds, one-hot encoding sums to 1, and protocol-service-flag dependencies for TCP. Validity rate (% AEs passing filter) and severity rate (attack success) are measured before and after filtering across multiple target models.

## Key Results
- Up to 80.3% of adversarial examples generated by existing algorithms are invalid due to constraint violations
- Simpler surrogate models like MLP generate more valid adversarial examples compared to complex architectures such as CNNs and LSTMs
- When domain constraints are enforced, vulnerability of ML/DL models to adversarial attacks is significantly reduced, with severity rates decreasing by 52.49% to 99.84% across most attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Enforcing domain-specific constraints dramatically reduces adversarial example validity, revealing that most reported vulnerabilities are infeasible in practice. A validation filter projects adversarial examples onto the feasible input space by enforcing (1) categorical dependencies—protocol type determines valid service/flag combinations per TCP/IP semantics—and (2) numerical dependencies—binary features must remain in {0,1}, one-hot encoded groups must sum to 1, and continuous features must respect bounded ranges. Core assumption: Network traffic adheres to protocol semantics; violating these produces inputs no real device would generate. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "up to 80.3% of adversarial examples generated by existing algorithms are invalid due to constraint violations"; [Page 3, Algorithm 1] Formal filtering procedure for categorical and numerical dependencies in TCP case. Break condition: If protocol implementations permit non-standard behavior (e.g., malformed packets that devices still process), the constraint model would underapproximate the true feasible space.

### Mechanism 2
Simpler surrogate models generate more constraint-valid adversarial examples than complex architectures. MLPs produce smoother, less intricate decision boundaries; perturbations computed against them are more likely to yield valid network traffic after projection. CNNs and LSTM-based models create highly non-linear boundaries that, when perturbed, produce examples violating domain constraints more frequently. Core assumption: Decision boundary geometry correlates with the likelihood that gradient-based perturbations remain feasible after constraint projection. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "simpler surrogate models like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) generate more valid adversarial examples compared to complex architectures such as CNNs and LSTMs"; [Page 4, Figure 3] MLP shows 42-76% valid AEs across attacks; CNN shows 0% valid for PGD/FGSM/BIM/DeepFool. Break condition: If attack algorithms incorporate constraints directly into optimization (rather than post-hoc filtering), this surrogate complexity effect may diminish.

### Mechanism 3
Constraint-aware evaluation reduces measured attack severity by 52.49%–99.84% across most attack methods. Invalid adversarial examples are filtered out before evaluation; only feasible perturbations remain. Many gradient-based attacks (FGSM, BIM, PGD) perturb all features, frequently breaking dependencies; targeted sparse attacks (JSMA, C&W) modify fewer features and retain higher validity. Core assumption: Real attackers cannot deploy inputs violating protocol semantics; thus, filtered examples represent the true threat surface. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "When domain constraints are enforced, the vulnerability of ML/DL models to adversarial attacks is significantly reduced, with severity rates decreasing by 52.49% to 99.84%"; [Page 4, Figure 2] Severity comparison showing stark reduction between unfiltered and valid-only AE evaluation. Break condition: If attackers find constraint-violating exploits that real systems nonetheless accept (e.g., tolerant parsers), this severity reduction would overestimate safety.

## Foundational Learning

- **TCP/IP Protocol Semantics and Feature Dependencies**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that network features are not independent—protocol type constrains valid services, flags, and port behaviors—is essential to grasp why unconstrained perturbations produce impossible traffic.
  - Quick check question: Given a UDP packet, which services (SSH, SNMP, FTP-data) are semantically valid?

- **Adversarial Example Generation Methods (Gradient-Based vs. Sparse)**
  - Why needed here: The paper compares seven attacks; knowing why FGSM/BIM/PGD perturb all features while JSMA targets specific features explains their differing validity rates.
  - Quick check question: Why might JSMA produce higher-validity adversarial examples than FGSM in constrained domains?

- **Surrogate Models and Black-Box Transferability**
  - Why needed here: The study uses MLP as a surrogate to generate attacks transferred to other models; understanding surrogate-target relationships is key to interpreting transferability results.
  - Quick check question: If a complex model (CNN-LSTM) yields near-zero valid AEs as a surrogate, what does this imply about its utility for black-box attack generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Constraint Definition Module -> Adversarial Example Generator -> Validity Filter -> Target Models -> Evaluation Metrics
- **Critical path**: 1. Define constraints from domain knowledge (protocol-service-flag relationships, feature bounds) 2. Train surrogate model (MLP recommended per findings) 3. Generate adversarial examples using selected attack algorithm 4. Apply validity filter (Algorithm 1) 5. Evaluate remaining valid AEs on target models
- **Design tradeoffs**: Simpler surrogates (MLP) → more valid AEs but potentially less realistic attack modeling; Complex surrogates (CNN/LSTM) → near-zero valid AEs, may underestimate vulnerability; Post-hoc filtering vs. constrained optimization: filtering is simpler but may discard effective attacks that could be reformulated within constraints
- **Failure signatures**: Near-100% invalid AE rate: Likely using complex surrogate with dense perturbation attacks (PGD/FGSM/BIM) on highly constrained features; Severity not reducing after filtering: Attack may already respect constraints (e.g., C&W on continuous features only); OHE violations in filtered output: Binary rounding not applied correctly; check Algorithm 1 step 4
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Reproduce validity rates: Run FGSM and JSMA on MLP surrogate with NSL-KDD, apply filter, compare validity percentages against reported ~42% (FGSM) and ~76% (JSMA) 2. Ablate constraint types: Disable categorical-only, numerical-only, and both; measure how each contributes to invalidity rates 3. Transferability test: Generate valid AEs from MLP surrogate, evaluate severity drop on CNN and CNN-LSTM targets; verify ~50%+ severity reduction reported in Table I

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
**Question**: How can defense mechanisms be specifically designed to counter *feasible* adversarial examples in domain-constrained IoT environments?
**Basis in paper**: [explicit] The conclusion states future work must "prioritize developing and evaluating defense mechanisms specifically tailored to counter feasible adversarial examples."
**Why unresolved**: The current study focuses on evaluating and validating attacks rather than proposing active defense architectures.
**What evidence would resolve it**: A novel defense framework (e.g., constrained adversarial training) that maintains high detection accuracy against valid adversarial examples.

### Open Question 2
**Question**: Why do targeted strategies like JSMA exhibit higher resilience to domain constraints compared to global perturbation methods?
**Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors note that "the resilience of targeted, smaller-scale perturbation strategies like JSMA to domain constraints warrants further investigation."
**Why unresolved**: The paper observes the phenomenon (higher validity for JSMA) but does not analyze the specific feature interactions that allow it.
**What evidence would resolve it**: A theoretical analysis or ablation study identifying how JSMA's feature selection avoids violating categorical dependencies.

### Open Question 3
**Question**: Do the findings regarding constraint violation and model robustness generalize to diverse, modern IoT datasets?
**Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors suggest "researchers could explore diverse datasets" to comprehensively address these challenges.
**Why unresolved**: The experimental results rely solely on the NSL-KDD dataset, which may not fully represent modern IoT traffic complexity.
**What evidence would resolve it**: Replication of the validation methodology on contemporary, high-dimensional IoT datasets showing similar validity reductions.

## Limitations

- The study's constraint filter is specific to TCP/IP network traffic semantics and may not generalize to other domains like image or text classification
- The validity rates depend heavily on the choice of surrogate model, but the paper does not explore why complex models like CNNs and LSTMs produce invalid examples or whether this is inherent to their architecture or the attack methods used
- The transferability results assume black-box attacks, but the actual threat model (white-box vs. black-box) is not explicitly clarified

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The claim that up to 80.3% of adversarial examples are invalid due to constraint violations is well-supported by the experimental results and the formal filtering algorithm
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that simpler surrogates like MLP generate more valid adversarial examples than complex architectures is plausible but may depend on specific attack hyperparameters and dataset characteristics
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the severity reduction rates (52.49%–99.84%) to other domains or threat models is uncertain without further validation

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce Validity Rates**: Re-run FGSM and JSMA on MLP surrogate with NSL-KDD, apply the constraint filter, and verify the reported validity rates (~42% for FGSM, ~76% for JSMA)

2. **Ablate Constraint Types**: Disable categorical-only, numerical-only, and both constraints in the filter; measure how each contributes to invalidity rates to confirm the paper's claim that both types are necessary

3. **Transferability Test**: Generate valid adversarial examples from MLP surrogate, evaluate severity drop on CNN and CNN-LSTM targets, and verify the ~50%+ severity reduction reported in Table I
