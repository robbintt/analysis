# Large Language Models for History, Philosophy, and Sociology of Science: Interpretive Uses, Methodological Challenges, and Critical Perspectives

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.12242
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12242
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** LLMs offer new interpretive tools for HPSS research through semantic modeling, pattern detection, and text generation, while raising epistemic and infrastructural challenges.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can serve as research tools in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science, where interpretive methodologies and context-dependent meaning are central. The authors examine both full-context models (BERT-style) and generative models (GPT-style), detailing their architectures and training paradigms. They investigate applications including semantic modeling, pattern detection, and modeling scientific change over time, while identifying key methodological challenges around model selection, data curation, and validation. The paper concludes with four key lessons about interpretive trade-offs, literacy requirements, the need for HPSS-specific benchmarks, and the role of LLMs as interpretive enhancers rather than replacements.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing literature on LLMs to propose methodological frameworks for HPSS research. It distinguishes between full-context models for data structuring and generative models for synthesis, explaining their transformer-based architectures. For diachronic semantic analysis, the method involves domain-adapting BERT-style models on scientific corpora, extracting contextualized word embeddings for target terms across time-sliced datasets, and measuring cosine distances to detect semantic drift. The RAG framework combines retrieval systems with generative models to ground historical analysis in verifiable sources. Validation relies on human-in-the-loop verification and comparison against historical records, though specific statistical thresholds for significance are not defined.

## Key Results
- LLMs can operationalize the distributional hypothesis for HPSS by encoding context-specific meaning in high-dimensional embedding spaces
- Full-context models excel at structuring data and detecting patterns, while generative models are better suited for synthesis and interpretive dialogue
- Domain adaptation and careful corpus curation are essential prerequisites for reliable HPSS applications
- The accessibility-transparency trade-off presents a fundamental challenge for HPSS adoption of LLM tools

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Contextualized Semantic Representation
The distributional hypothesis operationalizes meaning through contextual relationships. LLMs break text into tokens and convert them into high-dimensional vectors using self-attention layers. As processing progresses, embeddings encode increasingly rich syntactic and semantic features based on surrounding tokens. Proximity in this embedding space serves as a proxy for semantic similarity. This works because meaning is defined by contextual relationships rather than fixed definitions. The mechanism breaks when archaic vocabulary appears in contexts vastly different from pretraining data, potentially reflecting modern bias rather than historical usage.

### Mechanism 2: Diachronic Alignment via Vector Space Comparison
Scientific change can be modeled by comparing token embeddings across temporally segmented corpora. Researchers slice corpora by time periods, generate contextualized embeddings for target terms in each slice, and measure distances or clustering patterns over time. This quantifies semantic shifts or increasing polysemy. The mechanism assumes statistical shifts in embedding geometry correlate to meaningful conceptual ruptures. It breaks when models lack domain-specific pretraining, conflating syntactic variation with semantic change, or when separate time-sliced models cannot be effectively aligned.

### Mechanism 3: Retrieval-Augmented Grounding
Generative models can function as reliable interpretive partners only when constrained by external, verifiable source text via Retrieval-Augmented Generation. A query triggers retrieval to fetch relevant documents, which are injected into the generative model's context window. This forces the attention mechanism to prioritize provided source text over internal training memories. The mechanism assumes retrieval accurately captures scholarly-defined relatedness. It breaks when retrieval fails (low recall) or the generative model ignores context (hallucination), producing fluent but factually incorrect narratives.

## Foundational Learning

- **The Distributional Hypothesis**
  - *Why needed:* This is the theoretical foundation of all LLM mechanisms. Understanding that LLMs define "meaning" by spatial proximity learned from context is essential for interpreting why embedding clusters might represent "concepts" or "themes."
  - *Quick check:* If two words never appear in the same context but share a dictionary definition, will an LLM necessarily link them semantically? (Answer: Not without training data linking them distributionally).

- **Full-Context (BERT) vs. Autoregressive (GPT) Architectures**
  - *Why needed:* The paper heavily emphasizes trade-offs. Full-context models are preferred for structuring data/classification (looking at the whole sentence at once), while generative models are preferred for synthesis and dialogue. Selecting the wrong architecture dooms the HPSS workflow.
  - *Quick check:* To classify the rhetorical intent of a citation (using the whole sentence), which architecture is theoretically better suited?

- **Hallucination vs. Grounding**
  - *Why needed:* HPSS relies on historical accuracy. New engineers must understand that Generative LLMs are probabilistic text generators, not databases. RAG is introduced specifically to mitigate this.
  - *Quick check:* Why can't we trust a standard GPT model to summarize a 17th-century scientific manuscript without providing the manuscript text in the prompt?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Unstructured text (Historical archives, Journals) + Structured Data (Knowledge Graphs) -> Tokenizer -> Transformer Encoder (e.g., SciBERT) or Decoder (e.g., GPT) -> Domain-Pretraining (continued), Fine-tuning (contrastive/prompt-based), or RAG (Retrieval + Generation) -> Clustering (BERTopic), Distance Metrics (Cosine similarity), Visualization

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Corpus Curation:** HPSS data is fragmented; cleaning and formatting are prerequisites
  2. **Model Selection:** Choose Full-context (for extraction/patterns) or Generative (for synthesis) based on the "accessibility-literacy trade-off"
  3. **Validation:** Human-in-the-loop verification of patterns to prevent anachronistic interpretations

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Accessibility vs. Transparency:** Proprietary generative models (GPT-4) are easy to use but opaque; open-source BERT models are transparent but require high technical literacy
  - **Generalization vs. Fidelity:** General models flatten historical nuance; domain-specific pretraining captures jargon but is resource-intensive

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Temporal Hallucination:** The model confidently uses modern definitions for historical terms (e.g., interpreting "atom" in Dalton's time with quantum properties)
  - **Syntactic Clustering:** Clusters form based on sentence structure rather than conceptual meaning
  - **Fluency Trap:** High-quality prose output that obscures a lack of actual evidence or logic

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Word Sense Clustering:** Run a domain-adapted BERT model on a specific term (e.g., "energy") across 100 years of a journal; cluster CWEs to visualize meaning shifts
  2. **BERTopic Modeling:** Apply BERTopic to a corpus of scientific abstracts to identify thematic evolution without predefined labels
  3. **RAG Interrogation:** Build a simple RAG pipeline over a small set of historical papers and "chat" with them to test citation extraction accuracy vs. hallucination rate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Benchmark Development for LSC:** How can the field develop robust evaluation benchmarks for lexical semantic change that account for domain-specific ambiguity and multilingual historical corpora? The paper notes existing benchmarks rarely capture the ambiguity central to HPSS research, particularly in multilingual settings. Creating gold-standard datasets for historical conceptual change is resource-intensive and requires resolving interpretive ambiguities that resist standard annotation protocols.

- **LLM-Based Agent-Based Modeling:** To what extent can LLM-based agent-based modeling capture the situated reasoning and historical contingency required for simulating scientific change? The paper states it "remains unclear whether they can capture the situated reasoning and historical contingency central to HPSS" or if they merely repackage epistemic challenges in opaque forms. Current generative models prioritize fluency and coherence, but their ability to model context-specific constraints and non-deterministic historical outcomes is unproven.

- **Statistical Similarity as Epistemic Proxy:** Can statistical semantic similarity effectively serve as a proxy for epistemic innovation and historical continuity in scientific texts? The paper asks "Can statistical similarity serve as a proxy for historical continuity?" and cautions that novelty detection requires historical interpretation rather than mere distance metrics. Semantic deviation in vector space may reflect stylistic drift, noise, or institutional norms rather than meaningful conceptual rupture.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation that distributional mechanisms reliably capture historical meaning shifts, particularly for archaic or domain-specific terminology
- Fundamental trade-off between accessibility and transparency creates barriers for HPSS adoption
- Unresolved tension between statistical pattern detection and interpretive validity, with no specified thresholds for "significant" semantic drift

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The architectural distinctions between full-context and autoregressive models are well-established and correctly characterized
- **Medium Confidence:** The diachronic alignment mechanism is theoretically sound but lacks systematic validation across diverse historical corpora
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that RAG systems can reliably ground generative models assumes perfect retrieval accuracy and model compliance, neither empirically demonstrated for complex historical queries

## Next Checks

1. **Temporal Hallucination Test:** Select a historically stable scientific term (e.g., "gravity" pre-1900) and run the proposed embedding drift analysis. If the model detects significant semantic change where none exists, this indicates temporal bias that would invalidate diachronic claims.

2. **Syntactic Confounding Analysis:** For a polysemous term like "current," extract CWEs across different syntactic roles (noun vs. adjective) and time periods. If clusters form primarily by part-of-speech rather than semantic meaning, the distributional mechanism conflates syntax with semantics.

3. **RAG Grounding Validation:** Construct a simple RAG pipeline over a curated set of 50 historical scientific papers. Query for specific claims (e.g., "What did Maxwell say about light?") and measure both retrieval accuracy and generation fidelity. Compare hallucination rates against baseline GPT without retrieval constraints.
