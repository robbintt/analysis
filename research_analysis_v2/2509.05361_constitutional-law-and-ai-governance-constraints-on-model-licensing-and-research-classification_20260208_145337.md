# Constitutional Law and AI Governance: Constraints on Model Licensing and Research Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05361
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05361
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Constitutional analysis finds model licensing and research classification proposals face First Amendment, administrative law, and due process constraints requiring explicit congressional authorization, clear procedural safeguards, and defined entitlement triggers.

## Executive Summary
This paper examines constitutional constraints on two AI governance proposals: model licensing and research classification. Through analysis of First Amendment doctrine, administrative law principles, and procedural due process requirements, the authors identify key legal vulnerabilities in current proposals. While First Amendment protections for AI algorithms and outputs don't preclude regulation outright, they do create procedural requirements. Administrative law's Major Questions Doctrine requires explicit congressional authorization for AI regulation, and due process concerns necessitate clear definitions of when developers gain legal interests in their models. The paper recommends implementing licensing schemes with clear standards and judicial review, exempting AI regulations from lengthy administrative procedures, and carefully defining entitlement triggers to withstand constitutional challenges.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct doctrinal legal analysis across three constitutional domains: First Amendment (examining speech protections for algorithms, outputs, and weights), administrative law (analyzing Major Questions Doctrine and Loper Bright constraints on agency authority), and Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process (determining when licensing creates protected property interests). The analysis synthesizes existing precedents including Bernstein v. State Dept, West Virginia v. EPA, and Board of Regents v. Roth to identify constitutional vulnerabilities in AI governance proposals and derive recommendations for compliant regulatory design.

## Key Results
- First Amendment likely protects model algorithms and outputs but not weights, creating procedural requirements for licensing rather than outright prohibition
- Major Questions Doctrine and Loper Bright prevent agencies from regulating AI without explicit congressional authorization
- Procedural due process requires clear definitions of when AI developers gain legal interests in their models
- Recommendations include clear licensing standards, judicial review mechanisms, administrative procedure exemptions, and defined entitlement triggers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: First Amendment Framework Enables Regulation Through Procedural Safeguards
- Claim: First Amendment protections for AI algorithms and outputs create procedural requirements for licensing, but do not prevent regulation outright.
- Mechanism: IF source code receives Bernstein-like protection as expressive speech → THEN licensing restrictions face either intermediate scrutiny (content-neutral) or strict scrutiny (content-based) → regulatory design must include clear standards, judicial review, and government burden of justification.
- Core assumption: Courts will extend Bernstein's source code protection to training/inference algorithms, but not to model weights (which are functional object code).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "While the First Amendment may provide some degree of protection for model algorithms or outputs, this protection does not foreclose regulation."
  - [section]: "Content-neutral restrictions need only satisfy intermediate scrutiny, while content-based restrictions must satisfy strict scrutiny... algorithms used in the training and development of LLMs are likely protected under the First Amendment."
  - [corpus]: "Intentionally Unintentional: GenAI Exceptionalism and the First Amendment" challenges this assumption, arguing AI outputs lack intentionality required for speech protection—suggesting this mechanism could break.
- Break condition: Courts rule that AI development is purely functional conduct with no expressive component, or that LLM outputs lack human intentionality.

### Mechanism 2: Administrative Law Constraints Force Congressional Authorization
- Claim: Major Questions Doctrine and Loper Bright require explicit congressional delegation before any agency can implement model licensing or research classification.
- Mechanism: AI regulation involves major economic significance ($100B+ investment) → MQD triggers "clear congressional authorization" requirement → no existing agency has explicit AI licensing authority → Congress must vest authority in new/existing agency via statute.
- Core assumption: Courts will classify AI regulation as a "major question" comparable to EPA's generation-shifting in West Virginia v. EPA.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Administrative law requires clear congressional delegation of authority to an agency, as the Major Questions Doctrine and Loper Bright prevent agencies from regulating AI without explicit authorization."
  - [section]: "The authority to license AI models does not currently exist in the U.S. administrative state... Congress must clearly delegate that authority to an agency."
  - [corpus]: Corpus is weak on administrative law connections—no direct citations to MQD cases beyond the paper itself.
- Break condition: An existing agency (e.g., NIST) receives explicit statutory authority from Congress to regulate AI, or courts decline to apply MQD to AI.

### Mechanism 3: Procedural Due Process Triggers on Defined Entitlements
- Claim: Licensing schemes must specify exactly when developers acquire a protected property interest, or face due process litigation.
- Mechanism: Sunk costs in model development (architecture, datasets, scaffolding) → developers claim legitimate entitlement expectation → IF regulations don't define when entitlement attaches → procedural due process challenges under Board of Regents v. Roth → licensing scheme struck down.
- Core assumption: Assumption: AI developers will successfully argue that pre-deployment investments create property interests cognizable under due process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Fourteenth Amendment raises procedural due process concerns, requiring clear definitions of when AI developers gain a legal interest in their models."
  - [section]: "Even before training, the scaffolding, algorithmic design, and model architecture exist. Regulation must clearly indicate the stage at which an entitlement begins."
  - [corpus]: Corpus lacks direct due process citations—this constitutional constraint is underexplored in related literature.
- Break condition: Regulations explicitly define entitlement triggers at model ideation, training initiation, or another specific stage.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Content-based vs. Content-neutral Speech Restrictions
  - Why needed here: Determines whether licensing restrictions face strict or intermediate scrutiny—affects what safety requirements can legally mandate.
  - Quick check question: Does this restriction target specific AI outputs (content-based, strict scrutiny) or apply uniformly to all models regardless of output (content-neutral, intermediate scrutiny)?

- Concept: Major Questions Doctrine (MQD)
  - Why needed here: Explains why agency rulemaking alone is insufficient—Congressional action is required for AI regulation of economic/political significance.
  - Quick check question: Is the proposed AI regulation of such "political or economic significance" that it would trigger MQD's clear authorization requirement?

- Concept: Procedural Due Process Entitlements
  - Why needed here: Defines when the government must provide notice and hearing before depriving developers of regulatory approvals.
  - Quick check question: At what development stage does this regulation create a legitimate expectation of approval that triggers due process protections?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Congressional authorization statute -> Licensing agency -> Procedural safeguards -> Exemption mechanisms -> Entitlement definition

- Critical path:
  1. Draft statute with explicit AI regulatory authority + agency designation
  2. Define entitlement trigger point (ideation, pre-training, post-training)
  3. Establish licensing criteria with clear approval/denial standards
  4. Build in exemptions from standard administrative procedure timelines
  5. Create expedited judicial review mechanism

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Speed vs. procedural compliance: Exempting OIRA/notice-and-comment enables faster response but reduces transparency
  - Regulatory flexibility vs. clear standards: Vague criteria allow adaptation to new risks but create arbitrary-and-capricious risk
  - Pre-deployment intervention vs. entitlement risk: Earlier gating increases safety but strengthens developer due process claims

- Failure signatures:
  - Litigation pattern: Developers challenge license denial on First Amendment grounds (claims of content-based restriction without strict scrutiny satisfaction)
  - Authority challenge: Court vacates regulations for lacking clear congressional authorization under MQD
  - Due process violation: Court finds agency terminated license without adequate hearing because entitlement was ill-defined

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Map existing agency statutes to identify any plausible (even weak) existing authority claims—test whether MQD applies by documenting economic magnitude and novelty
  2. Draft entitlement definition at three different stages (ideation, training initiation, pre-deployment) and analyze procedural burden at each
  3. Simulate content-based vs. content-neutral characterization for proposed safety testing requirements—document which restrictions target specific outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do model weights receive First Amendment protection distinct from training algorithms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "the First Amendment likely protects model algorithms, but not weights" but acknowledges Bernstein left unsettled whether object code receives protection, and no binding precedent exists.
- Why unresolved: Bernstein was withdrawn before en banc review, and courts have not ruled on whether inscrutable statistical parameters constitute "speech" versus purely functional machine instructions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A court ruling specifically addressing whether neural network weights qualify as protected expressive content or unprotected functional elements.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can courts extend First Amendment speech protections to LLMs as independent legal entities with their own speech rights?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "it remains to be seen if courts will ever find that LLMs, as entities, have full speech rights under the First Amendment."
- Why unresolved: Extending rights to non-human entities (corporations, ships) has relied on those entities consisting of humans with intentions; LLMs may lack the requisite intentionality for expressive activity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Supreme Court or appellate court decisions addressing whether AI systems possess sufficient intentionality for independent speaker status.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can speculative or existential risks justify prior restraints on AI research publication under the First Amendment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes "there is no clear precedent that speculative risks—even existential ones—give rise to a valid prior restraint."
- Why unresolved: United States v. Progressive was declared moot before appellate review, leaving no binding precedent on whether born-secrets doctrines survive strict scrutiny for existential threats.
- What evidence would resolve it: Litigation challenging AI research classification that produces appellate rulings on whether catastrophic risk predictions meet the "imminent threat" standard.

### Open Question 4
- Question: At what stage of model development does a developer's procedural due process entitlement attach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "regulation must clearly indicate the stage at which an entitlement begins" and notes this remains unresolved for AI development pipelines.
- Why unresolved: The sunk costs in scaffolding, algorithmic design, and architecture before training create potential entitlement claims, but Board of Regents v. Roth requires more than "unilateral expectation."
- What evidence would resolve it: Judicial decisions in licensing disputes identifying what investment threshold or development milestone creates a protectable property interest.

## Limitations
- Several key claims about judicial interpretation (weights not protected, LLM outputs as amplified human speech) are argued positions rather than established precedent
- The analysis relies on recent doctrinal shifts that may continue evolving, requiring ongoing legal monitoring
- Technical implementation details of licensing frameworks (evaluation criteria, safety thresholds) are beyond the scope of the constitutional analysis

## Confidence
- High confidence: Administrative law requirements for congressional delegation (MQD, Loper Bright) and procedural due process triggers (Roth, Bell v. Burson) are well-established doctrines with predictable application
- Medium confidence: First Amendment protection for model algorithms follows from existing software speech precedent, though courts may distinguish AI training/inference code
- Low confidence: Predictions about court treatment of model weights and AI outputs as speech remain speculative given lack of direct precedent

## Next Checks
1. Track post-publication judicial decisions applying MQD to emerging technologies to validate predicted scope of required congressional authorization
2. Monitor circuit splits on software speech doctrine that could affect First Amendment analysis of AI model protection
3. Analyze proposed AI legislation for explicit agency authorization language to assess practical implementation of congressional delegation requirements
