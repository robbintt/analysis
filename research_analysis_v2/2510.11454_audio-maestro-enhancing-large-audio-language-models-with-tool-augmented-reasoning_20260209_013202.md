# Audio-Maestro: Enhancing Large Audio-Language Models with Tool-Augmented Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.11454
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11454
- **Reference count:** 10
- **One-line primary result:** Audio-Maestro improves reasoning accuracy across three LALMs by 4.1–4.7% absolute on the MMAU benchmark.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Audio-Maestro, a tool-augmented reasoning framework that enables large audio-language models (LALMs) to autonomously invoke specialized external tools for complex audio reasoning tasks. The framework addresses the challenge of bridging high-level semantic understanding with precise low-level acoustic analysis by allowing models to call tools like chord recognition or speaker diarization when needed. Experiments on the MMAU benchmark demonstrate consistent accuracy improvements across multiple state-of-the-art models: Gemini-2.5-flash improves from 67.4% to 72.1%, DeSTA-2.5 from 58.3% to 62.8%, and GPT-4o from 60.8% to 63.9%. Error analysis reveals that the majority of failures stem from inaccuracies in the external tools themselves, suggesting that improving tool reliability is a key direction for future work.

## Method Summary
Audio-Maestro operates as a two-phase pipeline for audio reasoning. In Phase 1, the LALM evaluates whether to answer a query directly or invoke specialized external tools based on both semantic understanding and acoustic cues. If tools are selected, Phase 2 executes them on the audio input, producing structured, timestamped JSON outputs that capture interpretable aspects like emotion trajectories, sound event durations, or chord progressions. These outputs are serialized and concatenated with the original audio and query to form an enriched context, which the LALM uses to generate the final response. The framework is entirely zero-shot, requiring no task-specific fine-tuning, and uses structured prompts with tool descriptions to guide autonomous tool selection. All 13 external tools (including Whisper-large-v3 for transcription, pyannote for speaker diarization, and autochord for chord recognition) must be implemented with standardized JSON output formats.

## Key Results
- **Performance gains:** Gemini-2.5-flash accuracy improves from 67.4% to 72.1%, DeSTA-2.5 from 58.3% to 62.8%, and GPT-4o from 60.8% to 63.9% on MMAU benchmark.
- **Error source dominance:** 73-90% of failures are attributed to tool output errors, with Gemini showing 90.0% of errors from this source.
- **Tool invocation frequency:** GPT-4o invoked tools in 98.4% of cases, suggesting potential over-reliance and calibration issues in the decision mechanism.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Autonomous Tool Selection via Semantic-Acoustic Decision
The framework enables LALMs to autonomously determine when specialized analysis is needed by integrating high-level semantic reasoning with low-level acoustic perception. The model evaluates input pairs against available tools and decides between direct answers or tool invocation based on detecting emotion shifts, overlapping speakers, or non-speech sounds. This decision-making capability is crucial for identifying when internal representations are inadequate for precise signal analysis tasks.

### Mechanism 2: Structured Timestamped Output Integration
External tools provide structured JSON with temporal markers that ground symbolic reasoning in concrete acoustic events. For example, chord recognition tools return outputs like "[0.52, 4.18] → C Major," enabling the model to align reasoning with specific audio segments rather than treating audio as monolithic. This timestamped structure is critical for tasks requiring temporal precision in reasoning.

### Mechanism 3: Error Propagation Through Tool Dependency
The modular architecture creates a dependency chain where tool inaccuracies propagate directly to final outputs. Since the LALM treats tool outputs as reliable evidence even when incorrect, performance is fundamentally limited by external tool reliability. Error analysis shows 73-90% of failures stem from tool output errors, making tool reliability the primary bottleneck rather than the reasoning framework itself.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Tool-Augmented Reasoning Paradigm
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding that LALMs delegate specialized subtasks (e.g., chord recognition, diarization) to external modules rather than attempting end-to-end inference for all tasks.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a model might choose to call an external chord recognition tool instead of predicting chords directly from audio features?

- **Concept:** Structured Prompting for Zero-Shot Tool Invocation
  - **Why needed here:** The framework operates without task-specific fine-tuning, relying entirely on structured prompts (system instruction + tool descriptions + query) to guide autonomous tool selection.
  - **Quick check question:** What three components comprise the structured prompt, and how do they collectively enable zero-shot tool use?

- **Concept:** Temporal Grounding in Audio Reasoning
  - **Why needed here:** Tools return timestamped outputs (e.g., [0.52, 4.18] → "C Major"), enabling the model to align symbolic reasoning with specific acoustic events rather than treating audio as a monolithic representation.
  - **Quick check question:** How does timestamped output from a chord recognition tool help a model answer "What chord is playing at 0:05?"

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Audio file + text query + tool descriptions → Phase 1 decision (direct answer vs tool calls) → Tool execution layer → JSON serialization → Context concatenation → Phase 2 inference → Final answer
- **Critical path:** Query + audio → Phase 1 decision → (if C) tool execution → JSON serialization → context concatenation → Phase 2 inference → final answer. Latency bottleneck: tool execution adds sequential processing time.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Accuracy vs. Latency:** Tool invocation improves accuracy (4.1–4.7% absolute gain) but increases inference time; real-time applications may require selective tool activation thresholds.
  - **Modularity vs. Error Propagation:** External tools enable specialization but introduce dependency on third-party model accuracy (73–90% of errors traced to tool outputs).
  - **Zero-Shot vs. Fine-Tuned:** Framework requires no task-specific training, but performance ceiling is limited by base LALM reasoning and tool reliability.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Tool Output Error (73–90%):** Incorrect/incomplete tool responses (e.g., chord recognizer returns "G major" when ground truth is "C minor")
  - **Incorrect Tool Selection (6.7–16.7%):** Model calls irrelevant tool (e.g., emotion classifier for transcription task)
  - **Result Misinterpretation (3.3–10%):** Tool output correct but model misinterprets (e.g., tool outputs "angry" but model responds "speaker sounds calm")
  - **Over-Invocation:** GPT-4o called tools in 98.4% of cases, suggesting decision boundary may be poorly calibrated
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Tool Ablation Study:** Run MMAU benchmark with individual tools disabled to measure per-tool contribution and identify minimal tool subset for target accuracy.
  2. **Decision Threshold Calibration:** Implement confidence-based tool invocation to reduce over-invocation and measure latency-accuracy tradeoff curves.
  3. **Tool Error Injection Analysis:** Systematically corrupt tool outputs and measure downstream accuracy degradation to quantify error propagation sensitivity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the framework be modified to mitigate error propagation when external audio tools produce hallucinated or incorrect structured outputs?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors identify in Section 5.4 that "the majority of failures... are attributed to 'Tool Output Errors'" and suggest improving underlying specialized models as a critical future direction.
- **Why unresolved:** The current design assumes LALM accepts tool outputs as ground truth without verification mechanisms to filter or correct flawed data.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modification where the LALM cross-references tool outputs against raw audio features to reject anomalies, resulting in lower "Tool Output Error" rates.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can adaptive strategies for tool invocation optimize the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and inference latency?
- **Basis in paper:** The "Limitations" section notes that "integrating external tools increases inference time, which may limit real-time applications" and suggests "optimizing tool invocation" as a future direction.
- **Why unresolved:** The current implementation may invoke tools even when the LALM's internal knowledge is sufficient, adding unnecessary computational overhead.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A dynamic threshold mechanism that reduces tool usage frequency without significantly dropping accuracy on the MMAU benchmark.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does incorporating confidence scores or uncertainty estimates from external tools into the LALM's context improve decision-making robustness?
- **Basis in paper:** While the paper analyzes "Tool Output Errors," it does not discuss providing the LALM with metadata regarding tool reliability.
- **Why unresolved:** The LALM currently interprets JSON outputs as absolute facts; it is unknown if probabilistic signaling would help the model weigh tool information against its own end-to-end perception.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments showing that adding a "confidence" field to the JSON structure reduces "Result Misinterpretation Errors" or improves accuracy on low signal-to-noise audio samples.

## Limitations
- **Tool reliability bottleneck:** Performance is fundamentally limited by external tool accuracy, with 73-90% of errors traced to tool output inaccuracies.
- **Over-invocation issue:** GPT-4o invoked tools in 98.4% of cases, suggesting potential calibration problems in the decision mechanism.
- **Zero-shot dependency:** Framework relies heavily on prompt engineering quality without exploring sensitivity to prompt variations or tool description quality.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The two-phase architecture and tool-augmented reasoning mechanism are clearly specified and empirically validated with consistent accuracy improvements across three different LALMs.
- **Medium confidence:** The error analysis methodology is sound, but the claim that "improving tool reliability is a key direction" assumes no complementary approaches could address the bottleneck.
- **Low confidence:** The claim that this framework "bridges the gap between high-level understanding and precise low-level signal analysis" is somewhat overstated, as the model still depends entirely on external tools for low-level analysis.

## Next Checks
1. Implement tool output confidence scoring and measure whether filtering low-confidence tool responses reduces error rates without sacrificing accuracy.
2. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis of tool invocation frequency, measuring latency-accuracy tradeoffs across different tool selection thresholds.
3. Test whether fine-tuning the LALM on tool output patterns improves its ability to detect and correct tool errors during the final reasoning phase.
