# Holistic Explainable AI (H-XAI): Extending Transparency Beyond Developers in AI-Driven Decision Making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.05792
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05792
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces Holistic eXplainable AI (H-XAI), a framework that combines traditional post-hoc explanation methods with a rating-driven explanation (RDE) approach to address the explanation needs of multiple AI stakeholders.

## Executive Summary
H-XAI is a framework that extends transparency beyond developers by integrating causal modeling, bias metrics, and synthetic baselines with standard post-hoc XAI methods. It addresses the diverse explanation needs of multiple stakeholders—applicants, regulators, and data scientists—by routing specific questions to appropriate tools within a unified interface. The approach combines global explanations through Rating-Driven Explanations (RDE) with local explanations like SHAP and counterfactuals, enabling stakeholders to test hypotheses about fairness, robustness, and feature influence. Two case studies demonstrate the framework's application to credit risk classification and stock price forecasting.

## Method Summary
The H-XAI framework combines Rating-Driven Explanations (RDE) with standard post-hoc XAI methods to serve multiple stakeholders. For credit risk, it uses German Credit Dataset (1,000 rows, 20 features) with Logistic Regression and Random Forest models; for stock forecasting, it uses Yahoo Finance data (March 2023-April 2024) for six companies with MOMENT, Gemini, and ARIMA models. RDE computes metrics including Weighted Rejection Score (WRS), Average Treatment Effect (ATE) via propensity score matching or G-computation, and Deconfounded Impact Estimation (DIE%). The framework generates synthetic "Random" and "Biased" baselines for comparison and routes stakeholder questions through a lookup table to appropriate methods (SHAP, PDPs, counterfactuals, or RDE).

## Key Results
- H-XAI successfully integrates causal modeling with traditional XAI methods to address multi-stakeholder needs
- The framework demonstrates how DIE% can reveal confounding bias that standard feature importance methods miss
- Case studies show H-XAI's applicability to both tabular (credit risk) and time-series (stock forecasting) domains
- Synthetic baselines provide intuitive reference points for non-technical stakeholders to interpret model behavior
- The unified interface enables targeted explanations for specific stakeholder questions about fairness, robustness, and feature influence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Causal Deconfounding via DIE%
- Claim: If protected attributes (e.g., age, gender) act as confounders between a treatment (e.g., credit amount) and an outcome, H-XAI proposes that adjusting for these attributes reveals the "true" sensitivity of the model, distinct from spurious correlation.
- Mechanism: The framework uses a **Deconfounded Impact Estimation (DIE%)** metric. It computes the difference between an unadjusted Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and an adjusted ATE (using Propensity Score Matching or G-computation). A high DIE% suggests the model's apparent reliance on a feature is actually driven by its correlation with a protected attribute.
- Core assumption: The causal diagram (Figure 1a) accurately reflects the data generation process and confounding structure; valid causal identification is possible via the specified adjustment set.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1.2] Defines DIE% quantitatively as $100 \times |ATE_{unadj} - ATE_{adj}| / |ATE_{adj}|$.
  - [section 4.1] Case study shows Random Forest exhibits higher confounding bias than Logistic Regression in credit risk.
  - [corpus] Related work (e.g., *A Comprehensive Perspective on Explainable AI*) supports the need for workflow-integrated explanations, though specific DIE% validation is absent in the corpus.
- Break condition: If the causal graph is misspecified (e.g., missing a confounder), DIE% may incorrectly attribute effects, rendering the explanation misleading.

### Mechanism 2: Comparative Baseline Anchoring
- Claim: Stakeholders may better judge model behavior (fairness/robustness) when model outputs are compared against automatically generated "Random" and "Biased" baselines rather than assessed in isolation.
- Mechanism: The **Rating-Driven Explanation (RDE)** workflow (Figure 2) generates two synthetic reference models: one predicting randomly and one predicting based solely on the protected attribute. Metrics (WRS, ATE) are computed for the target model and these baselines.
- Core assumption: "Biased" and "Random" synthetic models serve as intelligible cognitive anchors for non-technical stakeholders (regulators/applicants) to interpret numerical scores.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1.3] Describes the generation of random and biased baselines to ground explanations.
  - [figure 8] Visualizations in Scenario 2 allow stakeholders to compare target behavior against these baselines.
  - [corpus] *Emergent Bias and Fairness* discusses risks in multi-agent systems, but does not validate synthetic baselines as an explanation method.
- Break condition: If the synthetic "Biased" model does not reflect real-world bias patterns (e.g., intersectional bias), the comparison may fail to expose relevant fairness issues.

### Mechanism 3: Query-Driven Method Routing
- Claim: Transparency is enhanced by routing specific stakeholder questions (e.g., "Why was I rejected?" vs. "Is the model fair?") to the appropriate explanatory tool (e.g., Counterfactuals vs. RDE) within a unified interface.
- Mechanism: **H-XAI** integrates local methods (SHAP, Counterfactuals) for instance-level reasoning and RDE for global/hypothesis testing. Table 1 acts as a lookup layer, mapping question types to methods to prevent tool mismatch.
- Core assumption: Stakeholders can articulate their needs into the predefined question taxonomy (adapted from the XAI Question Bank).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [table 1] Explicitly maps questions (e.g., "Which features contribute most?") to methods (SHAP) and lists limitations.
  - [section 4.3] Demonstrates how combining methods resolves ambiguity where a single method fails.
  - [corpus] *A Comprehensive Perspective on Explainable AI* validates the need for workflow-spanning explanations, supporting the "Holistic" approach.
- Break condition: If users have questions outside the taxonomy (e.g., complex temporal "why" questions in time-series), the routing logic may default to inappropriate tools.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Causal Inference (Confounders & Adjustment)**
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding DIE% and ATE. You must grasp why $P(Y|T)$ differs from $P(Y|do(T))$ to interpret the "deconfounded" ratings.
  - Quick check question: "If age influences both credit amount and risk, why does a simple correlation between amount and risk mislead us about the model's true behavior?"

- Concept: **Local vs. Global Explainability**
  - Why needed here: H-XAI relies on distinguishing when to use SHAP (local/individual) vs. PDP/RDE (global/structural).
  - Quick check question: "Why would a SHAP value for a specific loan applicant fail to tell a regulator if the model is biased against an entire demographic?"

- Concept: **Statistical Hypothesis Testing (Weighted Rejection Score)**
  - Why needed here: The WRS metric uses weighted t-tests across confidence intervals to detect distributional disparities.
  - Quick check question: "What does a high Weighted Rejection Score imply about the difference in model outcomes between two demographic groups?"

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Layer (Dataset + Black-box Model + Causal Graph) -> Synthetic Baseline Generator (Random & Biased models) -> RDE Engine (WRS, ATE, DIE%) -> Post-Hoc Module (SHAP, PDPs, Counterfactuals) -> Query Interface (routes questions via Table 1)

- Critical path: The specification of the **Causal Graph** (Figure 1a/3a). Without this manual expert input (defining Treatment, Outcome, Confounders), the RDE engine cannot compute ATE/DIE. The system does not automatically discover causal structure.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Causal Rigor vs. Usability:** RDE provides causal rigor but requires expert-defined graphs; SHAP is model-agnostic but may mislead under correlation (Table 1).
  - **Coverage vs. Complexity:** Supporting time-series and classification requires distinct causal setups (Figure 3a vs 3b) and residual definitions, increasing engineering overhead.

- Failure signatures:
  - **High DIE% with Low Feature Importance:** Suggests the model is using proxies for protected attributes; standard SHAP might miss this, but RDE catches it.
  - **Baselines Outperforming Target:** If the Target model has worse error rates than the Random baseline on specific perturbations, it indicates model failure rather than bias.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Metric Validation (Binary):** Implement WRS and DIE% on the German Credit dataset using a simple Decision Tree. Verify that high DIE% aligns with known protected attribute correlations.
  2. **Perturbation Stress Test (Time-Series):** Apply the RDE workflow to the stock data. Inject missing values (Figure 12) and confirm if the "Random" baseline maintains lower error variance than the "MOMENT" model.
  3. **Routing Logic Test:** Simulate a "Regulator" query ("Is this fair?"). Run the RDE workflow. Then simulate an "Applicant" query ("Why me?"). Run SHAP. Verify the system correctly isolates the relevant module.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the H-XAI framework perform in improving actual decision-making quality and trust for non-technical stakeholders compared to standard XAI tools?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that "conducting user studies with diverse stakeholders who rely on AI-driven decisions" remains an open direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper relies on demonstrative case studies and researcher-defined scenarios (e.g., "Jack," "Maya") rather than empirical user evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative results from controlled user studies measuring task completion accuracy and subjective trust ratings when using H-XAI versus baseline XAI toolkits.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can stakeholders accurately define the causal models required for Rating-Driven Explanations (RDE) without expert assistance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Page 8 notes that stakeholders may not know how to specify causal models, so RDE defaults to a generalized structure; however, incorrect causal assumptions can invalidate explanations.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the "generalized causal model" is sufficient for complex domains or if it introduces confirmation bias by ignoring unmodeled confounders.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study measuring the alignment between stakeholder-defined causal graphs and ground-truth causal structures, and the resulting impact on ATE/DIE% accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the synthetic random and biased baselines used in RDE reliably correlate with real-world model failure modes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Table 1 explicitly lists the limitation that "Baselines are synthetic; may not match real misuse cases" when comparing error patterns.
- Why unresolved: Synthetic baselines might trigger false positives (flagging trivial differences) or false negatives (missing complex adversarial behaviors) during audits.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of RDE flagging rates against known, historical instances of algorithmic bias or failure in operational systems.

## Limitations

- Manual causal graph specification introduces subjectivity and potential misspecification that could invalidate DIE% calculations
- Framework lacks quantitative validation of its holistic integration—no ablation studies show that combining methods outperforms isolated use
- Synthetic baseline approach has no empirical validation showing that non-technical stakeholders actually find it helpful for understanding model behavior

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The methodological integration of post-hoc XAI methods (SHAP, counterfactuals) with the RDE framework is clearly specified and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: The theoretical justification for DIE% as a confounder detection metric is sound, but its practical utility depends on correct causal graph specification, which is not validated.
- **Low confidence**: The claim that synthetic baselines (Random/Biased) improve stakeholder understanding lacks empirical validation or user studies demonstrating comprehension gains.

## Next Checks

1. **Causal Graph Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the assumed causal structure in the credit risk case study and measure how DIE% scores change. This will quantify how sensitive the RDE outputs are to graph misspecification.

2. **Stakeholder Comprehension Study**: Conduct a controlled experiment where participants (simulating applicants/regulators) interpret model behavior using RDE versus traditional post-hoc explanations alone. Measure comprehension accuracy and confidence.

3. **Scalability Benchmark**: Apply H-XAI to a high-dimensional tabular dataset (e.g., Adult Income) and measure computational overhead, particularly for causal adjustment and synthetic baseline generation, compared to standard XAI pipelines.
