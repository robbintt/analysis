# Realizing LLMs' Causal Potential Requires Science-Grounded, Novel Benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16530
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16530
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Science-grounded benchmarks prevent LLM memorization, revealing performance gaps and validating hybrid methods that combine LLM priors with statistical algorithms.

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies a critical flaw in current causal discovery benchmarks: standard datasets have likely been memorized by LLMs, invalidating their use for evaluating genuine causal reasoning. The authors propose science-grounded benchmarks sourced from recent peer-reviewed studies published after LLM training cutoffs, ensuring novelty and preventing memorization. These benchmarks, such as Alzheimer's and COVID-19 causal graphs, are more challenging for LLMs, revealing significant performance gaps compared to traditional methods on older datasets. The authors also introduce hybrid methods that combine LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistical approaches, such as integrating LLM predictions as priors in the PC algorithm, which consistently outperforms both LLM-only and purely statistical methods.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a memorization test suite (M1-M3) to quantify LLM leakage on existing benchmarks by requiring reconstruction of causal graphs from partial context at varying levels. They constructed four novel science-grounded benchmarks from post-2021 publications, extracting expert-validated causal graphs and generating synthetic observational data via linear and non-linear structural equation models. The evaluation compared statistical methods (PC, FCI, GES, LiNGAM variants, NOTEARS, ANM), LLM-only approaches (Pairwise O(n²), BFS O(n)), and hybrid methods that use LLM predictions as priors for the PC algorithm. Performance was measured using edge-level precision, recall, and F1 scores against ground-truth graphs.

## Key Results
- Standard benchmarks like Asia achieve F1=1.0 even with 0% context, confirming memorization rather than reasoning
- Novel science-grounded benchmarks show LLM performance degradation (F1 drops from 0.93 on Asia to 0.54 on Alzheimer's)
- Hybrid LLM+PC methods consistently outperform both LLM-only (F1: 0.60→0.71) and purely statistical approaches (F1: 0.07→0.71) on COVID-19 datasets
- Hybrid methods with ground-truth negative priors improve precision without sacrificing recall on complex graphs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Standard causal discovery benchmarks have been memorized by LLMs, invalidating their use for evaluating genuine causal reasoning. Reconstruction-based memorization tests provide partial graph information at varying context levels and require the LLM to complete nodes, edges, or subgraphs. Near-perfect reconstruction from minimal prompts indicates memorization rather than reasoning. This is evidenced by F1=1.0 on Asia dataset even at α=0% (no context provided), which cannot be explained by causal reasoning alone.

### Mechanism 2
Science-grounded benchmarks derived from peer-reviewed studies published after LLM training cutoffs provide valid evaluation by preventing memorization while maintaining real-world relevance. These benchmarks extract expert-consensus causal graphs from recent publications, ensuring temporal separation from training data, and generate synthetic observational data via structural equation models for statistical method evaluation. This approach is validated by near-zero F1 scores on memorization tests for novel datasets, confirming reduced leakage.

### Mechanism 3
Hybrid methods that use LLM predictions as priors for constraint-based algorithms consistently outperform both LLM-only and purely statistical approaches. The LLM-BFS generates a prior graph G_prior, which is then used during PC's skeleton discovery phase where edges present in G_prior are preserved even if conditional independence is detected. Edge orientation initializes with LLM-predicted directions before applying standard orientation rules. This works because LLM domain knowledge provides signal complementary to statistical tests, trading potential false positives against missing true causal relationships.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Constraint-based causal discovery (PC algorithm)**
  - Why needed here: The hybrid method modifies PC's skeleton discovery and orientation phases; understanding conditional independence testing is essential
  - Quick check question: Why does PC algorithm search for a conditioning set S where X⊥⊥Y|S, and what happens to the edge X-Y when such a set is found?

- Concept: **Memorization vs. generalization in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core critique distinguishes pattern reproduction from reasoning; evaluation design hinges on this distinction
  - Quick check question: If an LLM perfectly completes a causal graph given only the dataset name, what alternative explanation exists beyond reasoning?

- Concept: **Structural Equation Models (SEMs) for synthetic data generation**
  - Why needed here: The benchmarks include synthetic observational data; understanding how graphs translate to data distributions is needed for interpreting results
  - Quick check question: In xi ∼ f(Pai) + εi, what does Pai represent and why does the choice of f (linear vs. MLP) matter for discovery algorithm performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Memorization Test Suite (M1-M3) -> Benchmark Construction Pipeline -> Discovery Methods (Statistical, LLM-only, Hybrid) -> Evaluation Metrics (P/R/F1)

- Critical path:
  1. Verify memorization on existing benchmarks via M1-M3 tests (Table 1)
  2. Obtain post-cutoff science graphs (Alzheimer's, COVID-19 Resp/Complications, Sweden Transport)
  3. Generate synthetic observational data (sample root nodes ~N(0,1), propagate via SEMs)
  4. Run discovery methods with appropriate hypothesis tests (Fisher's Z for linear, KCI for non-linear)
  5. Compare F1 scores; validate hybrid advantage

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fisher's Z vs. KCI tests: Z-test assumes linearity (faster, interpretable); KCI captures non-linear dependencies but computationally expensive
  - Linear vs. Non-linear data generation: Linear enables LiNGAM applicability; Non-linear (MLP) better reflects real-world complexity but violates LiNGAM assumptions
  - Positive vs. negative priors in hybrid: Ground-truth negative edges improve precision (Sweden: F1 0.67→0.70); noisy/random negative priors can degrade performance

- Failure signatures:
  - LLM-only: F1>0.9 on BNLearn but <0.6 on novel graphs (memorization artifact)
  - Statistical methods: Near-random performance on large, dense graphs (COVID-19 Complications: F1≈0.04)
  - Hybrid with edge pruning: Post-hoc p-value-based edge removal degrades F1 (Table 5: α=50% drops F1 from 0.71→0.31 on COVID-19 Resp)
  - Negative priors with noise: Random sampling of "forbidden" edges doesn't improve over baseline (Table 6 right)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Memorization quantification**: Run M1-M3 on all BNLearn datasets at α∈{0%,25%,50%,75%}; datasets with F1>0.8 at α=0% flagged as memorized
  2. **Hybrid implementation**: Implement LLM-BFS for prior generation, modify PC skeleton discovery to skip independence tests for prior edges, evaluate on Alzheimer's (non-linear data, KCI test)
  3. **Prior quality ablation**: On Sweden Transport dataset, compare PC+LLM with: (a) ground-truth negative edges, (b) 25%/50%/75% random negative sampling, (c) no negative prior; measure precision/recall tradeoffs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size (4 datasets) limits generalizability of science-grounded benchmark results
- Hybrid method performance highly dependent on prior quality, with negative priors showing sensitivity to noise
- Exact LLM-BFS prompt templates not provided, limiting reproducibility of hybrid method implementation

## Confidence
- High: Memorization critique (F1=1.0 on Asia at α=0% is direct and reproducible evidence)
- Medium: Science-grounded benchmark proposal (methodology sound but small sample size and potential future contamination)
- Medium: Hybrid method claims (substantial performance gains but highly dependent on prior quality)

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce memorization test results** using provided Alzheimer's and COVID-19 datasets with M1-M3 at all α levels to verify degradation in performance
2. **Implement hybrid method with ablation** comparing PC+LLM performance with ground-truth negative priors versus random negative sampling to quantify prior quality sensitivity
3. **Test benchmark longevity** by training a small language model on the science-grounded datasets and evaluating memorization via M2 at α=0% to assess temporal validity
