# ConlangCrafter: Constructing Languages with a Multi-Hop LLM Pipeline

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.06094
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06094
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-hop LLM pipeline generates linguistically diverse and internally consistent artificial languages, achieving 2.4x higher typological diversity and 26% better consistency than single-prompt baselines.

## Executive Summary
ConlangCrafter introduces a modular, multi-hop pipeline for end-to-end constructed language generation that decomposes language design into sequential stages: phonology, grammar, and lexicon. The method uses typological checklists with injected randomness to ensure diversity, and self-refinement loops to maintain logical consistency. Evaluation shows the pipeline generates languages with significantly higher typological diversity (0.60 vs. 0.25 baseline) and improved consistency (0.38 vs. 0.30 baseline), outperforming single-prompt approaches while maintaining coherence through iterative refinement. Manual expert evaluation confirms moderate agreement with automatic metrics, validating the approach's effectiveness in computational creativity for language construction.

## Method Summary
ConlangCrafter uses a reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1 or Gemini 2.5) to generate conlangs through sequential stages. Each stage begins with a typological checklist of 10 features with 5 options each, where an external RNG selects one option per feature. The model then instantiates the language description based on these selections, adding results to a cumulative "language sketch" memory bank. After each major step, a self-refinement loop runs where a critic LLM identifies errors and an editor LLM amends them, iterating until scores exceed thresholds or max iterations are reached. The pipeline generates phonology, grammar, lexicon (expanded to ≥100 items), and finally translates 10 fixed sentences while dynamically updating the sketch. Evaluation uses a separate judge LLM (OpenAI o3) to extract WALS features for diversity scoring and check translation consistency against sketch rules.

## Key Results
- Achieves typological diversity score of 0.60 vs. 0.25 for single-prompt baseline
- Improves consistency score from 0.30 to 0.38 baseline
- Outperforms temperature-based diversity injection, with RNG achieving better diversity-consistency trade-off than temperature 1.4 (diversity 0.56, consistency 0.34)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Modular decomposition improves coherence over single-prompt generation.
- Mechanism: Sequential conditioning through phonology → grammar → lexicon stages, where each layer conditions on prior outputs stored in a language sketch. This parallels multi-hop reasoning approaches.
- Core assumption: LLMs perform better when reasoning incrementally rather than generating entire systems at once.
- Evidence: Multi-hop alone improves consistency from 0.32 to 0.40; parallels multi-hop reasoning approaches.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: External RNG-driven typological checklists achieve higher diversity than temperature sampling alone.
- Mechanism: LLM generates checklists with 10 features and 5 options each; RNG selects options forcing diverse linguistic structures at feature level rather than token level.
- Core assumption: LLM has sufficient metalinguistic knowledge to instantiate any valid combination of typological features.
- Evidence: RNG achieves diversity 0.60 with consistency 0.43 vs temperature 1.4 achieving diversity 0.56 with consistency 0.34.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Self-refinement loops recover consistency lost during diverse generation.
- Mechanism: Critic LLM identifies errors and ambiguities; editor LLM revises content; iterates until threshold scores or max iterations.
- Core assumption: Evaluation is easier than generation; LLMs can reliably critique their own outputs.
- Evidence: Self-refinement improves consistency from 0.43 to 0.54; evaluation often more straightforward than production.

## Foundational Learning

- **Linguistic typology (WALS features)**: Understanding 16 WALS features (word order, alignment, tone) is essential for interpreting diversity metrics and debugging checklist generation. Quick check: Explain difference between active-stative and nominative-accusative alignment with natural language examples.

- **Chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs**: The pipeline uses reasoning models with inference-time scaling. Understanding CoT helps predict success/failure on complex constraints. Quick check: What distinguishes standard LLM prompts from chain-of-thought prompts for multi-step reasoning?

- **LLM-as-a-judge evaluation**: The framework uses OpenAI o3 as judge with moderate agreement (Spearman ρ=0.68) with human experts. Quick check: Why might LLM judges systematically rate outputs from different models more harshly than human evaluators?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: LLM M (reasoning model) -> Language sketch S (memory bank) -> RNG (external random selection) -> Critic/Editor (evaluation and revision) -> Judge LLM (separate evaluation model)

- **Critical path**: Phonology checklist → RNG selection → Phonology generation → Self-refine → Grammar checklist → RNG selection → Grammar generation → Self-refine → Lexicon extraction → Lexicon expansion (loop) → Translation with dynamic sketch updates

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Cost vs. quality: Full pipeline ~660K tokens (~$4) vs. ~70K without self-refinement
  - Diversity vs. consistency: RNG increases diversity but reduces consistency; self-refinement recovers consistency at computational cost
  - Automation vs. control: User constraints can override RNG selections but may reduce typological diversity

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Degenerate outputs: Language sketches not following required format (handled by rejection sampling)
  - Underspecification: 12% of WALS features incorrectly left unspecified
  - Harmony collapse: Languages collapsing to monosyllables without explicit word-shape prompting
  - Infinite revision loops: Self-refinement capped at 10 iterations

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline comparison: Generate 20 languages with single-prompt vs. full pipeline; measure diversity and consistency improvements.
  2. Ablation study: Systematically add components (multi-hop → RNG → self-refinement) to isolate contributions.
  3. Temperature vs. RNG comparison: Generate at temperatures 0.6, 1.0, 1.4, 1.6 and compare to RNG-based diversity injection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can ConlangCrafter's consistency rates be improved beyond the current ceiling of ~54% while maintaining high typological diversity?
- Basis: Authors acknowledge "generation of fully consistent translations remains a challenge" even with best method at 0.54 consistency.
- Why unresolved: No investigation of alternative refinement strategies or architectural improvements.
- What evidence: Experiments comparing different refinement mechanisms and their impact on consistency-diversity trade-off.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can language sketch complexity be scaled beyond current context length limitations to approach natural language expressiveness?
- Basis: Limitations section states summaries "too short to capture complexity of real languages" due to context constraints.
- Why unresolved: No exploration of hierarchical storage, retrieval-augmented generation, or chunked processing for longer specifications.
- What evidence: Implementation of long-context or retrieval-based extensions demonstrating coherent lexicons/grammars 10× larger than current outputs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the methodology be adapted to assist documentation of real low-resource languages rather than only fictional ones?
- Basis: Paper mentions "potential applications to low-resource languages" with footnote that generation must not divert resources from living communities.
- Why unresolved: No experiments testing whether consistency-focused framework transfers to languages requiring factual grounding.
- What evidence: Studies applying pipeline structure to incomplete grammars of documented languages, measuring accuracy against native speaker judgments.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can generated conlangs be learned and used by human speakers for actual communication?
- Basis: Paper demonstrates internal consistency but does not evaluate human acquisition or communicative functionality.
- Why unresolved: Evaluation focuses on structural properties rather than human acquisition or communicative functionality.
- What evidence: Human learning experiments where participants attempt to read, write, or speak in generated conlangs after brief training.

## Limitations
- LLM-as-a-judge evaluation shows only moderate agreement (Spearman ρ=0.68) with human experts, creating uncertainty about metric validity
- Heavy dependence on expensive reasoning models (~$4 per language) limits practical scalability compared to single-prompt approaches
- Automatic WALS feature extraction missed features in 12% of cases, suggesting potential measurement noise

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Modular decomposition architecture is well-specified and reproducible with explicit prompt templates
- **Medium confidence**: RNG-driven checklists achieve higher diversity based on controlled ablation experiments, though judge validity is uncertain
- **Medium confidence**: Self-refinement improves consistency quantitatively, but manual validation shows only moderate agreement with automatic metrics
- **Low confidence**: Claim of bridging "critical gap in conlang community" lacks user studies or adoption evidence

## Next Checks

1. **Human expert validation study**: Recruit 5-10 professional conlang creators to evaluate 20 randomly selected languages from ConlangCrafter vs baseline approaches using standardized rubrics for diversity, consistency, and usability. Compare their rankings against automatic metrics to quantify validity gap.

2. **Stress test on pathological feature combinations**: Systematically generate languages with known incompatible typological features (e.g., isolating morphology + polysynthetic word formation) to measure how often pipeline produces coherent outputs versus fails gracefully.

3. **Cost-benefit analysis at scale**: Generate 100 languages using full pipeline and compute total token costs, then compare quality distribution against 100 single-prompt languages generated at equivalent total cost (adjusting for parameters). This reveals whether quality improvements justify 9x+ cost increase.
