# Inference of Abstraction for Grounded Predicate Logic

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.13743
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13743
- Reference count: 25
- This paper introduces a novel approach to combining probabilistic reasoning and symbolic reasoning over data.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a theory for inferring abstractions in predicate logic by combining probabilistic reasoning with symbolic logic. The key insight is that predicate logic's structure allows expansion of a joint probability distribution over data, logical models, and formulas, enabling selective ignorance to derive abstract symbols from concrete data. The theory generalizes classical logical consequence to a probabilistic framework and demonstrates this through simple examples like arithmetic rule extraction and blame attribution.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a joint probability distribution p(D, M, α) = p(α|M)p(M|D)p(D) where data supports models and models support formulas. Given a multiset of data points and a mapping function m from data to models, the probability of a formula α is computed by marginalizing over supported models. The theory assumes closed formulas only and uses a parameter μ to represent formula truth probability in models, with μ=1 corresponding to classical logical consequence and μ→1 handling inconsistent information.

## Key Results
- A joint probability distribution framework that unifies probabilistic and symbolic reasoning
- A generalization of logical consequence to handle inconsistent information via cardinality-maximal possible subsets
- Demonstration that arithmetic rules and social reasoning patterns can be inferred as abstractions from concrete data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Logical reasoning emerges from a full joint probability distribution constructed over data, logical models, and formulas. The system expands p(D, M, α) = p(α|M)p(M|D)p(D), where data supports specific models and models support formula truth. This hierarchy enables "selective ignorance" through marginalization, allowing abstract formulas to be inferred by ignoring concrete models and data. The core assumption is that formula probability is conditionally independent of data given the model (p(α|M, D) = p(α|M)).

### Mechanism 2
Classical logical consequence is a special case of probabilistic inference where truth is certain (μ=1). A parameter μ ∈ [0.5, 1] represents the probability of a formula being true in a model. When μ=1, inference reduces to classical logical consequence over "possible" models (those with non-zero probability). When μ → 1, the system handles inconsistencies by selecting "cardinality-maximal possible subsets" of premises rather than failing.

### Mechanism 3
Grounded reasoning is achieved by deriving model probabilities directly from observed data frequencies. The probability of a model p(M) is equated to the Maximum Likelihood Estimate of the data categories supporting that model (p(M) = Θ̂). This grounds abstract symbols in the relative frequency of concrete observations, with the assumption that each data point supports exactly one single model.

## Foundational Learning

- **Model-Theoretic Semantics**
  - Why needed here: The paper defines truth values of formulas relative to "models" (pairs of domains and valuation functions) rather than static truth tables.
  - Quick check question: Can you define what a "model" consists of in predicate logic and how it determines the truth of a closed formula?

- **Joint Probability Distributions & Marginalization**
  - Why needed here: The core mechanism involves expanding a full joint distribution p(D, M, α) and marginalizing out variables to infer abstraction.
  - Quick check question: How do you compute the probability of a formula α by marginalizing out the models M and data D?

- **Logical Consequence vs. Empirical Consequence**
  - Why needed here: The paper generalizes the strict logical consequence (Δ ⊨ α) to an "empirical" version based on data support (Δ ≡ᵖ α).
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a logical consequence (truth in all models) and the paper's "empirical consequence" (truth in possible models)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Vocabulary Layer (C, V, F, P) -> Data-Model Mapper (m) -> Probabilistic Evaluator -> Abstraction Search
- **Critical path**: Defining the function m that maps raw data to structured logical models. The paper notes this is currently an assumption but identifies learning this mapping via connectionism as a critical future challenge.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Expressiveness vs. Simplicity: The theory restricts itself to closed formulas (no free variables) to avoid complexity of assignments as abstractions of data.
  - Soundness vs. Data-Fit: Using μ → 1 allows reasoning from inconsistent/impossible data (paraconsistency) rather than failing explosively.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Undefined Probability: Occurs if μ=1 and the denominator (probability of the condition) is zero. Fix: Use μ → 1 approach.
  - Infinite Search: Formula space is infinite. The paper suggests a simple heuristic (Occam's razor) for implementation.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement the "Example 28" arithmetic scenario. Given numerical grids, define mapping m and search for the formula "top × left + right = bottom" by maximizing p(α).
  2. Test inconsistency tolerance by providing contradictory premises and verifying if the system defaults to cardinality-maximal possible subsets (Theorem 21) rather than exploding.
  3. Measure performance scaling as the number of constants (|C|) increases, noting the exponential growth of model space (32 models for 2 constants in Example 6).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **How can connectionist approaches be integrated to learn the function m that accurately maps concrete data to models of predicate logic?**
  - Basis in paper: The conclusion states "An important challenge is to integrate connectionism to learn the function m so that it accurately maps data to models."
  - Why unresolved: The current framework assumes the existence of mapping m but does not provide a mechanism for learning or extracting these mappings from raw data.

- **By what mechanism can an autonomous agent decide which vocabularies to use in its predicate language for creative abstractions?**
  - Basis in paper: The author poses "A more fundamental question is how an agent should decide which vocabularies to use in its predicate language for creative abstractions of data."
  - Why unresolved: The paper relies on pre-defined vocabularies for examples and does not address the origin or selection process of these symbols.

- **How can the infinite space of predicate formulas be efficiently explored to find the formula α̂ that maximizes probability?**
  - Basis in paper: The author notes "It is beyond the scope of this paper to fully discuss how to explore the infinite language space."
  - Why unresolved: The provided solution relies on simple heuristics for small examples but lacks a general scalable algorithm for searching the formula space.

## Limitations
- The theory relies on a pre-defined mapping function m from data to logical models, which is assumed rather than learned
- Restriction to closed formulas excludes reasoning problems involving quantification over variables
- The infinite search space for optimal formulas remains unsolved with only heuristic approaches suggested

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The probabilistic generalization of logical consequence (Theorem 21) is well-supported by formal proof
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that hierarchical abstraction emerges from the joint distribution is theoretically sound but relies heavily on meaningful model abstractions
- **Low Confidence**: Practical implementation details for searching the infinite formula space and learning the mapping function m are underspecified

## Next Checks
1. Implement the Arithmetic Rule Extraction (Example 28): Define the mapping function m for grid data and verify the system can discover the formula "top × left + right = bottom" through probability maximization.
2. Test Inconsistency Tolerance: Construct a scenario with contradictory premises and verify the system selects cardinality-maximal possible subsets rather than failing.
3. Evaluate Search Space Complexity: Measure the exponential growth of model space as constants increase and benchmark the performance impact on formula search algorithms.
