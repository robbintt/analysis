# An Investigation of Visual Foundation Models Robustness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.16225
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16225
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: This paper investigates the robustness of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts, noisy inputs, and adversarial attacks.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically investigates the robustness of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) against real-world challenges including distributional shifts, noisy inputs, and adversarial attacks. The study analyzes prevalent empirical defenses and robust training methods, highlighting their limitations in comprehensively addressing these challenges. Through ablation studies and benchmarking metrics, the research provides actionable insights for improving VFM resilience in security-critical applications.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (ConvNeXt-XL/L, ViT-B-32, ResNet-101, Inception-V3, ImageBind) using ImageNet22K and ImageNet1K pre-trained weights. Evaluation involves applying perturbations including ImageNet-C corruptions (snow, rain), spatial distortions (motion blur, scaling), and adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD with ℓ∞ norm, ϵ ∈ {0.01, 0.04, 0.1}). The analysis measures classification accuracy under clean versus perturbed conditions, with additional embedding quality assessment via t-SNE visualization and SVM classifier accuracy on embeddings for ImageBind.

## Key Results
- Existing defenses often fail to maintain performance under diverse perturbations
- Adversarial training via minimax optimization improves robustness but may cause robust overfitting
- Input transformations can mitigate attacks but may distort critical semantic features
- Certified defenses provide provable guarantees but typically sacrifice clean accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Adversarial Training via Minimax Optimization
Proactively improves network robustness by exposing the model to adversarial examples during training. Formulates training as a minimax optimization problem where an inner maximization step generates adversarial perturbations to maximize loss, while an outer minimization step updates model weights to minimize this loss.

### Mechanism 2: Input Transformations (Quasi-Natural Projection)
Runtime defenses that mitigate adversarial perturbations by projecting inputs into a "quasi-natural" image space. Techniques such as sparse transformer layers or convolutional dictionary learning transform the input to filter out high-frequency components or statistical anomalies associated with adversarial noise.

### Mechanism 3: Certified Defense via Interval Bound Propagation
Provides deterministic guarantees of robustness for specific perturbation radii by propagating input intervals through the network. Instead of point estimates, the network processes lower and upper bounds of inputs (intervals) to certify predictions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Distributional Shift (Covariate vs. Semantic)**
  - Why needed here: The paper identifies this as a primary robustness requirement (RQ1). A model trained on "clean, sunny-day images" may fail in rainy conditions (covariate shift) or with new object types (semantic shift).
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish between a change in input lighting (covariate shift) and a change in the object class distribution (semantic shift)?

- **Concept: Adversarial Perturbation (ℓp norms)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding the constraint under which an attacker operates (e.g., ℓ∞ for pixel intensity changes) is essential for selecting defense mechanisms like PGD or Certified Defenses.
  - Quick check question: Does an ℓ∞ constraint limit the total geometric distortion of an image or the maximum change to any single pixel?

- **Concept: Ablation Studies**
  - Why needed here: The paper recommends ablation to assess the contribution of individual robustness techniques (e.g., removing "random cropping" to test its specific value).
  - Quick check question: In a robustness ablation study, do you add defenses one by one or remove them from a fully defended baseline?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer -> Encoder Backbone -> Defense Sub-modules (Pre-processing, Training, Detection) -> Output Head
- **Critical path:** Start with a standard pre-trained Encoder → Characterize the Threat Model (RQ1: Shifts? Noise? Attacks?) → Integrate Defense (e.g., Adversarial Training or Input Transformation) → Benchmark using Robustness Metrics (RQ5).
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Robustness vs. Accuracy:** Adversarial training often degrades performance on clean data.
  - **Proactive vs. Reactive:** Robust training (high cost, proactive) vs. Input transformations (low cost, reactive but potentially bypassable).
  - **Empirical vs. Certified:** High performance on known attacks (Empirical) vs. Provable guarantees for limited perturbations (Certified).
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Embedding Collapse:** Visualization (t-SNE) shows distinct classes merging into a single cluster under attack.
  - **Robust Overfitting:** Training loss decreases but robustness against unseen attacks does not improve.
  - **Gradient Masking:** Obfuscated gradients give a false sense of security (attacks fail due to implementation bugs rather than true robustness).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Vulnerability Baseline:** Evaluate a standard VFM (e.g., ConvNeXt or ViT) on a clean dataset vs. a perturbed dataset (PGD attack, ε=0.1) to measure the accuracy drop.
  2. **Embedding Visualization:** Extract embeddings from the encoder under "no attack" and "PGD attack" conditions. Use t-SNE to visualize if class clusters remain distinct or collapse.
  3. **Ablation Analysis:** Train a model with full robust training defenses, then retrain by removing one component (e.g., PGD augmentation or Weight Decay) to quantify the specific contribution of that component to robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can defense mechanisms be adapted to effectively address non-ℓp attacks, such as semantic similarity, spatial transformations, and composite attacks, in Visual Foundation Models?
- Basis in paper: The authors state that attacks like semantic similarity, spatial transformation, and composite adversarial attacks "demand deeper investigation" because current research primarily evaluates robustness against ℓp norm-bounded attacks.
- Why unresolved: Current empirical defenses and robust training methods are evaluated against a limited range of standard attacks, failing to generalize to these more sophisticated or realistic perturbation types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking results showing defense mechanisms maintaining high performance against these specific, non-traditional attack vectors compared to standard baselines.

### Open Question 2
Can adversarial training strategies be optimized to improve robustness without degrading the zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs)?
- Basis in paper: Section 5.1 notes that the "robustness-accuracy trade-off in adversarial training can degrade the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs by inadvertently introducing a substantial domain shift."
- Why unresolved: Standard adversarial training often forces the model to focus on specific robust features at the expense of the generalizable representations required for zero-shot learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: A training methodology that achieves measurable adversarial robustness while showing no statistically significant degradation in zero-shot transfer tasks.

### Open Question 3
How can certified defense mechanisms provide provable robustness guarantees without significantly compromising clean accuracy?
- Basis in paper: The paper observes that while certified defenses formally verify robustness, they "often come at the cost of reduced network accuracy" compared to standard or empirical defenses.
- Why unresolved: There is a tension between the strict mathematical bounds required for certification and the flexibility needed to maintain high performance on clean, diverse datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of a certified defense framework where the "clean accuracy" penalty is minimized or eliminated relative to a non-robust baseline.

## Limitations
- The study relies on pre-trained models without re-training, limiting insights into training-time robustness mechanisms.
- Specific details on the ImageNet subset (which 10 classes) and exact PGD attack parameters (step size, iterations) are unspecified, requiring assumptions.
- The analysis focuses on ConvNeXT and ImageBind in depth, with less detail on other models, potentially biasing conclusions about VFM robustness.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The identification of distributional shifts, noisy inputs, and adversarial attacks as key robustness challenges (RQ1); the empirical observation that existing defenses often fail under diverse perturbations.
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific performance drops reported for ConvNeXT and ImageBind under PGD attacks (e.g., 100% to 74.8% for ImageBind SVM accuracy), as these depend on assumed attack parameters and data subsets.
- **Low Confidence:** The generalizability of conclusions to all VFM architectures beyond the tested models (ConvNeXT, ViT, ResNet, Inception, ImageBind), due to limited model diversity in analysis.

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the PGD attack evaluation using standard Foolbox/AutoAttack defaults (40 iterations, step size ε/4) to verify the reported accuracy drops for ConvNeXT and ImageBind.
2. Test robustness-accuracy trade-offs by varying ε in {0.01, 0.04, 0.1} and measuring both clean and perturbed accuracy to confirm degradation patterns.
3. Conduct an ablation study by removing one defense component (e.g., PGD augmentation) from a robust training pipeline to quantify its specific contribution to resilience.
