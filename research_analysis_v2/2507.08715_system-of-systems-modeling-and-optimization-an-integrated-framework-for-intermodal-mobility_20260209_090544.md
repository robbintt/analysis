## Executive Summary
This work presents an integrated framework combining DLR and ONERA software tools for optimizing system-of-systems architectures in aerospace applications. The framework addresses computationally expensive black-box simulations with mixed hierarchical decision variables through surrogate-based optimization using Gaussian Process models. Specifically, it leverages SEGOMOE (Super-Efficient Global Optimization with Mixture of Experts) from ONERA and interfaces with DLR's architecture modeling tools like OpenTurbofanArchitecting and SBArchOpt. The approach demonstrates significant computational savings for aerospace system optimization while handling expensive simulations, hierarchical variables, and potential evaluation failures.

## Method Summary
The framework employs surrogate-based optimization using Gaussian Process models to efficiently explore expensive black-box simulations. It uses SEGOMOE (Super-Efficient Global Optimization with Mixture of Experts) as the core optimizer, which interfaces with DLR's architecture modeling tools through SBArchOpt. The system handles mixed hierarchical decision variables (continuous, discrete, and categorical) and automatically manages hidden constraints (simulation failures) through a GP classifier. The approach is validated on a turbofan engine design problem with 18 decision variables, demonstrating that SEGOMOE achieves optimal Thrust-Specific Fuel Consumption with only 60 function evaluations compared to 1000 evaluations required by NSGA-II.

## Key Results
- SEGOMOE achieves optimal Thrust-Specific Fuel Consumption of 6.679 g/kNs with only 60 function evaluations
- NSGA-II requires 1000 evaluations to reach 6.7 g/kNs on the same problem
- The framework successfully handles ~50% hidden constraint violation rate through automated GP classifier
- SMT Gaussian Process implementation effectively manages mixed hierarchical variables (9 continuous, 3 discrete, 3 categorical)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Surrogate-based optimization with Gaussian Process (GP) models enables efficient exploration of expensive black-box simulations by reducing the required number of costly function evaluations.
- Mechanism: The framework constructs an inexpensive surrogate model, specifically a Gaussian Process, to approximate the expensive-to-evaluate black-box function. The Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm then uses this surrogate's predictions (mean and uncertainty) to intelligently select the next most informative design point to evaluate, iteratively refining the model and focusing the search on promising regions.
- Core assumption: The unknown black-box function can be adequately modeled by a Gaussian Process, and the optimization landscape is sufficiently smooth for the surrogate to provide useful guidance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...addresses computationally expensive black-box simulations... through surrogate-based optimization using Gaussian Process models."
  - [Section II] "...it could be useful to use a surrogate model that reduces computational cost of while giving a good approximation of the black-box simulation."
  - [Section III] "BO rely on GP models of the objective and constraint functions in order to efficiently determine the most interesting design point to evaluate next."
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if the black-box function is highly discontinuous, chaotic, or if the initial Design of Experiments (DoE) is too small to provide a meaningful initial surrogate, leading the optimizer astray.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A specialized Gaussian Process formulation can effectively represent and optimize problems with mixed hierarchical variables.
- Mechanism: The framework employs a dedicated GP model, available in the SMT toolbox, which is designed to handle mixed-categorical variables and, crucially, hierarchical dependencies. This allows the model to correctly learn relationships where some design variables (e.g., "gear ratio") are only active if a categorical condition (e.g., "include gearbox" = True) is met.
- Core assumption: The kernel function of the GP can correctly encode the structure and correlation between continuous, discrete, and hierarchical categorical variables.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...addresses... mixed hierarchical decision variables through surrogate-based optimization..."
  - [Section I] "...leveraging... SMT... to handle hierarchical variables."
  - [Section V] "...bypass ratio... gearbox inclusion... are only active if the fan is included..."
- Break condition: The mechanism is less effective if the number of active hierarchical branches is vast or if the data is too sparse for the surrogate to learn the conditional dependencies accurately.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Integrating a classifier within the Bayesian optimization loop allows for the automated handling of hidden constraints (i.e., simulation failures).
- Mechanism: When a simulation fails to converge (a hidden constraint violation), the framework uses a dedicated GP classifier (WB2S_FE criterion) to model the probability of failure as a function of the design variables. The acquisition function then penalizes regions with a high predicted probability of failure, steering the search toward robust and feasible designs.
- Core assumption: Simulation failures are not random but correlate with specific regions or features of the design space that a classifier can learn.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...demonstrates SEGOMOE capabilities to help solving realistic architecture... problems... including hidden constraints."
  - [Section IV] "...OpenTurbofanArchitecting... featuring hidden constraints... with a failure rate of around 65%."
  - [Section IV] "...crash problems are handled automatically with a GP classifier..."
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if simulation failures are stochastic and not correlated with design variables, making them impossible to predict and avoid.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Bayesian Optimization (BO)**
- Why needed here: This is the core optimization paradigm, essential for understanding how the framework achieves efficiency. It replaces a direct search with a model-based sequential approach.
- Quick check question: What are the two core components of a Bayesian optimization loop? (A: A surrogate model and an acquisition function).

**Concept: Gaussian Process (GP)**
- Why needed here: The GP is the chosen surrogate model. Its ability to provide both a prediction and a well-calibrated uncertainty estimate is fundamental to how the acquisition function works.
- Quick check question: What two quantities does a Gaussian Process predict for any given input point? (A: A mean (prediction) and a variance (uncertainty)).

**Concept: Hierarchical Design Variables**
- Why needed here: The paper's key application involves architectural decisions where the existence of some parameters depends on others. Grasping this concept is necessary to understand the problem's complexity.
- Quick check question: In a hierarchical design problem, what makes a variable "active" or "inactive"? (A: Its state depends on the value of a higher-level categorical variable, e.g., a parent decision).

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** DLR problem definition (OpenTurbofanArchitecting, SBArchOpt) -> ONERA optimizer (SEGOMOE) -> SMT GP models -> WhatsOpt interface

**Critical path:** The critical path is the iterative BO loop: 1) SEGOMOE requests evaluations from SBArchOpt. 2) SBArchOpt runs the OpenTurbofanArchitecting simulation (1-5 mins). 3) Results (or failure flags) are returned. 4) SEGOMOE updates its GP surrogates for the objective, constraints, and failure probability. 5) The acquisition function is optimized to select the next point. 6) Repeat until the budget (e.g., 60 evaluations) is reached.

**Design tradeoffs:** The primary tradeoff is evaluation cost versus optimizer overhead. For very cheap functions, the overhead of training GPs and optimizing the acquisition function is not justified. This architecture is specifically tuned for problems where each simulation is computationally expensive (e.g., minutes to hours).

**Failure signatures:** The most critical failure mode is a simulation crash due to an invalid design point (a hidden constraint violation), which occurs in ~50% of a random DoE. The framework mitigates this by learning a model of failure probability, but a new engineer must ensure this classifier is trained and used. Another failure mode is poor surrogate quality if the initial DoE is too small or poorly distributed.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Baseline Replication:** Replicate the turbofan optimization using a standard algorithm (like NSGA-II) with a large budget (e.g., 1000 evaluations) to establish a baseline for the optimal Thrust-Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC).
2. **Efficiency Validation:** Run the same problem using the SEGOMOE optimizer with a constrained budget (e.g., 60 evaluations). Compare the best TSFC found to the baseline to validate the paper's central efficiency claim.
3. **Failure Handling Analysis:** On the turbofan problem, analyze the optimizer's behavior concerning hidden constraints. Track how often the classifier successfully avoids regions with a high probability of failure, ensuring the system is learning to navigate the feasible design space.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: Can the integrated framework be successfully deployed on the RCE platform to optimize the full intermodal mobility and wildfire fighting use cases?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future works will include even more collaboration in an online DLR platform named RCE [34] for both wildfire fighting and intermodal on-demand mobility concept of operations integration and aircraft design optimization."
- Why unresolved: The current paper validates the framework using a turbofan engine benchmark rather than the complex VTOL or seaplane concepts described in the project scope.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful optimization of the all-electric VTOL or multi-role seaplane architectures using the integrated DLR-ONERA workflow within the RCE environment.

**Open Question 2**
- Question: Does the surrogate-based optimization maintain its efficiency (e.g., 60 evaluations) when scaled to higher-dimensional design spaces?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The validation problem is limited to 18 decision variables (9 continuous, 6 discrete/categorical), whereas system-of-systems problems typically involve significantly larger design vectors.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not analyze how the computational budget required by SEGOMOE grows as the dimensionality of the hierarchical design space increases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark results on architecture problems with >50 variables comparing the evaluation budget required by SEGOMOE versus evolutionary algorithms.

**Open Question 3**
- Question: How does the framework perform in identifying Pareto-optimal solutions for multi-objective problems involving conflicting goals?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The introduction highlights the need to evaluate "performance, competitiveness, environmental impact," but the validation section (Table 2) reports results only for the single objective of Thrust-Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC).
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions multi-objective extensions, it provides no empirical evidence of the framework's ability to balance trade-offs between conflicting objectives like weight, noise, and fuel consumption.
- What evidence would resolve it: Presentation of a Pareto front for the turbofan problem optimizing at least two conflicting objectives (e.g., TSFC vs. weight).

## Limitations

- The framework's generalizability is limited by validation only on a single turbofan engine problem rather than diverse system-of-systems applications
- SEGOMOE is not open-source, preventing detailed examination of the acquisition function implementation and hyperparameters
- The scalability of the approach to problems with significantly more than 18 decision variables remains untested

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The efficiency claims for SEGOMOE on the turbofan problem (achieving 6.679 g/kNs with 60 evaluations vs. 6.7 g/kNs with 1000 NSGA-II evaluations) are well-supported by the presented results

**Medium confidence**: The generalizability of the framework to other system-of-systems problems, given the limited validation scope

**Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of hierarchical variable handling, as the paper focuses on a single application rather than multiple problem types

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain validation**: Apply the framework to a non-aerospace system-of-systems problem (e.g., urban mobility or supply chain optimization) to test generalizability of the hierarchical variable handling and hidden constraint approaches

2. **Scalability analysis**: Systematically vary the number of hierarchical levels and discrete variables to determine the limits of the SMT GP implementation's effectiveness

3. **Alternative optimizer comparison**: Benchmark SEGOMOE against other state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization algorithms (e.g., TuRBO, qEHVI) on the same turbofan problem to isolate the contribution of the framework architecture versus the specific optimizer choice
