## Executive Summary

Current life sciences agents rely heavily on static, rule-based architectures or resource-intensive supervised learning, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic user needs without expensive ground-truth labeling. This paper addresses the critical challenge of optimizing agentic workflows in complex, safety-critical environments where data is non-stationary and user preferences vary. Specifically, it tackles the exploration-exploitation dilemma inherent in agentic systems, where models must balance trying new strategies against leveraging known successful actions to maximize efficiency and accuracy in high-stakes scientific domains.

The key innovation is a label-free, Human-in-the-Loop framework that integrates AWS Strands Agents with Thompson Sampling, a contextual bandit algorithm. This architecture moves beyond fixed orchestration by simultaneously optimizing three distinct dimensions of agent behavior: **Generation Strategy** (direct generation vs. chain-of-thought), **Tool Selection** (e.g., literature search engines vs. drug databases), and **Domain Routing** (e.g., pharmacology vs. clinical specialists). By adapting Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) principles to the agent orchestration level, the system learns optimal policies solely from implicit user feedback, effectively handling cold-start issues and non-stationarity without requiring pre-labeled training datasets.

Empirical results demonstrate that the framework significantly outperforms random baselines, achieving a 15–30% improvement in user satisfaction on complex life science queries. The system exhibits rapid convergence, identifying optimal decision-making strategies after processing only 20–30 queries. Validation across diverse tasks—including factual lookups, complex reasoning, literature research, and safety-critical operations—confirmed that the model successfully maintains high performance while reducing dependency on costly data annotations.

This research represents a significant shift toward adaptive, self-optimizing AI systems in specialized domains, proving that agent-level decision-making can be effectively automated without traditional supervised methods. By validating a multi-dimensional optimization approach that relies exclusively on user feedback, the work reduces the operational costs associated with data labeling and manual tuning. The open-sourced framework provides a scalable, principled solution for deploying dynamic agents that can continuously evolve alongside changing user requirements and scientific knowledge.
