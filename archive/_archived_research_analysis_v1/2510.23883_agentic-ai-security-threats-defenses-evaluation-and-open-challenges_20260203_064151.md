## Executive Summary

This research addresses the escalating security risks inherent in **Agentic AI systems**—autonomous models capable of goal-directed reasoning, planning, and tool use. Unlike traditional software or static AI models, these agents operate with high autonomy across web, software, and physical environments, creating a vastly expanded and complex attack surface.

The core issue is that current security paradigms are ill-equipped to handle the distinct and amplified vulnerabilities introduced by agents that can autonomously execute actions and interact with external systems. This matters because the shift from passive models to active agents introduces new failure modes where malicious inputs can lead to real-world exploitation of system vulnerabilities, necessitating a move beyond reactive security measures toward **secure-by-design architectures**.

### Innovation and Impact
The paper’s key innovation lies in the development of a comprehensive taxonomy and a structured evaluation framework specifically tailored to the security of autonomous agents. Technically, the authors synthesize current literature to classify threats targeting modern agent frameworks like LangChain and AutoGPT, focusing on communication protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) JSON-based interactions.

The study exposes a critical disparity between the rapid advancement of Agentic AI capabilities and the lagging state of its security defenses. By demonstrating that autonomous agents can outperform traditional hacking tools at minimal economic cost, the paper underscores the urgent need for a paradigm shift in how AI systems are architected and evaluated.

## Key Findings

*   **Distinct Risk Profile:** Agentic AI systems introduce new and amplified security risks that are fundamentally different from traditional AI or software vulnerabilities.
*   **Expanded Attack Surface:** The autonomy of these agents allows execution across web, software, and physical environments, creating complex security implications.
*   **Dual-Defense Necessity:** Effective mitigation requires a multi-layered approach combining technical defense strategies with robust governance frameworks.
*   **Research Gaps:** Significant open challenges exist that must be addressed to transition from reactive security to secure-by-design system architectures.

## Methodology

The authors conducted a **comprehensive literature survey and synthesis** to establish the foundation of their analysis. The methodology involved three primary steps:

1.  **Taxonomy Classification:** Outlining a dedicated taxonomy for Agentic AI by classifying specific threats.
2.  **Evaluation Review:** Reviewing and analyzing existing benchmarks and evaluation methodologies used to assess agent security.
3.  **Defense Synthesis:** Synthesizing current research to discuss defense mechanisms from both technical and governance perspectives.

## Contributions

*   **Threat Taxonomy:** Development of a structured taxonomy defining threats specific to Agentic AI systems.
*   **Evaluation Review:** A critical review of recent benchmarks and methodologies used to evaluate the security of autonomous agents.
*   **Defense Synthesis:** A comprehensive discussion of defense strategies bridging the gap between technical implementations and governance policies.
*   **Future Roadmap:** Identification of open challenges aimed at guiding the research community toward the development of secure-by-design agent systems.

## Technical Details

### System Characteristics
Agentic AI systems are defined by four core capabilities:
*   **Autonomy**
*   **Goal-directed reasoning**
*   **Planning**
*   **Tool interaction**

Common frameworks analyzed include **LangChain** and **AutoGPT**.

### Communication Protocols
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Used for linking models to external resources.
*   **Agent-to-Agent (A2A):** Protocols using JSON for task delegation between agents.

### Key Attack Mechanisms
*   **Prompt Injection:** Both Direct (DPI) and Indirect (IPI).
*   **Adversarial Algorithms:** Such as Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG).
*   **Autonomous Exploitation:** Techniques including XSS+CSRF chaining and SQL injections.

## Results

The analysis of state-of-the-art LLM agents reveals alarming fragility in current systems:

*   **High Vulnerability Rates:**
    *   **94.4%** of agents are vulnerable to Prompt Injection.
    *   **83.3%** are susceptible to Retrieval-Based Backdoors.
    *   **100%** success rate was observed in Inter-Agent Trust Exploits.
*   **Evasion of Defenses:** Adaptive Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks achieved a **50% success rate** against eight deployed defense mechanisms.
*   **Autonomous Exploitation Capability:**
    *   GPT-4 agents demonstrated an **87% success rate** in exploiting "one-day" CVEs.
    *   Agents outperformed established tools like OWASP ZAP and Metasploit.
    *   Agents successfully breached sandboxed websites autonomously.
*   **Economic Feasibility:** The economic cost of executing these sophisticated exploits is minimal, often only a few dollars per attempt.
