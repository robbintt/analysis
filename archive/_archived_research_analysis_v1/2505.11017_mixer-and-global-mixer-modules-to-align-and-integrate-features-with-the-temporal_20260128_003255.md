## Executive Summary

Current approaches to leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series forecasting often treat these models as opaque, black-box encoders, relying exclusively on the final output layer for predictions. This methodology fails to capture the multi-scale temporal nuances inherent in time series data, specifically overlooking short-term local dynamics in favor of broad global patterns. Consequently, standard LLM-based methods struggle to effectively model complex temporal dependencies, limiting their accuracy and generalization capabilities in diverse forecasting scenarios.

The authors introduce **Logo-LLM**, a framework that explicitly repurposes pre-trained LLMs (specifically GPT2) by extracting multi-scale features from intermediate layers rather than relying solely on final outputs. The methodology relies on **"Hierarchical Layer Specialization,"** utilizing shallow layers to capture local dynamics and deeper layers to model global trends. To synthesize these features, the architecture employs specialized **Local-Mixer** and **Global-Mixer** modules, which align concatenated hierarchical LLM representations with original patching inputs.

Technically, the model freezes the Transformer self-attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs) of the backbone, training only positional embeddings and specific layer normalization layers, following a preprocessing pipeline of Channel Independence, Instance Normalization, and Patching. Logo-LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance across major benchmarks, securing the best rank on 5 out of 9 datasets for Mean Squared Error (MSE) and 4 out of 9 for Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The model demonstrated significant relative improvements over key competitors, achieving an **8.9% MSE reduction versus Time-LLM** and a **1.3% reduction versus CALF**.

This research represents a paradigm shift in time series forecasting, moving from using LLMs as static encoders to actively exploiting their intermediate hierarchical representations for temporal analysis. The framework's robust performance in few-shot and zero-shot settings suggests significant potential for broader applications where data is scarce.
