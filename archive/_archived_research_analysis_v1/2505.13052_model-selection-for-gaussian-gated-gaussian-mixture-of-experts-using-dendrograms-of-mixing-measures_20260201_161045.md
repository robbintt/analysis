> ## 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Determining the true number of experts (model order) in Gaussian-gated Gaussian Mixture of Experts (MoE) is essential for accurate non-linear regression, yet standard criteria like AIC and BIC often fail when gating networks depend on covariates. Furthermore, traditional model selection is computationally prohibitive in high-dimensional settings because it requires training and evaluating an exhaustive range of candidate models from scratch, creating a massive computational burden.
>
> The authors extend **"dendrograms of mixing measures"** to Gaussian-gated MoE models, operating within an **"overfitted regime."** The method trains a single model with a knowingly large number of components ($K > K_0$) and defines a dissimilarity metric that penalizes distances in both gating and expert parameters. A merging algorithm then iteratively combines similar components into a dendrogram, allowing the **Dendrogram Selection Criterion (DSC)** to identify the true model complexity by balancing average log-likelihood against dendrogram height.
>
> The proposed framework delivers rigorous theoretical guarantees, ensuring consistent estimation of the true number of components ($\hat{K}_N \to K_0$) and achieving pointwise optimal convergence rates for parameters even when the initial model is overfitted. In synthetic experiments, the DSC outperformed standard criteria (AIC, BIC, ICL) by effectively penalizing small-weight or proximate atoms using a specific penalty weight of $\log N$. Crucially, this approach reduces computational overhead by replacing exhaustive model training with a single overfitted training run.
>
> This research resolves the critical trade-off between theoretical stability and computational efficiency in MoE deployment. By eliminating the need to train multiple models, the method makes MoE layers feasible for high-dimensional data and easier to integrate into deep neural networks.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The authors revisit **'dendrograms of mixing measures'** and introduce a novel theoretical extension tailored for Gaussian-gated Gaussian MoE models. This approach handles intrinsic interactions governed by partial differential equations arising from covariates in both gating functions and expert networks.

*   **Extended Framework:** By utilizing this extended dendrogram framework, the method estimates model order and parameters directly from an overfitted model without exhaustive comparison across complexities.
*   **Overfitted Regime Strategy:** Instead of searching through a grid of model complexities, the approach fits a single, complex model and uses structural pruning to identify the true underlying structure.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Gaussian-gated Gaussian MoE (GGMoE)
The model uses a mixture of $K_0$ affine experts to model non-linear relationships.
*   **Expert Component:** A Gaussian distribution centered on an affine transformation of the input, characterized by a slope vector, intercept, and noise covariance.
*   **Gating Component:** A multivariate Gaussian distribution over the input space, defined by mean and covariance parameters.

### Dendrogram Selection Criterion (DSC)
The DSC operates by initializing an overfitted regime, starting with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of $K$ components (where $K > K_0$).
1.  **Dissimilarity Metric:** The method defines a dissimilarity metric between atoms (experts) that penalizes distance in both gating and expert parameters, weighted by mixing proportions.
2.  **Merging Algorithm:** An iterative process combines pairs of atoms with minimum dissimilarity. This uses weighted aggregation rules for weights, gating parameters, and expert parameters.
3.  **Dendrogram Construction:** A dendrogram is constructed recursively to record dissimilarity values at each merge.
4.  **Model Selection:** The final model selection minimizes the DSC score, balancing the average log-likelihood and the dendrogram height with a penalty weight of $\log N$.

*   **Comparative Performance:**
    *   DSC outperforms AIC, BIC, and ICL on synthetic data.
    *   It achieves this by incorporating the mixing measure's structure via dendrogram height to penalize closely located or small-weight atoms.
*   **Computational Impact:**
    *   The method alleviates the burden of training multiple models by requiring only a **single overfitted model training run**.
