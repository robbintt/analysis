## 📝 Executive Summary

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the language sciences is currently hindered by "methodological fragmentation," where researchers deploy models using inconsistent, ad-hoc approaches that disconnect specific research goals from technical methods. This lack of standardization creates significant issues regarding reproducibility and verifiability, treating computational tools as convenient utilities rather than rigorous instruments of scientific inquiry.

This paper addresses this gap by establishing the necessity for a unified structure to govern LLM deployment. The authors introduce a comprehensive, two-tier framework to align LLM capabilities with distinct linguistic research objectives:

1.  **Method-Selection Framework:** Categorizes applications into prompt-based interaction (exploratory), fine-tuning (confirmatory), and embedding extraction (quantitative).
2.  **Systematic Implementation Framework:** Provides the configuration infrastructure for constructing robust, multi-stage research pipelines.

Leveraging Transformer-based architectures (BERT and GPT-series), the framework standardizes key metrics such as surprisal, contextualized embeddings, and neural alignment with fMRI and EEG data. Validated through a triangulation methodology, the study confirms significant correlations between LLM-computed surprisal and human reading times/neural activity. Consequently, this work facilitates a paradigm shift, moving the field from fragmented, heuristic usage to standardized, verifiable science, and provides a durable blueprint for future balancing of general utility with theory-driven rigor.
