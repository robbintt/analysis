## Executive Summary

This research addresses the computational bottleneck of integrating high-dimensional speech data into pre-trained Language Models (LLMs) for text classification, specifically targeting the challenge of sequence length disparity and the controversy surrounding the utility of audio in Argumentative Fallacy Detection (AFD). While LLMs excel at textual analysis, incorporating paralinguistic speech features often introduces inefficiencies due to extensive sequence lengths, and previous studies have debated whether audio information introduces noise that hinders logical classification tasks. The paper investigates whether discrete speech representations can be effectively fused with text to improve performance on detection and classification tasks without requiring prohibitive computational resources.

The authors propose a low-complexity multimodal fusion technique centered on a rigorous dimensionality reduction pipeline and a distinct two-stage training mechanism. The method utilizes a 'SpeechTokenizer' (RVQ-based) to convert audio into discrete tokens. To solve the sequence length issue, the authors employ a Lasso-based (L1) feature selection on a multimodal Bag-of-Words representation. The training process involves adapting the frozen LLM to selected speech tokens and fine-tuning on the downstream task using LoRA adapters.

The approach achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results, outperforming unimodal text-only models, larger SpeechLM models, and models utilizing continuous audio representations. Ablation studies highlighted the method's robustness, revealing that introducing even a random selection of audio tokens boosts performance over text-only baselines. This work significantly impacts the field by providing empirical evidence that paralinguistic information complements textual analysis, challenging the prior assumption that audio features are detrimental to logical classification tasks.

## Methodology

The research follows a structured four-part methodology designed to efficiently fuse audio and text modalities:

1.  **Tokenization**
    The system utilizes an existing speech tokenizer to convert audio inputs into long sequences of tokens from a large vocabulary.

2.  **Feature Selection**
    It applies a **Lasso-based (L1) feature selection** on a multimodal Bag-of-Words representation. This filters and retains only the most critical audio tokens, drastically reducing dimensionality.

3.  **Representation**
    The process relies on a multimodal Bag-of-Words representation to facilitate the feature selection process and manage the disparity between sequence lengths.

4.  **Two-Stage Training**
    *   *Stage 1:* Adaptation of the pre-trained language model to selected speech tokens using a self-supervised language modeling objective.
    *   *Stage 2:* Fine-tuning on the specific downstream classification task.
