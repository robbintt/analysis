## Executive Summary

Qualitative research in healthcare relies heavily on inductive Thematic Analysis (TA) to extract patient insights from interview transcripts, yet this process remains manually intensive and unscalable. Analyzing complex, unstructured data—such as detailed focus groups regarding pediatric conditions like Anomalous Aortic Origin of a Coronary Artery (AAOCA)—requires significant time and expert cognitive effort. As the volume of qualitative data grows, the field faces a critical bottleneck: existing automated methods lack the accuracy required for high-stakes medical environments, while manual analysis cannot keep pace with the demand for rapid information synthesis.

This study introduces the **LLM-Enhanced Thematic Analysis (LLM-TA) pipeline**, a novel architecture that integrates the cost-effective GPT-4o mini model via LangChain to automate the first five stages of inductive TA. To overcome context window limitations and preserve nuance, the pipeline employs a fine-grained "divide-and-conquer" strategy. Transcripts are segmented into chunks of up to 1,500 words, generating approximately one code per 225 words, which are subsequently synthesized into higher-level themes. The technical implementation evaluates three distinct prompting strategies—0-Shot, 1-Shot, and 1-Shot augmented with a Reflexion (self-reflection) loop—to optimize the balance between efficiency and analytical depth.

The LLM-TA pipeline demonstrated superior performance compared to existing baselines (Mathis et al.) across both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Utilizing sentence-t5-xxl embeddings, the 0-Shot LLM-TA achieved a Jaccard Similarity of **0.410** against human ground truth, significantly outperforming the baseline range of 0.111–0.139 and approaching the human-human inter-rater similarity of 0.583. Furthermore, the pipeline achieved a perfect Hit Rate of **1.000**, successfully capturing all themes identified by human analysts. In expert evaluations, the 1-Shot + Reflexion variant received a specificity rating of 5/5 compared to 1-2 for baselines. Most notably, the pipeline reduced task duration by **97%**, decreasing the required time from 30 person-hours to under 10 minutes (or 90 minutes with Reflexion).

These findings validate the viability of using affordable, state-of-the-art LLMs for rigorous qualitative analysis in high-stakes healthcare settings. By proving that high-throughput automation can achieve near-human thematic fidelity, this research offers a scalable pathway to reduce analyst workload and accelerate the derivation of clinical insights. The study establishes a practical framework for human-AI collaboration in qualitative research and contributes to the field by releasing the pipeline code and implementation details, enabling other researchers to replicate and adapt this efficient methodology for complex domain-specific analysis.
