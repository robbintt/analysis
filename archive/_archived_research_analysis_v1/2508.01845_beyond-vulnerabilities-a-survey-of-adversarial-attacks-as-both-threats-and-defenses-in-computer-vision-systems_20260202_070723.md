## Executive Summary

This research addresses the expanding security vulnerabilities in Computer Vision (CV) systems, where adversarial attacks pose a critical threat to the reliability of deep learning models. As these systems become pervasive in high-stakes environments, the adversarial landscape has evolved from simple pixel perturbations to sophisticated, physically realizable, and latent-space manipulations.

This paper synthesizes a fragmented field into a coherent narrative, highlighting that adversarial examples are not merely offensive threats but also dual-purpose phenomena that can be leveraged for system hardening. The key innovation of this work is a comprehensive taxonomy and systematic analysis that classifies adversarial attacks into three distinct domains: **pixel-space**, **physically realizable**, and **latent-space attacks**.

Technically, the authors establish a unified mathematical framework and trace the chronological evolution from basic gradient-based methods (like FGSM) to complex optimization frameworks. The survey provides experimental evidence of efficacy, standardizes core evaluation metrics, and identifies significant research gaps in Neural Style Transfer protections and defensive computational efficiency. Ultimately, this survey serves as a foundational reference for bridging the gap between theoretical threat models and practical, real-world computer vision security.

## Technical Framework

The paper establishes the following mathematical and structural foundations for understanding adversarial attacks in Computer Vision.

### Mathematical Formulation
The study establishes a unified framework where an adversarial example is formulated as:

$$x_{adv} = x + \delta$$

**Objective:** Maximize deviation $D(F(x), F(x_{adv}))$
**Constraint:** Subject to a perturbation constraint $\|\delta\| \le \epsilon$

### Classification Schema
Attacks are classified by two primary dimensions:
*   **Attacker Knowledge:**
    *   White-box
    *   Grey-box
    *   Black-box
*   **Mechanisms:**
    *   Gradient/Optimization-based
    *   Generative models

**Target Architecture:** VGG-19 is specifically mentioned as a primary victim architecture in experimental evaluations.

## Experimental Results

### Illustrative Case Study: FGSM on VGG-19
The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)** with the following parameters:
*   **Perturbation Magnitude:** $\epsilon = 4/255$
*   **Original Classification:** 'robin' (98.23% confidence)
*   **Attacked Classification:** 'mantis' (66.12% confidence)

### Evaluation Metrics
The survey identifies three core pillars for evaluating attacks:
1.  **Performance:** Quantified by Attack Success Rate (ASR).
2.  **Transferability:** The ability of an attack to work across different models.
3.  **Imperceptibility:** Quantified by norms and perturbation magnitude.

## Identified Research Gaps

Based on the analysis, the authors highlight two primary deficiencies in the current state of the art:
*   **Lack of Protection:** Neural Style Transfer (NST) systems currently lack robust protection mechanisms against adversarial manipulation.
*   **Computational Inefficiency:** Current defense mechanisms often require prohibitive computational resources, making them impractical for real-time applications.
