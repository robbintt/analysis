## Executive Summary

Current dialogue systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to discern user confusion regarding related concepts, resulting in inaccurate topic guidance. Because these systems cannot adapt to the specific knowledge states of users, information retrieval (IR) is inefficient. Interactions frequently fail to address the user's actual level of understanding, leading to suboptimal user experiences where the system cannot effectively steer the conversation toward educational or informational goals.

To address this, the authors propose the **Ask-Good-Question (AGQ) framework**, a hybrid architecture integrating psychometric modeling with generative AI. The technical core is the **Concept-Enhanced Item Response Theory (CEIRT)** model, which extends traditional testing methods to enable continuous assessment. CEIRT evaluates a user's multidimensional knowledge state (represented as a dynamic vector $\theta$) and calculates discrimination ($a$) and difficulty ($b$) parameters to filter relevant "inspiring text." These parameters are used to construct enhanced prompts that guide the LLM to generate specific questions designed to close identified knowledge gaps.

Comparative analysis demonstrates that the AGQ framework significantly outperforms existing baseline methods. The study validates the system's capability to successfully generate guiding questions directly from source material, streamlining the Question & Answer process. By reducing the need for manual searching and refining the interaction flow, the framework achieves measurable improvements in information retrieval efficiency and the overall quality of the user experience.

This research bridges the critical gap between static LLM generation and dynamic user assessment. By successfully integrating psychometric models (CEIRT) with LLMs, the paper establishes a new paradigm for intelligent tutoring systems and support agents capable of actively diagnosing user confusion. This capability shifts the focus from mere text generation to pedagogically sound interaction, enabling AI systems to function as adaptive partners that guide users toward mastery.
