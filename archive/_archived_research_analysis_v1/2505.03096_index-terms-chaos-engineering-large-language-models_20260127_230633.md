## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical reliability challenges inherent in **Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems**, which are plagued by stochastic failure modes such as hallucination loops, deadlocks, and context loss. As organizations move toward autonomous agent architectures, traditional software testing methodologies—designed for deterministic systems—prove inadequate for capturing the complex, semantic error states of LLMs. This lack of standardized testing frameworks creates a significant barrier to validating the safety and robustness of these systems in production environments.

The core innovation is the formalization of **"Semantic Chaos Engineering,"** a framework that adapts fault-injection principles from distributed systems to the cognitive layer of LLM agents. The authors propose a mechanism to systematically perturb the agent's reasoning loop by introducing specific noise vectors—including simulated API latency, prompt injection attacks, context window truncation, and memory corruption. This approach stress-tests the agent's decision-making pathways and recovery mechanisms, moving beyond basic functional verification to evaluate the system's dynamic resilience under adverse semantic conditions.

> **Note on Data Availability:** The provided source text indicates that experimental results are "Not Available." Consequently, the specific quantitative findings requested in the critique—including the exact Task Success Rate (TSR) degradation values and the specific winner of the ReAct vs. Hierarchical planner comparison—cannot be detailed here.

This work establishes a foundational methodology for evaluating LLM systems by shifting the focus from **static accuracy to dynamic resilience**. It provides researchers and engineers with a reproducible taxonomy for validating agent robustness, enabling the identification of latent defects that standard testing misses. By formally defining Semantic Chaos Engineering, the paper sets a new standard for safety-critical validation in Generative AI applications, facilitating higher confidence in the deployment of autonomous agents.
