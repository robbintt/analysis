## Executive Summary

Solving stochastic optimal control problems in high-dimensional spaces is notoriously difficult due to the "curse of dimensionality" associated with traditional grid-based methods. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising mesh-free alternative, their application has largely been restricted to deterministic settings governed by first-order HamiltonJacobiBellman (HJB) equations. Extending these methods to stochastic domainswhich require solving complex, second-order HJB equations involving diffusion processesis critical for modeling real-world systems where noise and uncertainty are inherent, yet it remains a significant theoretical and computational challenge.

The researchers introduce the **Physics-Informed Neural Network Policy Iteration (PINN-PI)** framework, which effectively bridges the gap between PINNs and stochastic control. Technically, the method leverages Howards Policy Iteration algorithm to decompose the nonlinear HJB equation into a sequence of linear PDEs. By fixing the control policy, the framework transforms the problem into a linear PDE for the value function, which is then approximated by a neural network minimizing the residual. Crucially, the authors exploit this linear structure to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that rigorously quantify how errors in the value function gradient propagate to policy updates, addressing the typical "black box" nature of neural solvers.

The PINN-PI framework demonstrated robust performance across a variety of benchmark problems, confirming its ability to handle high-dimensional state spaces effectively. Specifically, the method successfully solved stochastic optimal control tasks including the Cartpole and Pendulum problems, and scaled efficiently to 10-dimensional Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) tasks. Theoretically, the research established that the algorithm achieves global exponential convergence in the $L^2$ norm and provides systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, assuming standard stability conditions ($\lambda > B/2$).

This work significantly advances the field by extending the applicability of neural solvers from deterministic to stochastic optimal control, setting a new standard for verifying the scalability of these techniques. By providing rigorous theoretical guaranteesincluding explicit error propagation bounds and convergence propertiesthe framework enhances the interpretability and reliability of neural network-based control strategies. This contribution paves the way for more robust, physics-compliant AI systems capable of operating in uncertain, high-dimensional environments typical of complex engineering and robotics applications.
