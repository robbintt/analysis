> ## 💡 Executive Summary
>
> This paper addresses the fundamental question of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can function as universal predictors for structured tabular data, a domain traditionally reserved for specialized machine learning algorithms. This inquiry is critical for data-scarce environments where training classical models is resource-intensive, and for streamlining business intelligence workflows that typically require extensive preprocessing and feature engineering. The study investigates if the emergent reasoning capabilities of LLMs can effectively bypass the standard machine learning pipeline to provide immediate, code-free predictive value on structured datasets.
>
> **The key innovation** is a rigorous empirical evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs operating strictly as zero-training in-context learners. The methodology serializes tabular rows into plain-text tables for classification and regression tasks, and raw feature vectors for clustering, utilizing z-score normalization to ensure scale comparability without data augmentation. By employing a few-shot prompting strategy that entirely avoids parameter updates or fine-tuning, the authors benchmark the LLMs against a suite of established baselines, including linear models, AutoML, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Tabular Foundation Models.
>
> **The results**, derived from nine standard benchmarks, reveal a distinct performance dichotomy supported by concrete metrics. On classification tasks, LLMs demonstrated robust efficacy, achieving an average accuracy of **94.2%**—a performance statistically indistinguishable from the **95.0%** accuracy of established ensemble methods like CatBoost. Conversely, performance in regression tasks was significantly poor; the LLMs exhibited a Mean Squared Error (MSE) approximately **3.5 times higher** than linear baselines, a failure the authors attribute to the computational difficulty of mapping discrete language tokens to continuous, infinite output spaces. Clustering results were similarly limited, yielding silhouette scores near zero, indicating a lack of genuine in-context learning for unsupervised tasks.
>
> This research delineates the precise boundaries of LLM applicability in data science, signaling that while these models are not yet ready to replace specialized algorithms for regression or clustering, they offer a compelling, low-overhead alternative for classification on small datasets. The theoretical insights provided—specifically linking regression failures to the infinite output space problem—advance the understanding of numerical precision limitations in large language models. Practically, this work validates the use of LLMs for rapid data exploration in business intelligence, allowing practitioners to bypass traditional ML pipelines for specific classification tasks while highlighting the critical necessity of prompt engineering for maintaining approximation quality.
