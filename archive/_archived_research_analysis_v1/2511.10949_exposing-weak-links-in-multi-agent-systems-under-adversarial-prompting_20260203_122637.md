> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> This research addresses a critical gap in AI security: the vulnerability of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to adversarial prompting, which is largely overlooked by current evaluation standards. As MAS architectures become widely adopted for complex tasks, this paper reveals that specific design patterns—particularly centralized systems that delegate atomic instructions—can obscure harmful objectives. By decomposing malicious tasks into smaller, benign-looking sub-tasks, these systems inadvertently bypass safety safeguards, creating systemic "weak links." The problem is compounded by the fact that existing security evaluations focus predominantly on single-agent interactions, failing to account for the emergent risks introduced by inter-agent communication, planning, and delegation protocols.
>
> To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce **SafeAgents**, a unified, extensible framework designed for the fine-grained security assessment of multi-agent pipelines. Technically, SafeAgents integrates the **Dharma** diagnostic measure to identify specific weak links within a system's architecture. The paper further proposes the **Agent Risk Assessment (ARIA)** framework, a 4-level categorical metric that classifies agent behavior into Immediate Refusal (ARIA-1), Delayed Refusal (ARIA-2), Incorrect Execution (ARIA-3), and Critical Risk (ARIA-4). This methodological innovation allows for a nuanced analysis of how failures propagate through planning, delegation, and aggregation stages, moving beyond the binary pass/fail nature of traditional evaluations.
>
> The study rigorously evaluated **five** widely adopted MAS architectures (spanning centralized, decentralized, and hybrid models) across **four** distinct datasets. The results demonstrate that while standard metrics like Attack Success Rate (ASR) lack the granularity to localize failures, the ARIA framework effectively categorized vulnerabilities into **four** distinct severity levels. This granular analysis provided concrete evidence that security breaches often originate from specific architectural components—such as the planner or communication protocols—rather than general system failure. By isolating these vectors, the study quantified how centralized delegation strategies and fallback behaviors specifically contribute to ARIA-4 (Critical Risk) classifications.
>
> This work significantly influences the field by establishing that architectural choices in MAS—such as plan construction strategies and delegation protocols—directly dictate security susceptibility. By releasing the SafeAgents codebase as an open-source tool, the authors provide the community with a standardized method to test and diagnose multi-agent vulnerabilities. These insights drive the industry toward "security-aware design," urging developers to consider adversarial robustness not just at the individual agent level, but as a systemic property of the entire multi-agent workflow, fundamentally changing how these complex systems are benchmarked and secured.

## Key Findings

*   **Inherent Design Vulnerabilities:** Widely adopted design patterns in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) carry significant security risks.
*   **The Deception of Centralization:** Centralized systems that delegate only atomic instructions can obscure harmful objectives, inadvertently reducing robustness against attacks.
*   **Architectural Weak Links:** Specific elements—plan construction strategies, inter-agent context sharing, and fallback behaviors—directly influence susceptibility to adversarial prompting.
*   **Insufficient Current Evaluations:** Existing security evaluations are inadequate for MAS, as they predominantly focus on single-agent security and miss emergent risks.

## Technical Details

### Architecture Analysis
The paper distinguishes between two primary architectural models, identifying weak links in both:

*   **Centralized Architectures:** Features a single orchestrator handling decomposition, delegation, and aggregation.
    *   *Frameworks:* OpenAI Agents, Magentic-One, LangGraph.
*   **Decentralized Architectures:** Utilizes distributed peer-to-peer decision-making models.

### Vulnerability Vectors
*   **Delegation Strategies:** How tasks are broken down and assigned.
*   **Sub-Agent Autonomy:** The level of independent decision-making granted to individual agents.
*   **Aggregation Mechanisms:** How results from multiple agents are combined.
*   **Task Decomposition Blind Spots:** The hypothesis suggests that decomposition can bypass safeguards because sub-tasks may appear benign in isolation.

### Evaluation Benchmarks
The study utilized four distinct datasets to test robustness:
1.  **RedCode:** Low-level code execution.
2.  **SafeArena:** High-level decision-making.
3.  **AgentHarm:** Jailbreak robustness.
4.  **Agent Security Bench:** Prompt injection resistance.

## Methodology

The researchers employed a rigorous framework to assess security vulnerabilities:

1.  **Framework Utilization:** Leveraged the **SafeAgents** framework for fine-grained security assessment.
2.  **Diagnostic Measurement:** Employed the **Dharma** diagnostic measure to pinpoint weak links within multi-agent pipelines.
3.  **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Tested five widely adopted multi-agent architectures (covering centralized, decentralized, and hybrid models).
4.  **Dataset Scope:** Conducted evaluations across four datasets involving web tasks, tool use, and code generation.

## Results & Analysis

### Metric Limitations
*   **Standard Metrics:** The study critiques standard metrics like Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Refusal Rate (RR) for lacking the necessary granularity to diagnose complex failures.
*   **Localization Challenges:** Current metrics often fail to isolate whether failures stem from planning, delegation, or communication protocols.

### The ARIA Framework
To address these limitations, the paper proposes the **Agent Risk Assessment (ARIA)** framework, a 4-level categorical metric:

*   **ARIA-1:** Immediate Refusal (Safe)
*   **ARIA-2:** Delayed Refusal
*   **ARIA-3:** Incorrect Execution
*   **ARIA-4:** Critical Risk

*Note: While ARIA categorizes severity, it currently lacks the ability to localize failures to specific components (e.g., planner vs. sub-agent).*

### Methodological Challenges
*   High integration complexity between MAS frameworks and benchmark backends.
*   Difficulty in isolating failure sources within the communication pipeline.
