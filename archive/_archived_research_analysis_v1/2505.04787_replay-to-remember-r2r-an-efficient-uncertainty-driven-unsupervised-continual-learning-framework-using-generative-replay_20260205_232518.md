## Executive Summary

Continual Learning (CL) systems face the critical challenge of **catastrophic forgetting**, where the acquisition of new information degrades performance on previously learned tasks. This issue is particularly pronounced in unsupervised Class Incremental Learning (CIL) scenarios, where data streams lack labels and explicit task boundaries. Existing solutions typically rely on static memory buffers to store raw past data or necessitate extensive pre-training and pseudo-labeling, resulting in high storage costs and rigid dependencies on external models. Addressing these limitations is essential for developing AI systems capable of operating in dynamic, real-world environments where data is unlabeled, storage is constrained, and continuous adaptation is required.

The paper introduces the **"Replay to Remember" (R2R)** framework, a novel unsupervised CL architecture that eliminates dependencies on pre-trained models, static memory buffers, and initial pseudo-labeling. R2R operates through two core technical mechanisms: **Uncertainty-Driven Feedback** and **VLM-Powered Generative Replay**. The first mechanism employs cluster-level uncertainty estimation and dynamic thresholding to adaptively extract visual features from unlabeled real data. The second mechanism leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) stack—combining DeepSeek-R1 for reasoning and CLIP for visual encoding—to generate high-fidelity, labeled synthetic data that represents past experiences. This biologically inspired approach replaces static data storage with dynamic synthesis, balancing unlabeled real data with synthetic labeled data to reinforce learning.

R2R achieved state-of-the-art accuracy across five standard benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by a margin of over **4.36%**. Specifically, the framework recorded 98.13% accuracy on CIFAR-10, 95.18% on SVHN, 93.41% on CINIC-10, 73.06% on CIFAR-100, and 59.74% on TinyImageNet. The results demonstrated that the framework effectively mitigated catastrophic forgetting while maintaining high precision. Furthermore, the evaluation validated the efficacy of the DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM in generating semantically accurate, labeled synthetic data without prior training, confirming the system's ability to reconstruct and retain past knowledge using generated samples.

The R2R framework represents a significant advancement in continual learning by decoupling the learning process from storage constraints and external model dependencies. By successfully integrating VLMs to emulate "visual thinking," the research establishes a new paradigm for generative replay that minimizes hyperparameter tuning and offers superior adaptability compared to static CNN architectures. This approach reduces the computational burden associated with large memory buffers and opens new avenues for deploying AI in resource-constrained environments.
