## Executive Summary

> **Overview**
> This research addresses a critical oversight in existing Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) literature: the systematic neglect of Data Augmentation (DA) strategies. While QAT and KD are essential for deploying efficient, low-bit models on resource-constrained hardware, prior work has largely treated DA as an arbitrary constant.
>
> **The Problem**
> The authors argue that treating augmentation as an afterthought is a significant deficiency because the choice of augmentation strategy has a profound impact on the performance of quantized models. By failing to optimize the input data distribution specifically for the constraints of low-bit quantization, current methods fail to achieve the full potential of model compression.
>
> **The Solution**
> The key innovation is a theoretically grounded framework that integrates optimal DA selection directly into the QAT-KD pipeline. The authors introduce a novel, low-overhead metric to rank and select augmentation strategies before training commences. This metric evaluates augmentations based on two criteria: maximizing **Contextual Mutual Information (CMI)** to preserve semantic relevance, and adhering to a **Prediction Accuracy Constraint (PAC)** to maintain fidelity to ground truth labels.
>
> **Impact**
> This approach serves as a pre-processing step compatible with existing QAT and KD algorithms. It allows practitioners to automatically identify the most effective DA strategy (e.g., AutoAugment, AugMix, or CutMix) for a specific dataset and quantization configuration without incurring high computational costs. The paper establishes a crucial theoretical link between Data Augmentation and quantization-aware Knowledge Distillation, shifting the paradigm from solely optimizing model weights to optimizing the input data distribution for low-bit environments.

    *   Adhering to a Prediction Accuracy Constraint.
2.  **Pre-processing Integration:** This metric allows for the automatic ranking and selection of the best strategies.
3.  **Compatibility:** The approach functions as a pre-processing step compatible with existing QAT and KD algorithms.
