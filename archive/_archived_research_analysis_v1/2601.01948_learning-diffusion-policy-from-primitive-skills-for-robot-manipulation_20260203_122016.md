## Executive Summary

Existing diffusion policies for robot manipulation typically rely on monolithic global instructions to generate short-term control signals. This approach suffers from **"action misalignment,"** where generated actions fail to correspond precisely to the semantic requirements of a task over extended periods. The core problem is that global instructions lack the granularity required for fine-grained control in complex, long-horizon manipulation, leading to suboptimal robot behavior that struggles to maintain consistency between high-level intent and low-level execution.

The authors introduce **SDP (Skill-conditioned Diffusion Policy)**, a framework that integrates interpretable skill learning with conditional action planning to resolve action misalignment. Technically, the method decomposes complex tasks into sequences of reusable primitive skills. The architecture employs a **Vision-Language Model (VLM)** to extract discrete semantic representations from visual observations and language instructions. These representations are processed by a lightweight router network, which functions as a learned classifier to map the current high-level context to a specific skill latent code. This router dynamically assigns the appropriate primitive skill, which then conditions the diffusion model, ensuring that the generated action sequence adheres strictly to the selected skill's behavioral constraints.

SDP demonstrates superior performance over State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods in both simulation and real-world environments. In the **Franka Kitchen** simulation benchmark, a standard for long-horizon manipulation, SDP achieved a success rate of **88.7%**, significantly outperforming baseline diffusion policies which averaged **62.4%** due to inconsistent action planning. In real-world robot deployments, SDP maintained a success rate exceeding **85%** on multi-stage tasks. These results highlight the framework's ability to maintain robust generalization, effectively transferring learned policies from simulation to physical hardware.

## Key Findings

*   **Action Misalignment:** Existing diffusion policies relying on global instructions for short-term control signals suffer from significant action misalignment.
*   **Superior Interface:** Primitive skills provide a more intuitive and effective interface for robot learning compared to global instruction approaches.
*   **SDP Performance:** The proposed SDP method ensures skill-consistent behavior by decomposing complex tasks into sequences of primitive skills.
*   **Benchmark Dominance:** SDP consistently outperforms State-of-the-Art methods across simulation benchmarks and real-world robot deployments.

## Methodology

The authors propose **SDP (Skill-conditioned Diffusion Policy)**, a framework integrating interpretable skill learning with conditional action planning. The methodology consists of four distinct components:

1.  **Skill Abstraction:** Defines reusable primitive skills to form the building blocks of complex tasks.
2.  **Representation Extraction:** Utilizes a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to process visual observations and language instructions into discrete representations.
3.  **Skill Routing:** Implements a lightweight router network to analyze context and assign specific primitive skills dynamically.
4.  **Policy Generation:** Constructs single-skill policies conditioned on the router's output to generate aligned action sequences.
