# Securing Agentic AI Systems -- A Multilayer Security Framework

*Sunil Arora; John Hastings*

## 📋 Executive Summary

Existing cybersecurity frameworks are insufficient for securing Agentic AI systems because they fail to address the unique risks introduced by autonomous, decision-making, and adaptive behaviors. Unlike traditional AI models, agentic systems interact dynamically with environments and can execute unauthorized actions, making them vulnerable to adversarial manipulation and complex operational failures. As enterprises increasingly deploy these autonomous agents, the lack of a specialized governance model creates a critical security gap where current standards cannot adequately mitigate the specific threats posed by independent software actors.

To bridge this gap, the authors introduce the **Multilayer Agentic AI Security (MAAIS)** framework, developed using Design Science Research (DSR) to ensure a rigorous, artifact-based approach. The core technical innovation of MAAIS is the evolution of the traditional CIA triad into "**Agentic AI CIAA**," which adds **Accountability** as a fourth pillar to specifically trace and govern autonomous decisions. This lifecycle-aware architecture integrates multiple defense layers across the agent's entire operational span, providing tailored controls that address the nuances of agency rather than relying on static, reactive security measures.

The efficacy of the MAAIS framework was validated through a structural mapping exercise against the **MITRE ATLAS** matrix, a comprehensive knowledge base of adversarial tactics targeting AI systems. The study successfully demonstrated that MAAIS covers known AI threat vectors by aligning its defensive layers with established tactics. However, the validation was qualitative in nature; the authors explicitly note that quantitative performance metrics, such as detection rates or comparative benchmarks against other frameworks, were not available for this study.

This research significantly advances the field by establishing a standardized, lifecycle-aware approach to securing agentic AI. The introduction of the Agentic AI CIAA concept provides a new foundational vocabulary and governance model for security professionals. For enterprises, the MAAIS framework offers actionable, step-by-step operational guidance for CISOs and engineering teams, facilitating the safe deployment of autonomous agents while ensuring that accountability is maintained throughout the system's lifecycle.
