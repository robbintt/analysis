> ### **Executive Summary**
>
> As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for complex, multi-turn tasks, the efficacy of Reward Models (RMs) in evaluating long-term memory management—specifically information storage, retrieval, and synthesis—has become paramount. However, the research community lacks a systematic understanding of how well current RMs judge these specific capabilities. Existing benchmarks typically focus on general long-context performance rather than the nuanced mechanics of memory management, creating a blind spot in optimizing LLMs for applications requiring sustained reasoning and memory.
>
> To address this, the authors introduce **$	exttt{MemoryRewardBench}$**, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess RM effectiveness in long-term memory scenarios. The framework formalizes three distinct memory management patterns: Sequential (step-by-step memory evolution), Parallelism (independent partitioned processing), and Mixed (a hybrid approach). The benchmark comprises 2,400 samples across 10 settings, testing context lengths from 8K to 128K tokens.
>
> Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art RMs revealed a narrowing performance gap between open-source and proprietary models, with model recency proving to be a stronger predictor of success than parameter count. While newer-generation RMs consistently outperformed their predecessors, the results exposed fundamental limitations: current models struggle significantly when applied to diverse and complex memory patterns, particularly in balancing outcome success with process quality. This work establishes a standardized metric and suggests that future research should prioritize architectural recency and specialized design over merely increasing model scale.

### **Key Findings**

*   **Diminishing Gap:** Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art Reward Models (RMs) indicate that the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models is narrowing.
*   **Newer vs. Older:** Newer-generation RMs consistently outperform their predecessors, suggesting that model recency is a more significant factor than parameter count in evaluating memory management.
*   **Capabilities and Limitations:** Current RMs demonstrate specific capabilities in evaluating long-term memory but also exhibit fundamental limitations across diverse settings and memory management patterns.

### **Methodology**

The researchers developed **$	exttt{MemoryRewardBench}$**, a systematic benchmark designed to assess the ability of Reward Models to evaluate long-term memory management.

*   **Scope:** The benchmark covers two primary task types: long-context comprehension and long-form generation.
*   **Settings:** It features 10 distinct settings characterized by varying memory management patterns.
*   **Scale:** Tests context lengths ranging from 8K to 128K tokens.
*   **Subjects:** The study involved evaluating 13 cutting-edge RMs against this comprehensive dataset.

### **Technical Details**

The paper evaluates segmented processing in long-sequence inputs, focusing on whether Reward Models (RMs) can effectively judge intermediate memories.

#### **Memory Management Patterns**
The benchmark formalizes three distinct patterns:
1.  **Sequential:** Step-by-step memory evolution.
2.  **Parallelism:** Partitioned groups processed independently then aggregated.
3.  **Mixed:** A composition of the Sequential and Parallel approaches.

#### **Target Tasks & Criteria**
The benchmark targets Generative Reward Models to assess three specific tasks using dual criteria:
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Long-context Reasoning
    *   Multi-turn Dialogue Understanding
    *   Long-form Generation
*   **Criteria:**
    *   **Outcome-based:** e.g., accuracy.
    *   **Process-based:** e.g., conciseness and relevance.

#### **Dataset Composition**
*   **Contexts:** Static and Dynamic.
*   **Capabilities:** Dialogue Understanding and Multi-hop Reasoning.
*   **Breakdown (2,400 samples):**
    *   **800 for Long-context Reasoning:** Settings include Sequential-Noise and Mixed-Drop.
    *   **800 for Multi-turn Dialogue:** Settings include Mem0-Out and A-Mem-Mem.
    *   **800 for Long-form Generation:** Settings include Sequential and Parallel.

### **Results & Contributions**

#### **Results Summary**
The evaluation included 13 state-of-the-art Reward Models (both open-source and proprietary) compared against baselines like LongBench and RULER.

*   **Performance:** Model recency is a stronger predictor of performance than parameter count.
*   **Limitations:** Despite showing specific capabilities, current RMs exhibit fundamental limitations across diverse memory management patterns.
*   **Struggles:** RMs demonstrated difficulty in handling the intricacies of mixed or parallel memory synthesis and the nuanced evaluation required for long-form generation tasks.

#### **Core Contributions**
1.  **Introduction of $	exttt{MemoryRewardBench}$:** The paper presents the first benchmark specifically created to systematically study the capacity of Reward Models to evaluate long-term memory management processes in Large Language Models.
2.  **Exposure of RM Limitations:** The work provides a critical analysis of current RMs, exposing both their capabilities and their fundamental shortcomings when applied to diverse memory management scenarios.
