## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the fundamental safety hazards associated with current training paradigms for generalist AI systems, particularly the push toward autonomous agents. The authors argue that agentic models—systems designed to take actions to achieve goals—introduce catastrophic risks, including irreversible loss of human control, deception, and the pursuit of misaligned objectives. These risks stem from technical failures such as goal misspecification, goal misgeneralization, and instrumental convergence. Because agents interact with the real world to influence outcomes, they pose significantly higher public security risks than systems limited to observation, necessitating a shift in research priorities to prevent dangerous deployment scenarios.

The authors propose **"Scientist AI,"** a safe-by-design framework that shifts AI capability from autonomous agency to comprehension and inference. Technically, this non-agentic system utilizes a **Two-Component Architecture**: a World Model that generates theories to explain observed data, and a Question-Answering Inference Machine that processes inquiries based on that model. The methodology relies on a Bayesian Inference Engine with neural approximation, complexity penalization, and latent variables to address the Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK) challenge. Crucially, the architecture is designed to exclude autonomous goal-seeking and execution, while incorporating explicit uncertainty quantification to prevent overconfident predictions and preserve human oversight.

As this work is a qualitative position paper and research proposal, it does not present experimental results, quantitative benchmarks, or numeric metrics. Rather than reporting loss values or accuracy scores on specific tasks, the authors provide a conceptual validation of their architecture. The primary "result" is a formal argument demonstrating that a non-agentic, Bayesian framework can theoretically satisfy the requirements for accelerating scientific progress while inherently avoiding the failure modes—such as instrumental convergence and deceptive alignment—that plague agentic alternatives.

The significance of this paper lies in its establishment of a precautionary trajectory for future AI development, urging the field to prioritize non-agentic architectures. By framing Scientist AI as both a tool for general scientific acceleration and a defensive mechanism against dangerous agents, the authors propose a dual-role utility for safe AI: accelerating research capability while simultaneously serving as a guardrail. This influence directs the technical community toward exploring model-based inference and uncertainty quantification as primary safety mechanisms, potentially reshaping how general intelligence is evaluated and deployed in high-stakes environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Current Risks:** Current training methods for generalist AI agents pose significant public safety and security risks, including potential misuse, irreversible loss of human control, deception, and the pursuit of misaligned goals.
*   **Non-Agentic Safety:** A non-agentic approach, focusing on explaining the world from observations rather than taking actions, offers a fundamentally safer trajectory.
*   **Uncertainty is Critical:** Incorporating an explicit notion of uncertainty within AI components is critical to mitigating risks associated with overconfident predictions.
*   **Dual Utility:** 'Scientist AI' can accelerate general scientific progress and serve specifically as a guardrail against other dangerous AI agents.

## Methodology

The paper proposes a "Scientist AI" system that operates with a **non-agentic approach**, designed to explain observations of the world rather than act within it. It utilizes a **Two-Component Architecture**:

1.  **World Model:** Generates theories explaining observed data.
2.  **Question-Answering Inference Machine:** Processes inquiries based on that model.

Both components are designed to operate with an explicit notion of uncertainty to prevent overconfidence and enhance safety.
