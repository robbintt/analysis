## Executive Summary

Current Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems struggle with scalability and generalizability, particularly when facing complex, structured tasks. As task complexity increases, these systems often suffer from "context explosion"—where the volume of information overwhelms the context window—and inefficient sequential processing that hinders performance. The paper addresses the critical need for a robust framework capable of decomposing intricate queries and managing distributed resources effectively without sacrificing accuracy or speed.

AgentGroupChat-V2 introduces a novel "divide-and-conquer" framework utilizing a fully parallel architecture to maximize efficiency. Technically, the system employs Hierarchical Task Decomposition to transform user queries into "task forests," allowing for the concurrent processing of sub-tasks rather than sequential execution. Key components include an Adaptive Collaboration Engine, which dynamically selects appropriate LLMs and interaction modes, and an Agent Organization Optimization module for distributed processing. The architecture is tunable via Width (Number of Agents: 2-5) and Depth (Dialogue Rounds: 2-5), with optimal performance observed at Width=3 and Depth=3.

The framework demonstrates superior performance across mathematical, coding, and domain-specific benchmarks, with its advantage growing alongside task difficulty. On high-complexity MATH-100 Level 5 problems, AgentGroupChat-V2 achieved 52.1% accuracy, significantly outperforming baselines like Multi-Agent Debate (40.3%) and Naive-CoT (42.3%). It also secured 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K, 30.4% on AIME, and a 79.20% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. In domain-specific applications, the model scored 90.20% on medical reasoning tasks (MedmcQA) and outperformed AutoGen in commonsense reasoning, achieving 85.6% on WinoGrande.

AgentGroupChat-V2 establishes new performance standards for multi-agent systems by validating that structural task decomposition and parallel execution are essential for handling complex reasoning. By demonstrating a performance margin exceeding 11 percentage points on the most difficult problems, this work shifts the paradigm from reasoning-intensive methods to scalable, divide-and-conquer strategies. This advancement has significant implications for the field, offering a generalizable solution that mitigates context management issues and enables the effective application of multi-agent systems to highly specialized domains such as finance, law, and medicine.
