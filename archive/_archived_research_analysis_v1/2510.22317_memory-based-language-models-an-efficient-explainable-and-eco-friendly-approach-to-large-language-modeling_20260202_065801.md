## Executive Summary

Current state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) rely heavily on Transformer architectures, necessitating massive GPU resources that result in substantial energy consumption and high carbon emissions. Furthermore, their "black box" nature limits interpretability. This research proposes **Memory-Based Language Modeling (MBLM)**, implemented via the system `OLIFANT`, as a sustainable and transparent alternative.

Utilizing fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification, `OLIFANT` operates on a "model equals data" principle, requiring only a one-pass, linear-time training process. It runs exclusively on CPUs, prioritizing transparent mechanics over deep learning opacity.

Evaluations using the EduFineWeb dataset demonstrate that MBLM achieves **log-linear scaling**, consistently improving accuracy as data volume increases (up to 5 billion tokens). Results indicate that `OLIFANT` achieves next-token prediction accuracy and token latency comparable to GPT-2 and GPT-Neo, but with significantly lower energy consumption. This challenges the assumption that massive parameter counts are strictly necessary, establishing memory-based modeling as a viable, eco-friendly paradigm for Explainable AI (XAI).

## Methodology

The researchers implemented the memory-based language model `OLIFANT` using fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor classification. To specifically measure the ecological footprint, the methodology relied **exclusively on CPUs** rather than GPUs for both training and inference.

The study compared MBLM against Transformer-based deep neural network architectures (**GPT-2** and **GPT-Neo**). Performance was evaluated using three distinct metrics:
1.  Next-token prediction accuracy.
2.  Estimated carbon emissions.
3.  Processing speeds.
