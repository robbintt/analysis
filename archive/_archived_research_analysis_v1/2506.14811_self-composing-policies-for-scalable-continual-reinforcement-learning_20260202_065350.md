## 📝 Executive Summary

Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) faces a fundamental challenge known as the **stability-plasticity dilemma**: agents must maintain high performance on previously learned tasks (stability) while successfully acquiring new skills (plasticity). In standard neural network architectures, this typically leads to **catastrophic forgetting**, where the optimization process for a new task overwrites the knowledge required for old ones. Furthermore, existing continual learning solutions often rely on computationally expensive regularization techniques or suffer from inefficient parameter expansion, scaling quadratically or exponentially with the number of tasks.

This paper addresses this bottleneck by introducing an architecture designed specifically to mitigate interference and memory constraints. The authors introduce a growable, modular neural network architecture that utilizes **"self-composing policies"** to manage knowledge transfer dynamically. Unlike static networks, this system constructs a cascading graph structure with dynamic depth, adding a distinct policy module for each new task encountered.

The proposed method was evaluated using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) optimization on continuous control and visual benchmarks. The architecture achieved **linear parameter growth**, significantly outperforming ProgressiveNet in efficiency while scaling to over 200 tasks. This research significantly advances the field of continual learning by resolving the long-standing trade-off between model scalability and knowledge retention, establishing a new standard for efficient CRL architectures.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Mitigation of Catastrophic Forgetting:** The proposed architecture naturally mitigates catastrophic forgetting and interference *without* requiring specific regularization techniques.
*   **Accelerated Learning:** The system demonstrates accelerated learning on new tasks by selectively combining and reusing knowledge from previous policies.
*   **Parameter Efficiency:** Achieves parameter efficiency with **linear growth** relative to the number of tasks, explicitly avoiding exponential or unbounded expansion.
*   **Sustained Plasticity:** The model retains high plasticity (the ability to learn new information) even as it scales to accommodate a larger number of tasks.
*   **Benchmark Superiority:** In tests involving continuous control (Meta-World) and visual problems (ALE), the method outperformed alternative approaches in both knowledge transfer and overall performance.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The authors propose a **growable and modular neural network architecture** designed specifically for continual reinforcement learning.

*   **Selective Combination:** Each module within the network is structured to perform a selective combination of policies. It integrates the agent's internal policy for the current task with relevant previous policies.
*   **Dynamic Expansion:** This self-composing capability allows the network to dynamically expand and leverage historical knowledge to solve new tasks efficiently.
*   **Architecture:** The system employs a **cascading graph structure** with dynamic depth. A new policy module is added for each task $k$.
*   **Recursive Definition:** Policies are defined recursively using a matrix $\Phi_{k;s}$ that aggregates outputs from preceding modules.
