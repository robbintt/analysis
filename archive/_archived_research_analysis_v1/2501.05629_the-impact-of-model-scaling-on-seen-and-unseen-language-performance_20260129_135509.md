> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale rapidly in size, a critical knowledge gap remains regarding how this parameter growth affects cross-lingual capabilities, particularly for languages completely absent during pretraining ("unseen" languages). While scaling laws suggest performance improvements with size in high-resource contexts, it is unclear whether this trend extends to zero-shot generalization across diverse linguistic families. Understanding this relationship is essential for efficient resource allocation and for developing truly universal models, as simply increasing model size is computationally expensive and may not yield proportional benefits for underrepresented languages.
>
> This study provides a comprehensive, systematic analysis of scaling laws across 204 languages by evaluating three families of multilingual LLMs of varying parameter sizes. The technical approach isolates specific variables by contrasting Base Pretraining against Instruction-Tuning and evaluating performance under Zero-shot versus Two-shot prompting scenarios. Crucially, the methodology decouples the impact of total pretraining resources from the specific proportional distribution of languages, allowing the researchers to strictly categorize and compare performance on "seen" versus "unseen" language groups across text classification and machine translation tasks.
>
> The evaluation reveals a divergent scaling behavior dependent on the task and prompting strategy: increased model scale showed negligible correlation with performance in zero-shot text classification, yet resulted in linear improvements when shifted to two-shot settings. For machine translation, scaling benefits were exclusive to instruction-tuned models, with base models seeing no advantage from increased size. The data indicates that overall resource volume is a stronger predictor of multilingual performance than specific language class proportions. However, a statistically significant performance gap between seen and unseen languages persists across all evaluated model scales and prompting settings, indicating that scale alone cannot bridge this disparity.
>
> These findings significantly influence the field by demystifying the drivers of multilingual performance, shifting the focus from balancing fine-grained language distributions to maximizing total training resources. The research highlights the limitations of relying solely on parameter scaling for zero-shot capabilities, establishing instead that few-shot prompting and instruction tuning are critical prerequisites for unlocking scaling benefits, particularly in translation tasks. By proving that the "seen versus unseen" gap is resistant to scaling, the paper directs future research toward architectural and training optimizations rather than simple parameter expansion to achieve true language universality.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Divergent Scaling Behavior:** Model scale has a negligible impact on zero-shot performance but shows linear improvements in two-shot text classification.
*   **Task-Specific Scaling Efficacy:** Scaling benefits differ by task; machine translation sees benefits exclusively in instruction-tuned models.
*   **Resource Level vs. Proportion:** Overall resource levels predict performance better than specific pretraining language proportions.
*   **Seen vs. Unseen Disparity:** A significant performance gap exists between seen and unseen languages regardless of model scale or setting.
