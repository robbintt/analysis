## Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the significant performance degradation that occurs when applying low-bit quantization to multi-task networks, particularly object detection architectures like YOLO. As the demand for deploying deep learning models on edge devices grows, minimizing model size through quantization (e.g., 4-bit or 3-bit weights and activations) is essential. However, existing Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods struggle in multi-task scenarios due to gradient conflicts between tasks and the collapse of feature representations under extreme quantization noise. This limitation creates a substantial accuracy gap between quantized and full-precision models, hindering the practical adoption of efficient multi-task vision systems.

**Innovation**
The authors propose **GABFusion**, a modular, plug-and-play framework designed to optimize feature fusion specifically for low-bit environments. The core innovation consists of two synergistic components:
*   **Gradient-Aware Balanced Feature Fusion (GABFusion):** Dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features to be quantization-friendly.
*   **Attention Distribution Alignment (ADA):** A specialized feature-level distillation strategy aligning quantized student models with full-precision teachers.

Crucially, this framework integrates into existing pipelines without requiring architectural changes to the backbone network.

**Results**
The methodology demonstrates significant empirical improvements across standard benchmarks and varying bit-widths:
*   **PASCAL VOC:** +3.3% average mAP improvement.
*   **YOLOv5s (W4A4):** AP50 increased from 82.1% to 84.2%, narrowing the gap to full precision (85.9%) to just 1.7%.
*   **YOLOv5s (W3A3):** Recovered LSQ+ performance by +8.3% (from 54.2% to 62.5%).
*   **COCO:** Achieved a consistent average mAP improvement of 1.6%.

**Impact**
The significance of this work lies in its broad generalizability and theoretical validation of gradient bias reduction. By delivering a "plug-and-play" solution compatible with dominant QAT methods and architectures, GABFusion offers a versatile tool for deploying high-performance, low-bit multi-task networks on resource-constrained hardware without sacrificing accuracy.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Performance Boosts:** The proposed strategy achieved an average mean Average Precision (mAP) improvement of approximately **3.3%** on the PASCAL VOC dataset and **1.6%** on the COCO dataset.
*   **Effective Low-Bit Quantization:** When applied to YOLOv5 under 4-bit quantization, the method narrowed the accuracy gap with the full-precision model to just **1.7%** on VOC, demonstrating high efficiency in preserving performance.
*   **Broad Generalizability:** The framework consistently enhanced a wide variety of existing Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods across different network architectures and varying bit-widths.
*   **Theoretical Validation:** The method provides theoretical guarantees regarding the reduction of gradient bias, validating the mechanism behind its effectiveness.

## Methodology

The research proposes a **modular framework** designed to optimize multi-task networks for low-bit quantization without altering the original network architecture. The core methodology consists of two novel components:

1.  **Gradient-Aware Balanced Feature Fusion (GABFusion):** This component dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features to be quantization-friendly, specifically addressing gradient conflicts inherent in multi-task learning.
2.  **Attention Distribution Alignment (ADA):** A feature-level distillation strategy tailored for quantized models. ADA maintains high-quality feature representations by aligning the attention distributions of the quantized model with its full-precision counterpart.
