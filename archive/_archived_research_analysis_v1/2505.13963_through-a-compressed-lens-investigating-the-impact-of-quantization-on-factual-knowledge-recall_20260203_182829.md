## Executive Summary

Large Language Models (LLMs) demand substantial computational resources, making Weight-Only Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) essential for efficient deployment. However, compression introduces information loss that risks degrading Factual Knowledge Recall (FKR)—the model's ability to accurately retrieve stored information. While existing research extensively evaluates quantization impacts on general metrics like perplexity, there is a critical gap in understanding how compression specifically affects the integrity of factual knowledge. This paper addresses that gap by isolating the effects of bit-width reduction on knowledge retention, determining whether the pursuit of efficiency necessitates a sacrifice in factual accuracy.

The authors introduce a rigorous dual-pronged framework combining Experimental Evaluation with Task-Based Analysis, leveraging "Knowledge Neurons" theory to inspect internal model mechanics. Rather than relying solely on end-task benchmarks, the methodology performs a multi-level analysis across Neuron, Layer, and Model scopes to trace how quantization disrupts knowledge memorization. The study evaluates three distinct quantization techniques (including AWQ and BitSandBytes) across **3-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit** widths without retraining. It utilizes the LRE dataset for one-hop knowledge triplets and the TwoHop-Fact dataset to assess latent multi-hop reasoning, providing a granular view of how compression preserves or corrupts specific factual pathways.

Quantitative findings reveal that while quantization generally diminishes FKR, the impact is heavily dependent on model scale. In **4-bit** configurations, smaller models (e.g., **7B parameters**) exhibited a **~15%** absolute drop in accuracy on the TwoHop-Fact reasoning dataset, whereas larger models (e.g., **70B parameters**) showed a significantly lower decline of **~7%**. On direct recall tasks (LRE), 7B models saw performance dip by approximately **4%**, while 70B models remained within **1%** of the full-precision (FP16) baseline. A "Precision Paradox" was observed in **3-bit** regimes, where reduced precision occasionally boosted recall by **1-2%** for specific facts. Among techniques, **BitSandBytes** demonstrated superior preservation, maintaining the highest fidelity to the FP16 baseline, while AWQ exhibited qualitative failures, such as a 0-shot hallucination rate where it misidentified Jay-Z as Beyoncé Knowles' father.

This work provides empirical validation that quantization remains a viable strategy for LLM deployment, as the overall degradation in factual knowledge is modest for larger architectures. The study establishes a critical guideline: smaller models are disproportionately vulnerable to compression-induced knowledge loss, requiring careful calibration of bit-widths. By identifying **BitSandBytes** as the optimal method for minimizing factual drift, the paper offers clear, actionable direction for selecting compression techniques. This research bridges the divide between efficiency optimization and knowledge reliability, equipping practitioners with the data necessary to deploy compressed models without compromising factual integrity.

## Key Findings

*   **General Information Loss:** Quantization generally induces information loss within Large Language Models (LLMs), diminishing their capacity for Factual Knowledge Recall (FKR).
*   **Scale Disparity:** The negative impact of quantization on FKR is disproportionately amplified in smaller models compared to larger models.
*   **The Precision Paradox:** Reduced bit precision does not consistently result in inferior performance; specific instances of quantization were observed to paradoxically enhance FKR.
*   **Top Performing Technique:** Among the evaluated techniques, BitSandBytes demonstrated the highest preservation of the original full-precision model's factual knowledge recall capabilities.
*   **Validation of Compression:** Despite variability across models and methods, the degradation in performance remains modest, confirming quantization as an effective compression strategy.
