## Executive Summary

> **Problem**  
> This research addresses the critical challenge of automating the end-to-end pipeline from raw data exploration to the creation of coherent visual narratives. As data volumes grow, the ability to rapidly generate insights and communicate them effectively becomes bottlenecked by the manual effort required to analyze data and craft accompanying stories. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for automation, relying on them as "black boxes" for the entire workflow introduces significant risks regarding transparency, reliability, and computational cost. Furthermore, existing automated systems often lack modularity, forcing users to regenerate entire outputs when making minor adjustments, which hinders sustainable human-AI collaboration.

> **Innovation**  
> The core innovation is a lightweight, hybrid multi-agent architecture that strategically decouples critical logic from LLM reasoning to enhance system control. Instead of relying solely on generative AI, the system integrates deterministic components with six specialized agents—Data Analysis, Visualization Generation, Code Generation, Visualization Execution, Story Generation, and Story Execution—operating in parallel via multiprocessing. LLMs are reserved exclusively for high-level reasoning tasks, while deterministic components handle specific logic execution. This design produces granular, modular outputs, enabling users to perform surgical edits on specific visualizations or narrative segments without triggering a computationally expensive full regeneration of the project.

> **Results**  
> Evaluated across four diverse datasets ranging from 418 to 4,111 rows, the system demonstrated strong performance in both efficiency and output quality. The architecture achieved a runtime of 6 to 11 seconds per story and approximately 75% story retention. Qualitative analysis confirmed the system's generalizability across different data types and highlighted the robustness of its error handling and retry mechanisms. Additionally, the implementation includes monitoring for LLM API calls and token usage, providing clear visibility into resource consumption.

> **Impact**  
> This work significantly advances the field of automated data communication by proving that a hybrid approach can mitigate the reliability issues often associated with pure LLM reliance. By externalizing critical logic, the system achieves a level of transparency and trustworthiness essential for professional environments. The modular framework facilitates a more sustainable collaboration between humans and AI, allowing users to maintain agency over the final output. This architecture sets a precedent for future systems seeking to balance the creative power of generative models with the precision and determinism required for robust data analysis.
