## 📝 Executive Summary

Current evaluation of LLM causal reasoning is fundamentally flawed due to an over-reliance on surface-level metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and embedding-based similarity scores. These traditional NLP metrics assess textual overlap rather than logical validity, frequently flagging semantically correct answers as incorrect because of phrasing variations (false negatives) or accepting incorrect answers that share tokens with the ground truth (false positives). This discrepancy creates a significant gap between perceived and actual model performance, obscuring the true extent to which LLMs understand formal causal relationships and hindering accurate progress in the field.

The authors introduce **DoVerifier**, a novel symbolic verification framework that evaluates LLM outputs based on formal mathematical derivability rather than string matching. Technically, the system treats evaluation as a proof search problem ($\phi \vdash_G \psi$), utilizing do-calculus and standard probability theory to determine if a model-generated expression is logically equivalent to a ground truth expression given a specific causal graph. The framework constructs a Derivation Graph searched via Breadth-First Search (BFS), applying a finite set of transformation rules to verify equivalence under d-separation conditions. This approach provides theoretical guarantees of soundness and completeness, ensuring that the assessment is grounded in rigorous causal inference logic.

Quantitative evaluations demonstrate the severity of existing failures and the efficacy of the proposed approach. On synthetic data tests, DoVerifier achieved perfect accuracy in validating logical derivations, whereas standard metrics like BLEU and BERTScore showed poor correlation with semantic validity. In real-world benchmarks, the impact was substantial: on the **CLadder benchmark**, DoVerifier recovered **27.6%** of GPT-4's answers that were incorrectly flagged by exact string matching, effectively raising the measured accuracy from **61.4%** to **89.0%**. Similarly, on the **CausalBench** dataset, the tool identified a significant portion of logically valid outputs that semantic similarity metrics had rejected, confirming that a large fraction of "incorrect" model outputs are actually semantically correct but phrased differently.

This research represents a paradigm shift in how LLM reasoning capabilities are assessed, moving the field from heuristic, surface-level comparisons to a rigorous, semantic framework. By uncovering "hidden correctness," the paper provides strong evidence that LLMs possess better causal reasoning capabilities than previously assumed, suggesting that current benchmarks have systematically underestimated model performance. The introduction of DoVerifier provides the research community with a robust tool for validating formal semantic validity, ensuring that future model development is guided by accurate measurements of logical understanding rather than linguistic fluency alone.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Inadequacy of Existing Evaluations:** Current evaluations rely on surface-level metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) that fail to assess formal semantic validity.
*   **High False Negative Rates:** A significant number of LLM-generated answers marked incorrect by standard metrics are actually semantically correct.
*   **Superior Evaluation Accuracy:** The proposed method demonstrates superior accuracy on both synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks (CLadder, CausalBench).
*   **Formal Validation Feasibility:** LLM-generated causal expressions can be formally validated by checking if they are derivable from a given causal graph using mathematical rules (do-calculus).

## 🛠️ Methodology

The researchers developed **DoVerifier**, a symbolic verifier designed to rigorously evaluate LLM outputs in causal reasoning tasks. Instead of relying on text string comparison, the methodology checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are logically derivable from a given causal graph.

*   **Core Logic:** The process utilizes formal rules from do-calculus and probability theory to determine semantic validity regardless of superficial phrasing.
*   **Process Flow:**
    1.  Input a causal graph and the LLM-generated expression.
    2.  Apply transformation rules to the expression.
    3.  Check for logical equivalence with the ground truth.

## 📈 Results

### Failure Modes of Standard NLP Metrics
The paper highlights critical flaws in common evaluation metrics:
*   **BLEU:** Scores low on logically equivalent expressions due to word reordering.
*   **Token-level F1:** Scores high on semantically inequivalent expressions due to simple token overlap.
*   **BERTScore:** Scores high on incorrect simplifications due to embedding similarity.
*   **String Match:** Fails to recognize equivalence under d-separation conditions.

### DoVerifier Performance
*   **Diagnostic Success:** Successfully identified equivalence in a complex scenario where Ground Truth ($P(F \mid do(B))$) was compared against a verbose Prediction ($P(F \mid do(C), do(A), do(B), D)$). Standard metrics failed this test.
*   **Benchmark Results:**
    *   **CLadder:** Recovered 27.6% of GPT-4 answers previously marked incorrect, boosting accuracy from 61.4% to 89.0%.
    *   **CausalBench:** Identified significant valid outputs rejected by semantic similarity metrics.
    *   **Synthetic Data:** Achieved perfect accuracy in validation compared to poor correlation from standard metrics.
