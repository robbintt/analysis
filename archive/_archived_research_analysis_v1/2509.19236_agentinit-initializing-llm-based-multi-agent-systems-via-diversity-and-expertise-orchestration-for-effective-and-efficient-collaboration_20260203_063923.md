## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
The initialization of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) remains a critical bottleneck, often relying on ad-hoc or suboptimal strategies that lead to inefficient collaboration. Existing methods typically struggle with redundancy, where agents possess overlapping capabilities, and a lack of precise expertise orchestration, resulting in teams that are ill-suited for complex task decomposition. This inefficiency manifests as high token consumption, task derailment, and repetitive execution steps. Addressing this initialization problem is vital because the composition of the agent team fundamentally dictates the upper bound of a system’s collaborative performance and computational efficiency.

### **Innovation**
AgentInit introduces a novel framework designed to optimize agent team structures by treating initialization as a subset selection problem, formalized as $f^{AgentInit}_{init}(q) \subseteq f^{LLM}_{init}(q)$. The architecture operates in two distinct modules: first, a **Standardized Agent Generation** module employs a multi-round reflective loop involving a Planner, Formatter, and Observer to iteratively decompose tasks and construct agents, ensuring structural consistency via a "Natural Language to Format" mechanism. Second, a **Balanced Team Selection** module utilizes a Pareto-based selection strategy to filter candidates. This process optimizes two competing objectives: **Task Relevance**, measured by the average cosine similarity of text embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT), and **Agent Diversity**, quantified using the Vendi Score to ensure a rich spread of capabilities.

### **Results**
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving relative performance improvements of up to 1.2 and 1.6 on benchmark tasks. Beyond accuracy, the framework significantly enhances computational efficiency by filtering out redundant and irrelevant agents, leading to a substantial reduction in token consumption. Qualitatively, the system exhibits high transferability to similar tasks and successfully mitigates common collaboration failures such as task derailment and step repetition, validating the robustness of its interaction mechanisms and selection strategies.

### **Impact**
This research represents a significant advancement in the automation and optimization of LLM-based agent systems. By formally defining the trade-off between diversity and relevance through Pareto-optimality, AgentInit provides a principled alternative to manual agent design. The release of source code and models further supports the open science community, offering a reproducible blueprint for constructing high-performance, cost-effective multi-agent collaborations. This work sets a new standard for MAS initialization, shifting the paradigm from static, manual configuration to dynamic, optimized orchestration.

## Methodology

The AgentInit framework optimizes agent team structures through a comprehensive, multi-stage process:

*   **Interactive Generation:** Utilizes a multi-round reflection approach to refine agent creation.
*   **Standardization:** Implements a "Natural Language to Format" mechanism to convert unstructured agent descriptions into standardized formats.

## Technical Details

AgentInit proposes a framework for optimizing Multi-Agent System (MAS) initialization. The process is formalized as a subset selection function:

$$f^{AgentInit}_{init}(q) \subseteq f^{LLM}_{init}(q)$$

The architecture comprises two primary modules:

### 1. Standardized Agent Generation
An iterative K-round process designed to create consistent agent profiles.
*   **Planner:** Responsible for task decomposition and agent construction.
*   **Formatter:** Handles the conversion of data into JSON format.
*   **Observer:** Provides feedback to improve the quality of generation.

### 2. Balanced Team Selection
A filtering mechanism that enumerates team subsets within defined size bounds.
*   **Optimization Objectives:**
    *   **Task Relevance:** Calculated as the average cosine similarity using text embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT).
    *   **Agent Diversity:** Quantified via the **Vendi Score** to ensure a broad range of capabilities.
*   **Final Selection:** The optimal team is chosen from the Pareto optimal set by a Selector Agent.
