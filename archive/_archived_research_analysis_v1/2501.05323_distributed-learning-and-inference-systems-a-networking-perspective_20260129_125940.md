## Executive Summary

While centralized AI training and inference methods deliver high performance, they are fundamentally limited by privacy risks, prohibitive storage demands, single points of failure, and substantial computational requirements. Transitioning to decentralized architectures resolves some of these issues but introduces significant systemic complexity, particularly in synchronizing data properties with the dynamic nature of network infrastructure. Currently, a comprehensive framework capable of coupling data awareness with system dynamics is absent.

This paper introduces the **Data and Dynamics-Aware Inference and Training Networks (DA-ITN)**, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between data characteristics and network behavior. The architecture is bifurcated into **DA-ITN-T** (Training) and **DA-ITN-I** (Inference). In the inference layer, models and queries are treated as mobile objects interacting at Model Hosting Facilities, coordinated through a Tools Layer for mobility management.

Technically, the framework relies on **Topology Management** via *Query, Resource, and Reachability Topology (QRRT)* to track resources, generating *Query-Specific topologies (QS-QRRT)*, and *Dynamic Resource and Reachability Topology (DRRT)* to handle system state. A key innovation is the deployment of **Autonomous AI Traffic Steering (AATS)**, which utilizes "destinationless packets" that dynamically determine routing based on payload content and real-time network conditions, supported by hierarchical or non-standalone control centers.

As a conceptual framework design, this study establishes quantitative performance targets and topological analyses rather than empirical experimental data. The analysis reveals that the topological structures required for these systems are significantly more complex than simple cyclic graphs, underscoring the insufficiency of existing frameworks and validating the need for the sophisticated coordination mechanisms proposed within the DA-ITN structure.

## Key Findings

*   **Limitations of Centralization:** Centralized training and inference methods, while high-performing, present critical drawbacks including privacy risks, high storage demands, single points of failure, and substantial computing requirements.
*   **Complexity of Distribution:** Transitioning to decentralized and distributed AI methods introduces significant complexity, primarily due to the challenge of managing multiple moving parts within the system.
*   **Gap in Current Frameworks:** There is a notable lack of comprehensive frameworks capable of addressing the specific complexities inherent in distributed AI system development.
*   **Necessity of Awareness:** Effective distributed systems require a framework that is cognizant of both data properties and system dynamics to function efficiently.

## Methodology

The authors employ a **conceptual framework design approach** to address the identified gap in distributed AI. Rather than conducting empirical experiments, the work focuses on the architectural description of a novel system—the **Data and Dynamics-Aware Inference and Training Networks (DA-ITN)**. The goal is to explore its constituent components, define their specific functions, and evaluate the associated research challenges.
