## 📑 Executive Summary

While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at standard Visual Question Answering tasks, their performance in wearable contexts remains untested and unreliable due to challenges inherent in egocentric vision such as motion blur, occlusion, poor lighting, and narrow fields of view.

The authors introduce **WearVQA**, the first benchmark specifically tailored to evaluate VQA capabilities in authentic egocentric scenarios. The dataset consists of 2,520 meticulously curated image-question-answer triplets captured via RayBan Meta smart glasses, spanning seven domains and ten cognitive task types. The benchmark employs a 'hard-negative' filtering process to ensure genuine reasoning tests and utilizes an 'LLM-as-a-judge' system calibrated with human annotations for automated evaluation.

Evaluation results reveal a substantial performance deficit in current state-of-the-art models, with accuracy ranging from only 24% to 52%. GPT-4o achieved the highest score at 51.5%, while the leading open-source model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, reached 45.1%. Models showed significant sensitivity to input quality, with Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrating a 16.2% performance gap when facing low-quality images compared to ideal ones. Despite task difficulty, the automated evaluation framework proved highly reliable with 96% accuracy and 96.8% F1-score against human ground truth.

WearVQA represents a paradigm shift in computer vision research by moving focus from idealized third-person imagery to the reality of first-person wearable computing. By establishing a comprehensive standard that exposes specific failure modes of current MLLMs regarding noise and visual artifacts, this benchmark provides a critical roadmap for developing models that can maintain high performance under imperfect visual inputs, a prerequisite for safe and effective AI assistant deployment in daily life.
