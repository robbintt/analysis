## 📝 Executive Summary

Current AI applications in wireless networks are often constrained by static models that cannot adequately adapt to rapidly changing environmental dynamics or hardware configurations. While traditional "agentification" converts specific network modules into agents, these implementations typically lack the autonomy to evolve their own internal models, tools, or workflows without significant human intervention. This rigidity presents a critical bottleneck for next-generation wireless systems, which require the flexibility to self-optimize and upgrade capabilities in real-time to maintain performance and efficiency.

The authors introduce a **"Self-Evolving Agentic AI"** framework designed to overcome static limitations through a fully autonomous evolution cycle. Technically, the system utilizes a multi-agent cooperative architecture comprising multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) guided by role-specialized prompts and coordinated by a central Supervisor Agent. The framework operates across four layers—Perception, Knowledge & Memory, Reasoning & Planning, and Action & Tooling—to execute tasks ranging from data collection to model deployment. Crucially, the agents utilize structured dialogue, iterative feedback, and systematic validation to coordinate the lifecycle, allowing them to independently modify their operational logic, tools, and workflows in response to environmental shifts.

The framework was validated through a demanding case study involving **Low-Altitude Wireless Networks (LAWNs)**, where the system was tasked with managing antenna optimization. The self-evolving agents successfully demonstrated the capability to autonomously upgrade the network’s logic from fixed antenna optimization to movable antenna optimization without human input. Compared to fixed baseline models, the framework restored degraded performance while simultaneously achieving a beam gain improvement of up to **52.02%**. These benchmarks confirm the system's ability to consistently outperform static models while adapting to complex environmental dynamics.

This research represents a significant paradigm shift toward truly autonomous wireless networks, laying the groundwork for 6G and future intelligent communication systems. By empirically proving that AI can autonomously manage both software lifecycles and hardware evolution—such as transitioning antenna types—the study establishes a viable path to reducing operational costs and human reliance. The findings provide a comprehensive blueprint for deploying self-evolving agents, suggesting that future networks will possess the agency to proactively reconfigure themselves to maintain optimal performance in unpredictable scenarios.
