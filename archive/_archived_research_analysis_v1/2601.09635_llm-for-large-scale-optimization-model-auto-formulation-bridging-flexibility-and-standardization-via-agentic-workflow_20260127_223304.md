## 📝 Executive Summary

> This research addresses the critical bottleneck of automating the formulation of large-scale optimization models, a task traditionally requiring extensive manual expertise in mathematical modeling and coding. As decision-making problems in industries such as logistics and aviation grow in complexity, manually translating natural language descriptions into rigorous mathematical formulations creates a significant scalability barrier.

The core innovation is **LEAN-LLM-OPT** (LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction), a framework designed to automate optimization formulation without manual fine-tuning by utilizing a sequential, three-agent architecture. Unlike baselines such as OptiMUS that rely heavily on chain-of-thought prompting—which can bloat token counts and degrade performance—LEAN-LLM-OPT decouples logical reasoning from mechanical data processing. It integrates auxiliary tools to handle tedious calculations and uses a retrieval mechanism that injects only specific, relevant examples rather than full datasets.

In evaluation, LEAN-LLM-OPT—powered by GPT-4—demonstrated superior performance against state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks. Ablation studies validated the necessity of the classification agent and confirmed that the combination of workflow guidance with customized tools is essential for high performance. This work significantly advances the field of AI-assisted Operations Research by proving that agentic workflows can effectively manage the trade-off between flexibility and standardization, providing a scalable, cost-effective alternative for practitioners.

*   **Classification Agent:**
    *   **Function:** Identifies the specific problem type at the initial stage.
*   **Workflow Generation Agent:**
    *   **Function:** Retrieves relevant examples from a reference dataset (*Ref-Data*).
    *   **Action:** Constructs a precise execution workflow based on the retrieved examples.
*   **Model Generation Agent:**
    *   **Function:** Executes the constructed workflow.
    *   **Output:** Generates the final mathematical formulation.

**Key Features**
*   **Token Efficiency:** Instead of injecting full data lists, the system retrieves specific examples to minimize token usage.
*   **Auxiliary Tools:** Integrates external tools to handle mechanical data processing, decoupling it from logical reasoning.
*   **Demonstration:** Validated on a logistics scheduling problem involving **10 trucks** and **4 time periods** with complex logical and capacity constraints.
