## Executive Summary

**Problem**
The research addresses the critical challenge of deploying high-capacity Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices for visually impaired assistance. Large models (19B parameters) typically require substantial memory resources (38GB), rendering them impractical for real-world, mobile assistive hardware. Furthermore, existing assistive technologies often lack the cognitive capability to understand environmental context beyond the user’s immediate field of view, limiting their effectiveness in complex navigation scenarios.

**Innovation**
The paper proposes a dual innovation framework combining advanced model compression with an intelligent multi-agent architecture:
*   **Cross-Modal Differentiated Quantization:** Applies non-uniform precision reduction across the model’s components, specifically preserving the accuracy of cross-modal interactions between vision and language data while significantly shrinking the model size.
*   **Scene-Aware Vectorized Memory:** A multi-agent architecture employing a perception-memory-reasoning workflow using high-dimensional embeddings. This allows for persistent environmental memory, enabling reasoning beyond the current visual snapshot.

**Results**
The proposed framework achieved a substantial **70.2% reduction in memory footprint** (38GB to 11.3GB). Despite this aggressive compression, the 19B-parameter model demonstrated robust performance with only a **2.05% drop on MMBench** and a minor decline on OCR-VQA (63.7 vs 64.9). Crucially, the compressed large model outperformed smaller, dense models with equivalent memory usage. The system achieved a real-time response latency of **2.83 to 3.52 seconds**.

**Impact**
This work significantly advances assistive technology by proving that large, high-performance VLMs can be effectively deployed on consumer-grade hardware. It represents a shift from reactive description tools to proactive, context-aware agents capable of supporting complex navigation and text recognition, offering a higher level of independence and safety for visually impaired users.
