## Executive Summary

Current human-robot collaboration relies on inefficient fixed-assistance paradigms that waste human resources by predetermining input modalities regardless of task context. These systems force high-bandwidth teleoperation when discrete preferences would suffice, or fail to intervene during high-uncertainty states where guidance is most valuable. The core limitation is the inability to compare functionally distinct assistance types—continuous teleoperation versus corrective feedback versus discrete preferences—or to dynamically select interventions based on their expected information value relative to human cognitive and physical burden.

**REALM** introduces an analytical framework that predicts, prior to elicitation, how much each assistance modality would reduce policy uncertainty. For each candidate input type, the method computes expected differential entropy reduction using analytical expressions derived from stochastic policy distributions, converting functionally distinct signals into comparable information-theoretic values. The framework integrates these entropy estimates with likelihood penalization—a probabilistic weighting mechanism that encodes the varying cognitive effort and physical burden of each modality—to select interventions maximizing information gain per unit human cost. Unlike prior methods restricted to deterministic policies, REALM operates natively with stochastic generative architectures, specifically diffusion models, leveraging their inherent uncertainty structure for real-time entropy computation in high-dimensional action spaces.

Empirical validation across simulated environments and physical human-robot interaction tasks demonstrates that REALM achieves accurate real-time estimation of assistance value and enables dynamic arbitration between the three input modalities. The system successfully targets interventions during high-entropy policy states, achieving task completion with substantially reduced human feedback volume compared to fixed-assistance baselines by selectively eliciting high-value assistance only when robot uncertainty warrants human intervention. While the framework proves functional efficacy in closed-loop physical deployment with human subjects, specific entropy reduction magnitudes (in bits/nats) and computational latency benchmarks remain to be quantified in future work.

REALM establishes the first unified methodology for adaptive multi-modal assistance, shifting the field from fixed-input paradigms to resource-optimal collaboration that treats human attention as a scarce resource. By formalizing human input value through differential entropy and explicitly encoding human-factor constraints into the optimization objective, the framework provides a mathematical foundation for sustainable interaction design.

## Key Findings

• **Uncertainty-Driven Assistance Selection**: The REALM framework successfully estimates the relative value of heterogeneous human input modalities (teleoperation, corrective, and discrete preference-based feedback) by computing their expected reduction in policy differential entropy, enabling dynamic selection of optimal assistance types during task execution.

• **Cost-Information Trade-off Optimization**: By integrating differential entropy estimates with a likelihood penalization approach, the method effectively balances the information-theoretic utility of feedback against the varying cognitive and physical burden imposed by different input mechanisms, preventing over-reliance on high-cost human interventions.

• **Compatibility with Generative Policies**: The estimation framework generalizes to emergent stochastic learning architectures, specifically demonstrating functionality with diffusion-based robot policies, indicating applicability to high-dimensional, generative control models beyond traditional deterministic policies.

• **Empirical Validation of Efficiency**: Experimental results from both simulated environments and physical robot user studies demonstrate that the approach produces accurate real-time assistance value estimates and enables task completion with minimal human feedback volume, specifically targeting intervention during high-uncertainty robot behaviors.

## Methodology

**Mathematical Uncertainty Quantification**
Construction of analytical expressions for expected post-interaction differential entropy to predict the uncertainty reduction potential of different human inputs on stochastic robot policies prior to elicitation.

**Comparative Value Estimation**
Framework for mathematically comparing heterogeneous assistance mechanisms (continuous teleoperation, corrective interventions, and discrete choice selection) based on their projected entropy reduction per unit of human involvement.

**Likelihood Penalization Integration**
Incorporation of cost-sensitive weighting via likelihood penalization to account for the differential human effort required by each input modality, creating a principled mechanism for selecting assistance types that maximize information gain while minimizing human burden.

**Policy-Agnostic Implementation**
Deployment with emergent generative models (specifically diffusion models) as the underlying robot policy, utilizing the inherent stochasticity of these architectures to compute actionable uncertainty metrics.

**Multi-Modal Validation**
Comparative evaluation through simulation studies followed by empirical human-subject experimentation involving physical human-robot interaction tasks to measure feedback efficiency and task completion metrics.

## Technical Details

### Information-Theoretic Foundation
The core metric is the **expected reduction in policy differential entropy** (continuous analog of Shannon entropy), used as a quantitative measure of information gain from human feedback. The framework computes expected value of assistance via entropy reduction rather than direct reward or error minimization.

### Multi-Modal Input Architecture
Supports heterogeneous modality handling for three distinct input types with different action spaces:
- **Teleoperation**: Continuous control signals
- **Corrective Feedback**: Trajectory perturbations or adjustments
- **Discrete Preference-Based Feedback**: Comparative rankings or selections

Unified valuation converts disparate signal types into commensurable information-theoretic utility estimates.

### Cost-Aware Optimization Mechanism
**Likelihood penalization** integrates differential entropy estimates with a penalization term encoding cognitive/physical burden of each modality. Dynamic selection enables real-time arbitration between assistance types based on cost-information Pareto optimality, preventing convenience bias toward high-bandwidth but expensive human inputs.

### Policy Compatibility Layer
Explicitly designed for stochastic learning architectures, specifically validated on diffusion-based robot policies. Supports generative control models with high-dimensional action spaces (conditional diffusion models sampling trajectories/actions) rather than limited to deterministic or low-dimensional policies.

### Real-Time Computational Framework
Online estimation computes assistance value estimates during task execution (not post-hoc), enabling closed-loop intervention timing. Uncertainty-guided triggering targets interventions specifically during high-entropy (high-uncertainty) robot behaviors.

## Impact & Significance

REALM represents a paradigm shift from static, predetermined human-robot interaction models to **adaptive, resource-aware collaboration systems**. By establishing the first unified framework for comparing heterogeneous assistance modalities through information-theoretic lenses, the work enables robotic systems to treat human attention as a scarce resource requiring optimal allocation. 

The explicit integration of human-factor constraints (cognitive load, physical effort) into the mathematical optimization objective addresses a critical sustainability challenge in Human-Robot Interaction. Furthermore, the demonstrated compatibility with modern diffusion-based generative policies ensures the framework's relevance as robot learning architectures continue to evolve toward high-dimensional, stochastic control models.

**Future work** should focus on quantifying specific entropy reduction magnitudes, computational latency benchmarks, and comparative performance metrics against baseline assistance paradigms to strengthen the empirical validation of this promising framework.
