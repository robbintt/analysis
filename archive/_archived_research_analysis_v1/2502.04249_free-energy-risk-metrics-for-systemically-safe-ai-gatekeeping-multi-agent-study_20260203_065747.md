## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of ensuring systemic safety in multi-agent autonomous systems, specifically within autonomous vehicle networks operating under uncertainty. As agentic AI systems grow in complexity, traditional safety mechanisms often fail because they rely on massive datasets and precise world models that are brittle or unavailable in dynamic environments. The authors argue for the necessity of "**epistemically and axiologically humble**" decision-making—systems capable of operating safely despite incomplete knowledge of the world (epistemic uncertainty) and ambiguity in human preferences (axiological uncertainty). Solving this is vital for preventing catastrophic cascading failures in networks where individual agent errors can lead to systemic collapse.

The paper introduces a novel framework combining **"Cumulative Risk Exposure" (CRE)**, a risk metric derived from the Free Energy Principle, with a "**Gatekeeper" (GK)** architecture for decentralized coordination. Technically, the system utilizes Active Inference to minimize Variational Free Energy, defining CRE as a time-discounted aggregation of instantaneous risk comprising energetic and entropic components balanced by an inverse temperature parameter. The architecture deploys Gatekeeper agents to monitor local neighborhoods, comparing real-time CRE against stakeholder-defined preferences modeled as Boltzmann distributions. When risk exceeds a defined threshold, these Gatekeepers intervene by overriding the agent's policy objective, shifting from Expected Free Energy (EFE)—used for exploration and information gain—to the Free Energy of the Future (FEF)—which minimizes expected log likelihood and penalizes information gain to prioritize safety.

Validation experiments conducted in multi-agent autonomous vehicle simulations demonstrated the framework's effectiveness using specific performance metrics: Cumulative Risk Exposure (CRE), System-wide Safety, and Joint Free Energy. The key empirical finding was that Gatekeepers significantly increased system-wide safety even at low penetration rates, proving that sparse, localized interventions are sufficient to secure the broader network. The system successfully maintained robustness under uncertainty, handling ambiguity in both world and preference models. Results showed that the online evaluation of CRE and the subsequent minimization of Joint Free Energy successfully mitigated hazardous interactions, confirming that the architecture can enforce collective safety without requiring comprehensive data coverage or control over every agent.

The significance of this research lies in providing a theoretically rigorous yet practical architecture for systemically safe AI that reduces dependency on big data and complex world modeling. By introducing a transparent governance mechanism where stakeholders can define preferences via Boltzmann distributions and straightforward decision rules, the framework bridges the gap between high-level safety objectives and low-level agent execution. This work contributes a scalable blueprint for multi-agent safety, proving that decentralized, "low-penetration" gatekeeping is a viable strategy for managing systemic risks. It sets a foundation for building robust AI systems capable of humble, safe operation in unpredictable, real-world environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Novel Risk Metric:** Introduction of **Cumulative Risk Exposure (CRE)**, a flexible risk metric derived from the Free Energy Principle designed to handle dynamic environments.
*   **Low-Penetration Efficacy:** Experiments demonstrated that gatekeepers increased system-wide safety in multi-agent autonomous vehicle simulations even at low penetration rates.
*   **Local-to-Global Safety:** Gatekeepers improved collective safety by evaluating local risk online and intervening in individual vehicle driving policies.

## Methodology

The research approach is grounded in the **Free Energy Principle** to establish a theoretical foundation for risk measurement. The methodology is defined by three core components:

1.  **Preference-Based Specification:** Stakeholders define desired outcomes, allowing the system to align safety interventions with specific human values.
2.  **Multi-Agent Simulation:** Validation was performed in a simplified autonomous vehicle environment.
3.  **Gatekeeper Architecture:** Special "gatekeeper" agents are deployed to monitor neighborhoods, evaluate collective safety risks online, and intervene in driving policies when necessary.
