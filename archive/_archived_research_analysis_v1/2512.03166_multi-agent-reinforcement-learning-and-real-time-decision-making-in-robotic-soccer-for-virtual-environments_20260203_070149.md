## Executive Summary

This research addresses the inherent complexity of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in dynamic, adversarial environments like robotic soccer. The core challenge lies in the "curse of dimensionality" caused by the exponential growth of state-action spaces as the number of agents increases, compounded by the non-stationarity of the environment where agents must simultaneously account for the evolving behaviors of teammates and opponents. Successfully balancing long-term strategic objectives with immediate tactical execution is critical for deploying autonomous systems in real-time scenarios, yet traditional single-agent RL methods often fail to scale effectively or maintain stability in such cooperative settings.

To address these limitations, the authors propose a novel architecture implemented within a unified client-server framework designed to facilitate sophisticated real-time decision-making. Technically, the system integrates Mean-Field Theory within a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) structure. It employs an options-based HRL framework using Semi-Markov Decision Processes (SMDP) to decompose complex tasks into high-level trajectory planning and low-level skill execution. To manage large-scale interactions, the framework utilizes a Mean-Field Actor-Critic algorithm that models the aggregate influence of surrounding agents as a distribution rather than tracking specific pairwise interactions, thereby mitigating computational burdens while enabling global strategy learning.

Validated through extensive 4v4 simulations in the Webots environment, the study demonstrates a clear progression of performance improvements across architectural iterations. While a baseline Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) achieved 4.32 goals with 82.9% ball control, the introduction of the HRL structure alone improved global strategy, raising the average to 5.26 goals. The final integration of mean-field theory yielded the highest performance, achieving 5.93 goals (a 37.3% increase over the baseline), 89.1% ball control, and 92.3% passing accuracy. Beyond these raw metrics, the approach significantly reduced training variance, enabling stable convergence and consistent cooperative behavior among the robotic agents.

This work provides a significant advancement in scalable MARL by establishing a validated methodology capable of linking high-level strategy with low-level control. By effectively solving the multi-granularity problem and mitigating scalability issues through mean-field approximations, the authors offer a robust blueprint for complex multi-agent systems. The research not only sets a comprehensive performance baseline for robotic soccer simulations but also presents a transferable framework applicable to other domains requiring dense, cooperative agent interactions in virtual or physical environments.

## Technical Details & Methodology

### Methodology
The research utilizes a unified Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework within a **client-server architecture**. The process followed a progressive evolution of algorithms:

1.  **Baseline:** Implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
2.  **Hierarchical Decomposition:** Employment of Hierarchical RL (HRL) with an options framework to decompose tasks into high-level trajectory planning (modeled as a Semi-Markov Decision Process) and low-level execution.
3.  **Scalability Integration:** Integration of mean-field theory into the HRL framework to manage large-scale agent interactions.

### Technical Architecture
The proposed system models a progressive evolution of MARL architectures:
*   **Hierarchy:** Uses Semi-Markov Decision Processes (SMDP) to separate high-level strategy from low-level skill execution.
*   **Mean-Field Integration:** Utilizes a Mean-Field Actor-Critic algorithm. This models agent interactions as a distribution rather than tracking individual pairs, which enhances training stability and solves the "curse of dimensionality."
*   **Simulation Environment:** Conducted on the **Webots platform** in a 4v4 Robotic Soccer scenario.
