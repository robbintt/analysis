# Norm-Q: Effective Compression Method for Hidden Markov Models in Neuro-Symbolic Applications

*Hanyuan Gao; Xiaoxuan Yang*

***

> ## 💡 Executive Summary
>
> Neuro-symbolic AI architectures face a critical scalability bottleneck due to the inefficiency of their symbolic components. Specifically, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) utilized in these systems generate excessive memory and bandwidth demands, accounting for **over 95% of runtime resources**. Furthermore, HMM latency scales significantly worse than Large Language Models (LLMs) (2x vs. 1.45x), creating a severe computational strain that hinders the deployment of neuro-symbolic systems on resource-constrained or custom hardware.
>
> To address these constraints, the authors introduce **"Norm-Q,"** a normalized linear quantization method specifically designed for probabilistic symbolic models. The key innovation lies in the "Norm-Q Aware Expectation Maximization" process, which integrates quantization constraints directly into the model training phase. By employing Row Normalization Quantization, the method resolves the "decay to zero" issue common in high-dimensional probabilistic models, thereby preserving the integrity of probability distributions even when bit width is drastically reduced.
>
> Norm-Q demonstrates exceptional compression capabilities, achieving up to a **99% reduction** in HMM weight size. The method successfully quantized an HMM with 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and to as low as 3 bits with acceptable performance. In large-scale tests involving hidden sizes of 8192 and 16384, the approach maintained constraint success rates exceeding 99% for 8-bit precision and 96% for 3-bit precision, with average score losses remaining under 4%. Additionally, pruning analysis revealed that while 86% sparsity typically leads to total failure, the proposed normalization technique recovers functionality to 82%.
>
> This research provides a viable pathway for the practical deployment of neuro-symbolic systems in production environments. By alleviating the memory and bandwidth bottlenecks associated with the symbolic component, Norm-Q enables these complex models to operate efficiently on custom hardware and edge devices.

## Key Findings

*   **Extreme Compression:** Norm-Q achieves a compression rate of **up to 99%** for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) weights while maintaining reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods.
*   **Low-Bit Quantization:** The method successfully quantized an HMM with 4096 hidden states to **8 bits without loss** and to as low as **3 bits with acceptable loss** in constrained generation tasks.
*   **Resource Optimization:** The approach significantly alleviates memory and bandwidth stress associated with dense computation and data transfer in neuro-symbolic systems.
*   **Hardware Enablement:** By reducing data bit width with minimal performance impact, Norm-Q enables the deployment of these models on potential custom hardware.

## Methodology

The authors propose **Norm-Q**, a normalized linear quantization approach specifically designed for compressing probabilistic symbolic models like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

*   **Core Process:** The method introduces a 'normalized quantization-aware expectation maximization' process.
*   **Integration:** This process integrates quantization directly into the probabilistic model training phase to minimize the impact of reduced bit width on model accuracy.
*   **Application:** This approach is applied to neuro-symbolic applications to optimize the symbolic component (HMMs) and mitigate overall computational and communication bottlenecks.

## Contributions

*   **Tailored Quantization:** Introduction of a normalized linear quantization method tailored for probabilistic symbolic models, addressing the specific needs of neuro-symbolic AI architectures.
*   **Specialized Training:** Development of a specialized expectation maximization process that accounts for quantization during training, ensuring model stability despite reduced precision.
*   **Deployment Solution:** Provision of a solution to deployment challenges (memory and bandwidth limitations) of neuro-symbolic systems by demonstrating extreme compression capabilities (up to 99%) that facilitate execution on resource-constrained or custom hardware.

## Technical Details

Norm-Q addresses the memory and bandwidth bottleneck (over 95% of runtime) in the HMM component of neuro-symbolic systems.

*   **Latency Scaling:** HMM latency scales significantly worse than LLMs (2x vs 1.45x).
*   **Decay Solution:** The method solves the 'decay to zero' quantization issue in high-dimensional probabilistic models by employing **Row Normalization Quantization** to preserve probability distributions.
*   **Training Strategy:** It utilizes a **Norm-Q Aware Expectation Maximization (EM)** training strategy to integrate quantization constraints.
*   **Data Sparsity:** Data analysis reveals high sparsity, with values smaller than 10^-5 accounting for over 80% of matrix weights.

## Results

*   **Compression Performance:** The method achieves up to 99% compression of HMM weights. It allows quantization to 8 bits without loss and 3 bits with acceptable loss.
*   **Large-Scale Model Stability:** For large-scale models (hidden sizes 8192 and 16384), constraint success rates remain over 99% (8-bit) and 96% (3-bit), with average score losses under 3.9% and 3.7% respectively.
*   **Pruning Analysis:** Shows a sharp non-linear trade-off:
    *   85% pruning is safe.
    *   86% causes total failure.
    *   Applying normalization at the failure point recovers functionality to 82%.
*   **Training Dynamics:** Stabilization occurs after 30 data chunks, with optimal quantization intervals of 20 for 4-bit and 50 for 8-bit.
