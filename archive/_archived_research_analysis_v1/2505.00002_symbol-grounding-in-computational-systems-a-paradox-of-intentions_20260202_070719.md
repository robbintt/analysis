## 📝 Executive Summary

> This research addresses the "Symbol Grounding Problem" within computational theories of mind, specifically challenging the capability of computationalism to explain how physical symbols acquire semantic meaning. The central issue is that computational systems, defined by operations over syntax, struggle to bridge the gap between meaningless data manipulation and genuine intentional states (aboutness). This problem is critical because if computationalism cannot account for the origin of meaning without presupposing it, the theory fails as a comprehensive explanation of human cognition and artificial intelligence.

The paper proposes a novel logical critique termed the "**Paradox of Intentions**," which utilizes a dichotomous analysis of Machine Functionalism, Von Neumann architectures, and the Language of Thought (LOT). Technically, Müller introduces a multi-level description framework ranging from Level 0 (Physical/Realization) to Level 3+ (Symbolic) to isolate where semantic properties emerge. The analysis dissects the mechanics of computation—using logic gates like XOR to illustrate syntactic ambiguity—to demonstrate that regardless of whether a system operates on meaningful or meaningless symbols, computationalism cannot derive intention from syntax alone.

Through logical deduction, the author establishes the "**Short Line**" argument, concluding that any LOT-based computational theory is logically forced to accept Semantic Nativism (the innateness of meaning). The study categorizes 9 distinct definitions of "computational" found in literature to demonstrate consistency in this flaw across different interpretations. The results further indicate that purely syntactic computationalism is logically possible only as "**Vacuous Computationalism**," rendering meaning observer-dependent rather than intrinsic to the system. Ultimately, the analysis proves that symbol-referent causal connections cannot be established without prior intentions, leaving the disjunction problem unresolved for standard computational frameworks.

This work significantly restricts the theoretical landscape for cognitive science and AI philosophy by demonstrating that standard computationalist approaches cannot explain learning or meaning acquisition without relying on innate semantics. By forcing a reduction to Semantic Nativism or observer-dependent syntax, the paper challenges the feasibility of creating truly intentional artificial agents through purely syntactic manipulation. This serves as a foundational critique for researchers in cognitive architectures, suggesting that future models must necessarily move beyond conventional computational frameworks—likely toward embodied or dynamic systems—to successfully ground symbols and solve the origin of meaning.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Fundamental Paradox Identified:** The paper highlights a critical contradiction showing that computationalism cannot explain symbol grounding.
*   **The Dichotomy of Symbols:**
    *   If computational processes use **meaningful symbols**, semantic nativism is presupposed.
    *   If they use **meaningless symbols**, intentional cognitive processes are absent, making grounding impossible.
*   **Implication for Computationalism:** Regardless of the nature of the symbols used, computationalism logically implies semantic nativism.

## 📈 Results

The paper presents logical deductions rather than empirical data, yielding the following conclusions:

*   **The "Short Line" Argument:** Concludes that LOT-based computationalism logically necessitates **Semantic Nativism** (innate meaning).
*   **Validation of the Paradox:** The Paradox of Intentions demonstrates that computationalism implies semantic nativism regardless of symbol nature; meaning cannot be acquired without prior intentions.
*   **Causal Connection Analysis:** Indicates that symbol-referent links require explanatory causes involving intentions to address the **Disjunction Problem**.
*   **Vacuous Computationalism:** Finds that purely syntactic computationalism is logically possible but observer-dependent, rendering it "vacuous" in terms of intrinsic meaning.
