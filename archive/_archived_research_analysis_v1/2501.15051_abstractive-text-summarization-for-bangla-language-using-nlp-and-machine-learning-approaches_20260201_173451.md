> ### 📋 Executive Summary
>
> This research addresses the pervasive challenge of information overload in digital news consumption, specifically highlighting the severe scarcity of Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources for the Bangla language. As a low-resource language, Bangla lacks the sophisticated automated tools available in high-resource languages, forcing users to rely on inefficient manual filtering to distill relevant information from noise.
>
> The authors propose an **abstractive text summarization model** that marks a technical departure from traditional extractive methods. The study implements a **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) neural architecture** featuring a **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) encoder** and an **LSTM decoder** integrated with an **Attention Mechanism**. This configuration captures long-range dependencies and contextual nuances, utilizing attention weights to focus on relevant segments and synthesize new sentences.
>
> Evaluated using standard **ROUGE metrics**, the model achieved a ROUGE-1 score of 44.25, ROUGE-2 of 23.15, and ROUGE-L of 39.05—statistically significant improvements over the baseline. This work establishes a robust framework for Bangla abstractive summarization, providing a scalable blueprint for future NLP applications in under-represented languages.
