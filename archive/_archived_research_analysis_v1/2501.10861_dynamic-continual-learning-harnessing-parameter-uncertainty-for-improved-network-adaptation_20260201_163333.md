##  Executive Summary

Continual Learning (CL) faces the persistent challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where neural networks lose previously acquired knowledge upon learning new tasks. While Bayesian methods offer a theoretical solution by managing uncertainty to balance stability (retention) and plasticity (adaptation), they are often computationally prohibitive in practice. Existing techniques typically rely on sampling-based inference, such as Monte Carlo Dropout or Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). These methods introduce significant latency and computational overhead, rendering them unsuitable for dynamic, real-time learning environments where efficiency is critical.

To address this efficiency bottleneck, the authors propose a novel framework utilizing **Bayesian Moment Propagation (BMP)**. This approach learns network parameters and their associated uncertainties directly, obviating the need for costly sampling. The core innovation is a two-pronged regularization strategy driven by these uncertainty calculations. First, **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment** assigns lower learning rates to parameters identified as critical for previous tasks. Second, **Regularization Weighting** applies constraints that force important parameters to revert to their prior states if they drift significantly during updates. By treating parameter importance as a dynamic continuum, the model continuously adapts its internal structure to data streams without the heavy computational load of sampling-based methods.

Benchmarked against established baselines on standard datasets including **Permuted MNIST** and **Split CIFAR-100**, the proposed BMP-based method achieved superior empirical results. On the **Permuted MNIST** benchmark, the framework attained an **Average Test Accuracy of approximately 94.2%**, outperforming both sampling-based Bayesian approaches and non-uncertainty regularization techniques like Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC). Crucially, the method demonstrated a **positive Backward Transfer of +0.8%**, indicating that the acquisition of new tasks measurably improved performance on prior tasks—a rare feat in CL, as most baselines typically exhibit negative transfer (forgetting).

This research significantly advances the field by validating that parameter-based uncertainty, quantified efficiently without sampling, is a superior driver for network regularization. The rejection of sampling-based inference in favor of moment propagation resolves a major scalability issue in Bayesian CL, potentially enabling deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments.

##  Methodology

The study utilizes a **Bayesian Moment Propagation (BMP)** framework to learn network parameters and their associated uncertainties concurrently without sampling.

To prevent catastrophic forgetting, a two-pronged regularization strategy is employed:

1.  **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment:** Critical parameters identified via uncertainty are assigned lower learning rates to prevent significant deviation.
2.  **Regularization Weighting:** This mechanism restricts important parameters from changing and forces reversion to prior states if they drift too far.

**Evaluation:** The method is evaluated on common sequential benchmark datasets (such as Permuted MNIST and Split CIFAR-100) against established Continual Learning baselines.
