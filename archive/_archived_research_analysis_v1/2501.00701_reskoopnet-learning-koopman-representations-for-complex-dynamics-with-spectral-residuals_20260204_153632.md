## Executive Summary

### Problem
The paper addresses the **"spectral inclusion problem"** and spectral pollution inherent in current data-driven Koopman operator analysis methods, such as Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) and Residual DMD (ResDMD). These prior approaches typically rely on filtering precomputed spectra or using predefined dictionaries, which frequently leads to the identification of spurious eigenvalues and fails to capture the true spectral properties of high-dimensional or complex nonlinear systems. This limitation is critical because accurate spectral decomposition is essential for understanding long-term stability, dynamics, and control in physical and biological systems, particularly those exhibiting continuous spectra where traditional methods diverge.

### Innovation
The authors introduce **ResKoopNet**, a neural network-based framework that fundamentally shifts the optimization paradigm from filtering spectra to explicitly minimizing spectral residuals. Rather than relying on fixed dictionaries, the method utilizes a feedforward neural network to parameterize dictionary functions and defines a loss function based on the sum of squared spectral residuals for computed eigenpairs. The architecture approximates the optimal Koopman matrix using a regularized formulation, $\tilde{K} = (G + \sigma I)^{-1} A$, ensuring numerical stability. To address continuous spectra—a major challenge for classical approaches—the method computes the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum through a grid scanning process in the complex plane, allowing the network to discover complete spectral information directly.

### Results
ResKoopNet demonstrates quantifiable superiority over existing baselines on complex, high-dimensional benchmarks.
*   **Ginzburg-Landau equation:** Successfully recovered the essential spectrum where baselines failed, reducing spectral residuals to near machine epsilon ($\sim 10^{-5}$).
*   **Fluid Dynamics (Flow past a cylinder):** Achieved precise reconstruction of flow dynamics with substantially lower prediction errors than standard DMD variants.
*   **Biological Data (Monkey reaching tasks):** Extracted meaningful latent modes with high fidelity, validating its robustness across both synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Impact
This research bridges the gap between rigorous theoretical dynamical systems analysis and deep learning by providing a framework with theoretical guarantees for complex nonlinear systems. The authors prove that empirical inner products within the framework converge to true $L^2$ inner products as data samples increase, effectively eliminating spurious spectral components. For engineers and researchers, this innovation transforms the workflow by removing the need for manual dictionary selection and post-hoc spectral filtering. By solving the spectral inclusion problem, ResKoopNet establishes a reliable, automated foundation for data-driven spectral analysis.

## Methodology

The authors propose **ResKoopNet**, a novel neural network-based framework designed to learn Koopman representations. Unlike previous methods that rely on filtering precomputed spectra or predefined dictionaries, ResKoopNet explicitly minimizes spectral residuals to compute Koopman eigenpairs. This shift from filtering to direct minimization allows for a more accurate and theoretically grounded discovery of the system's underlying dynamics.
