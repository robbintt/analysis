## Executive Summary

Current evaluation methods for the corruption robustness of machine learning classifiers are hampered by a lack of standardization, relying on arbitrary noise levels that fail to scale with dataset intricacy. This inconsistency, combined with the prevailing dogma of a necessary trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness, has driven the field toward computationally expensive adversarial training methods. However, the assumption that models must sacrifice standard performance to withstand statistical corruption remains empirically unverified due to the absence of a rigorous, dataset-specific metric for benchmarking resilience. This paper addresses these gaps by challenging the efficacy of existing evaluation protocols and re-examining the fundamental relationship between accuracy and robustness.

The authors introduce **Minimal Separation Corruption Robustness (MSCR)**, a geometric metric designed to normalize the evaluation of corruption resilience. MSCR is derived from the dataset's intrinsic geometry by calculating the minimal Euclidean distance between the centroids of the closest class pair in the feature space. This distance defines a robustness threshold, $\epsilon$, which serves as a scaling unit for test data augmentation—such as setting the standard deviation of Gaussian noise as a function of $\epsilon$. By quantifying **"avoidable loss"**—the accuracy degradation attributable specifically to corruption relative to a random classifier—MSCR provides a theoretically grounded, normalized measure. This approach allows for a direct, apples-to-apples comparison of robustness across different architectures and datasets, eliminating the ambiguity of previous arbitrary noise standards.

Experimental results on 2D synthetic and image datasets demonstrated that the MSCR metric effectively distinguishes between varying levels of classifier robustness with greater granularity than traditional accuracy measures. A critical finding was the identification of **"unexpected optima"** in robust accuracy; rather than improving linearly, performance peaked at specific intermediate training noise levels ($\sigma$), revealing a complex non-linear dependency. Contrary to the consensus on the accuracy-robustness trade-off, the study found that simple data augmentation not only maintained corruption resilience but yielded a slight improvement in overall clean accuracy. This indicates that the two objectives are not mutually exclusive and can be simultaneously optimized through properly tuned, computationally efficient training regimes.

This research significantly impacts the field by providing a rigorous, standardized tool for benchmarking corruption robustness, addressing the long-standing issue of inconsistent evaluation criteria. The introduction of the MSCR metric offers a precise method for quantifying "avoidable loss," enabling researchers to validly compare performance across diverse datasets. Practically, the findings suggest that the industry's reliance on complex adversarial regularization may be unnecessary for many applications; effective robustness can be achieved through simple data augmentation without clean accuracy penalties. By debunking the myth of an inherent trade-off, the authors pave the way for more efficient and effective model training methodologies.
