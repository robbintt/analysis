## 📝 Executive Summary

Mathematics research demands rigorous logical deduction and the ability to perceive complex, high-dimensional patterns. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a surprising aptitude for identifying intricate structures that human researchers might miss, they fundamentally lack native logical reasoning capabilities. This creates a critical barrier to their adoption in the field: relying solely on probabilistic generative models risks introducing hallucinations and errors into work requiring absolute certainty. This paper addresses the challenge of integrating the intuitive pattern-matching strengths of generative AI into the exacting workflow of mathematics without compromising the integrity of the results.

The study proposes a **Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Architecture** that redefines generative AI as a "cognitive prosthesis" rather than a standalone logical engine. Technically, this approach decouples the creative and logical components of research. The Generative AI Core is utilized strictly for its strengths in pattern recognition and interactivity to manage high-level structures and conjecture formulation. These probabilistic outputs are then rigorously validated by an External Verification & Execution Layer, which integrates deterministic tools such as Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) and formal proof assistants like Lean. This architecture allows the system to automate laborious technical tasks—such as code generation, debugging, and verification—while ensuring that all mathematical claims withstand formal scrutiny.

The research demonstrates that this integrated approach successfully identified complex mathematical patterns in higher-dimensional spaces that were imperceptible to human researchers. The system effectively functioned as an automated research assistant, handling code generation, debugging, and example verification with high reliability. Furthermore, the framework showed the capacity to generate novel mathematical conjectures. The study highlights that maximum effectiveness was achieved exclusively through the integration of neuro-symbolic components, whereas standalone generative AI models failed when applied to rigorous mathematical tasks. While the paper establishes these qualitative capabilities, specific quantitative metrics or performance benchmarks were not provided in the source text.

This work establishes a significant paradigm shift in how AI is applied to formal sciences, moving away from viewing AI as an autonomous solver toward viewing it as a specialized assistant for spotting patterns and managing technical drudgery. By providing a strategic roadmap for merging the probabilistic strengths of LLMs with the deterministic precision of formal proof assistants, the paper offers a viable path toward accelerating mathematical discovery. This influence extends beyond mathematics, offering a blueprint for hybrid AI systems in any technical domain that requires both high-level intuitive reasoning and strict logical verification.
