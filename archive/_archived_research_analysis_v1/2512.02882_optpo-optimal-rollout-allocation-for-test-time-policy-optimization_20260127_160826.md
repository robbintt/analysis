## 🚀 Executive Summary

Test-time policy optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical challenge in computational inefficiency. As models increasingly rely on generating multiple candidate solutions (rollouts) to solve complex reasoning tasks, the volume of required computation often scales prohibitively. Standard approaches typically employ fixed computation budgets, which waste resources on redundant or low-quality generations. This paper addresses the need for a dynamic allocation mechanism that maximizes reasoning accuracy while minimizing token expenditure and latency, arguing that efficient inference is as critical as model capability for resource-constrained deployments.

The core innovation, **OptPO**, introduces a framework that optimizes rollout allocation through a distinct separation of inference and training phases. During inference, the method employs a Bayesian Early Stopping mechanism (specifically BSPRT) to halt generation as soon as the algorithm achieves sufficient statistical confidence in a solution. This process is governed by a robustness constraint that weighs consensus among solutions and penalizes uncertainty, filtering out unstable generations early. To support this efficiency, the training phase utilizes a hybrid regimen combining Reinforcement Learning (using PPO and GRPO) with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This training strategy explicitly teaches the model to generate outputs that facilitate early stopping, ensuring that the drive for computational economy does not compromise the quality of the reasoning.

Experimental evaluations on challenging benchmarks—**MATH-500**, **AIME 2024**, and **GPQA Diamond**—using models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that OptPO successfully decouples performance from computational cost. The method achieved substantial token savings of approximately **51%** on GPQA Diamond and **20%** on MATH-500 while maintaining competitive performance metrics (mean@16 of 43.6). Furthermore, OptPO enhanced raw reasoning capabilities, boosting the AIME 2024 mean@16 score from 3.8 to 6.2. When compared to baselines like TTRL, OptPO not only converged faster on MATH-500—reaching ~80% accuracy for Qwen2.5-7B—but did so while consuming fewer compute resources.

This research significantly advances the field of efficient inference by validating that intelligent, dynamic allocation of test-time compute is more effective than simply increasing the budget. By proving that Bayesian-driven rollout allocation can drastically reduce token costs without sacrificing—and often improving—accuracy, OptPO establishes a viable path for deploying high-performance reasoning models in production environments. The findings suggest that future advancements in LLM capabilities will depend heavily on optimizing *how* computation is spent, rather than solely on increasing model size or compute volume.
