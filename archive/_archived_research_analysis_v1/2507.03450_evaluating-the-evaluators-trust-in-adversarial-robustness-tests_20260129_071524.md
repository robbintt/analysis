## 📝 Executive Summary

> This research addresses the critical lack of reliability and reproducibility in evaluating gradient-based adversarial evasion attacks, the standard method for verifying machine learning robustness. The authors identify that current assessment protocols are fundamentally flawed, suffering from mismatched model architectures, unverified code implementations, and uneven computational budgets across different libraries (e.g., Foolbox, ART, Torchattacks). These methodological inconsistencies introduce significant bias into the evaluation process, leading to misleading robustness claims. Consequently, the field faces a false sense of security, as models deemed "robust" under weak or inconsistent testing protocols may actually be vulnerable to optimized threats.
>
> To resolve these issues, the authors introduce **AttackBench**, a benchmark framework designed to enforce standardized, reproducible testing conditions for gradient-based attacks. The framework’s core technical innovation is the introduction of the "optimality gap," a novel metric that objectively ranks attack implementations. This metric quantifies the quality of a perturbation relative to the computational resources expended, measuring the distance between the found adversarial example and the theoretical optimal perturbation. By strictly controlling for variables such as model matching and computational budgets, AttackBench isolates the effectiveness of the attack logic itself. This allows researchers to distinguish between a model that is truly robust and one that appears robust only because the attack evaluation was suboptimal.

> The study provides quantitative evidence that current evaluations are unreliable, measuring the magnitude of the optimality gap across widely used attacks. The results demonstrate significant performance disparities between poorly tuned and correctly tuned attacks. For instance, the authors show that standard testing practices often fail to accurately assess attack effectiveness; the use of sub-optimal attacks can inflate robustness accuracy claims by substantial margins—sometimes exceeding **30-40%**—when compared to the rigorous baselines established by AttackBench. Furthermore, the framework successfully differentiates between implementations of popular attacks like PGD and AutoAttack, revealing that many default configurations in existing libraries yield non-zero optimality gaps, thereby failing to find the strongest possible adversarial examples within a given budget. The significance of this work lies in its potential to standardize robustness verification within the adversarial machine learning community.
