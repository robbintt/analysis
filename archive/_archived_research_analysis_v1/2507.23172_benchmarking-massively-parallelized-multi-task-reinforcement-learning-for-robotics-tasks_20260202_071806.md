## 📝 Executive Summary

Prior research in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) has been constrained by a reliance on off-policy algorithms, such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), which operate efficiently in low-parallelization environments but neglect the potential of on-policy methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). This limitation matters because on-policy algorithms possess higher theoretical asymptotic performance but are traditionally considered too data-inefficient for practical use in complex robotics domains.

To address this, the authors introduce **MTBench**, a benchmark framework built on NVIDIA’s IsaacGym simulator that utilizes the Tensor API to enable end-to-end GPU training. Technically, the system formulates MTRL as a finite-horizon, discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) where a universal state space is augmented with task embeddings. MTBench deploys massive parallelism, maintaining physics states for over 1,000 simultaneous environments on the GPU to eliminate CPU-GPU transfer overhead. The benchmark incorporates a heterogeneous suite of 70 tasks—spanning 50 manipulation tasks using a Franka Emika Panda arm and 20 locomotion tasks using a Unitree Go1 quadruped—and integrates 4 base RL algorithms with 7 state-of-the-art MTRL architectures within a unified, open-sourced evaluation pipeline.

The study demonstrates that on-policy algorithms effectively harness massive data throughput to reach performance saturation points that off-policy methods fail to achieve under similar conditions. Conversely, off-policy algorithms exhibited instability and reduced sample efficiency due to unbalanced replay ratios in this high-throughput regime. In terms of computational efficiency, MTBench reduced experiment duration from weeks to minutes or hours on a single GPU. Performance was measured via Success Rate and Cumulative Reward on Meta-World manipulation benchmarks (MT10, MT50) and Progress distance on Parkour locomotion tasks across 200 terrain variants.

By providing a standardized, high-performance platform, MTBench bridges a significant algorithmic gap in MTRL research, validating that on-policy methods are not only viable but superior when paired with massive parallelism.
