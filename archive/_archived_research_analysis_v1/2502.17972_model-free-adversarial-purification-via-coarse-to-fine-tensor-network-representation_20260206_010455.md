## Executive Summary

Adversarial attacks pose a critical threat to the reliability of deep learning models, introducing imperceptible perturbations that can drastically alter model outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial training or generative model-based purification, often suffer from limited generalization; they typically rely on pre-trained models, dataset-specific knowledge, or assumptions about noise distributions (e.g., Gaussian) that do not hold for the complex, unknown distributions of sophisticated adversarial threats. This paper addresses the need for a robust, model-free defense mechanism that can generalize across diverse attack types and norms without requiring task-specific tailoring or reliance on pre-trained generative frameworks.

The authors introduce Tensor Network Purification (TNP), a model-free framework that reframes adversarial defense as a signal reconstruction problem using Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). The key innovation lies in moving beyond classical tensor decomposition—which assumes low-rank representations and Gaussian noise—to accommodate the non-Gaussian, complex distributions inherent to adversarial examples. TNP employs a coarse-to-fine strategy that combines progressive downsampling with a novel adversarial optimization objective. This objective is uniquely designed to reconstruct the underlying clean image by projecting the adversarial input onto a low-dimensional clean image manifold, thereby minimizing reconstruction error while ensuring that malicious perturbations are not restored during the process.

Extensive validation on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet) demonstrates the method's effectiveness against strong attacks like PGD, AutoAttack, and CW-$L_2$. TNP achieved robust accuracy of 45–55% on CIFAR-10 and 20–30% on ImageNet, while maintaining high clean accuracy (>85% on CIFAR-10) and superior reconstruction quality (PSNR > 30dB). The coarse-to-fine strategy also yielded significant computational gains, reducing purification time by approximately 50% compared to full-resolution optimization and operating orders of magnitude faster than diffusion-based purification methods (milliseconds/seconds versus minutes).

This work significantly advances the field of adversarial robustness by introducing a versatile, model-free defense that overcomes the generalization limitations of previous generative approaches. By successfully relaxing classical decomposition assumptions and eliminating the dependency on pre-trained models, TNP offers a universally applicable solution for securing computer vision systems. The method's ability to maintain high clean accuracy while efficiently mitigating diverse norm threats establishes it as a promising and scalable alternative to heavier reliance on generative models, potentially influencing future research toward optimization-based, assumption-light defense strategies.

## Key Findings

*   **Effective Generalization:** The proposed Tensor Network Purification (TNP) method demonstrates robust generalization across diverse adversarial scenarios, including various norm threats, attack types, and tasks, without task-specific tailoring.
*   **Superior Reconstruction Capability:** TNP successfully reconstructs unobserved clean examples from adversarial inputs, minimizing reconstruction error while avoiding the restoration of adversarial perturbations.
*   **Model-Free Robustness:** TNP achieves strong robustness without relying on pre-trained generative models or specific dataset knowledge, functioning effectively as a model-free approach.

## Methodology

The methodology centers on Tensor Network Purification (TNP), a model-free framework utilizing a specially designed tensor network decomposition algorithm. It moves beyond classical decomposition techniques (which rely on Gaussian-noise assumptions and low-rank representations) to accommodate the unknown and complex distributions typical of adversarial perturbations.

TNP employs a coarse-to-fine strategy with progressive downsampling and introduces a novel adversarial optimization objective specifically designed to reconstruct the underlying clean image from the adversarial example. This ensures that reconstruction error minimization does not result in the restoration of malicious perturbations.

## Technical Details

*   **Framework:** TNP treats adversarial defense as a signal reconstruction problem.
*   **Representation:** Utilizes Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS), to project adversarial images onto a low-dimensional clean image manifold.
*   **Pre-training:** Not required; it is a purely optimization-based approach.
*   **Architecture Strategy:** Coarse-to-Fine approach:
    1.  **Coarse Stage:** The image is divided into patches where a local tensor network reconstructs a coarse version to remove global high-frequency noise.
    2.  **Fine Stage:** The coarse version is upsampled, and a global tensor network refines the details.
*   **Optimization Process:** Minimizes the reconstruction error between the adversarial input and the MPS representation.
*   **Algorithms:** Typically uses alternating least squares or gradient descent with orthogonality constraints.
