## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
Current embodied agents face significant limitations in answering complex, multi-stage questions within dynamic environments. Traditional approaches often rely on static, single-step generation or require computationally prohibitive Large Foundation Models (LFMs). These one-step methods lack the iterative reasoning capacity necessary to decompose intricate queries into actionable sub-tasks, leading to failures when visual contexts change over time. Additionally, the high resource consumption of LFMs creates a barrier to real-time, practical deployment.

### **Innovation**
The authors propose a sequential planning framework grounded in a structured semantic space, utilizing a hybrid neuro-symbolic approach that decouples reasoning from massive model dependency. Technically, the system employs a visual hierarchical scene graph to parse user intent and decomposes tasks using external rules rather than relying solely on neural generation. The core innovation is a closed-loop mechanism where visual perception interacts iteratively with question semantics, allowing the agent to refine action strategies dynamically based on real-time environmental feedback.

### **Results**
The study verifies technical efficacy through real-world scenario testing, specifically demonstrating stability in handling complex queries where traditional one-step models typically fail. While specific numerical benchmarks were not provided, the framework qualitatively proved capable of handling sequential actions through iterative feedback loops. To address the lack of standardized test cases, the authors released a specialized dataset for Embodied Complex-Question Answering (ECQA).

### **Impact**
This research validates that structured semantic interactions and external rules can reduce reliance on large foundational models without sacrificing reasoning performance. By proving that a closed-loop, neuro-symbolic approach can handle complex tasks in dynamic settings, the authors outline a path toward more resource-efficient and adaptable embodied AI systems. The release of the ECQA dataset ensures future rigorous comparisons.

## Methodology

The authors propose a sequential, multi-step planning framework distinct from traditional one-step methods. The framework is centered around a **structured semantic space** where hierarchical visual perception interacts iteratively with the question's semantics.

The operational pipeline consists of three main stages:

1.  **Intent Parsing:** Parsing human natural language using a visual hierarchical scene graph to clarify user intent.
2.  **Rule-Based Planning:** Planning steps by incorporating external rules to reduce dependence on large foundational models.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Iterating plans based on visual feedback from the environment until the final answer is obtained.
