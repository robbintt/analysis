## 📋 Executive Summary

> **Current Limitations:** Existing Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) primarily rely on cascaded "Audio-to-Text-to-Audio" architectures. This dependency on intermediate text introduces latency, error accumulation, and a significant loss of paralinguistic expressiveness (e.g., emotion and intonation). Furthermore, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating models across the full spectrum of audio scenarios.
>
> **Core Innovation:** This research introduces **Step-Audio-AQAA**, a fully end-to-end model operating on an "Audio Query-Audio Answer" (AQAA) paradigm that bypasses text dependency entirely. The architecture utilizes a 130-billion-parameter backbone LLM (Step-Omni) extended with 5,120 audio tokens derived from a novel dual-codebook tokenizer. This tokenizer processes audio via two parallel streams: a Linguistic stream for phonetic content and a Semantic stream for prosodic information. A token-based neural vocoder is identified as a critical component for high-fidelity speech synthesis.
>
> **Performance & Impact:** Step-Audio-AQAA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the newly introduced **StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark**, outperforming existing LALMs with particular strength in speech control tasks. The dual-codebook approach significantly reduced next-token prediction perplexity, while the end-to-end architecture mitigated error accumulation common in cascaded models. The application of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and weight merging measurably improved semantic coherence. This work sets a new precedent for integrating high-capacity LLMs with sophisticated audio tokenization, paving the way for voice agents capable of human-level expressiveness.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

The Step-Audio-AQAA model utilizes a fully end-to-end Audio Query-Audio Answer paradigm. Its architecture is composed of three distinct stages:

### 1. Dual-Codebook Audio Tokenizer
The tokenizer extracts features via two parallel streams to capture both linguistic content and semantic nuance.

| Stream | Frequency | Vocabulary Size | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linguistic** | 16.7 Hz | 1,024 tokens | Captures phonetic content |
| **Semantic** | 25 Hz | 4,096 tokens | Captures prosodic/emotional information |
| **Interleaving** | **2:3 Ratio** | | Mixes linguistic and semantic tokens |

### 2. Backbone LLM
*   **Model:** Step-Omni
*   **Parameters:** 130 Billion
*   **Vocabulary Extension:** Extended by 5,120 audio tokens to generate interleaved text and audio.

### 3. Neural Vocoder
*   Converts processed features back into high-fidelity speech waveforms.

### Training Pipeline
The training process follows a rigorous multi-stage approach:
1.  **3-Stage Pre-training:**
    *   Modality Mixing
    *   Interleaved Training
    *   Task-Specific Training
2.  **Post-Training:**
    *   Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
    *   Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
    *   Weight Merging

## 🧩 Methodology

The research methodology focuses on creating a seamless audio interaction loop:

*   **Dual-Codebook Strategy:** Simultaneous extraction of linguistic and semantic features allows the model to understand not just *what* is being said, but *how* it is being said.
*   **Interleaved Token-Output:** The model generates text and audio tokens in an interleaved fashion, allowing for dynamic responses.
*   **Optimization Techniques:** The use of DPO aligns the model outputs with human preferences, while model merging stabilizes and enhances the final performance.
