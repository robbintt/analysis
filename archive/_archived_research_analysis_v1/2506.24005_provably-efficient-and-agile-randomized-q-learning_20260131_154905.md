## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental challenge of achieving efficient exploration in model-free reinforcement learning, specifically within episodic tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The field has historically struggled with a dichotomy: exploration strategies based on Bayesian principles (like posterior sampling) show empirical promise but lack rigorous theoretical justifications in model-free settings, while existing provably efficient algorithms often rely on "stage-wise" updates. These stage-wise approaches introduce computational bottlenecks and slow responsiveness, as they require the algorithm to wait for specific time horizons to elapse before updating policies, rendering them less agile for dynamic applications.

The paper introduces **RandomizedQ**, a novel Q-learning variant that effectively bridges the gap between sampling-based exploration and computational tractability. Technically, the algorithm implements a Bayesian-inspired exploration strategy through the use of randomized learning rates. By sampling these rates from a distribution derived from visitation counts—essentially acting as an "inverse-Beta process"—RandomizedQ injects uncertainty into the value updates that mimics the statistical behavior of posterior sampling. Crucially, RandomizedQ departs from prior theoretical methods by employing "agile" step-wise policy updates. Instead of updating policies at the end of long, static stages, this approach updates the policy after every single step, significantly accelerating the learning process while maintaining the theoretical rigor necessary for provable guarantees.

The authors provide robust theoretical and empirical results demonstrating RandomizedQ's superiority. The algorithm achieves a gap-independent regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^5SAT})$. More significantly, under the mild condition that the sub-optimality gap is bounded away from zero (i.e., $\Delta_{\min} > 0$), RandomizedQ attains a gap-dependent logarithmic regret bound. This marks the first instance of a model-free, sampling-based algorithm achieving logarithmic regret. Empirically, RandomizedQ demonstrates superior performance on standard benchmarks compared to both "bonus-based" and Bayesian peers, validating its efficiency. This work significantly advances the state of the art by resolving the trade-off between theoretical provability and computational responsiveness in reinforcement learning.

*   **Logarithmic Regret:** Under the mild condition of positive sub-optimality of the optimal Q-function ($\Delta_{\min} > 0$), the algorithm attains a **logarithmic regret bound**, a significant theoretical milestone.
*   **Agile Performance:** The method demonstrates agility by combining sampling-based exploration with step-wise policy updates, avoiding computational bottlenecks and slow response times associated with stage-wise updates.
*   **Empirical Superiority:** RandomizedQ shows superior performance compared to existing Q-learning variants utilizing bonus-based or Bayesian exploration strategies.
