> ### 💡 Executive Summary
>
> This research addresses the critical limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate API calls within knowledge-intensive domains, such as meteorology. Standard LLMs often struggle with complex terminology and entity recognition, leading to hallucinations and incorrect parameter mapping. Existing solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using unstructured data fail to capture complex semantic relationships, while fine-tuning models is computationally expensive and lacks adaptability. This reliability gap restricts the deployment of autonomous agents in technical fields where precision is paramount.
>
> The authors introduce **KG2data**, a hybrid system architecture that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs), LLMs, ReAct agents, and tool-use technologies. The core innovation lies in using a Knowledge Graph as "persistent memory" to store structured domain-specific context and entity relationships. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely on unstructured vector search, KG2data employs a structured, entity-driven approach to map natural language queries to precise API parameters.
>
> In a comparative evaluation, KG2data demonstrated substantial performance gains, achieving an API call correctness rate of **88.57%** and completely eliminating hallucinations (**0%** failure rate). This work presents a significant architectural advancement for intelligent, knowledge-based question answering, offering a robust blueprint for deploying reliable LLM-driven agents in high-knowledge-demand sectors.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Accuracy:** KG2data achieved an **88.57%** API call correctness rate compared to 72.14% for RAG2data and 71.43% for chat2data.
*   **Elimination of Hallucinations:** The system achieved a **0%** hallucination failure rate, compared to 10% for RAG2data and 8.57% for chat2data.
*   **Improved Recognition:** KG2data demonstrated a name recognition failure rate of only **1.43%**, outperforming RAG2data (16%) and chat2data (7.14%).
*   **Handling Complexity:** The system effectively addresses limitations of standard LLMs in knowledge-intensive domains by successfully handling complex or terminology-rich queries.

## Methodology

The research employs a structured approach to augment LLM capabilities:

*   **System Architecture:** The authors developed **KG2data**, a hybrid system integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ReAct agents, and tool-use technologies.
*   **Knowledge Integration:** The methodology utilizes a Knowledge Graph as **'persistent memory'** to store and retrieve domain-specific context (meteorological data) rather than relying solely on the LLM's internal weights.
*   **Evaluation Framework:** The system was assessed using a virtual API environment, measuring performance across three distinct failure modes: name recognition failure, hallucination failure, and call correctness.

## Technical Details

The paper proposes KG2data, a system designed to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance specifically for generating API calls.

*   **Core Mechanism:** It utilizes a Knowledge Graph (KG) as its primary knowledge base mechanism, employing a structured, entity-relationship driven approach rather than unstructured vector search.
*   **Functionality:** The system maps natural language queries to precise API parameters, targeting 'knowledge-intensive domains' with complex terminology.
*   **Benchmarking:** It is benchmarked against two specific baselines:
    *   **RAG2data:** Utilizes unstructured retrieval methods.
    *   **chat2data:** Utilizes standard LLM prompting without external structured knowledge.

## Contributions

*   **Enhanced Reasoning and Retrieval:** Improves content retrieval, semantic relationship resolution, and domain-specific reasoning for effective integration of heterogeneous data.
*   **Cost and Adaptability Efficiency:** Mitigates the high computational costs of fine-tuning LLMs and offers adaptability to changing domain knowledge and API structures without retraining.
*   **Domain-Specific Solution:** Provides a novel architectural solution for intelligent, knowledge-based question answering and data analysis, specifically tailored for high-knowledge-demand fields like meteorology.
