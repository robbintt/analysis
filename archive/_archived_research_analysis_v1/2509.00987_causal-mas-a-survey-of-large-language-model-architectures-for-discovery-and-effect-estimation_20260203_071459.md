## 📋 Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental inability of single Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reliable causal inference. While LLMs excel at pattern matching, they struggle with complex causal tasks—such as discovery and effect estimation—due to tendencies toward hallucination and reliance on spurious correlations rather than true cause-and-effect mechanisms. This limitation is a critical bottleneck for high-stakes fields requiring rigorous reasoning, including scientific discovery, healthcare decision-making, and automated fact-checking, where understanding *why* something happens is as important as predicting *what* happens next.

The core innovation presented is the paradigm shift from monolithic LLMs to Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which offer superior performance in causal domains. The authors provide a technical taxonomy categorizing "Causal Multi-Agent LLMs" into three distinct architectural paradigms: (1) Causal Reasoning and Counterfactuals, utilizing specialized agents like "Faithful Reasoners" and "Causal Evaluators" (e.g., LoCal, CaCo-CoT); (2) Multi-Agent Causal Discovery, employing interaction protocols such as adversarial debates (e.g., MAC) and embodied simulations (e.g., ADAM in Minecraft) to construct causal graphs; and (3) Agentic Causal Estimation, which uses orchestrator agents to integrate external algorithmic tools, such as Double Machine Learning (DML) or Propensity Score Matching (PSM), as seen in systems like Causal-Copilot and TrialGenie.

The survey synthesizes evaluation metrics across these diverse architectures, revealing task-specific performance benchmarks. For Causal Discovery, efficacy is measured via graph reconstruction accuracy using Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), Normalized Hamming Distance (NHD), Precision, Recall, and F1-scores. In Causal Reasoning, systems like LoCal are evaluated on benchmarks such as HOVER and FEVEROUS using Accuracy and F1-scores, while social reasoning agents utilize Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) metrics. For Causal Effect Estimation, results are grounded in clinical and statistical validity; for instance, TrialGenie is assessed by comparing Average Treatment Effects (ATEs) and Hazard Ratios against ground truth. Evaluation methodologies increasingly combine human oversight with LLM-as-a-Judge protocols.

This work is significant as it provides the first comprehensive structural overview of the intersection between Causal AI and LLM-based agents. By aggregating evaluation methodologies and delineating architectural patterns, the paper establishes a framework for standardizing assessment in a rapidly evolving field. The findings highlight the broad utility of causal MAS across domains, suggesting that multi-agent architectures are poised to become the standard for robust, explainable AI in scientific and medical applications, while simultaneously identifying open challenges regarding robustness and standardization that must be addressed to enable future adoption.
