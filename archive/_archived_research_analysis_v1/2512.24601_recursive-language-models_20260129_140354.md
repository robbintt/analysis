## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the fundamental limitation of fixed context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs), which restricts the amount of input data a model can process in a single pass. While existing solutions like retrieval-augmented generation or architectural variants exist, they often involve trade-offs in accuracy, cost, or complexity.

The core innovation presented is the **Recursive Language Model (RLM)**, a general inference strategy that uses **inference-time scaling** rather than architectural modifications. RLMs treat long prompts as an "external environment" and use **Programmatic Processing**, where the LLM actively examines and decomposes the input. The central mechanism is **Recursive Execution**: the LLM identifies and calls itself on smaller snippets to extract relevant information before synthesizing a final answer.

Empirical findings demonstrate that RLMs can process input lengths up to **100 times greater** than the native context windows of base models. Benchmarks indicate this recursive approach outperforms standard base LLMs and common scaffolding techniques across diverse tasks. Performance improvements were observed on both extreme-length prompts and shorter inputs, suggesting the method enhances general reasoning capabilities. These gains are achieved without financial penalty, with RLMs maintaining comparable or cheaper costs per query than traditional methods.

The introduction of Recursive Language Models marks a significant paradigm shift in overcoming the context window bottleneck, offering a scalable alternative to hardware-heavy solutions. By decoupling input length from architectural constraints, this work enables LLMs to be deployed in complex, data-intensive environments where previous models were infeasible.

## 🧠 Methodology

The research approach prioritizes inference strategies over architectural changes. The core methodology consists of the following components:

*   **Inference-Time Scaling:** The model increases its capability during the inference phase rather than requiring structural changes to the underlying neural network.
*   **External Environment Treatment:** Long prompts are treated as an 'external environment' that the model interacts with, rather than a static input vector.
*   **Programmatic Processing:** The LLM actively examines and decomposes the prompt programmatically to understand the data structure.
*   **Recursive Execution:** The core strategy involves the LLM calling itself on smaller snippets of the input to manage the workload sequentially before synthesizing a final answer.
