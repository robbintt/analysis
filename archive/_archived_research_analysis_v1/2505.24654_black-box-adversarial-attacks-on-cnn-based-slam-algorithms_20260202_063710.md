## 📄 Executive Summary

> **Abstract Analysis**
>
> As CNN-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms become integral to the operation of autonomous agents, their security against adversarial interference remains a critical concern. This paper addresses the vulnerability of CNN-based feature detectors within SLAM systems to black-box adversarial attacks. This matters because a failure in tracking or mapping can lead to catastrophic navigation errors in safety-critical environments.
>
> Unlike white-box attacks that require full knowledge of the target model, this study focuses on realistic threat scenarios where an attacker only has access to the system's inputs and outputs. The study introduces an **architecture-agnostic, black-box attack methodology** capable of generating transferable adversarial perturbations for both RGB and Depth modalities. To overcome the lack of access to the target model's gradients, the approach employs substitute networks—such as MobileNetV2, DenseNet, and InceptionResNetV2—to approximate gradients and generate perturbations.
>
> A core technical innovation is the use of a **targeted attack strategy with randomized labels**; by assigning distinct target labels to each input frame, the method introduces diverse noise patterns that effectively degrade feature detection. The attack specifically exploits vulnerabilities in the SLAM back-end (e.g., ORB-SLAM2) by disrupting the matching process between current frames and previously established 3D map points.
>
> Empirical validation on the TUM dataset using GCN-SLAM reveals high susceptibility to these attacks. Black-box perturbations on RGB inputs caused tracking failure in up to **76% of frames**. Compared to untargeted attacks, targeted RGB attacks increased Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by **30%** even at low perturbation magnitudes ($\epsilon=0.005$). Attacks on depth inputs were even more severe, resulting in a **0% success rate** for single-frame pose estimation.
>
> This research bridges a significant gap in the literature by providing the first comprehensive comparative assessment of black-box adversarial vulnerabilities across RGB and Depth input modalities in SLAM. The findings underscore a severe security challenge: standard SLAM back-ends are highly sensitive to subtle input perturbations, posing substantial risks for the deployment of autonomous agents in untrusted environments.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Attack Strategy
*   **Randomized Labels:** The approach uses a targeted strategy where distinct target labels are selected for each input frame. This introduces diverse noise, enhancing effectiveness against feature detectors.

### Exploit Mechanism
*   **Matching Disruption:** The method exploits the vulnerability of the SLAM back-end (specifically the matching process in systems like ORB-SLAM2).
*   **Depth Vulnerability:** By disrupting the matching process between current frames and previous 3D points, the attack severs the link necessary for accurate localization.

### Architecture and Transferability
*   **Architecture-Agnostic:** The method is not dependent on the specific internal architecture of the target SLAM system.
*   **Substitute Networks:** To generate gradients without access to the target model, the system employs substitute networks including:
    *   MobileNetV2
    *   DenseNet
    *   InceptionResNetV2
