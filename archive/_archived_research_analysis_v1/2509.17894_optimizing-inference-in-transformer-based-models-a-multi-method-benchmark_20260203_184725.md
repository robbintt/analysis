## 24 Executive Summary

> The deployment of state-of-the-art generative models, specifically Transformer-based architectures like the Fast Diffusion Transformer (fast-DiT), is severely constrained by high inference costs. As model complexity scales to improve generative accuracy, computational demands, latency, and memory requirements increase proportionally, creating a barrier to deploying high-capacity models in resource-constrained environments. This paper addresses the critical efficiency-accuracy trade-off, seeking methods to reduce the resource footprint of diffusion models without compromising their generative quality.

The key innovation of this work is a comprehensive multi-method benchmark framework applied to the fast-DiT architecture. Rather than proposing a single new algorithm, the authors systematically evaluate and compare three distinct categories of optimization strategies:

*   **Structural optimization** (pruning and simplified attention mechanisms)
*   **Standard compression techniques** (quantization and knowledge distillation)
*   **Architectural innovation** (specifically the Mixture of Experts approach)

This methodology allows for a direct technical comparison of how these diverse methods reduce computational overhead relative to the preservation of model performance.

The study provides a detailed quantitative analysis, validating that standard compression techniques are highly effective. Specifically, the results demonstrate that quantization can reduce memory footprints by approximately **50%** and accelerate inference by up to **1.8x** while maintaining FID scores within a negligible margin (e.g., <0.5 increase) of the baseline. Similarly, pruning strategies were shown to achieve a **30–40% reduction in FLOPs** with minimal degradation in visual fidelity. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach offered the most significant gains in throughput, demonstrating over **2x improvement** in processing speed compared to the dense fast-DiT baseline, successfully mitigating computational burdens without negatively impacting output quality.

This research provides a vital technical reference point for the field of generative AI by offering empirical, quantitative insights into the optimization of diffusion transformers. By validating the efficacy of MoE and standard compression techniques within a unified benchmark, the paper guides practitioners in selecting appropriate strategies for reducing the resource footprint of high-capacity models. This work establishes a foundation for future efficiency improvements, facilitating the broader adoption of advanced generative models in real-world, resource-constrained applications.
