## Executive Summary

This research addresses the inherent complexity and manual effort required in interactive deductive verification, specifically targeting the verification of Java programs using the **KeY prover**. While formal verification offers the highest assurance of software correctness, the process of discharging proof obligations often involves intricate, user-guided reasoning that presents a significant bottleneck to widespread adoption.

The paper investigates how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be leveraged to automate portions of this workflow, reducing the cognitive load on verification engineers. The core innovation is a robust integration strategy that connects the KeY verification system with state-of-the-art LLMs, transforming the prover into an LLM-guided automated system.

The authors propose a workflow that translates KeY's internal proof state (represented as sequents in calculus) into structured natural language prompts. This prompts the LLM to suggest the most relevant proof steps or tactics, which are then parsed and applied back into the verification environment. This "Verification Workflow" creates a feedback loop where the LLM acts as a heuristic search guide, capable of proposing valid proof steps that traditional automatic strategies might miss, without modifying the underlying trusted verification kernel.

Experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-integrated approach can successfully automate a significant percentage of proof obligations that typically require human intervention. The study shows measurable improvements in the rate of automatically discharged lemmas compared to standard KeY heuristics, while maintaining a high validity rate for the generated proof steps. This work establishes a practical paradigm for AI-assisted formal verification, suggesting a future where manual proof effort is substantially minimized.
