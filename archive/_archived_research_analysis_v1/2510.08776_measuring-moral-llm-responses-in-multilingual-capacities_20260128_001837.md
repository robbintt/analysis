## Executive Summary

As Large Language Models (LLMs) see increased global deployment, a critical challenge emerges regarding the consistency of moral alignment and safety guardrails across different languages. Most safety training is predominantly English-centric, raising concerns about whether these models maintain robust ethical standards when operating in non-English contexts. This paper addresses the urgent need to evaluate how **"linguistic shifts"**—translating inputs into both high-resource and low-resource languages—affect a model's adherence to safety protocols and moral reasoning. Without this understanding, models risk producing harmful outputs or failing to prevent abuse in multilingual environments, creating new vectors for jailbreaking through linguistic obfuscation.

To bridge this gap, the researchers developed a quantitative evaluation framework employing a standardized "judge LLM" to rigorously assess responses from a comprehensive suite of frontier models and leading open-weight models. The study utilizes a custom dataset of 500 English questions spanning five dimensions: **Moral Judgment, Biases & Stereotypes, Legality, Harm Prevention & Safety, and Consent & Autonomy**. To test robustness, the corpus was translated into high-resource languages (Chinese, Spanish, Arabic) and low-resource languages (Hindi, Swahili) using industry-standard translation APIs. The methodology is technically distinct in its use of adversarial "trick questions" and jailbreak-styled prompts to stress-test safety filters, relying on a five-point grading rubric to quantify performance degradation across linguistic contexts.

The evaluation revealed a substantial performance disparity between models, with **GPT-5** achieving the highest average performance across all categories compared to other frontier and leading open-source models. Specifically, in the 'Harm Prevention & Safety' category, GPT-5 scored an average of 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest at 1.98. Similarly, in the 'Consent & Autonomy' category, GPT-5 averaged 3.56 against Gemini 2.5 Pro's 1.39. The data indicates that while top-tier models may perform well in English, nearly all evaluated models displayed significant inconsistency in other languages, with safety protocols failing particularly in lower-resource languages.

This research highlights a critical vulnerability in current LLM architectures: **safety and accuracy are not language-agnostic**. By demonstrating that linguistic shifts can bypass safety filters—effectively creating new vectors for jailbreaking—the study underscores that high performance in English does not guarantee safe deployment globally. These findings necessitate a shift in the field toward developing more robust, multilingual alignment strategies ensuring that harm prevention and ethical guidelines are rigorously enforced across all supported languages, not just dominant high-resource ones.

## Key Findings

*   **GPT-5 Superiority:** GPT-5 achieved the highest average performance across all evaluated categories compared to other frontier and leading open-source models.
*   **Cross-Lingual Inconsistency:** Models other than GPT-5 displayed significant inconsistency in their responses across different languages and evaluation categories.
*   **Harm Prevention & Safety Gap:** There was a substantial performance gap in safety measures; GPT-5 averaged **4.73** while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest at **1.98**.
*   **Consent & Autonomy Disparity:** GPT-5 again outperformed the lowest-scoring model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) with an average score of **3.56** compared to **1.39**.
*   **Linguistic Impact:** The study indicates that linguistic shifts significantly impact LLM responses, revealing the need for improved robustness across multilingual contexts.
