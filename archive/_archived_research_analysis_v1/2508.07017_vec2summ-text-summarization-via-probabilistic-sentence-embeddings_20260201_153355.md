## Executive Summary

Current state-of-the-art abstractive summarization relies heavily on Large Language Models (LLMs), which face fundamental bottlenecks regarding context-window constraints and scalability. As the volume of document collections grows, the sequential token processing inherent to autoregressive models becomes computationally prohibitive. This research addresses this challenge by investigating a method that bypasses the need to input lengthy contexts into LLMs, exploring whether semantic compression can achieve comparable summarization results without the substantial resource overhead.

Vec2Summ introduces a paradigm shift by reframing summarization as **semantic vector compression** rather than sequential text generation. The framework represents a document collection using a mean vector within a high-dimensional embedding space, which is then enhanced via stochastic sampling to capture semantic diversity. To reconstruct the summary, the method employs an iterative embedding inversion process (specifically the *vec2text* framework) that utilizes a Hypothesizer and Corrector.

Evaluations indicate that Vec2Summ achieves thematic coverage comparable to direct LLM summarization specifically for topically focused corpora, while completely bypassing context-length constraints. However, the study highlights a critical trade-off: the method produces summaries with **less fine-grained detail** than standard LLM generation.

In terms of computational performance, the architecture offers superior parameter efficiency; its resource requirements scale with the embedding dimension $d$ (specifically $d + d^2$) rather than the size of the input text. The study further determined that modeling the semantic space as a single multivariate Gaussian provides the best balance between diversity and relevance.

## Key Findings

*   **Performance vs. Detail:** Vec2Summ achieves thematic coverage comparable to direct LLM summarization for topically focused corpora, but produces summaries with less fine-grained detail.
*   **Constraint Bypass:** It successfully bypasses context-length constraints by treating summarization as semantic compression.
*   **Scalability:** The method scales efficiently with corpus size, requiring significantly fewer resources ($O(d + d^2)$ parameters).
*   **Parameter Optimization:** A single multivariate Gaussian was identified as the superior distribution model; a temperature parameter of **$T=1.2$** was found to provide the optimal balance between diversity and relevance.

## Methodology

The study proposes **Vec2Summ**, a framework that frames abstractive summarization as semantic compression. The core process consists of three main stages:

1.  **Vector Representation:** Represents a document collection as a single mean vector in a semantic embedding space.
2.  **Generation via Inversion:** Generates the summary by decoding this vector back into natural language (embedding inversion).
3.  **Stochastic Enhancement:** Employs stochastic enhancement by sampling from a Gaussian distribution centered on the mean vector to improve reconstruction quality.

## Technical Details

Vec2Summ reframes multi-document summarization as an information-compression problem within a semantic embedding space to bypass context-window constraints. The architectural pipeline consists of four distinct steps:

1.  **Embedding Generation**
    *   Utilizes models like OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` or GTR.
2.  **Distribution Modeling**
    *   Models the semantic space as a Multivariate Gaussian Distribution.
    *   Calculates mean and covariance.
    *   Applies regularization with $\lambda=10^{-4}$ for stability.
3.  **Sampling**
    *   Samples vectors from the distribution based on a temperature parameter $T$.
    *   **Optimal Value:** $T=1.2$ (controls diversity).
4.  **Text Reconstruction**
    *   Utilizes the `vec2text` framework.
    *   **Components:** Hypothesizer and Corrector.
    *   **Process:** Iteratively refines text over 3-5 iterations.

*   **Complexity:** Claims a parameter efficiency of $O(d + d^2)$.
*   **Problem Addressed:** Explicitly tackles representation degeneration.

## Contributions

*   **Paradigm Shift:** Introduces Vec2Summ, which redefines summarization as semantic vector compression and reconstruction, diverging from standard sequence-to-sequence generation.
*   **Interpretability:** Offers a mechanism for interpretable and controllable generation via semantic parameters.
*   **Efficiency:** Provides a highly parameter-efficient architecture ($O(d + d^2)$) that addresses scalability bottlenecks and context limits of current LLM methods.
