> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Standard adversarial training via Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) is effective but computationally prohibitive, requiring expensive perturbation generation for every sample. This overhead hinders scalability, while efficient alternatives like Fast Adversarial Training (FAT) often trade robustness for speed or suffer from catastrophic overfitting.
>
> This paper establishes that **full-batch perturbation is unnecessary** for achieving robustness. The authors introduce **"Selective Adversarial Training,"** a framework that optimizes PGD by perturbing only a critical subset of samples within each mini-batch. It utilizes a **mixed objective function**, applying adversarial loss solely to the selected subset and standard classification loss to the rest. Selection is governed by two theoretically grounded strategies: **Margin-Based Sampling** (prioritizing decision boundary proximity) and **Gradient-Matching Sampling** (aligning with dominant optimization directions).
>
> Validated on MNIST and CIFAR-10, the method achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding full PGD baselines while cutting computation costs by up to **50%**. Crucially, it avoids the robustness ceilings and catastrophic overfitting seen in FreeAT and FAT. By filtering redundant samples, this work offers a viable path for deploying robust models in resource-constrained environments, shifting the paradigm from brute-force computation to intelligent data utilization.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The paper proposes **Selective Adversarial Training**, a framework designed to optimize standard PGD adversarial training. Instead of perturbing the entire batch, the framework identifies and perturbs only a subset of **'critical samples'**.

The selection process utilizes two primary strategies:
1.  **Margin-based sampling:** Prioritizes samples close to the decision boundary.
2.  **Gradient-matching sampling:** Selects samples whose gradients align with the dominant optimization direction.

Once selected, adversarial examples are generated via PGD only for this subset. The remaining samples are trained on their clean inputs using a **mixed objective function**, balancing efficiency and robustness.

## 🛠 Technical Details

### Framework Overview
The proposed framework aims to reduce the computational cost of standard Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) by applying adversarial perturbation only to a dynamically selected subset of 'critical samples' rather than the entire minibatch.

### Objective Function
The framework employs a **mixed objective function** that combines:
*   Standard classification loss (for non-selected samples).
*   Adversarial loss (for the selected subset).

### Selection Strategies

**1. Margin-Based Sample Selection**
*   **Mechanism:** Identifies samples near the decision boundary.
*   **Metric:** Uses weights inversely proportional to the logit margin magnitude.
*   **Rationale:** Samples closer to the boundary are more susceptible to adversarial attacks and require more robust training.

**2. Gradient-Matching Sample Selection**
*   **Mechanism:** Identifies samples aligned with the dominant optimization direction.
*   **Metric:** Uses cosine similarity between individual sample gradients and the average batch gradient.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures that updates are applied to samples that most influence the global optimization direction.
