## Executive Summary

Developing Artificial Intelligence for safety-critical systems creates a fundamental conflict between the rapid, iterative nature of AI research and the strict stability requirements of functional safety standards like ISO 26262 and IEC 61508. The primary engineering obstacle is **tool qualification**, a resource-intensive process where every software tool in the development chain must be validated for safety use. This paper addresses the challenge of deploying mixed-criticality systems—environments where components of varying safety integrity levels (ASILs) coexist—without incurring prohibitive costs. The authors highlight that traditional, heavyweight development workflows fail to provide the necessary isolation between safety-critical and non-safety-critical components, creating a barrier to the reliable deployment of AI in automotive and industrial automation contexts.

The authors propose a **"Safe-AI" workflow** defined by a "qualifiable" architecture, which prioritizes transparency, completeness, flexibility, and lightweight design. The core technical innovation is the strategic restriction of the toolchain to a **minimal set of essential tools**, thereby reducing the scope of resources that require rigorous qualification. To bridge the gap between model generation and runtime, the workflow utilizes an **extended ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) model description**. This mechanism functions as a continuous validation loop, embedding necessary metadata to maintain traceability and ensuring the model executed at runtime is identical to the model validated during development. This extended ONNX description acts as the technical contract that enables rigorous validation across the entire AI lifecycle.

The study validates the proposed architecture through a qualitative engineering assessment based on the criteria of transparency, completeness, flexibility, and lightweight design. While the paper does not provide specific quantitative performance metrics or numerical benchmarks, it demonstrates that the minimal-tool strategy is the most effective method for mitigating the high resource demands of tool qualification. The results confirm that the extended ONNX description successfully establishes a viable mechanism for continuous validation, linking the development phase directly to runtime deployment. Furthermore, the workflow proves capable of supporting mixed-criticality systems by allowing reliable deployment across different runtimes while maintaining the necessary isolation between safety-critical and non-safety-critical elements.

This research provides a foundational framework for integrating AI into mixed-criticality systems, offering a practical pathway to balance the dynamic needs of AI evolution with the static requirements of functional safety. By defining a reproducible method for "qualifiable" AI development, the work significantly lowers the time and cost barriers associated with safety compliance. The implications for the field are substantial; the workflow enables engineering teams to deploy dependable AI components in safety-critical environments, such as autonomous driving and industrial control systems, without compromising the rigorous standards required for certification.

## Methodology

The authors propose a **transparent, complete, flexible, and lightweight workflow** designed specifically for safe-AI development. The technical foundation rests on an **extended ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) model description**, which enables rigorous validation of AI algorithms across their entire lifecycle.

The approach prioritizes 'qualifiability' by intentionally restricting the workflow to a **minimal set of tools and features**. This restriction is deliberate, aimed at reducing the administrative and resource burden associated with tool qualification.
