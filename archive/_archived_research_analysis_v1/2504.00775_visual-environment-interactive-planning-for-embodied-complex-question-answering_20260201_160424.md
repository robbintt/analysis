### 📑 Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of Embodied Complex-Question Answering (EQA), where agents must answer questions involving intricate structures and abstract semantics within physical environments. Existing approaches predominantly rely on static, one-step planning mechanisms or are heavily dependent on large foundational models (LFMs). These methods struggle in dynamic real-world settings because they cannot adapt actions based on evolving visual feedback, and they incur prohibitive computational costs.

The authors introduce a **Visual Environment-Interactive Planning (VEIP)** framework that transitions from static planning to a sequential, interactive model. The system’s core is a Structured Semantic Space that facilitates iterative interaction between visual perception and question chains. Technically, the architecture employs **Visual Hierarchical Scene Graphs** to parse agent intentions and uses **Iterative Stepwise Planning** guided by external rules rather than solely by model parameters. This is governed by a feedback loop where plans are dynamically generated and refined across multiple rounds of environmental interaction, allowing the agent to optimize its action strategy in real-time.

Empirically, the proposed framework demonstrated significant improvements over traditional baselines. The authors constructed a new **E-EQA dataset** comprising over 20,000 complex question-answer pairs to facilitate rigorous testing. On this benchmark, the VEIP framework achieved an accuracy of **47.6%**, outperforming the strongest one-step baseline, HCRN, by **6.4 percentage points**. Furthermore, the integration of external rules effectively reduced computational overhead, maintaining manageable latency while navigating unstructured environments. This work validates the efficacy of sequential, interactive planning, providing a scalable path for deploying embodied agents in real-world applications.
