## Executive Summary

Evolutionary Multitasking (EMT) aims to solve multiple optimization problems simultaneously by transferring knowledge across tasks. However, a fundamental challenge in this field is the "negative transfer" problem, where inappropriate knowledge transfer degrades performance rather than improving it. Existing methods often rely on manual, heuristic-based designs to determine transfer routing, content, and strategies, which lack adaptability and require extensive domain-specific tuning. This paper addresses the critical need for an automated, generalized framework that can intelligently manage the complex dynamics of knowledge transfer without human intervention.

The authors propose **"MetaMTO,"** a novel multi-role Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that automates the transfer process by decomposing it into three specialized cooperative agents within a bi-level Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) architecture. The system assigns distinct roles: a Task Routing Agent uses attention mechanisms to determine *where* to transfer based on task similarity; a Knowledge Control Agent regulates *what* to transfer by controlling the selection of elite solutions; and Strategy Adaptation Agents determine *how* to transfer by dynamically adjusting hyper-parameters (such as mutation and crossover strengths). These policy networks are trained end-to-end over an augmented multitask problem distribution, allowing them to learn a unified meta-policy that generalizes to unseen tasks.

In comparative experiments against representative baselines—including L2T, BLKT, RLMFEA, and MFEA—the proposed framework achieved state-of-the-art performance across all tested problem scales (VS, S, M, L, VL). For medium-scale problems (M-3), the model achieved an objective value of **0.1713 ± 0.0058**, significantly outperforming L2T (0.2862 ± 0.0018) and standard MFEA (0.3605 ± 0.0051). This performance gap was consistent across other scales; on large-scale problems (L-3), the method scored **0.2121 ± 0.0039** compared to L2T’s 0.3201 ± 0.0021. Furthermore, analysis revealed that the learned policies are interpretable, offering clear insights into the decision-making process regarding task routing and resource allocation.

This research significantly advances the field of evolutionary computation by demonstrating that knowledge transfer mechanisms can be fully automated via meta-learning rather than manually engineered. By proving that a meta-policy pre-trained on an augmented distribution can successfully adapt to new multitasking environments, the work reduces the heavy burden of hyperparameter tuning typically associated with EMT algorithms. The multi-agent architecture establishes a new paradigm for designing optimization systems that are not only high-performing but also robust and adaptable to varying problem complexities.

## 🛠 Methodology

The core of the proposed solution is the **Multi-Role Reinforcement Learning framework**, designed to automate knowledge transfer in Evolutionary Multitasking (EMT). The methodology decomposes the complex transfer process into three specialized, cooperative agents:

1.  **Task Routing Agent:** Determines **where** to transfer by evaluating attention-based similarity between tasks.
2.  **Knowledge Control Agent:** Determines **what** to transfer by regulating the selection of elite solutions for transfer.
3.  **Strategy Adaptation Agents:** Determine **how** to transfer by controlling the transfer strength via dynamic hyper-parameter adjustment.

These policy networks are trained **end-to-end** over an augmented multitask problem distribution. This allows the system to derive a unified meta-policy that captures the dynamics of knowledge transfer without manual algorithm design.
