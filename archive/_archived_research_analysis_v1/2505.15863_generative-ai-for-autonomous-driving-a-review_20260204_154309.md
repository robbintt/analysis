## 📝 Executive Summary

### Problem
This paper addresses the critical challenge of effectively integrating Generative AI (GenAI) into the complex, safety-critical ecosystem of autonomous driving. As the industry seeks to advance beyond traditional perception and control methods, there is a pressing need to understand how generative models can enhance specific AD tasks such as static map creation, dynamic scenario generation, trajectory forecasting, and motion planning. This analysis is vital because while GenAI offers significant potential for improving system adaptability and robustness, widespread deployment is currently hindered by unresolved issues regarding safety assurance, model interpretability, and the stringent requirement for real-time processing capabilities in dynamic environments.

### Innovation
The study provides a structured, comparative analysis of state-of-the-art generative architectures—including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Invertible Neural Networks (INNs), Generative Transformers, and Diffusion Models—specifically benchmarked against AD requirements. Technically, the authors evaluate these models across various tasks, highlighting how hybrid approaches that combine generative AI with conventional automotive techniques yield superior performance over standalone methods. The review dissects specific advanced implementations, such as M2I’s goal-driven two-stage framework using transformers and HiVT’s hierarchical vector representations with local and global context encoders, to illustrate how distinct architectural choices handle trajectory prediction and scene consistency.

### Results
The review highlights significant performance improvements in trajectory prediction and planning through the evaluation of specific models. M2I achieved state-of-the-art results on the Waymo Open Dataset, with a 20-30% improvement in minFDE and superior minADE scores. HiVT demonstrated competitive accuracy with a minADE of approximately 0.57m on Argoverse 1 while maintaining high inference speeds exceeding 150 FPS. Furthermore, simulation-based evaluations showed that the Implicit Latent Variable Model significantly reduced collision rates compared to CVAE baselines, while LookOut achieved higher driving scores and fewer collisions in the CARLA simulator. Additionally, JFP showed improved performance in interactive behaviors on the Waymo Open Interaction Dataset, evidenced by better mAP and Brier Score metrics.

### Impact
This work significantly influences the field of autonomous driving by offering a comprehensive taxonomy of generative architectures and a curated list of relevant datasets, thereby facilitating future research and development. By outlining specific recommendations for image generation, dynamic scenario generation, and motion planning, the authors provide a roadmap for addressing the industry's core challenges of safety and interpretability. Ultimately, the study serves as a critical resource for researchers and engineers, guiding the selection of appropriate generative models for specific AD applications and accelerating the transition from theoretical models to deployable, robust autonomous systems.
