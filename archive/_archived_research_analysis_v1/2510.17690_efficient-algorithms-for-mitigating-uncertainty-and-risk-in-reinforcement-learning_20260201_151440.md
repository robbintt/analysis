## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of mitigating uncertainty and risk in Reinforcement Learning (RL), a necessity for applying RL to safety-critical domains such as healthcare, autonomous systems, and finance. The paper distinguishes between two fundamental types of uncertainty: **epistemic uncertainty**, arising from incomplete knowledge of the environment model, and **aleatoric uncertainty**, stemming from inherent environmental stochasticity. Standard RL algorithms often fail to guarantee convergence or performance stability when facing these uncertainties, particularly when standard Bellman operators do not exhibit contraction properties. Addressing this is essential to prevent catastrophic failures in real-world deployments where robustness against model ambiguity and rare, high-severity events is required.

The core innovation lies in a bifurcated algorithmic approach tailored to each specific type of uncertainty, utilizing Dynamic Programming and Linear Programming formulations. For epistemic uncertainty, the authors introduce the Multi-model Markov Decision Process (MMDP) framework and the **Coordinate Ascent Dynamic Programming (CADP)** algorithm. CADP creates a novel theoretical link between policy gradient methods and dynamic programming, using coordinate ascent to adjust model weights and guarantee monotone policy improvements. For aleatoric uncertainty, the research focuses on risk-averse objectives—specifically Entropic Risk Measure with Time-Dependent Risk Constraints (ERM-TRC) and Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR-TRC). Crucially, the study establishes sufficient and necessary conditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to act as a contraction. Furthermore, the paper proposes **model-free Q-learning algorithms** that converge to optimal risk-averse value functions by leveraging operator monotonicity, circumventing the traditional requirement for contraction to prove convergence.

The theoretical frameworks were rigorously validated across five complex domains: HIV treatment, Breast Cancer management, Cloud Computing resource allocation, Autonomous Driving, and Financial Investment. Rather than relying on anecdotal evidence, the study quantified performance using specific metrics: Mean Return (scaled for HIV), Standard Deviation of Returns, Run-time (measured in minutes), Capital Distribution, and EVaR Value Convergence. Results demonstrated that the CADP algorithm converges regardless of the initial policy used. In financial simulations, risk-averse policies quantitatively modified capital distribution, shifting probability mass away from low-capital outcomes. Additionally, the experiments confirmed that the proposed Q-learning algorithms successfully converged to optimal value functions even in the absence of contraction properties, empirically validating the theoretical reliance on operator monotonicity.

This work significantly advances the state-of-the-art in risk-sensitive RL by providing a comprehensive theoretical framework that unifies model-based and model-free approaches under uncertainty. By proving that Q-learning can converge based on monotonicity rather than contraction, the research expands the class of risk-averse problems that can be solved efficiently without a known model. The introduction of the CADP algorithm, combined with Linear Programming formulations and the formalization of contraction conditions for exponential risk measures, provides the research community with powerful new tools for developing robust agents. Ultimately, these findings facilitate the creation of autonomous systems capable of handling model ambiguity and minimizing downside risk, bridging the gap between theoretical RL guarantees and practical, high-stakes applications.
