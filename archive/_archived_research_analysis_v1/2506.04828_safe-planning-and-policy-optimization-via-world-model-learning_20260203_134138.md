## Executive Summary

Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) in continuous control faces a dual challenge: the risks associated with epistemic uncertainty in imperfect world models and the "objective mismatch" inherent in traditional model-based approaches. In safety-critical environments, relying on inaccurate learned models can lead an agent to execute plausible yet catastrophic plans. Furthermore, optimizing a reward function based on a model's predictions often fails to align with optimizing the true environment's reward, a discrepancy known as objective mismatch. Existing methodologies typically rely on static safety thresholds; these fail to adapt to an agent's evolving competency, resulting in performance that is either overly conservative or dangerously aggressive when the model errors are significant.

This paper introduces **SPOWL** (Safe Planning and Optimization via World Model Learning), a hybrid framework that integrates Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDP) with an implicit world model to resolve these issues. Technically, SPOWL addresses objective mismatch by utilizing an implicit world model that performs planning directly in latent space without decoding to pixel space. This ensures that the optimization target aligns strictly with the true environment dynamics rather than artifacts of the model's reconstruction capabilities. The framework employs an adaptive switching mechanism to mitigate epistemic uncertainty, dynamically toggling between a learned Safe Policy (trained via constrained optimization) and Model-Based Planning based on estimated model error. Additionally, SPOWL replaces static safety limits with a cost-value-function-driven mechanism, allowing dynamic safety thresholds that adjust to the agent's improving capabilities.

Evaluated on the SafetyGymnasium benchmark using Point, Car, Ant, and Doggo agents, SPOWL demonstrated superior performance and safety compared to state-of-the-art baselines. In complex tasks such as the Doggo environment, SPOWL achieved near-zero cumulative safety violations (costs approaching 0.0), whereas competing methods like SafeDreamer incurred substantial violation costs. SPOWL also maintained high task completion rates and significantly outperformed model-free methods in sample efficiency. This research represents a pivotal advancement in the reliability of model-based RL for real-world applications where safety is paramount, offering a robust framework that enables agents to progressively take calculated risks as their competency evolves.
