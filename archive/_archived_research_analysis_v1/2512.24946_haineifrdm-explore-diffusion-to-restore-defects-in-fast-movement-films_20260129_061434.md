## Executive Summary

HaineiFRDM addresses the critical challenge of restoring high-resolution film sequences containing fast-moving objects, a domain where existing open-source solutions significantly lag behind proprietary commercial standards due to poor data quality and computational limitations. This disparity matters because it restricts high-quality restoration capabilities to well-funded entities using closed-source tools. By leveraging diffusion models, which possess superior content-understanding capabilities to distinguish defects from actual grain and motion, HaineiFRDM offers a viable open-source pathway to professional-grade restoration.

The framework introduces several architectural innovations to enable high-resolution processing within a constrained 24GB VRAM budget. It employs a patch-wise training and testing strategy to manage memory overhead, but to prevent the fragmentation typically associated with this approach, the authors implemented a Global-local Frequency Module specifically designed to reconstruct consistent textures across patches. Furthermore, the system utilizes a two-stage restoration process; a low-resolution version is restored first and then used as a global residual in the second stage. This mechanism effectively mitigates blocky artifacts and ensures structural coherence. The design is rounded out by Position-aware Global Prompt and Frame Fusion Modules to maintain temporal and spatial context.

Experimental validation demonstrates that HaineiFRDM outperforms current open-source baselines, significantly closing the quality gap with commercial solutions. The framework proves robust in handling fast-motion sequences, restoring defects—such as scratches and noise—without introducing severe motion artifacts or blurring. These results were achieved on hardware with 24GB VRAM, empirically validating the model's efficiency as a high-resolution solution that does not require industrial-grade computational clusters.

This research significantly impacts the field by democratizing access to state-of-the-art film restoration technology. As the first open-source framework to successfully apply diffusion models to this task, it establishes a new technical benchmark for the community. Additionally, the authors contribute a hybrid dataset combining restored real-degraded films with realistic synthetic data, providing a vital resource for future research. By bridging the gap between academic performance and commercial applicability, HaineiFRDM sets a standard for memory-efficient, high-fidelity video restoration.

## Key Findings

*   **Performance Benchmark:** HaineiFRDM outperforms existing open-source methods and significantly closes the gap with commercial solutions, which have traditionally dominated due to better data quality.
*   **Hardware Efficiency:** The framework successfully enables the training and testing of high-resolution films on hardware with limited memory (specifically 24GB VRAM), making high-end restoration accessible without industrial clusters.
*   **Data Synergy:** The construction of a hybrid dataset—combining restored real-degraded films with realistic synthetic data—has proven critical in aiding the restoration of complex defects.
*   **Superior Understanding:** Unlike traditional methods, the utilized diffusion models offer inherent "content-understanding" capabilities, allowing them to better distinguish and restore indistinguishable film defects (like grain vs. damage).

## Methodology

The researchers proposed **HaineiFRDM**, a film restoration framework built on diffusion models. To balance high-resolution output with computational limits, the team implemented a specific workflow:

1.  **Patch-wise Strategy:** A patch-wise training and testing strategy is employed to handle the heavy computational demands of high-resolution film.
2.  **Context Awareness:**
    *   **Position-aware Global Prompts:** Used to maintain spatial context.

3.  **Texture Consistency:** Implementation of a **Global-local Frequency Module** to reconstruct consistent textures across different patches, preventing visual fragmentation.
4.  **Artifact Mitigation:** A two-stage restoration process is utilized:
    *   **Stage 1:** A low-resolution version of the film is restored.
    *   **Stage 2:** The low-res result is utilized as a *global residual* to guide the high-resolution restoration, mitigating blocky artifacts.
