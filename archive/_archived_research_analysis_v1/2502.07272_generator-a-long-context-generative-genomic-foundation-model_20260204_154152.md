## 📝 Executive Summary

Current genomic analysis faces significant challenges in scalability, cost, and the ability to model long-range dependencies within eukaryotic DNA. Existing tools are often constrained by short context windows, which fail to capture the complex interactions between distal regulatory elements, or rely on expensive, alignment-based methods that limit their applicability across diverse tasks. This gap hinders the efficient interpretation of genetic variation and the ability to perform functional biological engineering, necessitating a more generalized and efficient foundation model.

The researchers introduce **GENERator**, a generative genomic foundation model pre-trained on 386 billion nucleotides of eukaryotic DNA, designed to handle ultra-long context windows of up to 98,000 nucleotides. Technically, the model utilizes a 6-mer tokenization strategy that balances local grammar capture with long-range context processing, implemented as an autoregressive DNA language model at 1 billion and 3 billion parameter scales. By employing a next-token prediction objective and using marginal nucleotide-level probabilities for Variant Effect Prediction (VEP), GENERator provides an alignment-free approach that generalizes across unsupervised, zero-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms.

Evaluations demonstrated that GENERator embeddings achieve phylogenetically coherent clustering that improves with model scale, while the 6-mer tokenizer attained peak sequence recovery accuracy. In zero-shot VEP tasks, GENERator-1B outperformed the comparable Evo2-1B model, and GENERator-3B matched the performance of the significantly larger Evo2-7B model. After fine-tuning, the model achieved state-of-the-art results on standard genomic benchmarks. Furthermore, in programmable design tasks, 99.9% of generated protein sequences translated successfully and folded into stable structures with high similarity (TM-score > 0.8) to known folds, while synthetic cis-regulatory elements were successfully validated using UMI-STARR-seq assays.

This work establishes a unified framework that bridges the interpretation of genomic function with programmable sequence design, marking a significant step toward active biological engineering. By offering a broadly applicable, alignment-free solution for variant effect prediction and sequence design, GENERator reduces the computational and resource barriers typically associated with high-resolution genomic analysis. The model's ability to generate functional biological elements validated by high-throughput experiments positions it as a powerful new tool for synthetic biology, precision medicine, and the exploration of non-coding DNA regions.
