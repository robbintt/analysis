### 📝 Executive Summary

Standard Imitation Learning (IL) is fundamentally unsuitable for contact-rich robotic manipulation because it relies on the Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) assumption. In real-world deployment, the agent's state distribution inevitably drifts from the expert's training distribution, causing compounding errors that render agents unreliable. This issue is exacerbated in environments where physics simulators are inaccurate and real-world data is scarce. Consequently, offline IL agents frequently fail when encountering states outside their training domain, creating a critical barrier to robust robotic autonomy.

This research addresses the non-i.i.d. violation by introducing a unified taxonomy and framework for **Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL)**, which integrates human-in-the-loop intervention to correct state drift. The study formally categorizes IIL approaches based on interaction strategies and policy updates, drawing a technical distinction between Agent strategies—where the system autonomously queries based on state uncertainty—and Passive strategies, which utilize fixed schedules. A core innovation is the optimization of the **"interaction budget,"** a constraint that quantifies the trade-off between minimizing human cognitive workload and maximizing policy performance, conceptually limiting interventions to a specific percentage of an execution (e.g., 5%) to ensure operational feasibility.

Comparative analysis demonstrates that IIL frameworks significantly outperform standard offline IL by effectively mitigating compounding errors in contact-rich tasks. The results highlight that Agent querying strategies yield superior sample efficiency compared to Passive approaches; specifically, Active methods achieve higher success rates while drastically reducing the volume of human interventions required for convergence. By optimizing the interaction budget, these methods align the agent’s state distribution with the expert's, enabling robust performance even when real-world data is limited and scarce.

This work significantly advances the field by providing the first unified problem definition for the shift from offline to interactive learning paradigms, offering a structured navigation of the IIL landscape. It establishes new evaluation benchmarks that prioritize human factors—such as fatigue and cognitive load—alongside standard robotic performance metrics. While the authors identify the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a promising direction for future semantic understanding, the paper's primary contribution lies in its comprehensive taxonomy and the formalization of the interaction budget, equipping researchers with the tools to implement efficient, human-in-the-loop robotic systems.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Violation of i.i.d. Assumption:** Standard Imitation Learning fails in robotic manipulation because it assumes training and testing data are Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.), leading to compounding errors when the agent encounters new states.
*   **Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) as a Solution:** IIL addresses distribution shift by placing a human in the loop to provide interventions during execution, keeping the state distribution close to the demonstration distribution.
*   **Efficiency vs. Performance Trade-off:** A key finding is the optimization of the **"interaction budget"** to minimize the amount of human interference required to achieve a successful policy.
*   **Application in Robotic Manipulation:** IIL is particularly critical for contact-rich manipulation tasks where physics simulation is inaccurate, and real-world data is scarce and non-i.i.d.

## 📋 Methodology

The paper employs a **systematic review methodology** to categorize existing IIL approaches. It organizes methods based on two primary factors:

1.  **Interaction Strategy:** Defining *when* and *how* to ask the human for help.
2.  **Policy Update Mechanism:** Defining *how* new data is incorporated into the policy.

The methodology distinguishes between:
*   **Active Approaches:** The agent decides when to ask for help based on uncertainty.
*   **Passive Approaches:** Utilize a fixed schedule or random selection.

The study involves a comparative analysis of algorithms regarding their handling of non-i.i.d. data, sample efficiency, and computational cost.

## ✅ Results

*   **Task Success:** The key results indicate success in contact-rich manipulation tasks by minimizing the interaction budget while maintaining a successful policy.
*   **Comparison:** The approach outperforms standard Imitation Learning, which fails due to compounding errors from distribution shift.
*   **Data Efficiency:** The method is data efficient, achieving high performance with scarce real-world data and interactive corrections instead of exhaustive prior demonstrations.
