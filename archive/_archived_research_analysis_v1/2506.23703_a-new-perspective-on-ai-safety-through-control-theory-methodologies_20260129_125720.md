## Executive Summary

Current data-driven AI architectures are fundamentally incompatible with the rigorous safety standards required for safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous vehicles. The core issue lies in the assurance gap between traditional control theory, which demands determinism, and the non-deterministic nature of modern AI. This gap leaves systems vulnerable when encountering Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs—scenarios not represented in training data. Because traditional analysis methods cannot verify AI behavior against these unknown conditions, generic fail-safes are often insufficient to guarantee dynamic control and safety in high-stakes environments.

To bridge this gap, the authors employ a top-down, system theory-inspired methodology to establish a new paradigm termed **'Data Control.'** This research integrates assurance directly into the AI stack by reinterpreting data generation and AI abstraction through control theory principles. The proposed architecture introduces an **'Extended Input Inspection'** mechanism that detects OOD inputs and replaces impermissible signals with 'imagined' foreseeable risk scenarios rather than triggering a generic shutdown. Technically, this is achieved through a three-stage 'Imagination Module' (consisting of a Hazard Case Imaginator, Probability Evaluator, and High-Risk Case Selector), supported by a Runtime Buffer and a Hazard Knowledge Base. The system quantifies risk as the product of the Probability of Occurrence and Extent of Impact, allowing for functionality in a safe, degraded mode.

The study focuses on foundational validation rather than quantitative benchmarking, offering qualitative proof-of-concept scenarios centered on trajectory generation. While specific performance metrics or statistical data are not provided, the results demonstrate the feasibility of generating 'realistic emergency-stopping trajectories' in response to unknown OOD inputs. The architecture illustrated its capability to support lifecycle management through case buffering and successfully showed that impermissible inputs could be transformed into permissible foreseeable risk scenarios. These findings provide conceptual validation of the system's ability to maintain operational continuity and predictability during safety-critical events, even in the absence of quantitative experimental data.

This work is significant for establishing a formal, abstract foundation for fusing AI engineering with established control theory safety standards. By outlining a generic basis for safety analysis, the paper stimulates a shift in the field where safety is treated as an integral component of system design rather than a retroactive certification step. The 'Data Control' perspective offers a theoretical pathway for future innovations in verifying and validating autonomous cyber-physical systems, holding the potential to accelerate the safe deployment of autonomous technologies by reconciling the black-box nature of AI with strict industrial safety requirements.

### Architecture Overview
*   **Core Mechanism:** Utilizes an **'Extended Input Inspection'** mechanism to manage Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs.
*   **Strategy:** Instead of shutting down, the system replaces impermissible inputs with "imagined" foreseeable risk scenarios.

### Core Components
1.  **Deficiency Detection / OOD Output Filter:** Monitors for anomalous data inputs.
2.  **Runtime Buffer:** Stores critical context information for system operation.
3.  **Hazard Knowledge Base:** Contains expert knowledge regarding potential hazards.
4.  **Three-Stage 'Imagination' Module:**
    *   *Hazard Case Imaginator:* Generates potential risk scenarios.
    *   *Probability Evaluator:* Assesses the likelihood of scenarios.
    *   *High-Risk Case Selector:* Chooses the most relevant risks for mitigation.

### Operational Logic
*   **Input Management:** System monitors AI inputs and replaces impermissible signals with **'foreseeable risk input signals'**.
*   **Risk Quantification:** Risk is calculated as:
    > **Risk = Probability of Occurrence × Extent of Impact**
*   **System State:** Maintains functionality in a **safe, degraded mode** rather than failing completely.
