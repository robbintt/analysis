## 📑 Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental inadequacy of traditional Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) models—specifically static, interface-based approaches—in the context of emerging Agentic AI. As AI systems transition from passive tools to autonomous agents capable of goal-directed behavior, existing interaction paradigms fail to capture the complexity of dynamic, networked collaboration. This limitation poses a significant challenge for developing next-generation systems where humans and AI must cooperate as equal partners rather than user and tool, making the establishment of a rigorous theoretical foundation for these interactions critical.

The key innovation is the introduction of a system-theoretical "communication spaces" framework, which formalizes Human-AI interaction across three distinct layers: **Surface** (data exchange), **Observation** (monitoring), and **Computation** (processing logic). The authors propose a **Dual Paradigm Architecture** distinguishing between Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)—characterized by functional independence—and Centaurian Systems, characterized by deep integration. Technically, the framework utilizes Colored Petri Nets for Centaurian systems and High-Level Reconfigurable Networks for MAS, treating humans as fully capable agents.

As this research is entirely theoretical, the results consist of formalized mathematical definitions and architectural proofs rather than experimental data. The study demonstrates the theoretical validity of the proposed layered architecture, establishing that specific mathematical models effectively capture the constraints of both integration styles. Consequently, the paper provides no quantitative benchmarks but delivers a validated conceptual model that bridges the gap between autonomous agent cooperation and deep human-AI integration.

The significance of this paper lies in its foundational contribution to the field of **Hybrid Intelligence**, effectively redefining HCI from a static interface interaction to a dynamic interplay within a networked system of heterogeneous agents. By providing a rigorous mathematical language to describe these interactions, the framework enables the design of systems capable of balancing structured coordination with emergent behavior, establishing a basis for future developments in complex cyber-physical systems.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Paradigm Distinction:** The paper identifies two distinct paradigms of human-AI collaboration:
    *   **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS):** Functional independence and structured protocols.
    *   **Centaurian Systems:** Deep integration and functional interdependence.
*   **Beyond Interface-Based HCI:** Traditional interface-based approaches are insufficient for Agentic AI; a shift toward system-theoretical interaction is required.
*   **Formalized Communication Framework:** A theoretical framework for 'communication spaces' is established, structured into three layers:
    *   Surface Layer
    *   Observation Layer
    *   Computation Layer
*   **Mathematical Representation:**
    *   **Colored Petri Nets:** Effective for representing Centaurian systems (tight coupling).
    *   **High-Level Reconfigurable Networks:** Better suited for MAS (structured protocols).
