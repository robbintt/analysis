## 📝 Executive Summary

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) models frequently face performance degradation due to domain shift—the discrepancy between the acoustic conditions of training data and real-world deployment environments. This challenge is exacerbated by standard unsupervised domain adaptation methods that demand access to source data or labels during the adaptation phase. These dependencies impose significant resource constraints and privacy risks, limiting the practical applicability of SER systems in dynamic settings where source information is unavailable or restricted.

To address these limitations, the authors introduce **EMO-TTA**, a test-time adaptation framework designed for frozen pre-trained Audio-Language Models (ALMs), specifically utilizing architectures like CLAP. Operating strictly at inference time, the technique minimizes entropy to optimize model confidence on unlabeled target data. Rather than fine-tuning the entire backbone, EMO-TTA updates only learnable text prompts or lightweight adapters. This mechanism aligns audio features with the semantic space of emotion descriptions, bridging the distribution gap between training and testing domains without altering the model's core weights.

Evaluation on the IEMOCAP and MELD benchmarks provides quantitative evidence of the framework's efficacy, measured via Weighted Accuracy (WA) and Unweighted Accuracy (UA). The results demonstrate that EMO-TTA achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, delivering superior metric scores compared to standard zero-shot Audio-Language Models and audio-only baselines. Specifically, the method significantly outperformed existing approaches in both zero-shot and cross-corpus settings, validating that the integration of semantic text knowledge effectively mitigates the accuracy losses typically associated with domain shift.

This work establishes a practical advancement for SER deployment by offering a privacy-preserving solution that requires only unlabeled test streams. By decoupling the adaptation process from source data dependencies, EMO-TTA enables real-time robustness in diverse acoustic environments. Furthermore, the parameter-efficient nature of updating prompts or adapters ensures minimal computational overhead, presenting a scalable paradigm for leveraging multi-modal semantic context in resource-constrained applications.
