> ### 📑 Executive Summary
>
> The field of audio AI currently suffers from significant fragmentation, where separate specialized models are typically required for distinct tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), audio understanding, text-to-speech generation, and voice conversation. Unifying these capabilities into a single foundation model is a complex challenge, primarily due to the difficulty of processing continuous audio signals alongside discrete text while maintaining the low latency necessary for real-time streaming.
>
> The **Kimi-Audio Technical Report** addresses this gap by presenting a unified model capable of handling the full spectrum of audio modalities—speech, sound, and music—without sacrificing performance or coherence across different domains. The core technical innovation is a novel hybrid LLM-based architecture engineered to bridge continuous audio features with discrete tokens.
>
> Kimi-Audio demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across rigorous benchmarks for speech recognition, audio understanding, audio question answering, and speech conversation. These results were achieved through a training regimen of unprecedented scale, utilizing over 13 million hours of raw audio data. The significance of this research extends beyond performance metrics, offering a comprehensive open-source solution that includes model codes, checkpoints, and evaluation toolkits to ensure reproducibility.
