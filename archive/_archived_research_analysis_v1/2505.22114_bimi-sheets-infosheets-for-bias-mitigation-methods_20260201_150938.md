## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical barriers hindering the practical adoption and benchmarking of algorithmic bias mitigation methods, identifying a phenomenon the authors term the **"portability trap."** Because bias mitigation techniques are highly specific to particular domains, tasks, and model architectures, transferring them effectively between contexts is notoriously difficult.

The authors highlight that a significant driver of this issue is the lack of uniform documentation; essential design choices—such as fairness formalizations and intervention points—are frequently absent or obscured. This inconsistency creates an expertise barrier that prevents practitioners from accurately assessing a method's suitability or comparing it against alternatives, thereby stifling both research progress and real-world application.

To resolve this fragmentation, the authors introduce **"BiMi Sheets,"** a standardized documentation framework and structured template designed specifically for bias mitigation algorithms. Unlike Model Cards or Datasheets for datasets, BiMi Sheets focus exclusively on the technical architecture of mitigation methods, systematically cataloging attributes like pipeline intervention points, fairness definitions, and model compatibility. The innovation lies in the creation of a uniform schema that transforms static documentation into structured data, enabling these methods to be aggregated into a comprehensive, queryable database. To operationalize this, the authors deployed a public web platform that serves as a centralized hub for generating, discovering, and comparing these information sheets.

The authors validated the need for this framework through an extensive audit of five major fairness toolkits (AIF360, Fairlearn, error-parity, fairret, and OxonFair) encompassing 20 distinct methods and 15 years of research. The audit revealed high inconsistency in information location and frequent "Not Found" gaps where critical details had to be deduced by experts rather than explicitly documented. As a proof of concept, the authors utilized this framework to create 24 BiMi Sheets, demonstrating the ability to capture and standardize previously fragmented methodological data.

## Key Findings

*   **The 'Portability Trap':** Algorithmic bias mitigation methods are highly specific to domains, tasks, and models, making them difficult to transfer between contexts.
*   **Barrier to Adoption:** The need for complex design choices regarding fairness and intervention points hinders benchmarking and practical uptake.
*   **Standardization Necessity:** A critical lack of uniform documentation exists for bias mitigation methods, complicating the assessment of their characteristics.
*   **Solution Efficacy:** 'BiMi Sheets' provide a structured, portable guide that enables rapid comparison of a method's merits against specific requirements.
*   **Enabling Database Creation:** The uniform structure of BiMi Sheets facilitates the aggregation of methods into a structured, queryable database.

## Methodology

The authors developed a standardized documentation framework called **'BiMi Sheets'** designed to systematically capture the design choices inherent to bias mitigation methods. This approach focuses on recording specific attributes, such as fairness formalizations and intervention points within the machine learning pipeline.

To operationalize this framework and ensure accessibility, the authors implemented a web-based platform (**bimisheet.com**) that serves as a centralized hub for finding and creating these standardized information sheets.

To validate the framework, the team conducted an audit of 5 major toolkits and 20 distinct bias mitigation methods. Documentation was evaluated across 5 axes:
1.  Fairness Guarantee
2.  Fairness Notion
3.  Implementation details
4.  Constraints
5.  (Other technical attributes)

**Scoring System Legend:**
*   **A:** API Reference
*   **U:** User Docs
*   **N:** Notebooks
*   **?**: Not Found
*   **-:** Not Relevant
*   **\*:** Deducible by experts

## Technical Details

BiMi Sheets are standardized, portable documentation templates ('Infosheets') designed to catalog the design choices and characteristics of algorithmic bias mitigation methods.

*   **Architecture:** Features a uniform schema capturing attributes like fairness formalization, pipeline intervention point, and model compatibility.
*   **Implementation:** Deployed as a web application at `bimisheet.com`.
*   **Comparison:** Unlike Model Cards or Datasheets, BiMi Sheets specifically target bias mitigation methods.
*   **Objective:** Aims to bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners through rapid comparison and contextualization to address the 'portability trap'.
*   **Dataset:** Initial release comprises 24 generated BiMi Sheets.

## Research Contributions

*   **Conceptual Framework:** Introduction of BiMi Sheets as a uniform and portable guide for documenting bias mitigation design choices.
*   **Benchmarking and Comparison Support:** Provision of a tool to rapidly identify method characteristics and compare them against user requirements.
*   **Structured Data Infrastructure:** Establishment of a structural format that allows for the compilation of bias mitigation methods into a comprehensive database.
*   **Community Resource:** Deployment of a public platform (bimisheet.com) to foster the adoption, creation, and discovery of BiMi Sheets.

## Results

The analysis covered 15 years of research and resulted in the creation of 24 BiMi Sheets. The audit of the 5 major toolkits resulted in the following key observations:

*   **High Inconsistency:** Significant variance in where information is located across different toolkits.
*   **Information Gaps:** Critical information was frequently marked as 'Not Found' (?).
*   **Expertise Barrier:** Necessary details often had to be inferred by experts (*) rather than being explicitly documented, creating a barrier to entry for non-experts.
