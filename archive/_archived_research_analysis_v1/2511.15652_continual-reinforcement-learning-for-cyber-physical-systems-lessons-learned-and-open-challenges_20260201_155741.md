## Executive Summary

> **Context:** This research addresses the critical challenge of applying Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), specifically within the context of autonomous driving. As CPS operate in dynamic, non-stationary environments, agents must learn incrementally across a sequence of tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge (catastrophic forgetting).
>
> **Methodology:** The study introduces a rigorous experimental framework to evaluate the feasibility of CRL within a simplified autonomous driving simulator, utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the baseline algorithm. The technical approach involves sequential training where a single agent learns to park in four distinct scenarios without revisiting prior tasks. To simulate real-world constraints, the authors fixed hyperparameters after tuning them on the initial task and implemented PPO combined with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) as a comparative regularization technique.
>
> **Outcomes:** Experimental findings demonstrated that current off-the-shelf CRL methods fail to maintain consistent performance. The system exhibited immediate catastrophic forgetting, inefficient capacity utilization, and environment abstraction difficulties. Notably, negative transfer was observed; configurations optimized for earlier tasks failed in the final scenario without substantial manual intervention.
>
> **Significance:** This paper significantly influences the field by providing a concrete analysis of technical bottlenecks in safety-critical systems. It challenges the suitability of standard neural networks for continual learning and advocates for a paradigm shift towards interdisciplinary research, bridging computer science with neuroscience to address fundamental limitations in non-stationary environments.

## Key Findings

The study identified several significant hurdles in applying Continual RL to complex Cyber-Physical Systems:

*   **Environment Abstraction Difficulties:** Finding suitable abstractions is a significant hurdle when applying Continual RL (CRL) to complex tasks like autonomous driving.
*   **Hyperparameter Instability:** The CRL system exhibits oversensitivity to hyperparameters, making it difficult to maintain stable performance across sequential tasks.
*   **Persistent Catastrophic Forgetting:** The issue of catastrophic forgetting remained present during sequential training, with performance on previous tasks dropping immediately upon learning new ones.
*   **Inefficient Capacity Utilization:** The study identified inefficiencies in how the neural network capacity was utilized, suggesting struggles in consolidating knowledge.

## Methodology

The researchers utilized an experimental setup with a simulated autonomous driving environment. In this setup, an agent was tasked with learning to park in four distinct scenarios varying by parking angle. The agent was trained sequentially to create a Continual Learning setting, simulating a real-world scenario where an agent must adapt to new conditions without retraining from scratch.

## Results

Experiments were conducted with a training budget of **500,000 steps per scenario**, with results averaged over **5 runs** measuring Success Rate. The study yielded the following observations:

*   **Catastrophic Forgetting:** Performance on previous tasks dropped immediately upon training on new tasks.
*   **Transfer Failures:** Hyperparameters and reward functions optimized for Perpendicular and Diagonal parking failed to enable learning in Parallel parking.
*   **Intervention Requirements:** Achieving success in the final (Parallel) scenario required significant modifications, including different learning rates and larger experience buffers.
*   **Conclusion:** Off-the-shelf abstractions and fixed configurations do not transfer reliably across tasks in this domain.
