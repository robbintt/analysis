## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
This research addresses the performance gap between energy-efficient Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and high-accuracy Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). While Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a standard technique used to transfer knowledge from a high-performing ANN teacher to an SNN student, the authors demonstrate that conventional KD methods are fundamentally suboptimal for this task. This limitation arises from an intrinsic distribution mismatch: ANNs utilize continuous, dense activation maps, whereas SNNs rely on sparse, discrete binary spikes. This discrepancy prevents standard distillation methods from effectively aligning the student’s behavior with the teacher's, hindering the deployment of high-performance, low-power neuromorphic hardware.

### **Innovation**
To overcome the distribution mismatch, the researchers propose a novel KD framework centered on two specific technical innovations: **Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD)** and **Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD)**. SAMD addresses feature alignment by rescaling the teacher's continuous Class Activation Map (CAM) and the student's sparse Spike Activation Map (SAM) using a Softmax function. This converts raw feature magnitudes into unified probability distributions, prioritizing semantic saliency over raw values. Concurrently, NLD tackles output alignment by injecting Gaussian noise into the student's sparse logits. This noise smoothing transforms the discrete student outputs into a continuous distribution that can be effectively matched against the teacher's continuous outputs.

### **Results**
The efficacy of the proposed method was validated through extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and CIFAR10-DVS using ResNet and Spikformer architectures. On CIFAR-100, the full framework achieved **79.62%** accuracy, significantly outperforming ablation models lacking NLD (78.95%) or SAMD (77.58%). Specifically, the Softmax scaling strategy within SAMD achieved 79.11%, surpassing Z-score (76.48%) and L2-norm (75.56%) baselines. Furthermore, the CAM-SAM distillation variant reached **83.07%**, a substantial improvement over existing CAM-CAM methods like CATKD (77.23%). On the event-based CIFAR10-DVS dataset, the approach established a new state-of-the-art with **81.55%** accuracy, outperforming the previous best method, EnOFSNN (80.50%).

### **Impact**
This paper is significant because it identifies and resolves a critical flaw in the conventional application of Knowledge Distillation to spiking architectures. By demonstrating that raw feature alignment is insufficient due to the sparse nature of SNNs, the authors establish saliency-based scaling and noise smoothing as essential components for effective neuromorphic training. These contributions provide a robust, generalized approach for improving SNN performance without sacrificing their inherent energy efficiency. The resulting state-of-the-art results offer a new pathway for researchers to bridge the accuracy gap between ANNs and SNNs, facilitating the broader adoption of spiking networks in resource-constrained environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Inherent Mismatch:** Standard Knowledge Distillation (KD) techniques are suboptimal for SNNs due to the intrinsic distribution mismatch between continuous ANN outputs and sparse SNN spikes.
*   **Semantic Superiority:** Saliency-based alignment yields better training results than raw feature alignment by improving semantic consistency between teacher and student.
*   **Logit Smoothing:** Logit Smoothing using Gaussian noise facilitates better alignment between discrete student outputs and continuous teacher outputs.
*   **Validation:** Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that the proposed strategies effectively improve SNN training performance.

## Methodology

The researchers propose a Knowledge Distillation framework utilizing a pre-trained ANN as the teacher and a learnable SNN as the student. The methodology implements two primary strategies to bridge the gap between the two modalities:

1.  **Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD):** Aligns the student's spike activation map with the teacher's class-aware activation map.
2.  **Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD):** Applies Gaussian noise to the sparse logits of the student SNN to achieve effective output alignment.
