## 📝 Executive Summary

> **Core Problem:** Standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces critical limitations in dynamic, real-world environments due to its reliance on static training distributions, extensive data requirements, and high computational costs for retraining. The rigid "training-deploy-retrain" cycle causes agents to fail at generalization and suffer from **catastrophic forgetting**—degrading performance on previous tasks while learning new ones.
>
> **The Solution:** This paper establishes **Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL)** as a vital paradigm enabling agents to learn incrementally, adapt to new tasks, and retain knowledge over time without revisiting past data. This capability is essential for long-term autonomy and non-stationary environments.
>
> **Key Innovation:** The authors introduce a **novel taxonomy** categorizing CRL into four distinct scenarios based on knowledge storage and transfer:
> 1.  **Lifelong Adaptation**
> 2.  **Non-Stationarity Learning**
> 3.  **Task Incremental Learning**
> 4.  **Task-Agnostic Learning**
>
> **Technical Landscape:** The survey classifies architectural approaches into **Regularization-Based Methods** (e.g., EWC, Online-EWC) that constrain parameters using Fisher information matrices, and **Experience-Focused Methods** that utilize Complementary Learning Systems with dual memory buffers.
>
> **Impact:** While the field is diverse, it remains fragmented regarding evaluation standards compared to Continual Supervised Learning. This research provides a unified theoretical framework, standardizes evaluation metrics, and offers a roadmap for addressing unique challenges found at the intersection of RL and Continual Learning.
