## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents capable of complex, multi-step reasoning and sequential decision-making. As models transition from static, single-turn inference to dynamic environmental interaction, traditional benchmarks—often relying on static question-answer formats—fail to capture the nuances of planning, adaptation, and execution within a changing state. The paper highlights the necessity of standardized, lightweight simulation platforms that can quantify not only decision accuracy but also the computational trade-offs inherent in advanced inference strategies, a vital requirement for deploying efficient agentic systems where resource expenditure is a significant constraint.

The core innovation is **LLM-Cave**, a lightweight simulation environment specifically architected to benchmark agentic capabilities without the computational overhead of complex graphical engines or extensive API dependencies. The study evaluates two distinct reasoning enhancement strategies: **Chain of Speculation (CoS)** and **Planner-Critic**. CoS employs explicit reasoning structures reliant on accurate "initial guess propagation," making it most suitable for robust models capable of maintaining deep inference chains. Conversely, Planner-Critic decouples the planning phase from critique and correction to optimize decisions directly; while this decomposition aids complex problem-solving for less capable models, it introduces inherent computational overhead through increased latency and token usage compared to baseline inference.

Performance evaluation across five models (Claude 3.5, OpenAI o1-mini, GPT-4o-mini, Deepseek R1, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) revealed significant disparities in absolute cost and relative efficiency. Claude 3.5 incurred the highest operational cost at approximately $0.0531 per run, while o1-mini was the most economical at $0.0015 per run but recorded the lowest throughput at 8.16 Tokens Per Second (TPS). GPT-4o-mini achieved the lowest latency (4.79s), whereas Gemini 1.5 Flash delivered the highest throughput (195.51 TPS).

Regarding reasoning strategies, CoS applied to o1-mini yielded substantial gains, increasing success rates by approximately 13% and average scores by 10 points relative to the baseline. Planner-Critic proved most beneficial for weaker models, boosting GPT-4o-mini's success rate by 6.7% and scores by 6 points, whereas CoS showed minimal efficacy on GPT-4o-mini. Both strategies introduced notable relative resource overhead, particularly impacting weaker models.

The significance of this work lies in establishing a reproducible, low-resource framework for assessing the "agentic" potential of LLMs, shifting the focus from mere accuracy to the efficiency of reasoning under constraints. The findings provide developers with a clear heuristic for strategy selection: sophisticated chains of speculation like CoS are best reserved for powerful, logic-heavy models, while the Planner-Critic architecture offers a more favorable balance of performance and resource usage for smaller, faster models. By defining these trade-offs between computational budget and decision quality, LLM-Cave serves as a vital tool for optimizing the deployment of autonomous AI systems.
