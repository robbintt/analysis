## Executive Summary

### Problem
The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a substantial barrier to entry due to prohibitive computational costs, restricting high-performance NLP research to well-funded entities. This paper addresses the challenge of resource efficiency by investigating whether "Tiny Language Models" (TLMs)—models with orders of magnitude fewer parameters—can retain the critical capabilities of their larger counterparts.

### Innovation
The key innovation is a **"soft committee" architecture**, comprised of multiple, independently pre-trained shallow networks (specifically BERT-1 variants), serving as an alternative to deep monolithic architectures. Rather than relying on sequential depth to capture complexity, this approach aggregates the outputs ("soft votes") of many shallow models.

### Results
Experiments conducted on FewRel, AGNews, and DBPedia classification tasks demonstrated that TLMs achieve a statistically significant performance boost over non-pre-trained baselines. Crucially, the study showed that the classification accuracy of a single 6-layer deep model (BERT-6) can be fully replicated by a soft committee of 1-layer shallow models, achieving parity in accuracy alongside a reduction in inference latency.

### Impact
By validating the viability of TLMs, this work offers a resource-efficient alternative to computationally prohibitive LLMs, enabling broader research participation outside of dominant tech companies. Furthermore, it suggests that language acquisition in humans may rely on computationally efficient, biologically plausible mechanisms rather than massive storage capacity.

## Key Findings

*   **Pre-training Efficacy:** Tiny Language Models (TLMs) demonstrate a distinct performance gap between pre-trained and non-pre-trained models across classification tasks, proving that pre-training is effective even at a significantly reduced scale.
*   **Data Correlation:** The performance advantage of pre-training correlates directly with the size of the pre-training dataset and the degree of token overlap between the pre-training data and the target classification tasks.
*   **Shallow vs. Deep:** The classification accuracy typically achieved by deep TLM architectures can be replicated using a "soft committee" of multiple, independently pre-trained shallow architectures.
*   **Latency Efficiency:** Using a soft committee of shallow models allows for low-latency inference without compromising classification accuracy compared to deeper models.
*   **Cognitive Implications:** The success of efficient, tiny models suggests that biologically inspired mechanisms with limited computational capacity may be sufficient to explain language development in children and adolescents.

## Methodology

The study utilized **BERT-6** and variants of **BERT-1** as the foundational architectures for Tiny Language Models. Models were pre-trained on subsets of the **Wikipedia dataset**. Performance was assessed using three specific classification tasks:

1.  **FewRel** (Relation Extraction)
2.  **AGNews** (News Classification)
3.  **DBPedia** (Ontology Classification)

The researchers compared the performance of deep architectures against ensembles ("soft committees") of multiple shallow architectures to validate latency and accuracy trade-offs.
