##  Executive Summary

Adversarial Training (AT) is the gold standard for defending against adversarial attacks, but it suffers from a well-known robustness-generalization trade-off, often resulting in significant accuracy loss on clean data. A major fracture exists in the research community regarding the utility of Clean Training (CT); prior studies have produced contradictory conclusions, with some viewing CT as a detriment to robustness and others as a benefit. This paper addresses this critical conflict, emphasizing that resolving these discrepancies is essential for developing practical training methodologies that do not sacrifice model security for clean data performance.

The core innovation is the introduction of the **"multi-view hypothesis,"** which provides a unified theoretical framework to reconcile conflicting literature through a three-stage analytical process. Technically, the authors move beyond viewing CT merely as data augmentation. Instead, they identify two specific mechanisms by which CT assists AT: **reducing the learning difficulty** of complex samples and **providing correct gradient guidance**. Based on this, the authors propose a synthetic training strategy that integrates knowledge from clean-trained models to address specific feature learning deficits inherent in standard AT.

The proposed method demonstrates significant empirical success in alleviating the robustness-generalization trade-off. On the CIFAR-10 dataset using WideResNet-34-10, the framework achieves a clean accuracy of **88.23%** and a robust accuracy of **55.82%** against AutoAttack. This represents a substantial improvement of approximately **2.5%** in clean accuracy compared to standard PGD-AT baselines, while maintaining comparable robustness to state-of-the-art methods like TRADES. Additionally, experiments on ImageNet confirm the scalability of the approach.

This research significantly advances the field by establishing a clear taxonomy of knowledge transfer that validates the complementary nature of clean and adversarial training. The study paves the way for future hybrid optimization strategies, offering a practical solution to the accuracy drop problem.
