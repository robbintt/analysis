## Executive Summary

### Problem
Full-precision backpropagation imposes significant memory and computational barriers, making it impractical for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge hardware. The primary bottleneck is the storage of high-precision gradients and intermediate activations, which exceeds the capacity of many IoT devices. Furthermore, in scenarios involving black-box optimization or adversarial attacks, gradient information is often entirely inaccessible, rendering standard gradient-based methods ineffective.

### Innovation
The authors introduce Zero-Order Quantized Optimization (ZOQO), a framework that eliminates the dependency on backpropagation by utilizing coordinate-wise zero-order gradient estimation. ZOQO maintains strict low-bit (e.g., 4-bit) parameter precision throughout the learning process and approximates the gradient sign strictly through function evaluations rather than derivative calculations. While this approach successfully decouples optimization from the computational graph, it introduces a distinct trade-off: it achieves substantial memory savings by removing gradient storage, though at the expense of increased computational cost inherent to zero-order estimation methods.

### Results
Empirical validation demonstrates that ZOQO delivers performance comparable to full-precision backpropagation baselines, achieving approximately 98% of their accuracy. In rigorous evaluations involving LLM fine-tuning and black-box adversarial attacks, the framework maintained robustness without the typical performance degradation associated with quantization. Crucially, by eliminating the need to store high-precision gradients, ZOQO reduced the memory footprint by up to 4x compared to standard full-precision optimization, a critical metric for deployment in constrained environments.

### Impact
ZOQO bridges the gap between theoretical optimization and practical deployment, making deep learning feasible on memory-constrained IoT and edge systems that previously could not support the overhead of backpropagation. This capability is particularly significant for secure, on-device learning applications, as it enables robust model updates in black-box environments where gradient access is restricted or computationally prohibitive.
