## 📑 Executive Summary

Computing the Wasserstein metric (Optimal Transport) for discrete measures on regular grids in 2D and 3D remains a computationally prohibitive challenge due to the high complexity of exact algorithms. While standard methods like network simplex are theoretically sound, their computational load—often scaling roughly as $O(N^6 \log N)$ in 2D—renders them impractical for large-scale data. Conversely, popular approximation methods like entropy-regularized OT offer speed improvements but lack mathematical guarantees, failing to provide strict bounds on the true distance. This creates a critical gap in the literature for methods that can deliver both high computational efficiency and rigorous, provable error bounds without relying on heuristics.

The authors address this by introducing a novel quantization-based framework that generates mathematically strict upper and lower bounds for the Wasserstein metric. The core innovation involves downsampling input discrete measures onto a coarse grid using SumPool for mass coefficients and AvgPool for coordinates. Crucially, the method utilizes a **specially designed cost matrix** within this reduced space to accurately reflect the geometry of the original measures. After solving the Kantorovich problem exactly on the coarse grid, the solution is upscaled, and a Total Variation (TV) correction term is applied. This TV correction serves as a **theoretical bound** rather than a heuristic, accounting for "intra-cell" transport costs—the movement of mass within individual grid cells—that are ignored by the coarse approximation. By constructing feasible solutions in the primal space (for upper bounds) and feasible potentials in the dual space (for lower bounds), the method guarantees that the resulting values bracket the true Wasserstein distance.

Empirical benchmarks on the DOTmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance gains without sacrificing precision. Compared to entropy-regularized Optimal Transport, the approach delivers speedups of up to 10× for generating upper bounds and up to 100× for lower bounds. Crucially, this computational efficiency is paired with high accuracy, maintaining an approximation error of less than 2% relative to the exact Wasserstein distance, provided the coarse grid sufficiently captures the data's structure. These results validate that rigorous bounding does not require the prohibitive computational costs associated with traditional exact solvers.

This research addresses a fundamental limitation in optimal transport literature by successfully decoupling computational speed from mathematical rigor. By establishing that strict bounds can be derived efficiently through a specialized quantization and correction pipeline, the authors set a new standard for the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in OT computations. This advancement is particularly significant for fields requiring reliable and rapid geometric comparisons, such as image processing and spatial statistics, as it provides a robust alternative to the unbounded approximations that currently dominate practical applications.
