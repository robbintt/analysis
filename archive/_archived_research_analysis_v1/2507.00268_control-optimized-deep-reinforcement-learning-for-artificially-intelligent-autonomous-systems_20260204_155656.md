## Executive Summary

Traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms typically operate under the assumption of perfect action execution, a simplification that often leads to failure in real-world deployments. This assumption ignores the complexities of physical systems, specifically **system dynamics, hardware constraints, and latency**, which create a divergence between the agent's intended commands and the actual physical outcome. This discrepancy, termed "**action execution mismatch**," results in performance degradation and instability when standard DRL agents are applied to mechanical systems.

This paper addresses this critical "sim-to-real" gap, highlighting the need for learning frameworks that account for the imperfect nature of physical actuation. To resolve this, the authors propose a **Control-Optimized Deep Reinforcement Learning (CO-DRL)** framework that explicitly models and compensates for actuation limitations.

The innovation lies in a two-stage architecture that decouples decision-making from execution:
1.  **Stage 1:** A standard DRL agent determines a high-level "desired action."
2.  **Stage 2:** A specific control signal is selected using a PID controller with Back-EMF compensation, which drives a simulated DC Motor to apply the actual force.

Crucially, the training paradigm is modified to optimize the agent’s policy based on the *actual* control signal rather than the idealized action, forcing the agent to learn and anticipate the errors introduced by the hardware dynamics (modeled here with specific motor parameters like $R=1\Omega$ and $L=0.1H$).

The framework was evaluated across five restructured open-source mechanical environments designed to reflect real-world operating conditions:
*   **Pendulum (DDPG):** Achieved perfect torque tracking and reached stability within 10 seconds.
*   **Acrobot (DQN):** Reached the goal in approximately 25 seconds and converged at an average episodic reward of -200.
*   **Mountain Car:** Successfully validated using both Episodic Semi-Gradient SARSA and DDPG.

This research significantly advances the field by bridging the disconnect between theoretical reinforcement learning models and practical engineering implementation, establishing a new benchmark for testing DRL in realistic physical scenarios.

## Key Findings

*   **Limitation of Traditional DRL:** Standard DRL methods often fail in real-world applications because they assume perfect action execution, ignoring performance degradation caused by system dynamics, hardware constraints, and latency.
*   **Action Execution Mismatch:** The proposed framework enhances robustness by explicitly modeling and compensating for the mismatch between intended actions and actual physical execution.
*   **Two-Stage Optimization:** By employing a two-stage process—determining the desired action and then selecting the appropriate control signal—the framework optimizes decision-making with respect to both the intended outcome and physical execution realities.
*   **Validated Stability:** Evaluations across five restructured open-source mechanical simulation environments confirmed that the framework maintains effectiveness and stability under realistic operating conditions and uncertainties.

## Methodology

The authors developed a "control-optimized Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework" utilizing a structured approach:

1.  **Two-Stage Process:**
    *   **Action Determination:** Determining the high-level "desired action."
    *   **Control Signal Selection:** Selecting the specific "control signal" required to execute that action properly, accounting for hardware limitations.

2.  **Modified Training:**
    *   The training process explicitly accounts for "action execution mismatches" and "controller corrections."
    *   It optimizes the desired action based on the actual control signal and the intended outcome.
    *   This forces the agent to learn to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances.

## Contributions

*   **Novel Framework:** Development of a new DRL framework that explicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, addressing a challenge largely overlooked in existing literature.
*   **Training Paradigm Shift:** Establishment of a training paradigm that forces the agent to consider actual control signals and execution errors, effectively bridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world engineering implementation.
*   **Adaptive Agents:** Empowerment of intelligent agents with the ability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances during training.
*   **Resource Creation:** Restructuring and development of five widely used open-source mechanical simulation environments to accurately reflect real-world operating conditions, providing a robust testing ground for control-oriented applications.

## Technical Details

The **Control-Optimized Deep Reinforcement Learning (CO-DRL)** framework addresses action execution mismatch by modeling actuation dynamics explicitly.

**Architecture Components:**
*   **Stage 1 (Decision):** A standard DRL agent that outputs actions converted into desired physical forces.
*   **Stage 2 (Execution):** Uses a PID controller (CTRL) with Back-EMF compensation to drive a simulated DC Motor, generating the actual force applied to the environment.

**System Specifications:**
*   **Environment Extension:** The system extends OpenAI Gym environments.
*   **Standardized Parameters:** Uses standardized motor parameters:
    *   Resistance ($R$): $1\Omega$
    *   Inductance ($L$): $0.1H$
    *   Torque Constant ($k_T$): $1$
*   **Control Logic:** Computes voltage inputs based on current error and motor dynamics.
