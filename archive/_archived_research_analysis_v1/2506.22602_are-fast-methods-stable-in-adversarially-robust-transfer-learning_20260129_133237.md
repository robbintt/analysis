## Executive Summary

Adversarial training serves as the primary defense against adversarial attacks, but it faces a significant computational dilemma. The gold standard, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), delivers high robustness but is often prohibitively expensive. Conversely, the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) is computationally efficient but has been largely dismissed due to "catastrophic overfitting"—a phenomenon where models achieve zero training error but fail completely on test data when trained from scratch.

This paper addresses whether a method exists that retains FGSM's efficiency without succumbing to instability. The key insight is that **FGSM's notorious instability is primarily a byproduct of training from scratch, not an inherent flaw of the attack method itself.**

The authors propose utilizing FGSM within the context of adversarial fine-tuning (transfer learning) rather than initialization-based training. They demonstrate that:
*   Standard fine-tuning avoids overfitting at low perturbation budgets ($\varepsilon=4$ and $\varepsilon=8$).
*   For extreme perturbation budgets ($\varepsilon=32$), integrating FGSM with linear probing (freezing the pre-trained backbone and training only a linear classifier) constrains the hypothesis space and effectively mitigates catastrophic overfitting.

Validated across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, the study shows that FGSM fine-tuning results in only marginal reductions in test robustness compared to PGD (losing an average of **0.39%** at $\varepsilon=4$ and **1.39%** at $\varepsilon=8$). Crucially, this near-state-of-the-art robustness was achieved with a **$4\times$ reduction** in training time.

This research rehabilitates FGSM as a viable training method, proving that catastrophic overfitting is context-dependent and offering a path for practitioners to achieve robust accuracy with a fraction of the computational cost.

## Key Findings

*   **Stability in Fine-Tuning:** Contrary to its instability when training models from scratch, FGSM exhibits **high stability** during adversarial fine-tuning, avoiding catastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets ($\varepsilon=4$ and $\varepsilon=8$).
*   **Extreme Perturbation Resilience:** When combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (specifically **linear probing**), FGSM remains stable even at significantly higher perturbation budgets up to **$\varepsilon=32$**.
*   **Marginal Robustness Trade-off:** Compared to PGD, FGSM fine-tuning results in only marginal reductions in test robustness:
    *   Loss of **0.39%** at $\varepsilon=4$
    *   Loss of **1.39%** at $\varepsilon=8$
*   **Significant Speedup:** FGSM achieves these robustness results with a **$4\times$ reduction in training time** compared to the standard PGD method.

## Methodology

The study employs a comparative analysis between the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) within the specific context of adversarial fine-tuning.

1.  **Comparison Baseline:** Performance and stability of FGSM are measured directly against the computationally intensive PGD.
2.  **Perturbation Analysis:** Researchers analyzed susceptibility to catastrophic overfitting across varying perturbation budgets, specifically testing $\varepsilon$ values of **4, 8, and 32**.
3.  **Fine-Tuning Strategies:** The investigation included:
    *   Standard fine-tuning.
    *   Parameter-efficient methods (specifically linear probing) to observe effects on adversarial stability.
4.  **Validation:** Performance metrics were derived from testing across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) to validate generalizability.
