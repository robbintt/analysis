## Executive Summary

Standard Federated Learning (FL) architectures typically rely on a single central server to aggregate model updates from distributed clients. While this preserves data privacy, the central server model introduces critical scalability limitations and creates a single point of failure. As the number of clients increases, the central server often becomes a communication and computational bottleneck, restricting the system's ability to scale efficiently.

This research addresses these challenges by investigating how to remove the central dependency, moving toward a robust, multi-server architecture capable of maintaining performance across larger networks. The authors propose a **Distributed Federated Learning (DFL) algorithm)** governed by a hierarchical architecture of $M$ servers connected via an undirected graph, each managing a disjoint set of clients.

The key technical innovation is an alternating optimization process consisting of **Local Training** (gradient descent on local data) and **Global Training** (consensus among servers). The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis proving that all distributed servers converge to a common model value within a small tolerance $\epsilon$ of the ideal global optimal model. This is supported by numerical simulations confirming that the DFL algorithm accurately recovers ground truth parameters and achieves consensus even from divergent initializations. This work validates the feasibility of fully decentralized server architectures, establishing a pathway for large-scale, resilient machine learning infrastructure.

## Methodology

The authors introduce a novel approach to decompose the central server bottleneck using a distributed framework and an alternating training schedule.

**Framework Architecture**
*   **Multi-Server Setup:** Consists of multiple servers with inter-server communication capabilities.
*   **Client Allocation:** Each server is associated with a disjoint set of clients, ensuring data distribution is managed hierarchically.

**The DFL Algorithm**
The algorithm operates via alternating periods of optimization:
1.  **Local Training:** Models are trained on locally available data across client devices.
2.  **Global Training:** Models are trained and synchronized among the distributed servers to reach consensus.

**Validation Approach**
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** Includes a rigorous mathematical examination of convergence properties.
*   **Numerical Simulations:** Empirical validation was performed to test the algorithm against theoretical predictions.
