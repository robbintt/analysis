## 📝 Executive Summary

This survey addresses the complexity and fragmentation within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique developed to mitigate the hallucinations and outdated knowledge of Large Language Models. By proposing a four-category taxonomy—**Retriever-Centric**, **Generator-Centric**, **Hybrid**, and **Robustness-Oriented**—the work structures RAG research and outlines key pipeline stages from query processing to generation. The analysis identifies critical trade-offs in system design, balancing retrieval precision against generation flexibility and efficiency against faithfulness. Furthermore, the study establishes a framework for future development and evaluation, guiding the creation of RAG systems that are scalable, truthful, and robust.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Definition & Framework
RAG is defined as a framework coupling pretrained LLMs with non-parametric retrieval modules. The generation probability is modeled as a conditional distribution approximated via a Top-k retrieval mechanism:

> $P(y|x) \approx P(y|x, d_i) \approx P(d_i|x)$

### Pipeline Stages
1.  Query Processing
2.  Retrieval (Sparse: BM25; Dense: DPR; Hybrid; Generative)
3.  Re-ranking
4.  Generation
5.  Post-processing

### Architecture Categories
*   Retriever-Centric
*   Generator-Centric
*   Hybrid
*   Robustness-Oriented

### Specific Patterns & Techniques
*   **Query-Driven Retrieval:** RQ-RAG, GMR, RAG-Fusion, KRAGEN, LQR.
*   **Retriever-side Adaptation:** Re2G, SimRAG.
