> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> State-of-the-art Adversarial Training (AT) strategies, such as Generalist and DBAT, exhibit significant incompatibilities when applied to Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, creating a critical security gap as ViTs become the standard for modern computer vision. The paper addresses this by providing a systematic investigation into why these standard methods fail, identifying through theoretical Mutual Information (MI) analysis that robustness in ViTs specifically requires constraining the MI between adversarial examples and their latent representations. Unlike existing approaches, current AT methods do not account for these specific representational dynamics, leaving transformer-based models vulnerable to adversarial perturbations.
>
> The authors introduce **MIMIR**, a self-supervised adversarial training framework grounded in Information Bottleneck theory, which proves that robustness can be achieved by implementing an MI penalty to limit information leakage from adversarial examples into the latent space. Technically, MIMIR converts Masked Image Modeling (MIM) into an adversarial pre-training method using a two-stage process: self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. The framework generates adversarial images, masks 75% of the patches, and forces the model to reconstruct the image using a loss calculated against the natural (clean) input. This approach integrates MIM with MI penalties to compel the model to learn inherently robust features and is adaptable to various architectures, including standard ViTs (MAE), Swin (Group Window Attention), and ConvNext (SparK).

> MIMIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K (RobustBench with AutoAttack) for both small and large models. On CIFAR-10, the method demonstrated incremental improvements, delivering a 1% increase in both natural and robust accuracy metrics over increased training epochs. Beyond accuracy, MIMIR offers substantial computational efficiency gains compared to end-to-end baselines. For instance, training a Swin-L model required 231.14 hours (versus 363.42 hours for the baseline), while training a ViT-B model took 263.77 hours (versus 451.39 hours for the baseline). Additionally, the method demonstrated superior resilience against unforeseen attacks, data corruption, and adaptive white-box attacks across diverse architectures.
