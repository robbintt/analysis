## Executive Summary

Deep learning models remain critically vulnerable to adversarial attacks, with current dictionary learning-inspired defenses proving insufficient against sophisticated threats. This research addresses the fundamental failure of existing dictionary learning CNNs, which provide a false sense of security by collapsing under strong adaptive attacks. The authors identify a critical gap: theoretical structural priors have not been effectively leveraged, resulting in models that lack robustness and exhibit poor generalization.

To resolve this, the authors propose **Elastic Dictionary Learning Networks (EDLNets)**, a ResNet-based architecture integrating structural priors through a novel Elastic Dictionary Learning (EDL) framework. Technically, EDL decomposes inputs into clean images ($x$) and adversarial perturbations ($\epsilon$), jointly reconstructing both to mitigate noise impact. Theoretically grounded in influence functions and optimized via RISTA iterations, the method minimizes the divergence between hidden embeddings of clean and attacked samples.

Benchmarking on RobustBench demonstrated superior performance. Under rigorous AutoAttack ($\epsilon=2.0$), the PORT baseline enhanced with Elastic DL achieved a robust accuracy of **11.1%**, effectively doubling the base model's 5.90%. Furthermore, the method achieved the lowest reconstruction error rates across all metrics. This research significantly shifts the adversarial defense paradigm, establishing that integrating mathematical structure into deep architectures is essential for future progress in generalized, robust systems.
