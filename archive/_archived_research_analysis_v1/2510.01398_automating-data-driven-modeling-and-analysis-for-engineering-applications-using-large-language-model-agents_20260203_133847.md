## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Engineering data-driven modeling faces a critical scalability bottleneck due to its reliance on manual, expert-driven processes for data preprocessing, architecture selection, and hyperparameter tuning. While traditional methods like Critical Heat Flux (CHF) lookup tables are widely used, they frequently lack the predictive accuracy of modern machine learning techniques. However, developing high-performance deep neural networks requires specialized expertise in optimization and uncertainty quantification (UQ), creating a high barrier to entry that limits the adoption of advanced data-driven methods in complex engineering applications.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce an automated pipeline powered by Large Language Model (LLM) agents designed to execute the end-to-end machine learning workflow autonomously, minimizing the need for human intervention. The study evaluates and compares two distinct technical architectures: a **Multi-agent system** utilizing specialized collaborative agents and a **Single-agent system** based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. These agents manage the full modeling lifecycle—including data preprocessing, neural network architecture generation, training, hyperparameter optimization, and the integration of UQ—effectively replicating the decision-making process of human data scientists.

**Results**
The proposed framework was rigorously validated on a large-scale benchmark comprising approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA dataset for CHF prediction. The Multi-agent system achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of **0.29 MW/m²** and an R² score of **0.93**, directly matching the performance of state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural networks developed by human experts (RMSE: 0.29 MW/m², R²: 0.93). The Single-agent system yielded slightly lower performance with an RMSE of 0.34 MW/m² and an R² of 0.91. Both LLM-generated models significantly surpassed the traditional CHF lookup table baseline, which recorded an RMSE of 0.58 MW/m² and an R² of 0.65.

**Impact**
This research marks a pivotal advancement in the automation of scientific computing, offering empirical evidence that LLM-based agents can replace manual workflows in high-stakes engineering environments. By demonstrating that the Multi-agent architecture can match expert-level performance in rigorous regression tasks while outperforming single-agent alternatives, the study addresses the generalization and scalability limitations of traditional data-driven methods. The successful integration of advanced modeling components—such as hyperparameter optimization and UQ—into a self-directed workflow establishes a new blueprint for applying autonomous agents to complex engineering challenges, potentially democratizing access to state-of-the-art modeling capabilities.
