## 📝 Executive Summary

Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) to hundreds of diverse continuous control tasks and robotic embodiments has historically been viewed as computationally prohibitive. While offline learning and behavior cloning offer efficiency, they often lack the adaptability required for robust decision-making and generalization to unseen scenarios. This research addresses the critical need for a unified system that moves beyond single-task training to enable massive multitasking, efficient data usage, and robust control across varied domains and action spaces.

The key innovation is **Newt**, a language-conditioned multitask world model built upon the TD-MPC2 architecture, formulated to function as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Technically, the model processes a composite state comprising low-dimensional states, image observations, and language instructions via CLIP-ViT/B embeddings, utilizing masking to handle varying action dimensionalities across tasks. The training pipeline adopts a foundation model approach: it begins with pretraining on demonstration data to establish task-aware representations and action priors, followed by joint online optimization where the agent interacts with all tasks simultaneously to refine the world model.

Evaluated on the newly introduced **MMBench**—comprising 200 diverse continuous control tasks across 10 domains—Newt achieved a normalized Average Score of **0.48–0.50** over 100 million environment steps. This performance significantly outperformed strong baselines, including Behavior Cloning (~0.1), Single-task BC (~0.0–0.1), PPO, and FastTD3. Crucially, the results demonstrated two distinct capabilities: robust open-loop control across a wide variety of scenarios, and rapid adaptation to unseen tasks, highlighting strong generalization properties. Ablation studies confirmed that while the model outperforms standard baselines even without demonstrations, its full potential is realized when using demos to enhance exploration, validating superior data efficiency.

This work carries significant implications for the robotics and RL communities by empirically validating that online RL can scale effectively to hundreds of diverse tasks, challenging the prevailing view that online methods are unscalable compared to offline approaches. By demonstrating the efficacy of integrating offline pretraining with online interaction within a world model framework, the research establishes a viable pathway toward developing general-purpose robotic controllers. To facilitate future progress, the authors have released the MMBench environments, demonstration datasets, and a full open-source codebase with checkpoints.
