## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical bottleneck of automating feature selection in high-dimensional datasets, a challenge often referred to as the "curse of dimensionality." Traditional feature engineering methods are frequently static and computationally expensive, struggling to balance the trade-off between feature relevance and redundancy. This failure often leads to model overfitting and poor generalization on unseen data. The paper underscores the urgent need for dynamic, automated frameworks capable of identifying optimal feature subsets without the prohibitive computational cost of evaluating vast feature spaces.

The core innovation is the comprehensive application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) architectures to treat feature selection as a sequential decision-making process. The author introduces a hierarchy of technical frameworks organized by function:
*   To enhance efficiency, the **Monte Carlo-based Reinforced Feature Selection (MCRFS)** utilizes early-stopping mechanisms.
*   For handling complex data interactions, the study proposes **Multi-Agent RL (MARLFS)** using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and **Interactive RL (IRFS)** that integrates external heuristics with decision trees.
*   The methodology employs **Hybrid Techniques** that apply sequential feature scanning and Convolutional Auto-Encoders.
*   Finally, the paper presents a novel **Dual-Agent framework** for simultaneous feature and instance selection, and a **Cascading Reinforced Agent system** that creates a self-optimizing loop for iterative refinement.

The study evaluates the efficacy of these methods using rigorous metrics. The findings demonstrate that RL-based approaches yield measurable improvements in model generalization compared to traditional feature engineering techniques. Specifically, the MCRFS framework is shown to effectively lower computational loads, while the Cascading and Dual-Agent architectures exhibit superior solution quality. This work significantly influences the field by establishing RL as a robust alternative to conventional feature selection algorithms, shifting the paradigm from static filtering to dynamic, learned optimization.

## Key Findings

*   **Balanced Exploration:** Reinforcement learning (RL) facilitates the balanced exploration of optimal feature subsets through both single-agent and multi-agent models, significantly improving model generalization and computational efficiency.
*   **Interactive Enhancement:** Interactive RL, when combined with decision trees and diversified teaching strategies, enhances feature knowledge, state representation, and selection efficiency.
*   **Computational Reduction:** Monte Carlo-based reinforced feature selection (MCRFS) effectively reduces computational burdens by utilizing early-stopping mechanisms and reward-level interactive strategies.
*   **Complex Data Navigation:** A dual-agent RL framework can successfully navigate complex data spaces by collectively selecting features and instances, thereby capturing critical interactions between them.
*   **Self-Optimization:** Cascading reinforced agents create a self-optimizing framework that iteratively improves the feature space, outperforming traditional feature engineering methods.
