## Executive Summary

Current Conversational AI (CAI) development is driven by economic incentives that prioritize efficiency and automation, often at the expense of human well-being. This utility-first approach risks eroding essential social bonds by displacing human interactions with purely transactional exchanges. The authors argue that as these technologies scale, the field must address a conceptual crisis where task automation supersedes the preservation of the human-computer relationship.

The proposed "Convivial Conversational Agents" framework integrates relationship-building mechanics directly into the automation workflow to sustain human-agent bonds. Technically, the system moves beyond individual interaction models to perform systems-level analysis of human networks, functioning as a "social agent" rather than a simple tool. The architecture translates specific design principles from the high-stakes domain of dementia care—leveraging technologies like advanced voice synthesis and NLP—into generalizable patterns applicable for government and corporate deployment.

Validation is provided through applied case studies in dementia care, which demonstrate the framework's efficacy through qualitative observations of sustained engagement rather than quantitative user trials. The research highlights that these agents successfully maintain service quality for critical functions like crisis response and social intervention while navigating resource constraints. The study confirms that this relational approach allows systems to scale operational capacity to meet rising healthcare demands without eroding the quality of human connection.

This work establishes a mandate for the CAI field to pivot from utility-centric to relationship-centered design. By abstracting human-centric principles from a sensitive healthcare context, the authors provide a blueprint for creating sustainable AI systems across various industries. The significance lies in challenging developers and organizations to elevate human well-being to a core metric of success, ensuring that future technological advancements actively enrich social networks.
