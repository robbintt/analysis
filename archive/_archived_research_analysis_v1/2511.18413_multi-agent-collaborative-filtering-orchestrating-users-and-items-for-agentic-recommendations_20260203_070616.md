## 📑 Executive Summary

Current LLM-based recommendation systems struggle to effectively utilize collaborative signals—the interaction histories between users and items that are fundamental to traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF). Furthermore, existing agentic recommenders often rely on generic, single-agent architectures that treat users and items as passive data points rather than active participants. This creates a significant design gap where these systems fail to leverage the full potential of multi-agent collaboration, resulting in suboptimal personalization and an inability to adaptively reason about complex user preferences.

This paper introduces **Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF)**, the first framework to bridge traditional CF concepts with LLM-based multi-agent systems. MACF instantiates similar users and relevant items as autonomous User and Item agents, respectively, all coordinated by a central Orchestrator Agent. Technically, the system employs an orchestration loop featuring Dynamic Agent Recruitment (DAR) to select relevant participants and Personalized Collaboration Instructions (PCI) to guide interactions. A critical technical component is Agentic Tool Use (ATU), which enables agents to actively call retrieval tools (e.g., `GetSimilarUsers`) for historical reasoning and alignment. This architecture allows agents to perform specific capabilities such as iterative refinement and active information retrieval, transforming static preference aggregation into a dynamic, agentic workflow.

Evaluations on Amazon datasets across three domains demonstrated MACF's superiority over strong agentic baselines. The framework achieved strong absolute performance metrics, including an N@10 of **0.7668** on the Music dataset and an H@10 of **0.5238** on the Clothing dataset. Ablation studies quantified the importance of specific components: removing Dynamic Agent Recruitment significantly degraded ranking quality on the Music dataset; removing Agentic Tool Use (ATU) caused the largest performance drop in Hit Ratio; and the absence of Personalized Collaboration Instructions resulted in consistent performance declines across all tested domains.

This research represents a significant advancement in agentic recommender systems by establishing a direct analogy between CF algorithms and multi-agent collaboration. It moves the field beyond generic, single-agent pipelines toward a comprehensive ecosystem where users and items are active, reasoning entities.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Superior Performance:** The proposed MACF framework outperforms strong agentic recommendation baselines.
*   **Cross-Domain Validity:** The framework's advantages were validated on datasets from three distinct domains.
*   **Efficacy of Dynamic Collaboration:** Dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instructions yield better results than static preference aggregation methods.
*   **Utilization of Collaborative Signals:** By instantiating users and items as agents, the system effectively leverages collaborative signals from interaction history.

## 🧪 Methodology

The researchers proposed the **Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF)** framework, which operates on four core pillars:

1.  **Agent Instantiation:** Identifying similar users and relevant items as individual LLM agents equipped with unique profiles.
2.  **Agent Capabilities:** Agents are autonomous, possess the ability to call retrieval tools, suggest items, and interact with one another.
3.  **Centralized Orchestration:** A central orchestrator agent manages the system adaptively to ensure coherent workflow.
4.  **Dynamic Management:** Facilitating collaboration via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instructions.

## 📝 Contributions

*   **Novel Framework Design:** Introduced MACF, the first framework to draw a direct analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration.
*   **Addressing Design Gaps:** Identified and addressed the lack of recommendation-oriented design and inability to utilize collaborative signals in existing agentic recommenders.
*   **Advancement of Agentic Workflows:** Moved beyond generic single-agent pipelines by proposing a multi-agent ecosystem where users and items are active participants rather than passive data points.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### System Architecture
MACF bridges Collaborative Filtering with LLM multi-agent systems by treating similar users and relevant items as autonomous agents.

*   **User Agents:** Responsible for alignment reasoning and generating suggestions.
*   **Item Agents:** Responsible for historical reasoning and retrieval tasks.
*   **Orchestrator Agent:** Responsible for system coordination and aggregation of results.

### Orchestration Loop
The system utilizes a loop consisting of four stages:
1.  **Dynamic Agent Recruitment:** Selecting relevant participants on the fly.
2.  **Personalized Collaboration Instruction (PCI):** Guiding agent interactions with specific context.
3.  **Sufficiency Testing:** Determining if more information or rounds of discussion are needed.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Improving recommendations based on feedback.

### Implementation Specs
*   **LLM:** GPT-4o (Temperature 0.3)
*   **Embeddings:** BGE-M3
*   **Services:** MCP services via async HTTP stream
*   **Retrieval Tools:** `GetSimilarUsers` and `RetrieveByQuery`

## 📊 Results

Experiments were conducted on Amazon datasets (Clothing, Beauty, Music) measuring **H@10** (Hit Ratio at 10) and **N@10** (NDCG at 10).

*   **Overall Performance:** The full MACF model achieved the highest performance across most metrics.
*   **Ablation Study - PCI:** Removing Personalized Collaboration Instructions caused consistent performance drops across domains.
*   **Ablation Study - DAR:** Removing Dynamic Agent Recruitment (DAR) significantly hurt ranking quality (N@10), notably on the **Music** dataset (0.7668 → **0.7129**).
*   **Ablation Study - ATU:** Removing Agentic Tool Use (ATU) led to the largest drop in Hit Ratio (H@10), particularly on **Clothing** (0.5238 → **0.4300**).
