## Executive Summary

This paper addresses a critical reliability gap in Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning (HITL-RL): the human tendency toward **"automation bias,"** where users erroneously assume their feedback improves the system. In standard interactive learning, human feedback is often noisy or flawed, yet interface designs typically present updated policies in isolation. This lack of comparative context prevents users from discerning whether an update is beneficial or detrimental, leading to poor trust calibration and potential system degradation. This opacity represents an urgent safety challenge for high-stakes applications, such as autonomous vehicles or medical support systems, where undetected policy deterioration resulting from bad feedback can have catastrophic real-world consequences.

The authors introduce **"salient-contrast demonstrations,"** a novel interaction technique designed to shift user evaluation from static model assessment to the analysis of behavioral deltas. Technically, the method leverages Q-values to algorithmically identify specific contexts where the original and updated policies disagree most significantly. Rather than visualizing the updated policy alone or in random states, the system generates contrastive explanations by simulating agent behavior within these high-disagreement "salient" states. This approach explicitly isolates and visualizes the specific changes in decision-making logic caused by the human's feedback, allowing users to directly verify the impact of their input.

In a controlled experiment with 240 participants, the researchers tested salient-contrast demonstrations against three baselines: no demonstration, same-context demonstration, and random-context demonstration. The salient-contrast method enabled users to correctly identify whether an update was helpful or harmful with **86% accuracy**, significantly outperforming random-context (68%) and same-context (72%) demonstrations. Furthermore, the method dramatically improved the detection of harmful updates; participants using salient-contrast contrasts were significantly less likely to accept deteriorating policies, reducing error rates by approximately **34 percentage points** compared to control conditions. These improvements were statistically significant with **p < 0.001**, confirming the method's efficacy in mitigating automation bias.

This research fundamentally shifts the design paradigm for Intelligent User Interfaces (IUIs) by establishing the assessment of model updates—rather than static performance—as the critical challenge for trustworthy AI. By providing empirical evidence that comparative visualization handles unreliable feedback loops effectively, the paper offers a concrete pathway to preventing the accumulation of errors in autonomous systems. The findings dictate that future interface designs must prioritize algorithmic selection of contrasting scenarios to ensure robustness. This connection between interface transparency and system safety is vital for the development of reliable human-AI collaboration, ensuring that users can maintain appropriate trust levels even when their own feedback is imperfect.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Communication:** Salient-contrast demonstrations significantly outperformed other communication methods (no demo, same-context, random-context), improving participants' ability to detect whether an update was helpful or harmful.
*   **Bias Mitigation:** Visualizing updates through salient contrasts successfully mitigated the user bias toward assuming that human feedback is always beneficial.
*   **Trust Calibration:** The use of salient-contrast demonstrations supported better trust calibration across different contexts for the users compared to baseline methods.
*   **Comparative Assessment:** Assessing the comparison between the original and updated policies is a more effective design strategy than evaluating a single updated model in isolation.

## Methodology

The study utilized a **controlled user experiment** involving a gridworld environment where participants provided feedback to a reinforcement learning agent.

*   **Task:** Participants were tasked with comparing the agent's original policy against its updated policy to determine the efficacy of the update.
*   **Design:** The researchers evaluated four specific strategies for communicating model updates:
    1.  **No demonstration (Control)**
    2.  **Same-context demonstration**
    3.  **Random-context demonstration**
    4.  **Salient-contrast demonstration (Proposed)**

## Technical Details

The paper proposes a framework for **Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning (HITL-RL)** operating in a grid-world environment.

*   **Policy Management:** It utilizes a bank of pre-trained policies rather than online fine-tuning.
*   **Communication Strategies:** The approach compares four strategies:
    *   *Control:* No demonstration provided.
    *   *Same-Context Demonstration:* Shows behavior in the current context.
    *   *Random-Context Demonstration:* Shows behavior in a randomly selected state.
    *   *Salient-Contrast Demonstration:* The proposed method.
*   **Algorithm Selection:** The Salient-Contrast method uses **contrastive explanations based on Q-values** to algorithmically select contexts that highlight the most informative differences or disagreements between original and updated policies.
