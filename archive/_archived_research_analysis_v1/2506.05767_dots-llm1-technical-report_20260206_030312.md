## Executive Summary

The research addresses the escalating computational costs and resource demands associated with training and deploying state-of-the-art dense Large Language Models (LLMs). As model sizes grow to achieve higher performance, the inference costs and memory requirements of dense architectures become prohibitive, limiting accessibility and practical deployment. Furthermore, there is an ongoing industry debate regarding the necessity of synthetic data to scale models effectively, which introduces complexity and potential quality control issues in data pipelines.

The core innovation is the development of `dots.llm1`, a 142 billion parameter sparse decoder-only Transformer built on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. The model employs a DeepSeekMoE architecture comprising 128 routed experts and 2 shared experts, activating only 14 billion parameters per input token to maximize efficiency.

The technical approach eliminates the need for auxiliary loss in load balancing by utilizing a dynamic bias adjustment strategy with FP32 gating precision. Additionally, the team developed a rigorous data processing pipeline that curates 11.2 trillion high-quality tokens with a strict 1:1 Chinese-to-English ratio, explicitly excluding synthetic data. Training was conducted using the Cybertron framework over Megatron-Core, featuring a custom Grouped GEMM optimization aligned to WGMMA instruction shapes.

The `dots.llm1` model achieves performance parity with the state-of-the-art dense model Qwen2.5-72B, demonstrating that sparse architectures can match dense counterparts without sacrificing capability. The custom kernel optimizations yielded significant performance gains, achieving an average forward speed-up of 14.00% and backward speed-up of 6.68% compared to NVIDIA Transformer Engine v2.1, with a peak forward speed-up of 24.68%. The training process maintained perfect load balance with zero token drops, and the final model supports efficient inference on a single node with 8 GPUs, validating the architecture's cost-effectiveness.

This work significantly impacts the field by providing a viable, cost-efficient alternative to dense LLMs, enabling high-performance model deployment on reduced hardware infrastructure. By validating that competitive performance can be achieved using only real data (11.2T tokens) through meticulous processing, the paper challenges the prevailing assumption that synthetic data is required for large-scale training. Furthermore, the decision to open-source intermediate training checkpoints at one trillion token intervals offers the research community an unprecedented resource to analyze learning trajectories and internal dynamics, paving the way for more transparent and efficient future model development.
