## Executive Summary
Current approaches to tool integration in Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which depends on static, pre-collected demonstrations of tool usage. This method is fundamentally limited because it restricts models to mimicking specific patterns found in training data rather than learning optimal strategies for tool interaction. Consequently, models often fail to generalize to novel scenarios or determine the most effective moments to utilize external computational resources.

This paper addresses this critical need by introducing **ToRL (Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning)**, a novel framework that shifts the training paradigm from SFT to reinforcement learning. Unlike traditional methods, ToRL scales RL directly from base models—specifically Qwen2.5-Math architectures—without requiring prior SFT on tool-use trajectories. The framework employs an iterative, reward-driven loop consisting of natural language reasoning, code generation, and tool execution. This allows the model to update its trajectory dynamically based on computational feedback, learning optimal policies through trial and error.

The significance of this research lies in its validation of reinforcement learning as a superior method for tool integration compared to supervised approaches. By establishing new state-of-the-art benchmarks on mathematical reasoning tasks, ToRL provides a robust blueprint for developing agentic systems capable of sophisticated tool use. Furthermore, the study offers critical insights into emergent capabilities, demonstrating that complex behaviors—such as strategic tool invocation, self-regulation, and dynamic switching between computational and analytical reasoning—can arise spontaneously from reward maximization.
