## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
Achieving reliable **Level 5 autonomous driving (AD)** faces critical bottlenecks in reasoning, planning, and handling long-tail edge cases. Traditional modular and end-to-end systems struggle with these complexities. Additionally, acquiring real-world data for rare, safety-critical scenarios is both costly and dangerous. The research posits that a paradigm shift from purely discriminative models to **Generative AI (GenAI)** is essential to solve content creation, simulation, and cognitive reasoning challenges.

### **Innovation**
The study introduces a comprehensive **taxonomic framework** mapping modern generative architectures to the specific needs of the autonomous driving pipeline. It provides a technical synthesis of foundational models—**VAEs**, **GANs**, **Diffusion Models**, and **LLMs**—aligning them with AD tasks ranging from low-level sensor simulation to high-level planning. Key innovations include utilizing **NeRFs** and **3D Gaussian Splatting** for 4D scene reconstruction and diffusion models for trajectory prediction, creating a unified architectural view for integration into simulation loops and cognitive stacks.

### **Results**
As a survey paper, this work does not present novel quantitative experimental results. Instead, it establishes definitive **evaluation benchmarks** and performance criteria for future GenAI deployment. The proposed framework evaluates performance based on four pillars:
*   Real-World Perception
*   Interactive Agents
*   Simulation Fidelity (Reality Gap)
*   Cognitive Alignment

Key success metrics include generalization across long-tail scenarios, safety metrics adherence, real-time computational efficiency, and effective **Sim-to-Real transfer**.

### **Impact**
This research provides a vital roadmap for transitioning from classical AD architectures to **GenAI-native systems**, influencing academic and industrial strategies. By identifying gaps in safety metrics and theoretical assurances, the authors accelerate the development of evaluation standards required for regulatory compliance. The inclusion of an actively maintained repository ensures this serves as a foundational resource for navigating the socio-technical complexities of deploying generative models in safety-critical transportation networks.
