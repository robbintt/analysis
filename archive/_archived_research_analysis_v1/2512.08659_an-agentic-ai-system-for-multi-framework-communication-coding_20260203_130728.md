## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
Clinical communication analysis faces a significant bottleneck due to the reliance on manual human annotation. Mapping unstructured patient-provider dialogues to structured codes is labor-intensive, prone to inter-rater inconsistency, and difficult to scale. Existing Large Language Model (LLM) solutions are typically restricted to single-task applications, limiting their utility in complex clinical environments requiring multiple distinct communication frameworks simultaneously.

### **Innovation**
The researchers introduce **MOSAIC**, an agentic AI architecture built on LangGraph designed for multi-framework adaptability. The system orchestrates a workflow of four specialized core agents:
*   **Plan Agent:** Defines coding strategies.
*   **Update Agent:** Maintains dynamic context.
*   **Annotation Agents:** Execute the mapping of dialogue to codes.
*   **Verification Agent:** Ensures output accuracy.
This structure separates planning, maintenance, and verification, allowing for dynamic adaptation to various taxonomic frameworks.

### **Results**
MOSAIC achieved high performance in validation studies, securing an overall **F1 score of 0.928** against gold-standard human annotations. The system showed particular strength in the **Rheumatology domain (F1 = 0.962)** and excelled in coding "Patient Behavior." Ablation studies confirmed that the agentic architecture outperforms standard baseline benchmarking methods.

### **Impact**
This research provides a scalable, automated remedy to the prohibitive costs and inconsistencies of manual annotation. By introducing a structured agentic workflow, MOSAIC improves coding accuracy and enhances the interpretability of the AI's decision-making process. This establishes a new standard for applying agentic AI to multi-faceted clinical tasks, potentially enabling real-time analysis of provider-patient communication.

## Methodology

The researchers developed the MOSAIC system to map unstructured dialogue to structured codes across multiple taxonomic frameworks. The methodology involved:

*   **Architecture:** Implementation of a LangGraph-based architecture orchestrating four specialized core agents (Plan, Update, Annotation, Verification).
*   **Data:** Utilization of 26 gold-standard annotated transcripts for training and 50 transcripts for testing.
*   **Evaluation:** Performance measurement against annotations from trained human coders across two distinct clinical domains (Rheumatology and OB/GYN).
