## 📄 Executive Summary

As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow in capability, aligning them with human values remains a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs) serve as the essential proxy for human preferences within frameworks like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), acting as the mechanism by which LLMs learn to be helpful, harmless, and honest. However, the rapid expansion of RM research has led to a fragmented landscape characterized by diverse methodologies—ranging from discriminative scoring to generative judging—and a lack of standardized evaluation protocols.

This paper addresses the urgent need to synthesize this disparate field, providing clarity on how RMs are constructed, deployed, and evaluated to ensure LLMs adhere to complex safety and reasoning standards. The study’s primary contribution is a holistic taxonomy that decomposes the Reward Model workflow into three distinct stages: **Preference Collection**, **Reward Modeling**, and **Usage**.

Technically, this framework categorizes Preference Collection by source (Human vs. AI/RLAIF) and efficiency optimizations (Active Learning). It classifies Reward Modeling architectures into **Discriminative** (scalar/classifier heads), **Generative** (LLM-as-a-judge), and **Implicit** models (such as Direct Preference Optimization). Furthermore, the taxonomy distinguishes between **Outcome Reward Models (ORMs)** and **Process Reward Models (PRMs)**, and details Usage strategies including data selection for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and robust policy training via ensemble methods.

The authors supplement this structural analysis with a public repository of curated resources, offering a centralized hub for the community. While the paper is a survey rather than an experimental study, it synthesizes key evaluation findings to establish standard benchmarks for RM performance. The authors identify principal evaluation metrics such as `RewardBench`, which utilizes human-verified trios to assess chat, reasoning, and safety; `RM-Bench` for large-scale evaluation; and `ProcessBench` specifically for PRMs.

Qualitative results aggregated from the literature demonstrate that advanced RMs significantly enhance dialogue safety by strictly adhering to the "3H" principles (Honest, Harmless, Helpful). Additionally, the survey highlights that PRMs specifically improve logical consistency in mathematical and coding tasks, while generative RMs offer better alignment in retrieval and recommendation systems by capturing nuanced user preferences better than traditional metrics.

This work provides a foundational roadmap for both researchers and practitioners navigating the complex ecosystem of LLM alignment. By defining a common taxonomy and identifying critical benchmarks, the paper facilitates the comparison of future RM advancements. Crucially, the survey reveals significant research gaps, specifically regarding the **efficiency** of RM training and the **robustness** of models against adversarial attacks, thereby directing future academic inquiry.
