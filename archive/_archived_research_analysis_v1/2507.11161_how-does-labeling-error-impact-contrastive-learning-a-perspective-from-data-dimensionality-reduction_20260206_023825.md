## Executive Summary

Contrastive learning relies on the fundamental assumption that augmented views of the same image retain semantic consistency, allowing them to serve as positive pairs. However, this paper identifies a critical vulnerability in this paradigm: aggressive augmentation strategies, such as Random Resized Crop (RRC), frequently violate this label consistency assumption. This violation introduces "labeling error," where semantically distinct views are incorrectly treated as positive pairs (false positives). These false positives act as noise within the learning process, significantly degrading downstream classification performance. The paper addresses the need to understand and mitigate the impact of these inevitable errors caused by standard data augmentation practices.

The authors introduce a theoretical framework to quantify the relationship between labeling error and classification risk, decomposing risk into components for true positives, false positives, and negative samples. Their core innovation is the application of Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the original data as a mechanism to filter out false positive samples before training begins. The study highlights a "double-edged sword" effect: while SVD effectively reduces the labeling error rate ($\alpha$), it simultaneously reduces the connectivity of the augmentation graph ($\lambda_{k+1}$), which is essential for learning. The research theoretically balances this trade-off by bounding the downstream classification error and recommending specific strategies—such as moderate embedding dimensions (512 or 1024), weak augmentation, and data inflation—to maintain graph connectivity while minimizing noise.

Empirical experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 using ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 architectures validate the proposed approach. The study found that moderate SVD truncation ($q=30$) yields accuracy gains comparable to data inflation, whereas aggressive truncation ($q=10$) significantly degrades performance. Optimizing the embedding dimension yielded substantial improvements; specifically, increasing the dimension from 128 to 1024 improved top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 from 67.71% to 69.09%, CIFAR-100 from 35.00% to 37.78%, and STL-10 from 72.35% to 73.88%. These optimizations resulted in an absolute accuracy improvement ranging from 1.4% to 2.8% over low-dimensional baselines.

This research provides a significant theoretical contribution by formalizing how labeling errors from augmentation propagate to impact classification risk in self-supervised learning. It moves beyond heuristic observations by offering a mathematically grounded intervention (SVD) and a clear explanation of the trade-offs involved in dimensionality reduction. For practitioners, the study establishes concrete guidelines for selecting embedding dimensions, augmentation strengths, and inflation levels to optimize model performance. By bridging the gap between theory and practice, this work enables the development of more robust contrastive learning systems that are resilient to the noise inherent in aggressive data augmentation.

## Key Findings

*   **Label Consistency Violations:** Aggressive augmentation strategies, specifically Random Resized Crop (RRC), cause violations of the label consistency assumption. This creates labeling errors that significantly degrade downstream classification performance in contrastive learning.
*   **SVD as a Mitigation Strategy:** Applying data dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to the original data can effectively filter out false positive samples and mitigate the negative impacts of labeling error.
*   **The "Double-Edged Sword" Effect:** SVD presents a trade-off: it reduces labeling error but simultaneously reduces the connectivity of the augmentation graph, which can potentially lead to deterioration in downstream classification accuracy.
*   **Optimal Configuration:** To balance the trade-off between reducing labeling error and maintaining graph connectivity, the study recommends using **moderate embedding dimensions** (e.g., 512 or 1024), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD.

## Methodology

The study employs a rigorous combination of theoretical derivation and empirical experimentation:

1.  **Theoretical Framework:** The authors established a theoretical framework to analyze the relationship between labeling error and downstream classification risk.
2.  **Intervention:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) was applied as a data dimensionality reduction method on original datasets to filter out false positive samples.
3.  **Evaluation:** The evaluation tested how modifying the embedding dimension and augmentation strategies impacts the augmentation graph connectivity and overall model performance.

## Technical Details

### Problem Statement
Aggressive augmentation in contrastive learning creates false positive samples (labeling error), acting as noise that degrades model performance.

### Proposed Solution
Apply **Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** to the original data before learning to filter out noise.

### Theoretical Framework
*   **Risk Decomposition:** Classification risk is decomposed into variance components for:
    *   True positives ($V(f(x))$)
    *   False positives ($V^-(f(x))$)
    *   Negative samples ($V(f(x-))$)
*   **Graph Analysis:** Utilizes an augmentation graph $G$ and normalized graph Laplacian $L$ to analyze connectivity.

### The Trade-off
The method highlights a specific dynamic where SVD reduces the labeling error rate ($\alpha$) but may reduce graph connectivity ($\lambda_{k+1}$).

### Key Theorem
**Theorem 4.9** provides an upper bound for downstream classification error:
$$E(f^*, W^*) \le \frac{4\alpha_q}{\lambda_{k+1,q}} + 8\alpha_q$$

### Loss Functions
*   $L_{InfoNCE}$
*   Spectral contrastive loss $L_{spe}$

## Results

Experiments were conducted on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **STL-10** using **ResNet-18/50** with weak augmentation, measuring top-1 accuracy.

### Impact of Truncation ($q$)
*   **Moderate Truncation ($q=30$):** Achieved comparable or better accuracy than data inflation. (e.g., $L_{spe}$ accuracy 71.64% vs baseline 71.54% on CIFAR-10).
*   **Aggressive Truncation ($q=10$):** Significantly reduced performance (dropping from 71.64% to 67.83%).

### Impact of Embedding Dimension ($k$)
Optimal performance was found at moderate dimensions (512 or 1024):

| Dataset | Low Dim ($k=128$) | Optimal Dim ($k=1024$) | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CIFAR-10** | 67.71% | 69.09% | +1.38% |
| **CIFAR-100** | 35.00% | 37.78% | +2.78% |
| **STL-10** | 72.35% | 73.88% | +1.53% |

Optimizing SVD and embedding dimension resulted in an approximate **1.4% to 2.8% absolute improvement** in accuracy over low-dimensional baselines.
