## Executive Summary

This research addresses the emergent challenge of implicit bias accumulation within Large Language Models (LLMs) utilizing Long-term Memory (LTM) mechanisms. Unlike static architectures, agentic LLMs with LTM face a feedback loop where bias intensifies dynamically over extended interaction lifecycles, rather than remaining constant. The study characterizes this as a temporal risk where bias not only accumulates but also propagates across disparate social domains—spilling over from, for instance, gender contexts into nationality decisions. This issue is critical because conventional static mitigation strategies, such as one-shot system prompting, exhibit rapid decay in effectiveness, rendering them insufficient for managing the evolving safety landscape of persistent, memory-augmented agents.

The authors introduce two primary innovations: the **Decision-based Implicit Bias (DIB) Benchmark** and the **Dynamic Memory Tagging (DMT)** framework. The DIB Benchmark standardizes evaluation using a dataset of 3,776 scenarios spanning nine social domains, enabling the systematic quantification of bias in long-horizon interactions. The core innovation, DMT, functions as an agentic intervention that enforces fairness constraints at memory "write time." Operating within the memory management layer, DMT classifies or tags memories during storage to prevent the consolidation of biased associations in vector stores or memory graphs. This architectural shift moves beyond static output filtering to active, dynamic management of information retrieval and storage in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and long-context systems.

The study rigorously evaluated six state-of-the-art LLMs across three representative memory architectures (including Mem0, LongRoPE, and Graph RAG) using the DIB Benchmark. Simulations demonstrated a clear dichotomy in performance: static mitigation strategies failed to prevent bias resurfacing, showing rapid decay in effectiveness as interaction depth increased. In contrast, the DMT framework achieved a substantial reduction in bias accumulation rates across the 3,776 test scenarios. Crucially, DMT effectively curtailed cross-domain bias propagation, preventing spillover effects where bias in one domain negatively impacts unrelated categories. The results confirm that implicit bias in LTM systems behaves as a dynamic variable that requires continuous architectural intervention rather than static correction.

This paper significantly reframes LLM safety from a static classification problem to a dynamic systems challenge. By identifying memory as a primary vector for risk amplification, the authors establish a new sub-field focused on the temporal evolution of bias in agentic AI. The introduction of the DIB Benchmark provides the research community with a necessary tool for longitudinal fairness evaluation, while the DMT framework offers a viable architectural solution for safer, persistent AI systems. These findings suggest that future deployments must integrate fairness constraints directly into memory management layers to ensure reliability and ethical compliance over extended usage lifecycles.

## Key Findings

*   **Dynamic Intensification:** Implicit bias in LLMs equipped with long-term memory dynamically intensifies over extended interaction lifecycles, rather than remaining static.
*   **Cross-Domain Propagation:** Bias propagates across unrelated social domains (e.g., from gender to nationality), negatively affecting broader decision-making processes.
*   **Failure of Static Mitigation:** Standard static mitigation strategies, such as system prompting, provide only limited and short-lived debiasing effects.
*   **Efficacy of DMT:** The proposed **Dynamic Memory Tagging (DMT)** method substantially reduces bias accumulation and effectively curtails cross-domain propagation.

## Methodology

The research approach involved three primary components to evaluate the evolution of bias in long-term memory systems:

1.  **Benchmark Construction:** The researchers built the **Decision-based Implicit Bias (DIB) Benchmark**, comprising a dataset of 3,776 scenarios spanning nine distinct social domains.
2.  **Simulation Framework:** A realistic long-horizon simulation framework was utilized to evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs. These models were integrated with three representative memory architectures to test diverse configurations.
3.  **Comparative Analysis:** The study performed a direct comparison between baseline static system-level prompting strategies and the proposed Dynamic Memory Tagging (DMT) intervention to measure efficacy over time.

*   **Novel Intervention Framework:** Proposed **Dynamic Memory Tagging (DMT)**, a new agentic intervention framework designed to enforce fairness constraints at the memory write time.

## Results

*   **Qualitative Outcomes:** While specific quantitative metrics were not detailed in the source text, qualitative findings highlight a significant performance gap between control groups and the intervention group.
*   **Static Strategy Decay:** Standard static mitigation strategies showed rapid decay in effectiveness, failing to maintain debiasing over long interaction horizons.
*   **DMT Performance:** The Dynamic Memory Tagging (DMT) framework is claimed to substantially reduce the rate of bias accumulation.
*   **Propagation Control:** DMT successfully curtailed the cross-domain propagation of bias, isolating biased associations to their original contexts.
*   **General Conclusion:** The study confirms that bias in LLM long-term memory is a dynamic variable that intensifies over time and requires dynamic intervention strategies.
