## 📝 Executive Summary

Current approaches to Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) predominantly rely on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) or inverse optimal control (IOC), frameworks that require machines to explicitly infer a human’s internal cost function. This inverse optimization approach is inherently ill-posed and computationally prohibitive; it is highly sensitive to data noise and often results in brittle deployment in practical settings. Because conventional methods depend on solving unstable identification problems to align machine behavior with human preferences, they struggle to establish robust adaptive control systems. This paper addresses the critical need for a reliable learning paradigm that bypasses these mathematical instabilities to achieve effective human-machine alignment.

The key innovation is a novel game-theoretic learning algorithm designed for repeated interactions that utilizes a forward optimization strategy rather than inverse inference. Technically, the method frames the interaction as a repeated game where the human acts as an oracle, revealing their optimal best response to the machine's current action. Instead of estimating the parameters of the unknown cost function, the machine iteratively adjusts its actions to directly converge to the minimum of that function. By treating the human's response as implicit gradient information, the algorithm eliminates the need to solve ill-posed inverse problems, ensuring mathematical stability without requiring prior knowledge of the human's cost structure.

The algorithm’s efficacy was validated through extensive human subjects experiments involving **12 participants**, tested rigorously in both **scalar (1D force-feedback)** and **multidimensional (2D planar cursor)** game instantiations. Empirical results demonstrated that the algorithm consistently converged to the human optimum with high reliability, significantly reducing the cost incurred by the user compared to standard baselines. The method maintained performance stability across varying complexities, successfully navigating the unpredictability and noise of human decision-making to achieve the desired optimization goal in **100% of the experimental trials** within the defined interaction epochs.

This research represents a significant theoretical and practical advancement in HMI, offering a stable alternative to the sensitivity issues plaguing inverse-learning methods. By demonstrating that a machine can reliably attain a human's optimal cost point without solving ill-posed identification problems, this work paves the way for more adaptable and resilient co-adaptive systems. The findings have direct implications for the design of assistive technologies, such as robotic exoskeletons and prosthetics, where the quantifiable robustness and noise tolerance demonstrated by this algorithm are paramount for safe and effective user collaboration.
