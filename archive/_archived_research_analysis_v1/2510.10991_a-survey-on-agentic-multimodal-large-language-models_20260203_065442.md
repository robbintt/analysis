## 📝 Executive Summary

> This paper addresses the critical transition in artificial intelligence from static, passive systems—which merely respond to prompts—to dynamic, proactive agentic AI capable of autonomous decision-making. As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) evolve, the distinction between conventional agents with fixed workflows and truly agentic systems capable of long-horizon planning and sustained goal-directed behavior has become blurred. The research highlights the urgent need for a unified definition and organizational structure to make sense of this rapidly expanding and fragmented landscape, ensuring that the field can systematically approach the development of systems that possess internal intelligence, tool-use capabilities, and environmental interaction.

The authors introduce a comprehensive conceptual framework that mathematically formalizes Agentic MLLMs using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Unlike traditional agents defined by static workflows of fixed function sequences, Agentic MLLMs are characterized as autonomous decision-makers operating through dynamic state transitions and a policy ($\pi$) designed to maximize expected rewards. The survey organizes the field into three fundamental dimensions: **Internal Intelligence**, **External Tool Invocation**, and **Environment Interaction**. Furthermore, it details architectural distinctions between Dense MLLMs and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLLMs and outlines a rigorous six-step training pipeline ranging from foundational selection to reinforcement learning and evaluation.

As a comprehensive survey rather than an experimental study, this paper does not report original quantitative metrics, validation data, or benchmark scores. Instead, its primary result is the successful synthesis of 40 key citations, establishing a robust taxonomy that clarifies the current state of the art. The authors have effectively curated and categorized existing open-source training frameworks, datasets, and benchmarks. They have also established a dynamic tracking mechanism via a public GitHub repository ("Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs") to aggregate resources, providing the community with a centralized, up-to-date inventory of tools and literature in this domain.

This work serves as a foundational roadmap for the research community, bridging the gap between current multimodal capabilities and the broader goal of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). By providing a standardized definition and a clear organizational structure, the paper enables researchers to better distinguish between passive models and true agentic systems. The creation of a centralized, publicly maintained repository significantly lowers the barrier to entry for new researchers and facilitates collaboration. Ultimately, this survey shapes the future trajectory of AI by outlining critical downstream applications and research directions necessary to develop sophisticated, goal-oriented agents.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Mathematical Formalism (MDP Framework)
The paper distinguishes Agentic MLLMs from traditional agents using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework.

*   **Traditional Agents:** Rely on static workflows defined as fixed sequences of functions:
    $$Agent_{MLLM} = f_T \circ \dots \circ f_1(x_1)$$
*   **Agentic MLLMs:** Operate as autonomous decision-makers characterized by:
    *   **Dynamic State Transitions:** $s_{t+1} = \delta(s_t, a_t)$
    *   **Proactive Action Execution:** Via a policy $\pi$ where $a_t \sim \pi(a|s_t)$
    *   **Generalization Objectives:** Maximizing expected rewards:
        $$\pi^* = \text{argmax}_\pi \mathbb{E}_{(x)\sim D} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t; x) \right]$$

### Architectural Categorization
*   **Dense MLLMs:** Activate all parameters (e.g., LLaVA, Qwen2.5-VL).
*   **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLLMs:** Utilize sparse activation for efficiency.

### Training Pipeline
The paper outlines a six-step training pipeline:
1.  Foundational Selection
2.  Action Space Definition
3.  Continual Pre-training
4.  Supervised Fine-tuning
5.  Reinforcement Learning
6.  Evaluation
