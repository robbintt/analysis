## 📋 Executive Summary

> **Problem**  
> This research addresses a critical vulnerability in tabular machine learning models used for financial decision-making. The study exposes that these models are susceptible to gradient-based adversarial attacks, causing degradation beyond simple accuracy loss. Specifically, small input-level perturbations significantly harm statistical discrimination (fairness), model calibration (reliability), and the stability of financial risk metrics. This poses severe threats to economic stability and regulatory compliance, as production models may yield unreliable outputs and inequitable consumer treatment.

> **Innovation**  
> The study introduces a dataset-agnostic adversarial robustness pipeline tailored for tabular financial data. Its modular architecture features an **Attack Generation Module** using FGSM and PGD attacks with domain-bounded projectors, and a **Multi-Faceted Evaluation Engine** that assesses calibration and distribution drift (PSI, Wasserstein). Notably, a **Regulatory Output Layer** automates the generation of governance artifacts (e.g., economic confusion matrices) to bridge the gap between technical research and compliance needs.

> **Results**  
> Experimental results quantified statistically significant failures across a comprehensive set of metrics. Performance dropped in key indicators like AUC, KS statistic, and Gini Coefficient. Calibration reliability deteriorated, evidenced by increased Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Most critically, economic risk indicators (Expected Loss, VaR, Expected Shortfall) were compromised. While defense strategies like Robust PGD were implemented, they only achieved partial recovery, failing to fully restore original robustness.

> **Impact**  
> This paper broadens the understanding of adversarial risk by shifting focus from pure accuracy to a holistic view encompassing fairness, reliability, and economic stability. It provides empirical evidence on the limitations of current mitigation strategies, establishing a new standard for assessing model robustness in high-stakes environments. The "governance-ready" pipeline offers financial institutions a practical framework to document and mitigate the economic and ethical risks associated with their AI systems.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Performance Degradation:** Tabular machine learning models in financial contexts degrade significantly when subjected to gradient-based input perturbations.
*   **Beyond Accuracy:** Adversarial attacks negatively affect **statistical discrimination** (fairness) and **model calibration** (reliability), not just classification accuracy.
*   **Risk Instability:** The stability of essential financial risk metrics is compromised under adversarial conditions.
*   **Partial Mitigation:** While adversarial training can partially recover performance, it does **not** fully restore the model's robustness.
