## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical inefficiencies and performance degradation inherent in Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (MTKD) for Large Language Models (LLMs). While utilizing multiple teacher models theoretically allows a student to aggregate diverse knowledge, practical application often leads to "knowledge conflicts," where varying or contradictory reasoning rationales from different teachers confuse the student and degrade performance. Furthermore, standard MTKD imposes prohibitive computational demands due to the need to process outputs from multiple large teacher models simultaneously during training, creating a barrier for efficient model compression.

The core innovation is "Knowledge Purification" (KP), a framework designed to synthesize conflicting rationales into a single, unified rationale ($r_P$) to guide the student. Technically, this is operationalized through a modified loss function, $L_{MTKD-KP} = L_{PR} + \lambda L_{DL-KP}$. In this mathematical formulation, the Primary Response loss ($L_{PR}$) ensures the accuracy of the student's final answer, while the Purified Distillation Loss ($L_{DL-KP}$) aligns the student's reasoning process with the consolidated rationale $r_P$, balancing correctness and reasoning fidelity via the hyperparameter $\lambda$. The authors evaluate five purification architectures, with a specific focus on router-based methods—such as Plackett-Luce Ranking and Similarity-based Routers—which utilize semantic embeddings and cosine similarity to dynamically select the most appropriate teacher rationale, thereby filtering out noise.

Experimental validation using the TinyLLM framework, with teachers including Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, FLAN-T5 xlarge, and Llama 2-chat, demonstrated that Knowledge Purification effectively resolves the performance drop typically associated with adding more teachers. The study evaluated performance on Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) tasks—specifically OBQA, ARC, Riddle, and PQA—using Accuracy as the primary metric. Student models trained with KP consistently outperformed those trained using traditional multi-teacher approaches across these datasets. The results specifically highlighted that router-based purification methods offered the most robust generalization capabilities, confirming that consolidating knowledge into a single, high-quality rationale yields better student performance than exposing the student to all available teacher rationales.

The significance of this work lies in shifting the paradigm of model distillation from simple knowledge accumulation to intelligent knowledge consolidation. By resolving the conflicts inherent in multi-teacher setups, the research enables the practical use of ensembles of expert models to train smaller, more efficient student models without the resource penalty or noise of traditional methods. This advancement facilitates the deployment of high-performance lightweight models in resource-constrained environments and establishes routing-based purification as a critical component for future research in efficient LLM training and compression.
