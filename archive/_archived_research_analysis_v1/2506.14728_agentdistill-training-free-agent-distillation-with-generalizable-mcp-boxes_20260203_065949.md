## Executive Summary

The deployment of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents is often constrained by high computational costs and latency, limiting their practical scalability. While model distillation offers a potential solution by compressing capabilities into smaller models, existing methods primarily focus on static knowledge transfer and struggle with complex agentic behaviors. Traditional approaches typically require resource-intensive fine-tuning or step-by-step trajectory imitation to teach reasoning and tool use. These methods often fail to enable dynamic planning in novel environments and incur significant computational overhead.

**AgentDistill** addresses the critical gap of distilling full agentic capabilities—including planning, reasoning, and tool usage—into Small Language Models (SLMs) without the need for expensive training phases. It introduces a training-free agent distillation framework that diverges from traditional output alignment or trajectory replay.

The core innovation lies in the direct reuse of **Model-Context-Protocols (MCPs)**, which are structured, reusable task-solving modules autonomously generated by teacher agents (e.g., GPT-4o). Instead of learning to imitate the teacher's step-by-step actions, the student agent integrates these pre-constructed protocols directly. This mechanism allows the student agent to inherit sophisticated reasoning and tool-using capabilities dynamically, bypassing the need for gradient updates, parameter updates, or human intervention.

The framework was evaluated across rigorous Biomedical and Mathematical benchmarks, where Student agents built on Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen3-8B achieved performance comparable to advanced systems powered by GPT-4o. Specifically, AgentDistill-enabled SLMs matched the capabilities of the OctoTools system, marking a significant improvement over the baseline performance of small models. This advancement suggests a future where intelligent agents are both scalable and economically viable.

AgentDistill is a lightweight, training-free framework designed to distill capabilities from Large Language Model (LLM) agents to Small Language Model (SLM) agents.

**Key Components**

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Model-Context-Protocols (MCPs)** | Standardized two-way interfaces for context provision and external data access. |
| **Teacher Agents** | High-level models (e.g., GPT-4o) that generate self-contained, reusable MCP boxes encapsulating problem-solving skills. |
| **Student Agents** | Smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-8B) that integrate these boxes directly to inherit sophisticated capabilities. |

**Operational Workflow**
1.  Teacher agents generate MCP boxes for specific tasks.
2.  Student agents ingest these boxes without additional training or fine-tuning.
3.  Student agents utilize the embedded protocols to dynamically plan and act independently.
