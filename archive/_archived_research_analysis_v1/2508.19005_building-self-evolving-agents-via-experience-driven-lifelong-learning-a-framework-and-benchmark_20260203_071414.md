## Executive Summary

Current AI research is predominantly limited to optimizing static, pre-defined tasks, a paradigm that fails to capture the adaptive, continuous nature of human-like intelligence. This paper addresses the critical challenge of transitioning from isolated task optimization to creating open-ended agents capable of lifelong learning. This problem is significant because real-world intelligence requires agents to learn continuously through interaction, retaining and building upon past experiences to navigate dynamic environments rather than treating each task as an isolated event.

The authors introduce the **Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL) framework**, a novel architecture defined by four principles: *Experience Exploration*, *Long-term Memory Management*, *Skill Learning*, and *Knowledge Internalization*. Technically, the framework models environments as goal-conditional Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with multimodal state spaces and natural language actions. The core innovation lies in the Knowledge Architecture $K=(M, F)$, which segregates persistent Memory ($M$)—containing trajectory, declarative, and structural knowledge—from procedural Skills ($F$). The "Knowledge Internalization" mechanism functions by autonomously identifying recurring patterns within the explicit trajectory memory ($M_{traj}$) and abstracting them into reusable skills ($F$). This process transitions explicit experiences into implicit capabilities, allowing the agent to self-evolve by converting raw history into executable procedures.

The research validates the ELL framework through the **StuLife benchmark**, a comprehensive simulation modeling a holistic student journey through college. Evaluation results demonstrate that agents utilizing the ELL framework effectively accumulate long-term knowledge and successfully abstract skills in a dynamic, multi-stage environment. The benchmark highlights the system's ability to navigate complex scenarios requiring the integration of diverse experiences, showcasing the capacity of lifelong learning agents to outperform static models in environments that demand continuous adaptation and knowledge retention.

This research significantly influences the field by providing a formalized taxonomy and conceptual framework for building self-evolving agents, establishing a clear theoretical foundation for lifelong learning in AI. By releasing the StuLife benchmark, the authors provide a critical resource for the community to evaluate agents in complex, dynamic scenarios rather than on static datasets.

## Key Findings

*   **Paradigm Shift in AI:** The research identifies a critical transition from optimizing static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn continuously through real-world interaction.
*   **Core Framework Definition:** The paper defines **Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL)**, underpinned by four essential principles:
    *   Experience Exploration
    *   Long-term Memory
    *   Skill Learning
    *   Knowledge Internalization
*   **Mechanism of Self-Evolution:** Agents achieve growth by abstracting recurring patterns into reusable skills and converting explicit experiences into implicit capabilities.
*   **StuLife Benchmark:** Introduction of a comprehensive benchmark designed to simulate a holistic student journey to test lifelong learning capabilities.

## Methodology

The research proposes the **Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL)** framework, structured around four operational principles:

1.  **Experience Exploration:** Self-motivated interaction within dynamic environments.
2.  **Long-term Memory Management:** A persistent memory system designed to preserve historical knowledge.
3.  **Skill Acquisition and Refinement:** Autonomous improvement achieved by abstracting recurring patterns.
4.  **Knowledge Internalization:** The transition from explicit experiences to implicit capabilities.

**Evaluation Approach**
The framework is evaluated using the **StuLife dataset**, which simulates a student's college journey. This provides a multi-stage environment to test the agent's ability to accumulate and utilize knowledge over time.

## Technical Details

### Environment Modeling
The environment is modeled as a **Goal-Conditional Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)** defined by the tuple $E = (S, A, G, T, R, \Omega, O, \gamma)$:

*   $S$: Multimodal state space
*   $A$: Action space (natural language)
*   $G$: Goal space
*   $T$: Transition function
*   $R$: Reward function
*   $\Omega$: Observation space
*   $O$: Observation probability
*   $\gamma$: Discount factor

### Knowledge Architecture
The Knowledge Architecture $K$ is defined as $(M, F)$:

*   **Memory ($M$):** Includes historical data consisting of:
    *   Trajectory Memory ($M_{traj}$)
    *   Declarative Knowledge ($M_{decl}$)
    *   Structural Knowledge ($M_{struct}$)
*   **Skills ($F$):** Represents procedural knowledge.

### Task and Trajectory Definitions
*   **Task ($T^{(i)}$):** Defined as $\langle E^{(i)}, o_0^{(i)}, g^{(i)}\rangle$
*   **Trajectory ($\xi$):** A sequence of observations, actions, and rewards.
