## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical inefficiency and unpredictability of current state-of-the-art automated data insight discovery, which relies heavily on resource-intensive agentic Large Language Model (LLM) frameworks. These dynamic agent-based approaches suffer from high computational costs and non-deterministic complexity, rendering them impractical for many organizations. The paper highlights the urgent need for a deterministic, cost-effective alternative capable of systematically analyzing tabular data ($N \times M$ tables) without the overhead of large, proprietary models. The authors argue that for automated analytics to be scalable, it must move away from volatile tool-calling agents toward a more structured, rigorous methodology.

The key innovation, **Explanova**, is a novel hybrid framework that integrates Explainable AI (XAI) with Local Small LLMs through a deterministic, AutoML-like workflow. Unlike agentic models, Explanova utilizes a "Systematic Traversal" method to exhaustively cover data exploration paths, ensuring comprehensive analysis of univariate statistics, bivariate relationships, and target-to-all interactions. The architecture is built on a robust three-stage pipeline:

1.  **Feature Preparation:** Employing parallelized LLM-based type inference and imputation.
2.  **Feature-to-Feature Statistics:** Utilizing HDBSCAN clustering with a Gower distance matrix.
3.  **Feature Modeling:** Using a "One-vs-All" strategy interpreted via Kernel SHAP.

This design effectively separates heavy statistical computation from language generation, streamlining the process.

To validate performance, the system is benchmarked against **DiscoveryBench** and **InfiAgent-DABench**, demonstrating that the preset workflow effectively maintains data integrity and insight quality. While the framework reduces processing overhead by decoupling statistical analysis from LLM generation, it ensures analytical rigor through specific quantitative internal metrics rather than opaque model outputs. Key performance indicators include Missing Value Ratio and Outlier Ratio thresholds to filter noise, SSE (Sum of Squared Errors) thresholds to validate clustering stability within HDBSCAN, and a defined "Credibility Score" to assess the reliability of discovered insights.

Explanova represents a paradigm shift in automated analytics, proving that high-quality insight generation does not require expensive, large-scale agentic LLMs. By leveraging Local Small LLMs within a structured XAI workflow, the study offers a scalable solution that democratizes access to advanced data analysis for organizations with limited computational resources.

## Methodology

The methodology proposes a **Hybrid XAI (Explainable AI) combined LLM workflow**. The core philosophy shifts away from autonomous agents toward a structured pipeline:

*   **Workflow Type:** Deterministic, AutoML-style pipeline (Preset Workflow) vs. agent-based decisions.
*   **Exploration Strategy:** Systematic Traversal of exploration paths, including:
    *   Univariate statistics
    *   Bivariate relationships
    *   Target-to-all relationships
*   **Role of LLM:** A Local Small LLM is used specifically for **Explanation Generation** to interpret statistical results and generate natural language insights.
