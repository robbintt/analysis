## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical scarcity of high-performance, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically optimized for the Thai language. While global LLMs have rapidly advanced, Thai-specific models often lack the sophisticated capabilities required for complex, real-world applications, such as extended context comprehension and functional tool use. This performance gap limits the development of advanced AI applications for Thai users and forces a reliance on proprietary or English-centric models that fail to adequately capture local linguistic nuances and cultural contexts.

OpenJAI-v1.0 introduces a specialized bilingual model built upon the Qwen3-14B architecture, utilizing a rigorous data curation strategy to enhance functional capabilities. The core technical innovation lies in a fine-tuning pipeline that targets three distinct areas: instruction following, long-context understanding (supporting up to 120,000 tokens), and tool use. The methodology employed LLM-as-a-judge filtered synthetic data, translated tool-calling datasets, and direct instruction-response formatting to prevent "catastrophic forgetting," ensuring the model retained the base model's general abilities while acquiring new specialized skills.

Evaluations demonstrate that OpenJAI-v1.0 sets a new benchmark for open-source Thai models, outperforming both the Qwen3-14B foundation and existing open-source Thai leaders across all target tasks. The model was rigorously assessed on IFBench, measuring strict accuracy across 480 bilingual prompts (300 English, 180 Thai), and on MT-Bench, utilizing a 10-point scale judged by GPT-4o across 8 distinct domains. Long-context capabilities were validated via LongBench-v2, comprising 503 multiple-choice questions, and an MRCR (8-needle) test, confirming the model's ability to maintain high proficiency over extended contexts without sacrificing general performance.

The release of OpenJAI-v1.0 provides a significant open resource for the Thai AI community, democratizing access to state-of-the-art NLP technology. By establishing a new performance standard for open-source Thai models, this work enables developers and researchers to build more complex, practical applications that require advanced features like tool integration and long-context processing. The model's success in balancing bilingual proficiency with specialized functional capabilities serves as a blueprint for future development in low-resource languages, bridging the gap between general-purpose models and localized, high-performance AI solutions.
