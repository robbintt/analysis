## Executive Summary

Current implementations of Agentic AI rely heavily on ad-hoc, purely data-driven approaches that lack the explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance required for reliable deployment. This structural deficiency results in systems that are opaque and unpredictable, failing to meet the verifiability standards necessary for complex, real-world environments.

This paper addresses this critical gap by arguing that relying solely on implicit behavioral patterns is insufficient for achieving robust agency. The authors propose a **hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture** that integrates modern adaptive methodologies with the theoretical rigor of the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community.

Technically, the solution moves beyond implicit learning to embed structured formal reasoning models—such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architectures, game-theoretic coordination protocols, and normative governance frameworks—directly into the agent's design. This integration enables the system to leverage the pattern recognition capabilities of data-driven AI while utilizing formal logic to ensure decision-making processes are interpretable and rule-compliant.

As a conceptual framework, the paper does not present quantitative experimental results. Instead, the primary outcome is a strategic roadmap demonstrating that integrating formal agency theory with adaptive systems qualitatively resolves issues of opacity. This work is significant for bridging the disconnect between formal agency theory and the practical implementation of autonomous systems, shifting the research focus toward developing systems that are not only intelligent but also socially responsible.

## Key Findings

*   **Beyond Basic Agency:** The realization of Agentic AI requires moving beyond basic assumptions of agency to include explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance.
*   **AAMAS Foundation:** Conceptual tools from the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community provide the necessary theoretical and practical foundation.
*   **Alignment of Approaches:** Aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning results in systems that are transparent, cooperative, and accountable.
*   **Bridging the Gap:** The proposed perspective creates a bridge between formal agency theory and the implementation of practical autonomy.
