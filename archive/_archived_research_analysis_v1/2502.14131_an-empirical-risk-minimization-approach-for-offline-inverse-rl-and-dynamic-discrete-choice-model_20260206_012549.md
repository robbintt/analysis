## Executive Summary

Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models have traditionally faced significant computational and statistical bottlenecks that limit their applicability to complex, real-world environments. The primary challenge lies in the reliance on explicitly estimating state transition probabilities within the Bellman equation. This requirement introduces exponential statistical complexity and is prone to error propagation, making it infeasible for high-dimensional or infinite state spaces. Furthermore, conventional methods often assume linearly parameterized reward functions, which restricts the model's expressiveness and fails to capture the nuances of complex agent behaviors. These limitations necessitate a framework that can handle high-dimensional data without the computational burden of transition estimation while maintaining theoretical robustness.

The authors propose a novel Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework that fundamentally changes how IRL and DDC problems are approached by eliminating the need to estimate state transition probabilities. Instead of relying on known or estimated transition dynamics, the method minimizes the Bellman residual directly using a one-shot, gradient-based optimization strategy. This "transition-estimation-free" approach allows for the use of non-parametric estimators, specifically neural networks, to approximate reward or $Q^*$ functions, thereby handling infinite state spaces and non-linear reward structures.

A critical theoretical contribution is the proof that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. This finding is significant because it guarantees fast (linear) global convergence for gradient-based methods, even when using non-convex neural network architectures, bypassing the instability often associated with deep reinforcement learning fitted fixed-point iterations.

In synthetic experiments, the proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance over current benchmarks and state-of-the-art alternatives across two key metrics: the precision of reward inference and scalability. The method successfully scales to massive state spaces ($\ge 10^{20}$), a feat unattainable for previous approaches. Compared to GAN-based methods (e.g., Finn et al., Fu et al.), this approach recovers the exact reward function suitable for counterfactual use, rather than identifying rewards only up to policy invariance. It also outperforms Two-Step MLE and CCP methods by avoiding the computational bottlenecks of explicit transition estimation and simulation, and surpasses Sieve methods by evading the curse of dimensionality through neural network approximations.

The experiments confirm that the method achieves fast global convergence, addressing the optimization instability common in prior deep learning-based solutions. This research bridges the gap between reinforcement learning and econometric modeling by unifying Maximum Entropy IRL and DDC models under a single optimization framework. By removing the dependency on explicit transition probability estimation, the authors dismantle a major barrier to applying these models to high-dimensional, real-world problems such as complex economic choice modeling and robotic control.

## Methodology

The authors propose a globally convergent gradient-based method grounded in an Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on solving the Bellman equation with known or estimated transition probabilities, this method circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation.

The approach utilizes non-parametric estimation techniques (specifically neural networks) to approximate reward or $Q^*$ functions, allowing the model to handle complex, high-dimensional, or infinite state spaces. The optimization process relies on the insight that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition to guarantee convergence.
