## Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of feature selection in multi-view multi-label learning (MVML) environments, where data is derived from heterogeneous sources and associated with multiple labels simultaneously. The core problem is that existing attention-based methods predominantly model intra-view relationships while neglecting inter-view complementarity, leading to suboptimal feature representation. Furthermore, these approaches fail to explicitly account for feature redundancy, resulting in selected subsets that contain repetitive information. This is a critical issue because high redundancy and poor view integration degrade model efficiency, increase computational costs, and reduce the predictive accuracy required for complex, high-dimensional data analysis.

To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes **RMAN-MMFS**, a novel framework utilizing a Multi-head Attention Network tailored for multi-view scenarios. The architecture innovates by employing individual attention heads to model intra-view features and integrating cross-attention mechanisms to explicitly capture inter-view feature complementarity. A key technical contribution is the implementation of a dual-term Redundancy Optimization strategy: a **Static Redundancy Term** that mitigates redundancy within each view, and a **Dynamic Redundancy Term** that learns to minimize redundancy between unselected and selected features during training. Additionally, the method employs correlation analysis to compute importance weights by aggregating correlations between Query and Key matrices, ensuring the model prioritizes the most pertinent feature values.

The proposed method was rigorously evaluated against six existing multi-view multi-label feature selection techniques across six real-world datasets. The results demonstrated that RMAN-MMFS achieves superior performance, outperforming the strongest baselines in terms of Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 scores. The significance of this research lies in its holistic approach to feature selection, bridging the gap between intra-view analysis and inter-view complementarity, providing a more robust and efficient framework for handling complex multi-view data.
