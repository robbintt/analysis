## Executive Summary

Current audio processing landscapes are fragmented, typically requiring distinct, specialized models for separate tasks such as understanding (e.g., speech recognition and classification), generation (e.g., text-to-audio), and reasoning. This separation prevents the development of cohesive systems capable of advanced multimodal interaction, where a model must interpret audio inputs and synthesize outputs within a unified reasoning loop. While diffusion models have dominated high-fidelity audio generation, they exist largely separate from transformer-based language models used for understanding. This paper addresses the critical need for a single, unified architecture that bridges understanding and generation to enable complex, cross-modal reasoning without sacrificing performance in either domain.

The key innovation is the **UALM (Unified Audio Language Model)** framework, a decoder-only Transformer architecture initialized from Qwen2.5 that integrates audio understanding, generation, and reasoning. Technically, UALM abandons diffusion-based generation for a next-token prediction approach using discrete X-codec audio tokens (50Hz, 8 RVQ tokens/frame) and an Enhancement VAE for upscaling to 48kHz stereo. For reasoning, the researchers introduced **UALM-Reason**, a cross-modal generative reasoning mechanism that leverages multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This allows the model to process intermediate "thinking" steps using a mixture of text and audio (Rich Captions), facilitating complex patterns like Enrichment, Dialogue, and Self-Reflection. The training pipeline employs a modality alignment curriculum and a massive data blend of 30M samples and 80k hours of audio.

The UALM framework achieved parity with state-of-the-art specialized models across all three domains without performance trade-offs. Specifically, UALM-Gen demonstrated generation quality comparable to top diffusion-based models, validating the efficacy of direct audio token prediction. The unified model maintained high performance on understanding tasks while successfully executing reasoning operations like audio correction and self-reflection. The study utilized a highly optimized data composition consisting of 39.2% Audio Generation, 33.1% Audio Understanding, and 27.7% Text-Only data. Although the LM-based generation approach required significantly more data to reach maturity (80k hours compared to <4k hours for diffusion models), the resultant system successfully demonstrated the first instance of generative reasoning using mixed audio-text contexts.

This research represents a significant paradigm shift by proving that language models can effectively generate high-quality audio via discrete token prediction, challenging the prevailing dominance of diffusion models in audio synthesis. By establishing the first successful cross-modal generative reasoning paradigm in the audio domain, UALM opens new avenues for developing intelligent audio systems capable of complex self-reflection and interactive dialogue. The unification of understanding, generation, and reasoning into a single model simplifies deployment and reduces the architectural complexity of future multimodal agents, setting a new standard for holistic audio intelligence.

## Methodology

The researchers developed a single unified architecture to handle audio understanding, generation, and reasoning simultaneously. The core components of this approach include:
