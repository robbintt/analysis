## Executive Summary

### Problem
Retrieving information from large, semi-structured knowledge graphs (KGs) presents a persistent challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily due to the difficulty in balancing search breadth against depth. Existing retrieval methods often struggle with the "breadth-depth dilemma," relying on static strategies or fragile seed node selection that fail to adapt to the varying complexity of different queries.

### Innovation
The authors introduce **ARK (Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge)**, an agentic KG retriever that grants LLMs the autonomy to dynamically manage the tradeoff between breadth and depth. Technically, ARK utilizes a dual-operation toolset: **Global Lexical Search (BM25)** for breadth-oriented discovery and **One-Hop Neighborhood Exploration** for depth-oriented expansion. The agent alternates between these tools based on real-time query requirements, employing an ensemble method with rank fusion for scoring. Additionally, the methodology features a label-free imitation learning pipeline that distills the reasoning trajectories of a large teacher model into a smaller 8B parameter student model.

### Results
ARK achieved state-of-the-art performance on the STaRK dataset, with the teacher model securing an average Hit@1 of **59.1%** and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of **67.4%**, outperforming existing methods by up to **31.4%** in Hit@1. The distillation process proved highly efficient, as the 8B parameter student model retained **98.5%** of the teacher's Hit@1 performance while delivering absolute improvements on the AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets.

### Impact
This research significantly advances the field by demonstrating that high-performance knowledge graph retrieval can be achieved through agentic tool use without the need for specific retrieval training or seed selection. By effectively solving the breadth-depth dilemma via dynamic adaptation, ARK provides a more flexible and reliable framework for querying semi-structured data. Furthermore, the study offers compelling evidence that the complex decision-making capabilities of large agentic models can be effectively compressed into smaller, efficient models.

## Key Findings

*   **State-of-the-Art Performance:** ARK achieved an average **59.1% Hit@1** and **67.4% MRR** on the STaRK benchmark, outperforming existing methods by up to **31.4%** in Hit@1.
*   **Effective Distillation:** Distilling ARK's tool-use trajectories into an 8B parameter student model resulted in significant absolute improvements in Hit@1 across AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets.
*   **High Retention Rate:** The distillation process successfully retained up to **98.5%** of the teacher model's Hit@1 performance, proving the efficiency of the compression.
*   **Adaptive Strategy:** The model dynamically adapts its retrieval strategy based on query complexity:
    *   Utilizes **global lexical search** for language-heavy queries.
    *   Utilizes **neighborhood exploration** for relation-heavy queries.
