## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Training multimodal foundation models to function as autonomous agents capable of complex tool use remains a significant hurdle, particularly when addressing long-horizon tasks where the connection between an action and its eventual outcome is temporally distant. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle with the credit assignment problem in these multi-turn scenarios, failing to identify which specific steps lead to success. Furthermore, developing agents capable of **Tool Integrated Reasoning (TIR)** and managing **long-context dialogue management** while naturally processing interleaved speech and text inputs requires a robust training environment that standard supervised learning approaches fail to provide.

**Innovation**
The core innovation of this work is Turn-level Adjudicated Reinforcement Learning (TARL), a process-supervised RL strategy that deploys a Large Language Model (LLM) as a judge to provide turn-level evaluations. By adjudicating the quality of each interaction step, TARL effectively resolves credit assignment issues in long-horizon tasks. The architecture utilizes a specialized sandbox RL environment supporting interleaved speech-text rollouts and applies Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) at the token level. Additionally, the authors introduce a refined mixed-task training curriculum that integrates mathematical reasoning problems to broaden the model's exploration capabilities, preventing it from converging prematurely on suboptimal policies during tool-use training.

**Results**
Evaluations on the Retail domain of the text-based $\tau$-bench demonstrate significant performance gains, with the framework reportedly improving task pass rates by over 6% compared to strong existing RL baselines. Specifically, the base Qwen3-8B model achieved a pass^1 rate of 42.6%, which increased to 48.7% using PPO and 51.3% using GRPO. The training also yielded behavioral improvements, reducing the average 'wait' tokens per turn from 14.6 to 8.4, indicating more natural interaction. However, the method faced challenges in generalization; in the Airline domain, performance declined, with GRPO dropping to a 28% pass^1 rate compared to the base model's 32%. Additionally, consistency remained an issue, as pass^2 and pass^3 rates fell below 30% across the board.

**Impact**
This research significantly advances the field of agentic AI by demonstrating that unified RL approaches can successfully adapt multimodal foundation models for natural, voice-driven interactive applications. The introduction of TARL provides a scalable solution to the persistent problem of credit assignment in multi-turn tool use, validating the efficacy of using LLMs as process judges. Furthermore, the successful implementation of a mixed-task curriculum offers a new pathway for improving exploration in RL training for language models. While the generalization challenges highlight areas for future work, the framework establishes a strong foundation for developing sophisticated, voice-enabled agents capable of complex reasoning and tool integration.

## Results

### Performance Metrics
Evaluation is based on the pass^k metric, average 'wait' tokens, and response length.

| Domain | Model | Pass^1 Rate | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Retail** | Base Qwen3-8B | 42.6% | Baseline performance |
| **Retail** | PPO | 48.7% | Improved over baseline |
| **Retail** | **GRPO** | **51.3%** | Highest performance in Retail |
| **Airline** | Base Qwen3-8B | 32.0% | Generalization failed here |
| **Airline** | GRPO | 28.0% | Drop compared to baseline |

### Behavioral Analysis
