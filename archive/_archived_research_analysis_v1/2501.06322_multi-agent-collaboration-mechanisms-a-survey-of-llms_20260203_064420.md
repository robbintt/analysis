## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the fragmented landscape of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs), a rapidly evolving field that has shifted focus from single-agent paradigms to collaboration-centric models capable of collective action. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in complex environments such as 5G/6G communications, Industry 5.0, and social simulations, the lack of a unified understanding of how these agents interact effectively hinders progress. The authors argue that solving the coordination problem is essential for achieving artificial collective intelligence, yet the field currently lacks a standardized framework to categorize the diverse mechanisms driving these interactions.

The core innovation is the introduction of a comprehensive, extensible framework developed through a systematic survey of contemporary literature, characterizing collaborative behaviors through a rigorous five-dimensional taxonomy. Technically, this framework defines MASs by:

1.  **Actors:** The entities involved.
2.  **Types:** Classifying interactions as Cooperation, Competition, or Coopetition.
3.  **Structures:** Such as Peer-to-peer, Centralized, or Distributed topologies.
4.  **Strategies:** Including Role-based, Rule-based, and Model-based approaches.
5.  **Coordination Protocols.**

The authors demonstrate this taxonomy by analyzing specific state-of-the-art systems, such as **MetaGPT**, which utilizes Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to assign distinct roles to agents, and **AutoGen**, which enables multi-agent conversations for task completion. This concrete analysis provides a structural blueprint for designing future systems rather than relying on abstract descriptions alone.

As this is a survey paper, the findings are qualitative and conceptual, lacking quantitative benchmarks or experimental performance metrics. However, the authors successfully synthesized methodologies from numerous citations to operationalize the proposed framework, validating its utility by categorizing current systems into a coherent structure. The survey identifies critical open challenges facing the field, specifically highlighting the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks for multi-agent coordination, difficulties in interpreting emergent behaviors, and safety concerns regarding unaligned collective actions.

The significance of this work lies in its establishment of a foundational resource that clarifies the collaborative aspects of LLM-based agents, serving as a guide for both researchers and practitioners. By bridging the gap between theoretical agent design and practical industrial application—ranging from telecommunications to social simulations—the paper sets the agenda for future development.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Proposed Framework
The paper proposes a comprehensive taxonomy for characterizing LLM-based MASs based on five dimensions:

| Dimension | Description | Examples/Components |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Actors** | The entities involved in the system. | LLMs, Humans, Software APIs |
| **Types** | The nature of interaction between agents. | **Cooperation**, **Competition**, **Coopetition** |
| **Structures** | The topology of the agent network. | **Peer-to-peer**, **Centralized**, **Distributed** |
| **Strategies** | The methods agents use to achieve goals. | **Role-based**, **Rule-based**, **Model-based** |
| **Coordination Protocols** | Rules governing information exchange. | Communication standards, handshakes |

### System Architecture
The general architecture for a Multi-Agent System consists of four core components:
*   **Agents**
*   **Environment**
*   **Interactions**
*   **Organization**
