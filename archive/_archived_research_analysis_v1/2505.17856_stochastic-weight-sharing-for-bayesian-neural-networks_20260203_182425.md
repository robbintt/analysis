## Executive Summary

Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offer the distinct advantage of robust uncertainty quantification, but their adoption in large-scale, state-of-the-art architectures is severely hindered by prohibitive computational costs and convergence difficulties. Traditional BNNs struggle with the high memory and processing demands required to infer posterior distributions over weights, making them largely infeasible for complex, deep models such as ResNet-101 or Vision Transformers (ViT). This paper addresses this critical bottleneck, aiming to enable efficient Bayesian learning in modern deep learning without sacrificing the reliability of uncertainty estimations.

The authors introduce **2DGBNN (2D Gaussian Bayesian Neural Networks)**, a novel method that reinterprets weight-sharing quantization techniques through a stochastic lens to optimize BNNs. The core innovation lies in encoding the stochastic behavior of a BNN into a lower-dimensional, soft Gaussian representation using a 2D perspective of weight mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$). The methodology operates in three stages:
1.  **Initializing** a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by partitioning weights into "inliers" (subject to weight sharing) and "outliers" (retaining full distributions);
2.  **Refining** the GMM by merging Gaussians based on Wasserstein Distance Estimations, Mahalanobis distance checks, and Alpha Blending;
3.  **Final Training** where inliers are sampled from the shared distribution and outliers individually.

This approach leverages 2D Adaptive Gaussian Distributions to compress the parameter space significantly while maintaining the stochastic properties necessary for Bayesian inference.

The proposed method achieves substantial efficiency gains, reducing computational overhead by several orders of magnitude compared to traditional BNN approaches. Specifically, 2DGBNN delivers a **50x reduction in model parameters** and a **75% decrease in overall model size**. Despite this aggressive compression, the framework maintains predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation capabilities comparable to current state-of-the-art models. The approach was successfully validated on benchmarks including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet1k, using architectures such as ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ViT. Performance metrics, including Accuracy, Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), and Expected Calibration Error (ECE), confirm that the method scales efficiently to very deep networks like ResNet-101 and ViT.

This research establishes a critical conceptual bridge by applying weight-sharing quantization techniques to the stochastic domain, offering a new direction for efficient Bayesian deep learning. By solving the primary bottlenecks of computational cost and convergence, the work makes it feasible to apply rigorous Bayesian uncertainty quantification to massive, modern architectures. The ability to achieve extreme parameter compression without degrading reliability suggests that this method could significantly broaden the deployment of uncertainty-aware models in resource-constrained environments and high-performance applications where BNNs were previously impractical.
