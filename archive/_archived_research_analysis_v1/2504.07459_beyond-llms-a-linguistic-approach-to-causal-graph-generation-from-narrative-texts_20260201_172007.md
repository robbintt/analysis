## 📋 Executive Summary

Current approaches to extracting causal relationships from narrative texts rely heavily on end-to-end generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5. While these models possess strong semantic capabilities, they lack the precision necessary to distinguish explicit causal links from mere temporal or semantic associations. This deficiency leads to causal graphs that, while readable, frequently suffer from logical inconsistencies and "hallucinated" connections. As narrative analysis becomes essential for understanding complex storylines and agent interactions, there is a critical need for a method that prioritizes logical rigor alongside natural language understanding to accurately map high-level causality to specific event details.

The authors propose a **hybrid architecture** that decouples event extraction from causal relationship identification through a structured four-stage pipeline. First, LLMs are utilized exclusively to extract concise, agent-centered vertices. The core innovation is the **"Expert Index"**—a novel set of seven linguistically informed features, including *Genericity* and *Eventivity*, which are derived using RoBERTa. These features are fused with standard RoBERTa embeddings to serve as inputs for an XGBoost classifier. This classifier operates within the Situation-Task-Action-Consequence (STAC) framework to categorize event types and accurately identify causal edges. Finally, the pipeline employs a structured five-iteration prompting mechanism to refine the output, ensuring that linguistic theory drives the classification process rather than raw probabilistic generation.

In empirical testing involving 100 narrative chapters and trained on 750 annotated sentences from 23 distinct references, the proposed framework consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines, including GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, in both accuracy and precision. Crucially, the results demonstrate a **"Balanced Readability and Accuracy"**; the method successfully preserves the high-level readability of the generated graphs while capturing detailed, event-specific causal chains, a significant improvement over the verbose or inconsistent outputs of monolithic models. Furthermore, this superior performance was achieved with lower computational costs compared to pure LLM approaches, validating the efficiency of the hybrid design.

This research challenges the prevailing reliance on monolithic LLMs for structured knowledge extraction by demonstrating that specialized linguistic features significantly enhance performance. By validating that a hybrid model leveraging the semantic power of LLMs while grounding logic in linguistic theory yields superior results, the paper establishes a new standard for narrative understanding. The release of an interpretable, open-source tool provides the research community with a practical, efficient solution for automated causal analysis, suggesting that the future of graph generation lies in such theoretically grounded hybrid architectures.
