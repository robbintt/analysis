## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of enhancing adversarial robustness in deep learning models through data-centric coreset selection. A prevailing assumption in active learning and subset selection is that "hard" samples—those lying close to decision boundaries—are the most "informative" and should be prioritized for training. However, the authors identify a significant gap: while these methods maximize clean accuracy, they often fail to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. This finding reveals a conflict between selecting data for standard performance versus selecting data for security, highlighting a critical vulnerability in current data pruning strategies where relying on hard samples may inadvertently train models on inputs that are most susceptible to perturbation.

The paper introduces **EasyCore**, a novel coreset selection framework that fundamentally challenges the status quo by selecting "easy" samples to bolster robustness. Technically, the method quantifies sample hardness using the **Average Input Gradient Norm (AIGN)**, which is accumulated over the training process. Samples exhibiting low AIGN are classified as "easy," indicating they are prototypical and distant from decision boundaries, whereas high-AIGN samples are deemed "hard" and vulnerable. Grounded in the **Boundary Curvature Hypothesis**, the authors present a theoretical bound linking input gradient norms to weight gradient norms, demonstrating that utilizing low-AIGN subsets reduces decision boundary curvature. This allows EasyCore to modify training data composition to create simpler, more stable decision regions without altering model architecture or loss functions.

In empirical evaluations across ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10/100) and ResNet-50 (ImageNet), EasyCore achieved significant gains in adversarial accuracy compared to state-of-the-art coreset baselines. Specifically, the method yielded up to a **7% improvement** in adversarial accuracy under standard training regimes and up to a **5% improvement** under TRADES adversarial training. Qualitative analysis using UMAP visualizations confirmed that models trained on low-AIGN subsets exhibit less complex decision boundaries, with features clustering into tight centroids rather than fringing near class boundaries. Additionally, the researchers observed that standard adversarial training naturally shifts the mean AIGN distribution to higher values, further validating the metric's correlation with model vulnerability.

This work significantly influences the field by establishing AIGN as a theoretically grounded and dataset-intrinsic metric for robustness, shifting the research focus from maximizing informativeness to minimizing vulnerability. It provides practitioners with a computationally efficient, model-agnostic tool to improve model security simply by optimizing the training set composition, bypassing the need for complex architectural changes or expensive adversarial fine-tuning.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Contradiction of Intuition:** Contrary to the belief that "hard" samples (near decision boundaries) are most valuable, this study finds that "easy" samples—quantified by low **Average Input Gradient Norm (AIGN)**—are less vulnerable to adversarial attacks and reside further from decision boundaries.
*   **Superior Performance:** Training on data subsets selected via the proposed EasyCore method yields significantly higher adversarial accuracy compared to subsets selected by existing coreset algorithms designed for clean accuracy.
*   **Quantifiable Gains:** EasyCore achieves specific improvements of up to **7%** in adversarial accuracy under standard training and up to **5%** under TRADES adversarial training relative to competing methods.
*   **Dataset Agnostic:** The selection metric (AIGN) is a dataset property rather than a model-specific one, making the approach widely applicable across different model architectures for improving robustness.

## 🧩 Methodology

The researchers proposed **EasyCore**, a data-centric coreset selection framework designed to enhance adversarial robustness. The methodology operates on the premise that a sample's adversarial vulnerability is linked to its "hardness," quantified using the Average Input Gradient Norm (AIGN) accumulated over the training process.

Instead of retaining the most informative or "hard" samples (common in standard active learning), EasyCore filters the dataset to retain only "easy" samples—specifically those exhibiting low AIGN. This subset is then used to train models under both standard and adversarial training regimes (specifically TRADES).
