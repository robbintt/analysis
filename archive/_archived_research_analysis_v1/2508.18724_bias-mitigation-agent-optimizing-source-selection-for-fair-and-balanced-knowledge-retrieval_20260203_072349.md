## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical issue of **bias inheritance** within Agentic AI systems, specifically those utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). As autonomous agents rely on internal and external knowledge bases to answer queries, they inevitably propagate the biases present in those sources. This creates a significant challenge for developers: retrieving relevant information often comes at the cost of fairness, leading to skewed outputs that erode user trust and compromise the integrity of generative applications.

The authors introduce the **"Bias Mitigation Agent,"** a multi-agent system designed to optimize information retrieval before generation occurs. The core innovation lies in shifting the mitigation focus from post-processing or model training to the **source selection phase**. By employing a multi-agent architecture, the system orchestrates a workflow that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Zero-shot and Few-shot prompting to dynamically evaluate and select information sources.

This process filters potential inputs based on a dual optimization of **relevance** and **minimal bias**, ensuring the foundational data is balanced before the generative model processes it. In experimental trials, the proposed system demonstrated a substantial improvement over baseline methods, achieving an **81.82% reduction in bias** compared to a naive retrieval strategy. This performance significantly surpasses related benchmarks cited in the literature, proving that sophisticated agent-based workflows can vastly outperform naive retrieval strategies in ensuring balanced knowledge dissemination.
