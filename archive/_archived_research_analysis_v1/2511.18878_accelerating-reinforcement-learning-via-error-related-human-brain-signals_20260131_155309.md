## Executive Summary

Reinforcement Learning (RL) typically struggles with sample efficiency in high-dimensional control spaces, such as robotic manipulation tasks involving multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) manipulators navigating cluttered environments. In these scenarios, sparse environmental rewards often prevent agents from converging on optimal policies without prohibitive amounts of interaction time.

This paper addresses the challenge of accelerating skill acquisition in complex settings by investigating how external guidance—specifically, human cognitive signals—can bridge the feedback gap inherent in sparse reward functions. The authors introduce a closed-loop framework that integrates **Error-related Potentials (ErrP)** decoded from human electroencephalography (EEG) signals into the RL agent’s learning process via reward shaping.

The system employs offline-trained classifiers to detect ErrP signals—neural responses generated when a human observer perceives an error—and translates these biological signals into modulatory inputs for the agent's reward function. This allows the agent to utilize implicit human neural feedback as a dense, supplemental reward signal, guiding the policy update process without the need for explicit teaching commands or physical demonstrations.

Experimental validation on a 7-Degree-of-Freedom (7-DoF) robotic manipulator demonstrated that the neural feedback framework significantly outperforms standard sparse-reward baselines. Quantitatively, the proposed method achieved an average task success rate of **92.5%**, a substantial increase over the **55%** success rate observed in the baseline condition. Furthermore, the integration of EEG signals accelerated the learning process, reducing the number of episodes required for convergence by approximately **3.1 times**.

The study employed leave-one-subject-out cross-validation across 10 participants to ensure robustness; the system maintained stable performance and policy transferability despite an average ErrP classification accuracy of roughly **75%**, confirming its resilience to inter-individual EEG variability.
