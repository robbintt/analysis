## Executive Summary

The exponential growth of connected devices in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has overwhelmed traditional centralized computing systems, creating critical bottlenecks in latency, bandwidth, and real-time responsivity. This paper addresses the inherent limitation of conventional machine learning algorithms—specifically their reliance on static batch training—which renders them ill-suited for the dynamic, non-stationary data streams characteristic of edge environments. As industrial data evolves in real-time, models deployed for applications like quality control must adapt locally without the latency of cloud communication or the computational burden of reprocessing entire historical datasets.

The authors introduce a novel, hardware-agnostic edge-computing architecture tailored for IIoT scenarios, integrating an incremental (continual) learning philosophy directly into the edge environment. The core technical innovation replaces static training methods with a continual learning framework that allows models to learn from new data streams locally without accessing historical data. This approach specifically addresses "catastrophic forgetting"—the tendency of neural networks to overwrite previously learned information when acquiring new skills—through strategies like sparsity and parameter regularization. This optimization enables intelligent adaptation on resource-constrained nodes, ensuring the system remains lightweight and responsive.

The research validates the architecture through rigorous experimentation using a Raspberry Pi 4 and the DeepPCB dataset for defect detection across six incremental tasks. The proposed system successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting, maintaining an average accuracy of **93.8%**, which stands in stark contrast to the approximate **60%** accuracy observed in naive incremental approaches. Furthermore, the architecture proves highly efficient in terms of resource utilization, reducing the required storage footprint from the multiple gigabytes needed for raw data storage to a mere **44 megabytes** for the model parameters. Additionally, the system achieved an inference latency of approximately **147 milliseconds** per image, confirming its viability for real-time manufacturing workflows.

This work is significant because it bridges the gap between theoretical continual learning algorithms and practical, deployable industrial solutions. By demonstrating that complex adaptive models can operate effectively on low-cost, resource-constrained hardware at the edge, the authors enable a shift toward truly autonomous manufacturing systems. This domain-specific solution reduces dependency on constant cloud connectivity, minimizes bandwidth usage, and allows for immediate, local decision-making, thereby setting a new standard for resilience and efficiency in industrial quality control.
