## Executive Summary

Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face a critical trade-off between achieving high performance and managing computational costs. Enhancing reasoning capabilities typically requires expensive fine-tuning with extensive data annotations, particularly for Chain-of-Thought processes. Conversely, employing agentic frameworks that utilize external tools offers a training-free alternative but introduces significant reliability risks; the unvetted outputs of these external tools can lead to hallucinations or errors that degrade the overall trustworthiness of the system.

The researchers introduce **SRICE (Seeing and Reasoning with Confidence)**, a novel, training-free agentic framework designed to integrate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) directly into multimodal reasoning pipelines. Technically, SRICE operates by allowing the MLLM to autonomously select Regions of Interest (ROIs) without manual supervision. Its core innovation lies in a conformal prediction-based approach that calibrates the outputs of external vision models. By dynamically estimating the uncertainty of both the MLLM’s internal reasoning and the external tools, SRICE can intelligently select the optimal tool for a given task while filtering out low-confidence or unreliable predictions.

SRICE demonstrated substantial empirical efficacy across five distinct datasets, achieving an average performance improvement of 4.6% over base MLLM models. Crucially, the framework matched or outperformed state-of-the-art methods that rely on costly fine-tuning, realizing these gains with zero training overhead. The integration of uncertainty-aware mechanisms successfully mitigated the risks associated with external tool usage, validating the framework's ability to maintain high accuracy while eliminating the need for costly data annotation and fine-tuning.

This work significantly influences the field by bridging the gap between resource-intensive fine-tuning strategies and the often-risky deployment of agentic tools. By demonstrating that uncertainty-aware, tool-augmented inference can rival fine-tuned state-of-the-art methods, SRICE offers a scalable and cost-effective pathway to enhancing MLLM capabilities. The research establishes a new standard for reliable agentic systems, emphasizing that uncertainty quantification is essential for the safe and effective advancement of multimodal AI agents.

## Methodology

The researchers proposed **SRICE**, a training-free multimodal reasoning framework designed to integrate external vision models with Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) into MLLMs. The methodology operates through a distinct multi-stage interaction process:

1.  **Autonomous Selection:** The MLLM autonomously selects Regions of Interest (ROIs) without human intervention.
2.  **Calibration:** It utilizes a **conformal prediction-based approach** to calibrate the output of external tools, ensuring statistical validity.
3.  **Dynamic Tool Selection:** The system estimates the uncertainty of the MLLM's own output to dynamically select the optimal tool for the specific task at hand.
