## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of continual learning (CL) within large-scale foundation models, specifically targeting the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. As foundation models are sequentially fine-tuned on new tasks, standard optimization techniques frequently degrade performance on previously learned data, creating a fundamental conflict between the stability required to retain past knowledge and the plasticity needed to acquire new information. This problem is particularly acute in modern, parameter-intensive networks where full fine-tuning is computationally prohibitive. Solving this stability-plasticity dilemma is essential for deploying foundation models in dynamic environments where data streams evolve continuously.

The authors introduce **PLAN (Proactive Low-Rank Allocation)**, a novel framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient, interference-aware fine-tuning. Unlike standard LoRA, which injects trainable adapters statically, PLAN employs a proactive subspace allocation strategy utilizing orthogonal basis vectors for specific tasks. This ensures that the parameter space for new learning does not overwrite critical features from previous tasks. The framework’s core mechanism involves a selection process that identifies basis vectors exhibiting minimal sensitivity to interference, coupled with a perturbation-based optimization strategy. This approach minimizes conflicts between new task gradients and previously learned parameters, systematically assigning low-sensitivity vectors to balance stability and plasticity.

Empirical validation demonstrates that PLAN establishes a new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models. On the challenging Split CIFAR-100 benchmark (10 tasks), PLAN achieved an average accuracy of **79.03%**, significantly outperforming strong baselines such as L2P (75.15%) and DualPrompt (74.12%). Furthermore, the framework exhibited superior retention capabilities, reducing the forgetting measure to approximately **13.1%**, compared to **18.2%** for L2P. Similar performance gains were observed on Split TinyImageNet, where PLAN maintained a consistent lead in average accuracy while keeping parameter overhead low—requiring only approximately **0.3%** of the total model parameters (roughly 0.4M additional parameters for ViT-B/16).

The significance of this work lies in providing a technically robust and scalable solution to the stability-plasticity dilemma for massive foundation models without relying on computationally expensive replay buffers or architectural expansion. By integrating proactive low-rank allocation with orthogonal basis management, PLAN validates that parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods can be effectively adapted for sequential task learning. This research advances the field by demonstrating that interference-aware optimization can yield substantial improvements in retention metrics, likely influencing future developments in dynamic model adaptation and the long-term deployment of AI systems in evolving real-world scenarios.
