## Executive Summary

**Problem: The Full-Annotation Bottleneck in MTL**
Multitask learning (MTL) offers a robust pathway to improve Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by leveraging synergies from auxiliary tasks such as Language Identification (LID). However, the practical application of MTL is severely constrained by the "full-annotation bottleneck." Current paradigms require that every training utterance be labeled for *all* tasks simultaneously, which is resource-prohibitive and prevents the utilization of large, heterogeneous datasets where labels are often disjoint. This limitation forces researchers to either curate expensive, fully-aligned datasets or discard partially labeled data, thereby restricting the scalability and potential performance gains of multilingual ASR systems.

**Innovation: Dynamic Task Activation Vectors**
TokenVerse++ addresses this limitation through a novel Dynamic Task Activation mechanism integrated into an XLSR-Transducer architecture. The technical core of the solution lies in the injection of learnable task vectors directly into the acoustic embedding space. These vectors serve as conditional prompts that dynamically gate task-specific components, allowing the model to identify and process only the relevant labels for a given utterance. By decoupling the training of the primary ASR objective from auxiliary LID tasks, the architecture facilitates "partial-label" training—where datasets with missing annotations can be utilized without forcing uniform labeling schemas or incurring computational penalties from missing targets.

**Results: Statistical Parity with Full Supervision**
Experimental evaluations on multilingual benchmarks, specifically across 10 languages in Common Voice and VoxPopuli datasets, demonstrate that TokenVerse++ eliminates the performance degradation typically associated with partial-label training. The model achieves Word Error Rates (WER) that are statistically indistinguishable from the original fully-supervised TokenVerse baseline, with a negligible gap of less than 0.1% absolute WER in many configurations. Furthermore, the integration of LID as an auxiliary task provided a measurable boost to ASR performance, yielding an average relative WER improvement of approximately 1-2% over single-task baselines, while simultaneously maintaining LID classification accuracy above 95% across the test sets.

**Impact: Scalable Data Utilization for Speech Processing**
This research significantly advances the field by providing a validated architecture that removes the necessity for perfect label alignment. By proving that auxiliary tasks can be added without degrading the primary objective, TokenVerse++ drastically reduces the cost and logistical friction of data curation. This enables practitioners to seamlessly combine disparate, partially labeled corpora into unified training pipelines, particularly benefiting low-resource languages where full annotations are scarce. The approach sets a new standard for efficient data utilization, empowering the development of more robust, scalable multilingual speech systems.
