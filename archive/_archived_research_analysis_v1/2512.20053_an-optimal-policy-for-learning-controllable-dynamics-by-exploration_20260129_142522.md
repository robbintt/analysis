## 📋 Executive Summary

### **Problem**
This research tackles the critical challenge of devising optimal exploration policies for agents learning controllable dynamics within unknown, finite-horizon environments. The core difficulty lies in navigating structural impediments—such as absorbing or non-backtracking states—that act as traps, restricting control and halting data collection. Traditional exploration methods often fail to account for these structural risks, leading to inefficient exploration or agents becoming permanently stuck in states that yield no new information.

### **Innovation**
The key innovation is the derivation of an optimal policy that utilizes **greedy maximization of immediate information gain**, managed through dynamically evolving constraint sets. The framework models the unknown environment as a **Controllable Markov Chain (CMC)** and employs a parameterized control set that progressively removes dangerous control actions to prevent the agent from getting trapped. Crucially, the authors establish the optimality of this greedy approach through rigorous theoretical validation using counting arguments and dynamic programming principles.

### **Results**
Experimental validation provided robust quantitative evidence of the method's efficacy. In a deterministic test case featuring 2 states and 2 controls over a 20-period horizon, the optimization successfully identified the exact correct policy parameters, defined as `r* = (1, 1, 7)`. This precise identification allowed the agent to correctly pinpoint the risky state, the trapping control, and the safe time threshold. Both the parametric policy and the refined rollout policy demonstrated a reduction in "Missing Information" over time.

### **Impact**
This research significantly advances the field by providing a computationally efficient, theoretically rigorous algorithm that is simple to implement in practice. It establishes a crucial theoretical link between specific structural state types and the necessity of non-stationary policies, bridging the gap between theoretical dynamic programming and real-world autonomous learning systems.
