> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> This research addresses the challenge of automating Optimization Modeling (OM)—the process of translating textual descriptions of real-world problems into mathematical formulations suitable for solvers. This task is critical because manual OM requires significant domain expertise and is labor-intensive. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential solution, existing approaches are hindered by computational inefficiencies, often relying on expensive multi-agent frameworks or resource-heavy fine-tuning. Furthermore, the field lacks reliable evaluation standards, as current benchmarks suffer from high error rates and a narrow focus that prioritizes optimal values over the correctness of the mathematical formulation itself.
>
> The key innovation is **ORThought**, a framework that automates OM by integrating expert-level optimization principles with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Technically, ORThought employs a dual-agent architecture: a Model Agent and a Solve Agent. The Model Agent utilizes an Understanding Module and a Mathematical Modeling Module, both infused with expert knowledge, to systematically define variables, objectives, constraints, and parameters. The Solve Agent then generates and executes Gurobi Python code, featuring a Repair Functionality to debug and fix syntax or logic errors. By utilizing guided reasoning rather than multi-agent negotiation, ORThought targets Linear, Integer Linear, Mixed Integer Linear, and Nonlinear Programming problems without the need for model fine-tuning.

> The study’s evaluation revealed critical flaws in existing data, with a systematic analysis uncovering a labeling error rate of up to **42%** in current OM datasets. Specifically, the authors identified 136 Incorrect, 56 Missing, and 15 Spurious instances, with constraints being the most error-prone component. Using corrected datasets and the newly introduced LogiOR logistics benchmark, ORThought outperformed state-of-the-art approaches, including complex multi-agent frameworks, particularly on difficult problems. Ablation studies highlighted the necessity of the Understanding Module, whose removal caused significant performance degradation, whereas the Repair Functionality provided a more modest contribution. Performance was observed to degrade as problem size scaled from Toy to Medium.

> This work significantly influences the field of LLM-based optimization by providing a rigorous analytical framework for identifying success factors and failure modes. The authors contribute a corrected and comprehensive annotation of existing datasets, alongside LogiOR, a new benchmark designed to broaden evaluation beyond simple optimal value checking. By demonstrating that a single, expert-guided reasoning framework can outperform multi-agent systems, ORThought offers a more computationally efficient and reliable path toward automating optimization modeling, paving the way for broader adoption of AI in operations research and logistics.
