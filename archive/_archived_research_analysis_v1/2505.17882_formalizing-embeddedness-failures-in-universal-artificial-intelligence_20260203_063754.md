## Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the fundamental incompatibility of the AIXI model—the dominant theoretical framework for general reinforcement learning—with the concept of "embedded agency." AIXI operates under a Cartesian dualist assumption, treating the agent and environment as separate modules where the agent inputs actions and receives outputs without influencing the system's structure. In reality, agents are embedded within the world they inhabit and must reason about their own existence and resource constraints. This distinction is critical because without resolving these embeddedness failures, it is impossible to construct a universal theory of intelligence that functions effectively in the physical world, where the boundary between agent and environment is indistinct.

**Innovation**
The key innovation of this paper is the introduction of **"Joint AIXI,"** a mathematical formalism designed to isolate and analyze these limitations. Rather than assuming a one-way causal relationship, Joint AIXI models the joint distribution of the agent's actions and percepts using the universal distribution. This formulation treats the problem as an "unrealizable learning problem," where actions are viewed as being adversarially chosen rather than controlled. By removing the Cartesian separation and treating the agent's actions as part of the environment's history, the authors create a controlled setting to mathematically dissect the specific mechanics of how the agent breaks down when it can no longer rely on the simplifying assumption of separation.

**Results**
The study provides formal proof that the Joint AIXI variant exhibits fundamental embeddedness failures, specifically demonstrating that the agent fails to learn optimal policies. This breakdown occurs because the assumption of environment computability is violated when the agent is treated as part of the environment; the agent cannot distinguish its own influence from environmental dynamics. The authors further benchmark these findings against alternative attempts to bridge the gap: Reflective AIXI fails due to its reliance on reflective oracles that necessitate infinite computation and are not physically realizable, while Self-AIXI fails because it requires unrealistic levels of policy uncertainty resolution that cannot be satisfied in a strictly embedded context.

**Impact**
This work bridges the gap between high-level conceptual critiques and formal mathematical theory by providing the first rigorous definitions of embeddedness failures. It serves as a critical benchmark for the field, proving that simply modeling joint history via the universal distribution is insufficient for embedded agency. By clarifying that current modifications relying on reflective oracles or policy uncertainty also fail to resolve core theoretical issues, the paper steers the research community away from attempting to patch the inherently flawed AIXI framework. Instead, it encourages the development of entirely new, robust theories of intelligence that are fundamentally capable of handling the complexities of being part of the physical world.

## Key Findings

*   **Fundamental Failures:** The AIXI reinforcement learning agent exhibits fundamental failures when utilized as a model of embedded agency.
*   **Formal Proof:** These failure modes are not merely theoretical assertions but can be formally proven to occur within the framework of universal artificial intelligence.
*   **Variant Confirmation:** The analysis specifically confirms these failures in a variant of AIXI that models joint action/percept history using the universal distribution.
*   **Critical Evaluation:** Existing progress toward a successful theory of embedded agency, based on AIXI variants, has been critically evaluated.

## Methodology

The authors employed a **theoretical formalization approach**, moving beyond informal discussion to rigorously define specific failure modes. The study utilized the following components:

1.  **Mathematical Proof:** Demonstrating the occurrence of embeddedness failures within the framework of universal artificial intelligence.
2.  **Specific Focus:** Concentrating on a specific technical variant of AIXI, defined by modeling the joint action/percept history as drawn from the universal distribution.
3.  **Evaluative Review:** Assessing the current state-of-the-art and advancements made in solving embedded agency through AIXI agent modifications.

## Contributions

*   **Rigorous Formalization of Embeddedness Problems:** The paper bridges the gap between conceptual critiques of AIXI and formal mathematical theory by providing precise definitions of embeddedness failures.
*   **Validation of Limitations:** It provides formal proof that standard AIXI models (specifically those utilizing the universal distribution for joint histories) fail to meet the requirements of embedded agency.
*   **Benchmarking Progress:** The work serves as a critical evaluation of existing research, clarifying how much progress has actually been made toward a viable theory of embedded agency using AIXI-based models.

## Technical Details

### Proposed Model: Joint AIXI
The paper proposes 'Joint AIXI' to address the Cartesian dualist limitation of standard AIXI by formalizing embedded agency.
*   **Mechanism:** Models the joint distribution of actions ($a$) and percepts ($e$) on the same footing using the universal distribution, rather than conditioning percepts on actions.
*   **Problem Type:** Treats the problem as an **unrealizable learning problem** where actions are considered adversarially chosen.

### Mathematical Framework
*   **Functions & Measures:** Utilizes lower semicomputable functions and semimeasures (accounting for potential termination via $u(x) \ge \sum \nu(xa)$).
*   **Distributions:** Employs the universal distribution ($\xi_U$) and chronological semimeasures to define probability measures.

### Comparative Architecture
The Joint AIXI architecture is compared against several other models:
*   **Reflective AIXI:** Uses reflective oracles for a realizable, limit-computable problem.
*   **Self-AIXI:** Relies on policy uncertainty and one-step lookahead.
*   **Space-Time Embedded Intelligence:** An alternative framework for embedded systems.
