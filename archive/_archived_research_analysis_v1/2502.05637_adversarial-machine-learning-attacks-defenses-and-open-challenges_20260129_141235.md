## Executive Summary

Current AI systems possess critical vulnerabilities where adversaries can degrade performance by manipulating inputs during inference (**evasion**) or corrupting training data (**poisoning**). This poses a substantial safety risk because modern architectures lack intrinsic security; they perform adequately in standard environments but become dangerously brittle when facing active attackers. The core problem is that current defense evaluations are often static, failing to account for intelligent adversaries who can adapt their strategies to bypass security measures, leaving safety-critical deployments exposed to targeted failures.

This research pivots away from heuristic defense catalogs by introducing **"Adaptive Threat Models,"** a mathematical formalization that treats adversaries as rational actors capable of dynamically evolving their attack vectors. Technically, the innovation lies in establishing rigorous requirements for **"Certified Robustness"**—a framework that demands mathematically proven performance bounds under attack, rather than relying on empirical stability. By modeling the defender-attacker interaction as an optimization problem where the adversary actively counters the defense, the paper sets a new standard for evaluating security that anticipates real-world adaptability rather than just static, known threats.

The analysis uncovers a persistent **"robustness gap,"** demonstrating that while theoretical solutions for certified robustness exist, they suffer from a critical **scalability barrier** that prevents their application to high-dimensional, real-world data. The study quantifies defense efficacy as highly fragile: mechanisms designed for static adversaries frequently fail completely when tested against adaptive opponents capable of adjusting their strategies in response to implemented defenses. Consequently, the paper finds that current guaranteed performance metrics are largely unrealized in practical scenarios, meaning that what is theoretically provable often fails to translate into viable protection in complex, high-dimensional environments.

This work significantly alters the trajectory of adversarial machine learning by shifting the field's focus from ad-hoc patching to the pursuit of mathematically provable guarantees. It delineates a strict boundary between current heuristic capabilities and the necessary advancements for scalable, certified security, effectively serving as a reality check for the state of the art. By establishing the transition from theoretical robustness to practical application as the field's primary open challenge, the paper creates a benchmark that compels researchers to prioritize the development of scalable defenses, ensuring future R&D targets the elimination of the scalability barrier rather than merely refining static mitigations.

## Results

The study indicates that adversaries induce performance degradation through input and data manipulation. It identifies a persistent **robustness gap** in achieving Certified Robustness, meaning current guarantees on performance are not fully realized. A **scalability barrier** was found where theoretical robust solutions fail to scale to real-world deployment. Defense efficacy is quantified as particularly difficult against adaptive adversaries, often resulting in the failure of current defense mechanisms.
