## Executive Summary

Sentiment analysis on social media is a critical component of natural language processing, yet performing this task across multiple languages remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of labeled training data in foreign languages. Standard models often fail to generalize effectively when transferred to low-resource languages where annotated datasets are unavailable or sparse. This paper addresses this limitation by focusing on the difficulty of achieving robust, accurate sentiment classification across diverse linguistic contexts without requiring extensive language-specific training data.

The study introduces a Transformer Ensemble Model designed to synthesize the outputs of two distinct pre-trained multilingual architectures: `bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment` and `XLM-R` (XLM-RoBERTa). Rather than relying on a single classifier, the proposed framework aggregates predictions from these models to enhance robustness and accuracy. Technically, the approach involves a rigorous preprocessing pipeline—including noise removal (hyperlinks, user tags, punctuation) and text normalization—followed by label engineering that collapses a 5-star rating scale into a balanced 3-class categorical format (Negative, Neutral, Positive) to standardize the corpus for analysis.

The proposed ensemble model achieved a sentiment analysis performance exceeding 86%, demonstrating high efficacy in processing multilingual data with minimal reliance on labeled foreign language samples. Beyond aggregate performance, the study found that sentiment distribution varies significantly by language; notably, some languages exhibited higher neutrality rates, a phenomenon the authors attribute to cultural politeness standards. These results validate that the ensemble method can maintain high accuracy while capturing nuanced linguistic behaviors across different regions.

This research offers a viable strategy for overcoming data scarcity in cross-lingual NLP tasks, providing empirical evidence that ensembling diverse pre-trained transformers significantly boosts performance metrics compared to single-model approaches. By establishing a robust framework for analyzing sentiment where labeled data is typically unavailable, the study sets a new benchmark for global sentiment analysis. The findings encourage the broader adoption of ensemble techniques to improve model generalization and accuracy in multilingual social media monitoring.
