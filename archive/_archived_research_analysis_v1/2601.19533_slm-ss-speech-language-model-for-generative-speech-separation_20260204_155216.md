## 📝 Executive Summary

Current speech separation (SS) research is hindered by a fundamental disconnect between signal reconstruction and linguistic utility. Dominant discriminative methods prioritize signal-level metrics like Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SI-SNR), which does not correlate strongly with improved intelligibility in downstream tasks like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). This "semantic gap" means that while separated waveforms may appear clean in signal quality, they often suffer from phonetic distortions that render them less effective for real-world applications.

The paper introduces **SLM-SS**, the first framework to apply Speech Language Models (SLMs) to speech separation by reframing the task as a discrete multi-codebook sequence generation problem. The architecture utilizes a pre-trained neural audio codec to decompose the speech mixture into discrete tokens, processed by a Transformer-based SLM using a hybrid decoding strategy: an autoregressive (AR) model generates the coarse semantic structure, while a non-autoregressive (NAR) model predicts the residual codebooks in parallel.

Evaluations on the LibriMix dataset demonstrate that SLM-SS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative baselines, including SepFormer and Conv-TasNet. While maintaining competitive SI-SNR scores, the model achieves substantial gains in intelligibility, reducing the Word Error Rate (WER) for downstream ASR tasks to approximately **3.8%** on Libri2Mix compared to SepFormer's 4.5%. Furthermore, the hybrid AR-NAR mechanism yields a **10x speedup** in inference latency compared to a fully autoregressive baseline.

This research represents a paradigm shift in speech separation, moving the field from signal-level reconstruction to semantic preservation. By demonstrating that SLMs can effectively model the linguistic aspects of separated speech, SLM-SS bridges the gap between high signal fidelity and high intelligibility. The introduction of hybrid AR-NAR decoding for audio tokens provides a scalable architectural blueprint for future generative audio tasks, offering a viable path to real-time deployment.
