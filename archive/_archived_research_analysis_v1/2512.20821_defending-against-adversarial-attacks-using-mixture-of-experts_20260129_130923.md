## Executive Summary

Deep learning models deployed in security-sensitive environments remain vulnerable to adversarial examples—inputs perturbed to induce misclassification. While adversarial training is the primary defense, it typically necessitates computationally intensive monolithic architectures, creating a prohibitive trade-off between robustness and operational latency. This paper addresses this scalability bottleneck, aiming to deliver state-of-the-art defense suitable for resource-constrained applications where hardware limitations prevent the deployment of massive, parameter-heavy models.

The authors introduce a defense architecture that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework with adversarial training. The system utilizes nine distinct expert models employing a standard ResNet-18 backbone, governed by a gating mechanism to route inputs. The core technical innovation is an end-to-end training strategy employing joint optimization to simultaneously update both the expert parameters and the gating network. By embedding adversarial training within this modular architecture, the model distributes the burden of defense across specialized experts, leveraging architectural diversity rather than relying on a single, complex classifier.

Empirical evaluation on the CIFAR-10 benchmark demonstrates that the proposed MoE-based system achieves a robust accuracy of **53.8%** against Projected Gradient Descent (PGD-10) attacks, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline of a standard adversarially trained ResNet-18, which scored approximately **49.5%**. The system also demonstrated superior resilience against Carlini & Wagner (C&W) attacks, maintaining a robust accuracy of roughly **50.2%**. Furthermore, the architecture preserved clean accuracy at approximately **83.9%**, confirming that the modular specialization does not compromise standard classification performance while delivering a measurable improvement in robustness over monolithic counterparts.

This research establishes a new efficiency-performance standard for adversarial defense, demonstrating that architectural specialization can outperform sheer model complexity. By proving that a system composed of standard backbones can surpass more intricate single-model defenses, the paper offers a practical pathway for deploying robust models in resource-constrained environments. These findings suggest a significant shift in the field, indicating that transitioning from monolithic models to Mixture-of-Experts architectures with joint optimization is a promising direction for securing machine learning systems against evolving adversarial threats.
