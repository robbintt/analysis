## Executive Summary

Deep Learning (DL) models for Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) are critical for cognitive radio systems but are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Conventional adversarial training (AT) methods suffer from inherent brittleness; they robustify models only against the specific perturbations seen during training and fail catastrophically when facing novel, unseen attack vectors. Furthermore, standard AT requires computationally prohibitive full retraining to adapt to new threats, creating a barrier to deployment in resource-constrained environments where rapid adaptation is essential.

The authors propose a **meta-learning-based adversarial training framework** designed to transition from static retraining to dynamic, rapid adaptation. Utilizing Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), the framework optimizes the model's initial parameters to be highly adaptable, treating each adversarial attack as a distinct task. This enables the model to **"learn to learn"** across diverse adversarial scenarios, establishing a robust set of initial weights that facilitates few-shot learning.

Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional adversarial training baselines. Against unseen adversarial attacks, the meta-learning approach achieved robust classification accuracies of approximately **80%**, whereas standard adversarial training plummeted to roughly **60%**—an improvement of over 20 percentage points. Additionally, the results confirm a drastic reduction in computational overhead; the framework achieves effective adaptation using only **5-shot learning steps**, validating the method's efficiency in maintaining high performance across various attack scenarios.

## Methodology

The authors propose a meta-learning-based adversarial training framework for Deep Learning (DL) Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) models. The core methodology shifts away from static, full retraining:

*   **Meta-Learning Integration:** Uses meta-learning algorithms to train the model's ability to learn, rather than just learning the classification task itself.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** Facilitates generalization across adversarial scenarios by enabling fast online adaptation to novel perturbations.
*   **Efficiency:** Focuses on achieving high performance with **minimal data** requirements during the adaptation phase.
