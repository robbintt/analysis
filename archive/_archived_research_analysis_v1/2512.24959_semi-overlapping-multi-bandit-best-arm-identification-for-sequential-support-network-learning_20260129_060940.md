## Executive Summary

This research addresses the inefficiency of traditional Best Arm Identification (BAI) methods when applied to complex systems involving shared resources or interdependent tasks. Standard multi-armed bandit models typically evaluate arms in isolation, failing to account for scenarios where a single evaluation action yields data for multiple decision-makers or tasks simultaneously. This limitation is significant in modern AI applications such as Multi-Task Learning, Federated Learning, and Multi-Agent Systems, where evaluating a specific data point or model parameter can provide relevant feedback for multiple contributing nodes. To bridge this gap, the authors formalize the problem within the **Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL)** framework, which aims to identify the highest-performing support networks from sparse candidate lists.

The core innovation is the introduction of the **Semi-overlapping Multi-bandit (SOMMAB)** model, a pure-exploration framework that captures asymmetric feedback via structural arm overlaps. In this model, arms are grouped into evaluation clusters; selecting a single arm pulls the corresponding cluster using one budget unit but generates distinct reward distributions (feedback) for every arm within that group. To navigate this structure efficiently, the authors propose a **generalized Gap-based Exploration (GapE)** algorithm. Technically, this approach computes an index $B_{mk}(t)$ for every arm, combining a negative estimated gap with a confidence radius to optimally balance exploration and exploitation. A critical technical feature is the algorithm's ability to update statistics for all arms in a group simultaneously upon a single selection, leveraging the semi-overlapping structure to maximize information extraction.

Theoretically, the generalized GapE algorithm achieves significant improvements in sample efficiency and error bounds compared to standard baselines. While the standard GapE algorithm utilizes an error exponent constant of $1/144$, the proposed solution improves this constant to **$1/59$** when the initialization parameter $l=1$, representing an improvement factor greater than 2.4. Further optimization, specifically with $l=152$, boosts the constant to **$1/41$**, yielding an improvement factor greater than 3.5. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates that for $r$-order semi-overlapping multi-bandits, the error bound scales linearly with the degree of overlap. This effectively simulates a multiplicative increase in the available budget $n$ by a factor of $r$, proving substantial gains in sample complexity derived from shared evaluations.

This work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for sequential learning in environments characterized by shared yet asymmetric evaluation processes. By defining SSNL as a unifying framework, the paper bridges pure-exploration bandit theory with practical applications in areas requiring partner contribution evaluation and simultaneous candidate selection.

## Methodology

The authors approach the problem by formulating it under the **Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL)** framework. The primary goal is modeled as learning a directed graph representing the highest-performing contributions from partners.

The methodology relies on the **semi-overlapping multi-bandit (SOMMAB)** model to capture shared yet asymmetric evaluation processes. This allows a single trial to provide feedback to multiple bandits simultaneously.

A **generalized GapE algorithm** is proposed specifically for the SOMMAB environment. This is supported by a theoretical analysis that derives performance guarantees regarding:
*   Exponential error bounds.
*   Scaling relative to the degree of structural overlap.

## Technical Details

The paper presents the SOMMAB (**Semi-Overlapping Multi-Armed Bandit**) model to address the Best Arm Identification (BAI) problem.

### Model Structure
*   **Grouping:** Arms are grouped into evaluation groups.
*   **Selection Mechanism:** Selecting an arm pulls the corresponding group with a single budget unit.
*   **Feedback:** Allows for asymmetric feedback (distinct reward distributions) for arms within the group.

### Algorithm: Generalized GapE
The approach generalizes the Gap-based Exploration (GapE) algorithm:
*   **Index Computation:** Computes an index $B_{mk}(t)$ that combines a negative estimated gap and a confidence radius to balance exploitation and exploration.
*   **Simultaneous Updates:** Updates statistics for all arms in a group simultaneously upon selection.
*   **Initialization:** Utilizes an initialization parameter $l$.

### Framework
The paper frames **Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL)** as the unified framework for this problem class.

## Results

The analysis focuses on theoretical bounds minimizing the probability of error $\ell(n)$ and sample complexity defined by $H$.

### Performance Comparison
Compared to the standard GapE baseline ($1/144$), the generalized algorithm achieves significant improvements in the exponent constant:

*   **Configuration $l=1$:**
    *   Constant: **$1/59$**
    *   Improvement Factor: **> 2.4x**
*   **Configuration $l=152$:**
    *   Constant: **$1/41$**
    *   Improvement Factor: **> 3.5x**

### Scaling Efficiency
For $r$-order semi-overlapping multi-bandits, the error bound scales **linearly with the overlap order**. This effectively acts as if the budget $n$ is multiplied by $r$.

### Parameters
*   The optimal initialization parameter is determined to be **152**.
*   Validity constraint: Values must be $\leq 152$ to maintain proof validity.
