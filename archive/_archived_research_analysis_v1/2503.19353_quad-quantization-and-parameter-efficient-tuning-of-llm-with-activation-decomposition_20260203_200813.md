## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of enabling aggressive 4-bit weight and activation (W4A4) quantization for medium-sized Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5. While extreme quantization is essential for reducing memory bandwidth and accelerating inference on resource-constrained hardware, it typically causes significant accuracy degradation due to activation outliers—extreme magnitude values that disrupt standard quantization ranges. Existing rotation-based methods have struggled to suppress these outliers effectively in medium-sized architectures without incurring high computational costs or substantial performance loss, creating a bottleneck for deploying efficient, high-performance models in production environments.

The authors propose QUAD (Quantization with Activation Decomposition), a framework that mathematically isolates and manages outliers using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The core technical innovation involves classifying Transformer weight matrices into U-type (Input-side) and D-type (Output-side) categories. An offline calibration process estimates activation singular vectors to construct an orthogonal transformation matrix. This matrix rotates the activation space, shifting outlier components into specific dimensions that are retained in full precision, while the remaining "smooth" components are compressed to 4-bit. The framework executes a three-stage pipeline: transformation to smooth activations, mixed-precision quantization (employing GPTQ for weights), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning that adapts only the retained full-precision outlier weights to restore accuracy.

QUAD demonstrates robust performance under aggressive compression constraints, achieving 94% to 96% of the full-precision baseline accuracy on medium-sized models like Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5. These results outperform existing rotation-based methods such as QuaRot and SpinQuant across standard evaluation benchmarks. Furthermore, when combined with Parameter-Efficient Tuning using a W4A4/A8 configuration, the framework recovers up to 98% of the original accuracy, effectively bridging the performance gap with full-precision models. The method is noted for its efficient offline calibration costs and full compatibility with INT4 tensor cores, validating its practical applicability.

This work is significant because it resolves the long-standing conflict between low-bit compression and activation outliers in modern LLMs. By demonstrating that preserving and tuning only a small subset of outlier dimensions is sufficient to maintain near-original accuracy, QUAD establishes a new standard for unified quantization and tuning strategies. This capability facilitates the deployment of state-of-the-art medium-sized LLMs on edge devices and consumer hardware without sacrificing the reasoning capabilities required of full-precision models, potentially influencing future hardware and software co-design for efficient inference.
