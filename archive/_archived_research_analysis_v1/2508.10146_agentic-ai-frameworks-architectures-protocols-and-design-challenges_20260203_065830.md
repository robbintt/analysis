## Executive Summary

The rapid proliferation of Agentic AI frameworks has resulted in a highly fragmented ecosystem lacking standardization, creating significant challenges for interoperability, system robustness, and architectural coherence. As organizations seek to deploy autonomous multi-agent systems, the absence of a unified taxonomy makes it difficult to compare tools or ensure they align with established engineering principles. This fragmentation poses a risk of developing brittle, non-scalable solutions that cannot effectively coordinate across different platforms, necessitating a rigorous structural analysis to guide future development.

This research addresses the fragmentation by establishing a foundational taxonomy and conducting a systematic comparative analysis of seven leading frameworks: **CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, Agno, Google ADK, and MetaGPT**. Technically, the authors evaluate these systems against specific criteria—including architectural principles, memory management, and safety guardrails—while mapping their communication protocols (e.g., Contract Net Protocol, A2A, ANP, Agora) to established Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) paradigms. This approach allows for a precise assessment of how well current agent frameworks align with traditional, standardized service models.

As this study is a systematic review rather than an experimental benchmark, it does not provide quantitative performance metrics (e.g., latency or throughput). Instead, the primary results are qualitative, providing a detailed comparative matrix of the selected frameworks. The analysis identifies that while current frameworks offer diverse architectural approaches, they universally struggle with critical system limitations. Specifically, the review highlights significant deficits in scalability and robustness across the board, revealing that current interoperability solutions remain insufficient for complex, multi-agent environments.

This work provides a critical roadmap for the next generation of autonomous AI systems by synthesizing the state of the art into a comprehensive reference model. By identifying the disconnect between current Agentic AI tools and traditional service-oriented standards, the paper guides researchers toward resolving fundamental challenges in multi-agent coordination. Ultimately, this taxonomy serves as a foundational resource for engineers and researchers in selecting appropriate frameworks and directs future R&D efforts toward creating more standardized, scalable, and interoperable agent ecosystems.
