## Executive Summary

Traditional constraint-based (e.g., PC) and score-based (e.g., NOTEARS) algorithms for causal discovery face significant limitations when identifying complex causal structures in tabular data. These approaches frequently struggle to resolve causal directionality and are typically restricted to modeling linear associations. This renders them insufficient for capturing the intricate, non-linear dependencies inherent in complex systems like biological networks. This limitation is critical because effective causal inference is often impossible in these domains due to the impracticality of controlled experiments, leaving researchers reliant on observational data that standard methods cannot accurately interpret.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces **CALM (Causal Analysis Language Model)**, which bridges the modality gap between language modeling and tabular data analysis by adapting the Mamba architecture for causal discovery. Instead of optimizing graph structures directly, CALM reframes causal discovery as a pattern classification task derived from pairwise variable relationships, treating inference as a sequential modeling problem similar to those used in natural language processing. The architecture integrates three distinct technical components—local causal scoring mechanisms, conditional independence tests, and relational attributes—to synthesize evidence from diverse patterns. Significantly, the model is trained on a comprehensive corpus of diverse synthetic data combined with 10 real-world biological datasets that possess rigorously validated ground-truth causal relationships.

In comprehensive simulation studies, CALM achieved over **91% accuracy**, significantly outperforming established baselines including the PC algorithm and NOTEARS. The model demonstrated superior capability in resolving causal direction and modeling non-linear and conditional mechanisms compared to these traditional approaches. Furthermore, CALM was validated in a real-world biological case study, where it successfully identified specific causal factors related to the progression of the **Hepatitis C virus**, confirming its effectiveness in capturing a broad spectrum of relationships ranging from linear to highly non-linear.

This research represents a significant advancement in causal inference by successfully applying the pattern recognition capabilities of large language models to tabular data. By overcoming the restrictive assumptions of linearity and directionality that limit traditional methods, CALM offers robust generalizability for analyzing complex systems where interventions are infeasible. This approach suggests a new pathway for automating discovery in scientific domains, potentially enabling more accurate insights in genomics, systems biology, and other fields reliant on observational data.
