## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of optimizing control parameters in distributed multi-agent systems (MAS) operating under unknown, nonconvex reward functions and coupled constraints. The primary difficulty lies in balancing three often conflicting requirements: maintaining a distributed architecture (relying solely on nearest-neighbor communication), ensuring strict safety guarantees, and achieving sample efficiency. Existing literature typically prioritizes only one or two of these aspects; centralized approaches fail to scale, while distributed methods often ignore safety or require prohibitive amounts of data. This limitation is particularly acute for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, where system failures during the tuning process are unacceptable.

The core innovation is a distributed Safe Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework that reformulates a static global optimization problem into a time-varying local optimization problem. By treating time as a latent variable, agents can model the influence of non-neighboring agents through one-step time-series prediction using the Gaussian Process (GP) mean, effectively capturing global dynamics without requiring full connectivity. The approach employs a custom spatio-temporal kernel—multiplicatively decomposed into a spatial Matérn52 kernel and a temporal pre-RKHS component—to inject prior structural knowledge into the GP regression.

Safety is rigorously maintained through the use of confidence intervals and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) norm assumptions, ensuring that parameters are only selected if their lower confidence bound exceeds a defined safety threshold. The proposed algorithm was validated across three experiments demonstrating both efficacy and robustness. In a four-agent toy example ($T=50$ iterations), agents successfully improved rewards while strictly maintaining a safety threshold of $h=0.22$, with zero unsafe parameter evaluations. An eight-agent scenario showed the method outperforming baselines such as "No Latent Variable" and "No Communication," while a "Full Communication" baseline failed due to dimensionality issues. Finally, in a vehicle platooning simulation with four heavy-duty vehicles, the algorithm optimized P-controller gains from an initial state of $[4, 5, 4, 5]$ to a final state of $[6.57, 5.00, 4.44, 6.77]$ over 50 episodes, significantly improving performance without incurring a single safety violation (crash).
