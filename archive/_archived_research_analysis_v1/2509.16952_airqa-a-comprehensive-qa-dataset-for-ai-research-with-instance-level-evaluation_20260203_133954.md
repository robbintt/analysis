## Executive Summary

Evaluating AI agents on scientific literature is hindered by the lack of comprehensive, realistic benchmarks capable of assessing complex reasoning and tool-use, alongside a critical scarcity of high-quality interaction trajectory data needed to train smaller models. Existing datasets often fail to cover the necessary breadth of task types—such as multi-document analysis or cross-modal interpretation—or rely on expensive, subjective evaluation methods. This paper addresses these dual challenges by establishing a rigorous standard for scientific QA and providing a mechanism to overcome data limitations for model training.

The authors introduce **AirQA**, a human-annotated dataset comprising 1,246 questions grounded in 13,948 AI research papers, alongside the **ExTrActor** automated synthesis framework. AirQA is technically distinct in its coverage of four task types and five modalities. It employs a rigorous instance-level evaluation system using 19 Python functions for objective checks and GPT-4o-mini for subjective logic, ensuring strict, binary scoring based on specific "scoring points."

The AirQA dataset presents a challenging workload with a balanced distribution of questions. Benchmarks reveal that most current state-of-the-art LLMs significantly underperform on this dataset; for instance, GPT-4o achieved only approximately **41.7% accuracy** under the strict evaluation protocol. However, small language models fine-tuned using data synthesized by the ExTrActor framework demonstrated marked improvement, achieving accuracy scores nearing **40%**, which makes them comparable to large, resource-intensive models.

This work significantly advances the field by providing a cost-effective, objective benchmark that fills a critical gap in the evaluation of scientific AI agents. By demonstrating that automated instruction tuning via ExTrActor can bridge the performance gap between small and large models, the research offers a scalable path toward deploying efficient, capable AI agents in research settings.

## Key Findings

*   **LLM Underperformance:** Evaluations using the AirQA dataset reveal that most current open-source and proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform, validating the dataset's quality and the complexity of scientific QA tasks.
*   **ExTrActor Efficacy:** The ExTrActor framework significantly improves the multi-turn tool-use capabilities of smaller language models.
*   **Parity Achieved:** Through the use of ExTrActor-generated data, small models are able to achieve performance levels comparable to larger, more resource-intensive models in scientific paper QA workflows.
