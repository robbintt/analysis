## Executive Summary

This research addresses the "embeddedness problem" within Universal Artificial Intelligence, specifically targeting the structural limitations of the AIXI model. Standard AIXI relies on Cartesian dualism, assuming a strict separation between the agent and its environment; however, this abstraction creates a disconnect from physical reality where agents are embedded within the world. The authors investigate why this disconnect causes specific theoretical failures, such as self-referential inconsistencies and the agent's inability to distinguish its own actions from environmental noise. This formalization is critical because it rigorously demonstrates the theoretical barriers that physically grounded models face within the current Universal AI framework.

The key innovation is the formalization of **"Joint AIXI,"** a variant designed to model the joint distribution of actions and percepts rather than assuming a separation. The authors distinguish technically between actions as free variables chosen by the agent (standard AIXI) and actions as events sampled from the environment (Joint AIXI). By utilizing the universal distribution ($\xi_U$) over the class of lower semicomputable semimeasures ($M_{semi}^{lsc}$), the paper employs chronological semimeasures $\nu_\cdot(e_{1:t} || a_{1:t})$ to frame the agent's environment as an unrealizable problem with adversarial actions. This rigorous mathematical approach allows for the formal definition and proof of embeddedness failures, moving the discussion beyond informal assertions to concrete theoretical evidence.

The study yields specific theoretical classifications regarding the feasibility of different embedded agency approaches. It formally proves that Joint AIXI constitutes an unrealizable learning problem, confirming that embeddedness failures are intrinsic to this formulation. In a comparative assessment, the research finds that "Reflective AIXI" constitutes a realizable learning problem, achieving a limit-computable result through a stochastic anytime algorithm. Conversely, "Space-Time Embedded Intelligence" is assessed as making too few assumptions to be practically useful. These results provide precise complexity delineations for current AIXI variants, clearly distinguishing between realizable and unrealizable formulations.

This work significantly influences theoretical computer science and AI safety research by establishing the mathematical limits of the AIXI framework regarding physical constraints. By proving that certain embeddedness failures are unavoidable within the standard Universal AI framework, the authors prevent researchers from pursuing theoretically dead-end paths. The paper provides a solid foundation for future inquiry, directing the field toward more promising, realizable models like Reflective AIXI and emphasizing the necessity for new theoretical tools that reconcile the universal nature of intelligence with the physical realities of the real world.
