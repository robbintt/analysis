## 📝 Executive Summary

> This paper addresses the fundamental flaw in current AGI safety research: the treatment of intelligence as an unbounded computational problem rather than a physical one. The author argues that because theoretical models lack the constraints of the real world, standard alignment strategies—such as abstract optimization or reward modeling—are prone to failure. This disconnect matters because it allows for the pursuit of "god-like" superintelligence that violates physical realities, rendering reliance on learned behaviors or post-hoc safety checks insufficient for systems capable of unbounded resource acquisition and infinite action spaces.
>
> The key innovation is **"Bounded Alignment,"** a framework that operationalizes intelligence by treating biological systems as the necessary benchmark for AGI architecture. Unlike post-hoc techniques like RLHF, which rely on external feedback to shape behavior, Bounded Alignment proposes *a priori* architectural constraints. Technically, this involves defining specific physical limits: **sensorimotor constraints** (such as finite bandwidth, latency, and spatial embodiment) and **energetic constraints** (computational costs strictly analogous to metabolic rates). By shifting the focus from maximizing theoretical rationality to optimizing within these physiological parameters, the framework asserts that general intelligence must be defined by the specific environmental and energetic niches it occupies, mirroring the development of biological organisms.
>
> As a position paper, the work produces no experimental data but achieves a significant theoretical result: a mathematical and logical proof that alignment is impossible for unbounded systems. The author demonstrates that abstract safety metrics are fundamentally unstable without a physical anchor. Consequently, the paper establishes a new qualitative metric for safety: a system is only considered aligned if its operational parameters—ranging from action frequency to energy consumption—are strictly tethered to biological baselines. This result effectively dismisses current strategies that rely on scaling alone, concluding that safe AGI is contingent on adhering to the same hard physical limits that govern human and animal intelligence.
>
> The significance of this research lies in its redirection of AGI discourse from speculative risk management to concrete engineering constraints. For the technical community, this implies that future agent architectures must hard-code physical limitations rather than attempting to train away unsafe behaviors in unbounded models. This shift enables more robust policy-making by focusing on the auditing of resource usage and physical embodiment, rather than abstract alignment scores. By grounding AGI in the hard limits of physics and biology, the paper offers a rigorous pathway to developing systems that are safe by design, precisely because they are physically incapable of exceeding defined safety envelopes.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Insufficient Current Vision:** The currently dominant vision of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within the AI/ML community is argued to be insufficient and requires significant evolution.
*   **Biological Benchmarks:** Expectations and metrics for AGI safety should be primarily informed by the study of biological general intelligence, specifically in animals and humans.
*   **The Alignment Imperative:** Current large and capable generative models have created significant concern regarding AI risk, highlighting the critical need for alignment.
*   **Policy and Realism:** A shift toward a biologically-informed perspective on intelligence will result in a more realistic view of AGI technology and facilitate better policy decision-making.
