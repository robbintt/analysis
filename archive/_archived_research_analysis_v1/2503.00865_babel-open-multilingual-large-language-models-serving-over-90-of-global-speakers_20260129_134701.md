> ### 💡 Executive Summary
>
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have historically favored high-resource languages, leaving a vast majority of the global population underserved. This research addresses this critical scarcity by introducing **Babel**, a family of open-source multilingual LLMs focused on widely spoken yet under-resourced languages such as Hindi, Urdu, and Swahili.
>
> The authors employ a novel **Layer Extension Technique** to scale parameters and elevate performance ceilings without relying on computationally expensive continued pretraining. This involves inserting new layers initialized with Gaussian noise into the second half of a 72B backbone (expanded to 83B). The study offers two variants: **Babel-9B** for efficient inference and **Babel-83B** for maximum benchmark performance.
>
> Evaluations demonstrate that Babel covers the top 25 languages, reaching approximately 7 billion people. **Babel-9B-Chat** ranks first among all open-source models in the 10B parameter class, while **Babel-83B-Chat** rivals commercial closed-source giants. This work establishes a new state-of-the-art standard for open multilingual LLMs, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for researchers in low-resource linguistic environments.
