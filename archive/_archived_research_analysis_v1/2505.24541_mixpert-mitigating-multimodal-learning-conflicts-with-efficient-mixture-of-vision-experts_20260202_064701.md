## Executive Summary

> This research addresses the critical limitation of "domain conflicts" in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that rely on a single vision encoder. In standard architectures, a shared visual encoder struggles to reconcile the diverse feature requirements of different domains—such as charts, documents, and natural images—during multi-task optimization. This inter-task competition creates a performance ceiling where the model cannot specialize in specific tasks without sacrificing general capabilities or incurring the prohibitive computational costs associated with deploying multiple separate encoders.

The authors propose **Mixpert**, an efficient Mixture-of-Vision-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to replace or augment standard single encoders. The core innovation is a hybrid training strategy that utilizes a dynamic routing mechanism to allocate input images to the most suitable specialized visual expert. Unlike isolated multi-encoder systems, Mixpert retains the benefits of Joint Optimization for foundational knowledge while simultaneously enabling Task-Specific Specialization. This restructuring of the learning process effectively eliminates inter-task interference by allowing domain-specific experts to evolve without conflicting with one another.

Evaluation based on the LLaVA-OV-7B (SI) architecture demonstrates that Mixpert’s hybrid approach significantly outperforms standard baselines across specific benchmarks. On the **ChartQA** benchmark, Mixpert improved accuracy from 42.2% to 53.1%, representing a substantial 26% relative gain, while on **DocVQA**, performance increased from 68.5% to 78.8%. Crucially, these specialization gains did not compromise general capabilities; on the **MMBench** benchmark, the model maintained a competitive score of 67.3% compared to the 67.1% baseline, effectively validating the strategy of combining Joint SFT with task-specific fine-tuning over pure joint learning.

Mixpert offers a significant advancement in the efficiency and capability of MLLMs by solving the persistent trade-off between model specialization and resource expenditure. By demonstrating that domain conflicts can be mitigated to achieve measurable accuracy boosts in chart and document understanding while preserving general reasoning, this work provides a blueprint for building more versatile visual systems without exploding inference costs. The architecture's universal compatibility allows for seamless integration into existing MLLM frameworks, positioning Mixpert as a scalable solution for enhancing the robustness of vision-language models in complex, real-world applications.
