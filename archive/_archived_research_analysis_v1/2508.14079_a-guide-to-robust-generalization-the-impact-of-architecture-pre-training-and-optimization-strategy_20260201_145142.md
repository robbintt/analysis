## Executive Summary

### 🚨 Problem
Ensuring deep learning models generalize robustly against unseen perturbations—such as novel adversarial attacks or distribution shifts—remains a critical challenge in computer vision. As the field trends toward complex attention-based architectures and resource-intensive self-supervised or robust pretraining strategies, there is insufficient empirical evidence regarding how these design choices truly impact a model's ability to handle unexpected threats. Misconceptions about the universal superiority of certain architectures can lead to suboptimal model selection in safety-critical applications.

### 💡 Innovation
The authors established the most comprehensive benchmark for robust fine-tuning to date, empirically evaluating **1,440 distinct training configurations**. The methodology isolates four key dimensions:
*   **Architecture:** 40 pretrained checkpoints from 19 families.
*   **Pretraining Strategy:** Supervised, Multistep, Robust, Self-Supervised, and Fusion.
*   **Adaptation Protocol:** Full Fine-Tuning, Partial Fine-Tuning, and Linear Probing.
*   **Optimization Objectives:** Classic AT and TRADES.

### 📈 Results
The experimental setup generated **7,200 robustness measurements** across 23 distinct perturbations. The empirical results reveal several counter-intuitive findings that challenge current deep learning dogmas:
*   **CNN vs. Attention:** Standard CNNs pretrained in a supervised manner consistently outperform attention-based models (e.g., Vision Transformers) in robust generalization.
*   **Pretraining Efficacy:** Robust pretraining does not guarantee superior performance over standard supervised pretraining.
*   **Efficiency:** Robust fine-tuning is a highly efficient alternative to training from scratch, offering comparable security with lower computational costs.
*   **Correlation Gap:** High accuracy against training perturbations fails to correlate with robustness to unseen threats.

### 🌍 Impact
This research provides a data-driven guide for practitioners, challenging the assumption that attention-based architectures are optimal for generalization. By validating robust fine-tuning as a practical alternative to expensive pipelines, it offers a pathway for resource-constrained organizations to improve security. The study also highlights new research directions by identifying discrepancies between current trends and empirical performance.

## Results

Standard CNNs pretrained with supervision generally outperform attention-based models in robust generalization. While robust pretraining does not consistently outperform standard supervised pretraining across all architectures and sizes, robust fine-tuning is confirmed as an efficient alternative to training from scratch with specialized losses. Ultimately, robustness is highly sensitive to the choice of optimization, architecture, and pretraining combinations; notably, robustness to training perturbations does not ensure robustness to unseen perturbations.
