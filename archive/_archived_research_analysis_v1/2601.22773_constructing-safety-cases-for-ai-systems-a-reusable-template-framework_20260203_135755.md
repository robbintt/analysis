## 📑 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical disconnect between classical safety engineering and the unique characteristics of modern AI systems. Traditional safety cases, which rely on deterministic logic and static behavior, are ill-equipped to handle the unpredictable, emergent behaviors inherent in generative and agentic AI. As these systems become more autonomous and capable of evolving post-deployment, existing assurance frameworks lack the necessary structure to verify safety effectively. This creates a significant barrier to the reliable deployment of frontier AI technologies, as current methods cannot account for the dynamic nature of advanced models.

To resolve these challenges, the authors employ a rigorous two-phase methodology that combines analytical examination with framework design. The first phase involves a comprehensive investigation of current safety-case practices through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to characterize the specific failure points when applied to AI dynamics. The second phase focuses on the design of a reusable template framework, operationalized through end-to-end patterns intended to shift safety assurance from deterministic to discovery-driven methodologies. This methodological structure enables the systematic derivation of safety arguments that can adapt to evolving AI capabilities, effectively resolving technical bottlenecks such as evaluation without ground truth.

This methodology produced a comprehensive Reusable Template Framework defined by specific AI taxonomies and operational components. The framework utilizes a Claims–Arguments–Evidence (CAE) structure augmented with distinct categories for Claims (e.g., Assertion, Capability), Arguments (six types, including Demonstrative), and Evidence (seven types, including Mechanistic), organized within a Hierarchy of Abstraction. The ecosystem pipeline comprises three components: an AI Safety Case Builder, a Validator, and a Registry. The supporting SLR quantitatively screened 1,235 initial papers, adding 807 via seed snowballing and 46 via Google Scholar, ultimately refining the dataset to 112 high-relevance publications. This analysis successfully yielded a unified taxonomy for AI safety components and characterized the failure points of traditional safety cases, particularly regarding post-deployment capability discovery.

This work significantly advances the field by providing a standardized, systematic method for constructing auditable safety arguments for complex AI. By establishing a reusable, composable framework that adapts to the emergent nature of generative AI, the research offers a practical path forward for industry and regulators seeking to assure high-stakes systems. The ability to handle dynamic updates and evaluation without ground truth positions this framework as a foundational tool for the future assurance of adaptive and autonomous AI technologies, facilitating the reliable deployment of frontier models.
