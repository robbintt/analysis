## Executive Summary

Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are fundamentally limited in their capacity for fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning, often failing to simulate the physical dynamics necessary for complex environments. This creates a critical bottleneck for embodied AI and robotics, where agents must achieve robust zero-shot generalization—adapting to unseen data distributions without task-specific fine-tuning—relying solely on visual cues and high-level instructions to navigate novel physical spaces.

The authors introduce a novel paradigm that formulates visual reasoning as a conditional video generation problem, shifting from textual reasoning chains to generating sequences of visual frames as intermediate reasoning steps. Utilizing a fine-tuned Wan 2.2 TI2V 5B model, the system learns a conditional policy $P(\text{Trajectory} | \text{Icon}, \text{Layout})$. A key technical innovation is the integration of **"Visual Context,"** which employs explicit visual controls—such as agent icons and tangram shapes—to maintain visual consistency.

Furthermore, the paper establishes a **"Visual Test-Time Scaling"** strategy that manipulates the inference budget by increasing total frame count and adjusting a scaling factor ($\kappa$) for frames per step, allowing the model to dynamically allocate more computation to complex planning tasks. The methodology was evaluated across Maze Navigation (sequential discrete planning) and Tangram Puzzles (continuous manipulation).

In Maze Navigation, the study demonstrated a clear Visual Test-Time Scaling Law; increasing the inference budget significantly enhanced Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization. Conversely, the Tangram task maintained robustness but exhibited no scaling trend due to rigid geometric consistency constraints. This research shifts the perception of video generation models from media creation tools to scalable, generalizable engines for visual reasoning.

## Key Findings

*   **Robust Zero-Shot Generalization:** The video generation model demonstrates high performance on unseen data distributions in both Maze Navigation and Tangram Puzzle tasks without requiring specific fine-tuning.
*   **Utility of Visual Context:** The model effectively utilizes explicit visual controls, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, to maintain visual consistency and robustly adapt planning capabilities to new patterns.
*   **Visual Test-Time Scaling Law:** A scaling law was observed in sequential planning where increasing the generated video length (the visual inference budget) significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, particularly for spatially and temporally complex paths.
*   **Efficacy Across Visual Regimes:** The approach proves effective in two distinct environments:
    *   **Maze Navigation:** Sequential discrete planning with low visual change.
    *   **Tangram Puzzle:** Continuous manipulation with high visual change.

## Methodology

The study posits that generated frames serve as intermediate reasoning steps bridging the gap between an initial state and a final solution. To validate this, the authors focused on assessing the model's ability to handle fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning—areas where traditional VLMs typically struggle.

### Task Selection
*   **Maze Navigation:** Used to assess sequential discrete planning characterized by low visual change.
*   **Tangram Puzzle:** Used to assess continuous manipulation characterized by high visual change.

## Results

Experiments covered Maze Navigation and Tangram Puzzles, evaluated using metrics such as EM (Exact Match), PR (Precision), Score, and OOD (Out-of-Distribution) performance.

*   **Visual Anchoring:** Enabled successful zero-shot generalization compared to textual instructions alone.
*   **Scaling Law (Maze):** In Maze Navigation, increased inference budget (more frames) significantly enhanced OOD generalization.
*   **Geometric Constraints (Tangram):** Tangram Puzzles showed no scaling trend due to geometric consistency constraints, though robustness was maintained. The 'Translation' setting was the strongest for Tangrams.
*   **Failure Modes:**
    *   **Mazes:** 'Cross the wall' (violating spatial boundaries) and 'Distortion'.
    *   **Tangrams:** Incorrect predictions.
