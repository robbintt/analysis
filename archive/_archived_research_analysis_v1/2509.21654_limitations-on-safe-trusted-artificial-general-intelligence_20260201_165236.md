## Executive Summary

This paper addresses a fundamental theoretical conflict in artificial intelligence research: the incompatibility between ensuring strict safety and achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The authors investigate whether it is mathematically possible to construct a system that is perfectly "safe" (never making false claims) and "trusted" (where the operator relies on that safety) while simultaneously meeting the definition of an **AGI** (matching or exceeding human capabilities across all tasks). This problem is critical because it challenges the prevailing assumption that safety mechanisms can be layered onto increasingly capable systems without imposing fundamental performance limitations, potentially revealing hard theoretical boundaries on what reliable super-intelligent systems can actually achieve.

The key innovation is the establishment of a rigorous mathematical framework that formally defines concepts often treated qualitatively—Safety, Trust, and AGI—using precise computational terms. Technically, the authors employ proof strategies from classical theoretical computer science, specifically leveraging diagonalization, reductions from the Halting Problem, and the construction of self-referential "Gödel programs." The model allows an AI system to solve problems or abstain (potentially using randomization), but it enforces a hard constraint on false claims. By applying theorems from mathematical logic (Gödel’s incompleteness) and computability theory (Turing’s undecidability) to modern AI architectures, they create a formal basis for analyzing system limitations.

The study presents definitive impossibility results and specific complexity separations. **Theorem 3.2** proves that for program verification, a system cannot be both safe/trusted and an AGI. Similarly, **Theorems 3.6** and **3.8** demonstrate that deterministic safe systems cannot achieve AGI performance in planning domains due to undecidability. In terms of complexity metrics, **Theorems 3.11** and **3.13** establish a stark efficiency gap in graph reachability: while humans can verify solutions in constant time $O(1)$, a safe system requires near-linear time $O(T)$ to avoid making false claims.

This research significantly influences the field by rigorously grounding AI safety discourse in classical computability theory, moving the conversation beyond empirical observations to mathematical necessity. It implies that the pursuit of a "perfectly safe" AGI is theoretically impossible under strict definitions, suggesting an inevitable trade-off between absolute reliability and general capability. By demonstrating these limitations in concrete domains like program verification and planning, the paper provides a cautionary framework for researchers and policymakers, indicating that future AGI deployments must navigate a fundamental compromise between safety, trustworthiness, and computational efficiency.

## Key Findings

*   **Fundamental Incompatibility:** Under strict mathematical definitions, there is a proven incompatibility between a system being "safe and trusted" and being an "AGI".
*   **Performance Gaps:** For a safe and trusted system, there exist specific task instances that are easily solvable by humans but impossible for the system to solve.
*   **Concrete Domains:** These limitations are demonstrated in practical computational domains, including **program verification**, **planning**, and **graph reachability**.
*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The findings are mathematically grounded in classical theoretical computer science, drawing on **Gödel's incompleteness theorems** and **Turing's undecidability of the halting problem**.

## Methodology

The authors adopted a highly formal approach to AI safety research:

*   **Formal Definitions:** AI concepts were defined mathematically:
    *   **Safety:** Defined as never making false claims.
    *   **Trust:** Defined as the operator's assumption of safety.
    *   **AGI:** Defined as always matching or exceeding human capability.
*   **Proof Techniques:** The study utilizes proof techniques analogous to mathematical logic and computability theory to demonstrate inherent system limitations.
*   **Application:** Theoretical results are applied to illustrate failure modes in technical domains such as graph reachability and program verification.
