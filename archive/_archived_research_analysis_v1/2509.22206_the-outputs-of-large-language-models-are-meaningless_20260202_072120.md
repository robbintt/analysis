## 📋 Executive Summary

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a widespread tendency to anthropomorphize their outputs, attributing human-like understanding, intentionality, and semantic meaning to algorithmic responses. This paper addresses the fundamental philosophical and technical problem of whether LLM outputs possess genuine semantic content or are merely sophisticated statistical manipulations of symbols. Distinguishing between functional utility and actual meaning is critical for the field, as conflating the two risks overstating model capabilities, misunderstanding the nature of "truth" in AI systems, and misguiding future research toward achieving understanding through mere scaling of syntactic processing power.

The authors introduce a rigorous philosophical framework that treats standard Transformer architectures as "syntactic engines" or "black boxes," arguing that their functional architecture mechanistically precludes semantic content. The key technical innovation is a two-pronged deductive argument establishing that meaning requires specific forms of intentionality (the "aboutness" of mental states), which LLMs cannot plausibly possess. To defend this premise, the paper systematically dismantles prevailing semantic theories: it refutes Semantic Internalism (the idea that intrinsic vector relationships constitute meaning) and Semantic Externalism (the idea that meaning derives from deference to training data or user communities). By isolating "machine intention" as the necessary missing ingredient, the authors demonstrate that neither the intrinsic math of the models nor their connection to the external world suffices to generate meaning.

As the study relies on conceptual analysis rather than empirical testing, there are no standard quantitative metrics or loss curves to report. Instead, the results consist of qualitative logical proofs and thought experiments that successfully demonstrate LLMs lack "aboutness." The authors provide theoretical refutations showing that "community deference" cannot substitute for an agent's intentionality (defeating Externalism), and that conceptual roles within a neural network do not equate to understanding (defeating Internalism). Consequently, the paper concludes that while LLMs are capable of generating outputs that carry the *appearance* of meaning and can pragmatically serve as sources of true beliefs, they possess no semantic truth value or understanding in themselves.

This work significantly influences the theoretical foundation of AI research by establishing a clear demarcation between semantics and utility. It challenges the field to recognize that high-performing models are not moving closer to human understanding through architectural scaling alone, as they lack the cognitive prerequisites for meaning. By clarifying that LLMs are functional tools for generating the *appearance* of conversation rather than entities with semantic states, the paper provides a robust philosophical guard against over-attributing consciousness or understanding to current AI systems. This distinction is vital for developers and users to accurately assess the limitations of LLMs and to approach their deployment with appropriate epistemic humility.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Fundamental Meaninglessness:** LLM outputs are fundamentally meaningless based on the absence of specific necessary cognitive conditions.
*   **Necessity of Intentionality:** Meaning is contingent on intentionality (specific kinds of intentions), which LLMs cannot plausibly possess.
*   **Refutation of Semantic Externalism:** The paper refutes semantic externalism, arguing that 'deference' is insufficient to substitute for required intentions.
*   **Refutation of Semantic Internalism:** The paper refutes semantic internalism, rejecting the idea that meanings can be established purely through intrinsic conceptual roles.
*   **Utility Without Semantics:** Despite lacking meaning, LLMs have utility and function pragmatically to generate the appearance of meaning and acquire true beliefs.

## 🧪 Results

The paper does not present standard machine learning metrics. Instead, it offers qualitative logical proofs and thought experiments. Key results include:

*   **Theoretical Demonstration:** Proof that LLMs lack 'aboutness' (intentionality).
*   **Refutation of Externalism:** Arguments against meaning derived solely from training data or users.
*   **Refutation of Internalism:** Arguments against vector relationships constituting intrinsic meaning.
*   **Conclusion:** LLMs are functional tools simulating conversation without understanding or semantic truth value.
