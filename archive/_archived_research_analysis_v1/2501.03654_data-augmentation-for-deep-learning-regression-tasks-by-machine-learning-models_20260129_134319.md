## Executive Summary

Deep learning (DL) has historically underperformed in tabular regression tasks compared to traditional machine learning, often due to the scarcity of training data and the lack of effective regularization techniques. Unlike computer vision, where geometric transformations effectively augment data, tabular data augmentation is challenging; naive methods—such as simple duplication or random noise injection—often distort the underlying feature correlations and degrade model performance.

This paper addresses this critical bottleneck by investigating how to generate synthetic data that maintains the integrity of statistical relationships. The authors propose a **"Teacher-Student" framework** utilizing a tree-based AutoML model (TPOT) as the Teacher to guide the training of the AutoDL Student. By rigorously evaluating across 30 datasets and three major AutoDL frameworks, the proposed method outperformed standard techniques like C-mixup, ADA, and naive noise injection.

The research demonstrates that sophisticated augmentation strategies can close the performance gap with traditional methods. With an average improvement of over 10% in RMSE and marked success in small datasets (12.7% boost), this work paves the way for broader adoption of deep learning in real-world regression scenarios where data acquisition is expensive.

## Technical Details

### Framework Architecture: Teacher-Student
The paper proposes a specific implementation for tabular data augmentation:
*   **Teacher Model:** An AutoML model (**TPOT**) trained on original data.
*   **Student Model:** An AutoDL model (AutoKeras, H2O, or AutoGluon).
*   **Process:**
    1.  The Teacher learns statistical distributions from the original data.
    2.  Synthetic features are generated by adding Gaussian noise to original features.
    3.  Noise Formula: $N(\mu_c, \eta \cdot \sigma_c)$ where $\eta=5\%$.
    4.  The Teacher predicts labels for the synthetic data.
    5.  The Student is trained on the combination of original and synthetic data.

### Experimental Configuration
*   **Datasets:** 30 datasets utilized (20 for SOTA comparison, 10 large-scale for scaling analysis).
*   **Baselines:** Compared against Naive augmentation, C-mixup, and ADA.
*   **Robustness Testing:** Validated across noise levels of 1%, 5%, and 10%.
