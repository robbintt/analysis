## Executive Summary

This research addresses the computational bottleneck inherent in designing efficient neural network architectures, specifically targeting the demands of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). As model complexity increases, the manual balancing of network depth and width becomes computationally prohibitive. The paper highlights the urgent necessity for automated architecture exploration methods capable of discovering high-performing models without excessive resource consumption.

The key innovation is **"FractalNet,"** a framework that utilizes fractal geometry and structural recursion to achieve the balanced scaling of model depth and width. Technically, the system employs a template-driven pipeline composed of a generator, runner, and evaluation module. It constructs architectures using fractal templates featuring multi-column pathways, generating diversity through systematic permutations of layers.

The implementation leverages PyTorch, optimized with **Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)** and **gradient checkpointing** to maximize computational throughput. The framework demonstrated robust capability by successfully generating and processing over **1,200 distinct neural network variants**. Validation experiments were conducted on the CIFAR-10 image dataset over five epochs.

While specific quantitative accuracy metrics were not disclosed, the study validates fractal design as a resource-efficient strategy for automated architecture search. However, the study’s reliance on a small image dataset for validation suggests the approach is currently a preparatory step for LLM analysis, leaving the transferability of these specific fractal patterns to text-based LLMs as an open question.
