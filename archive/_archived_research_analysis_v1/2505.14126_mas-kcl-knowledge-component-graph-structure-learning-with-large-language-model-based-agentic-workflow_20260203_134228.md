## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of **Knowledge Component (KC) graph structure learning**, a critical task in educational data mining that involves mapping causal dependencies between concepts as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Accurately reconstructing these graphs is essential for identifying precise student learning paths and diagnosing the root causes of learner performance gaps. Without reliable dependency mapping, educators lack the data foundation necessary for targeted instructional interventions, thereby limiting the effectiveness of personalized education systems and the ability to model student knowledge accurately.

The authors introduce **MAS-KCL**, a novel method leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent system for the adaptive modification and optimization of KC graph structures. The core technical innovation is a **bidirectional feedback mechanism** involving specialized agents: Positive Feedback, Negative Feedback, and a Game agent. The Game agent functions as a strategic decision-maker, selecting edges to construct the graph based on a probabilistic policy, while the Feedback agents evaluate the pedagogical validity of the proposed structure. This interaction dynamically updates the edge generation probabilities, transforming the search for the optimal DAG into a game-theoretic optimization problem executed through a four-phase workflow.

The MAS-KCL algorithm was validated across nine datasets, comprising five synthetic and four real-world educational environments. Using F1-Score as the primary metric for structure recovery, experimental results demonstrated that **MAS-KCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines** in learning path recognition accuracy. Additionally, the implementation of the bidirectional feedback mechanism optimized edge generation probabilities, resulting in accelerated convergence times for the structure learning process compared to traditional approaches. The system successfully identified weak knowledge components, confirming its capability to handle complex graph structures with high fidelity.

This work significantly advances the field by demonstrating the efficacy of LLM-based agentic workflows in solving complex structural learning problems. By providing high-fidelity KC graphs, MAS-KCL equips educators with precise tools to diagnose student difficulties and design targeted learning plans. The ability to accurately model knowledge dependencies not only facilitates more effective instructional interventions but also sets a new standard for the integration of generative AI in educational technology.
