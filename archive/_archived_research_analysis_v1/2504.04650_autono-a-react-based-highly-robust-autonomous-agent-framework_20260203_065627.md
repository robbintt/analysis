## 📝 Executive Summary

Current autonomous agent frameworks frequently suffer from rigidity, relying on static workflows or fixed planning phases that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of real-world execution environments. This lack of adaptability results in significant robustness issues, particularly when agents encounter unexpected states. Furthermore, a critical challenge in agentic AI is the "termination problem," where agents become trapped in infinite loops or fail to recognize when a task should be abandoned, leading to resource wastage. Additionally, single-agent architectures often lack the efficiency and specialized capability required for complex, multi-faceted tasks that benefit from collaborative labor division.

The Autono framework introduces a ReAct-based (Reasoning + Acting) architecture that replaces static planning with dynamic action generation based on real-time analysis of prior execution trajectories. A core technical advancement is the "timely abandonment strategy," which employs a probabilistic penalty mechanism to dynamically assess risk. By analyzing execution history, the system adjusts the probability of task abandonment, allowing the agent to weigh the cost of continued action against the likelihood of success. The system also facilitates multi-agent collaboration through a shared memory mechanism and explicit labor division, enabling agents to transfer context and specialize. Structurally, Autono utilizes a modular design compatible with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling seamless integration of external tools and flexible expansion of the action space.

Empirical evaluations confirm that the dynamic action generation approach significantly enhances system robustness compared to traditional fixed LLM workflows. The implementation of the probabilistic penalty mechanism effectively resolves termination issues, successfully preventing infinite loops and balancing task persistence with the ability to recognize failure. In scenarios involving multi-agent collaboration, the shared memory and labor division features yielded measurable improvements in both task execution efficiency and output quality. By successfully maintaining stability in dynamic conditions, the system demonstrated superior performance in handling complex, adaptive tasks compared to static baselines.

Autono represents a significant advancement in the pursuit of reliable, production-ready autonomous agents by shifting the paradigm from rigid planning to adaptive, trajectory-based reasoning. The introduction of a probabilistic approach to task termination addresses a fundamental failure mode in current LLM-based agents, paving the way for more stable and predictable autonomous systems. By prioritizing modularity and MCP compatibility, the framework establishes a scalable blueprint for future agent ecosystems, influencing how developers approach tool integration and multi-agent orchestration in dynamic environments.
