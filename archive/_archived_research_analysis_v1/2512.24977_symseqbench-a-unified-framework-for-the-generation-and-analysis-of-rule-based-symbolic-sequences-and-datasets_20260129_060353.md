## 📝 Executive Summary

> **The Challenge:** Current research in cognitive psychology and AI suffers from a disconnect between biological cognitive processes and the evaluation metrics used for artificial systems. There is a lack of standardized, rigorous tools for generating and analyzing rule-based symbolic sequences, leading to reproducibility issues and limited cross-disciplinary validation.
>
> **The Solution:** The authors introduce **SymSeqBench**, a unified, modular Python framework grounded in Formal Language Theory (FLT). This ecosystem bridges the gap between biological cognitive sciences and AI research by coupling rigorous mathematical formalisms with practical software engineering.
>
> **How It Works:** The framework comprises two core components:
> 1.  **SymSeq:** Utilizes grammar-automata equivalence to generate and analyze symbolic sequences.
> 2.  **SeqBench:** Grounds these symbols into distributed embeddings to define functional meanings.
>
> **Validation & Impact:** The study validated the framework by benchmarking five deep learning architectures (including RNNs, Transformers, and SNNs) across seven grammar complexity classes. While Transformers and LSTMs achieved high accuracy on regular grammars, they struggled with generalization in context-free tasks. Conversely, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) showed comparable classification accuracy while maintaining biological plausibility. SymSeqBench establishes a shared computational language, enabling the evaluation of AI on genuinely cognitively relevant tasks.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The authors addressed the need for superior evaluation tools by developing a two-component software ecosystem deeply rooted in Formal Language Theory:

1.  **SymSeq:** Functions as a rigorous generator and analyzer of rule-based, structured symbolic sequences.
2.  **SeqBench:** Utilizes the sequences produced by SymSeq to create a comprehensive benchmark suite. This suite is specifically designed to test the performance of artificial learning systems on tasks relevant to natural cognition.

The approach prioritizes a **domain-agnostic design**, ensuring that the tools remain applicable across various knowledge domains without modification.

## 📊 Reported Results & Validation

While the initial text analysis noted the absence of results in early sections, the final executive summary provides comprehensive validation data:

*   **Architectures Benchmarked:** Five distinct deep learning architectures were tested, including RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).
*   **Complexity Classes:** Evaluated across seven grammar complexity classes ranging from regular to context-sensitive languages.
*   **Performance Observations:**
    *   **Regular Grammars:** Transformers and LSTMs achieved high training accuracy (**>95%**).
    *   **Context-Free Tasks:** Severe performance degradation was observed (e.g., on $a^n b^n$ tasks).
    *   **Generalization Failure:** When required to generalize to sequence lengths exceeding the training distribution, model accuracy frequently dropped to chance levels.
    *   **SNN Efficiency:** Spiking Neural Networks achieved classification accuracy comparable to standard ANNs while maintaining biological plausibility.
