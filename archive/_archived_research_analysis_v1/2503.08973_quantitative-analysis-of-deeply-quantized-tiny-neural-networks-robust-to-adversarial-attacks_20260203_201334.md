## Executive Summary

This research addresses the deployment constraints of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on Microcontroller Units (MCUs), specifically the conflict between aggressive model quantization and adversarial robustness. In TinyML applications, models must operate within strict kilobyte-scale memory limits and power budgets below 4W, necessitating deep quantization which typically increases susceptibility to adversarial perturbations. This paper investigates methods to secure these deeply quantized models against both white-box and black-box attacks without violating the rigid hardware constraints of edge devices.

The core innovation is a co-optimization strategy implemented within the QKeras framework that integrates Stochastic Ternary Quantization (STQ) with per-layer Jacobian Regularization (JR). The method employs STQ to reduce precision by treating quantization error as stochastic noise; quantization probability is inversely proportional to the error, allowing for incremental compression. This is combined with a per-layer JR technique to smooth the model's output landscape against minor input perturbations. The architecture is optimized through a joint loss function incorporating adversarial training, specifically targeting MCU environments with limited power and memory resources.

In evaluations using the CIFAR-10 and Google Speech Commands (GSC) datasets, the proposed compact DNN demonstrated superior quantitative performance compared to MLCommons/TinyML benchmarks "Quanos" and "DS-CNN." On the GSC dataset, the model maintained a memory footprint of **320 KB** and achieved a robust accuracy of **41.2%** against PGD-20 attacks, substantially outperforming the DS-CNN benchmark which plummeted to **5.6%**. Similarly, on CIFAR-10, the proposed method achieved a robust accuracy of **41.5%** compared to the baseline's **31.2%**, while preserving clean accuracy above **80%**. The model consistently outperformed benchmarks against a rigorous suite of white-box attacks (FGSM, PGD, C&W) and black-box attacks (Square, Boundary, ZOO), demonstrating that deep quantization does not inherently compromise defense capabilities.

This work advances the state of the art in Edge AI by providing a validated solution to the accuracy-robustness-resource trade-off for pervasive devices. By establishing that high security is compatible with extreme resource efficiency, the authors offer new quantitative benchmarks for TinyML robustness. The research serves as a foundation for future hardware-software co-design, demonstrating that secure, deeply quantized models are viable for next-generation microcontroller-based applications.
