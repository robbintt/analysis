## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental question of the origin of computational power in Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, it challenges the prevailing assumption that the ability to perform complex algorithmic reasoning and universal computation arises from the training process, learned weights, or massive datasets. This distinction is critical because accurately attributing the source of computational expressiveness changes how researchers understand model scalability, the theoretical limits of AI reasoning, and the necessity of specific training objectives for achieving intelligence.

The key innovation is the establishment of a theoretical equivalence between extended autoregressive decoding and Lag systems (specifically $L(U_{15,2})$), proving that the chaining of autoregressive outputs is mathematically sufficient for universal computation. Technically, the authors utilize an extended decoding protocol that incorporates a sliding context window, multi-token output per step, and a halt symbol to manage unbounded memory. To demonstrate this, they implement injective mappings between Lag system rules and model tokens using two distinct strategies: one using system prompts in trained models, and another employing a trained injective codebook (separate encoder/decoder networks) interfaced with a frozen, randomly initialized language model. This architecture proves that the potential for universal computation is intrinsic to the model structure rather than learned data.

Empirical experiments demonstrated that standard trained models, such as Llama-2, achieved 100% rule coverage, successfully executing all 1,857 production rules of the universal Lag system without external memory. Furthermore, the study confirmed that untrained, randomly initialized models possess this same computational universality across a wide range of architectural sizes, including variations of GPT-2 and Llama-2 architectures with 2 to 512 layers and encoder/decoder widths ranging from 32 to 1024. All verification experiments utilized deterministic greedy sampling (temperature T=0) and measured codebook training convergence via log-norm Time-to-Universality, validating that non-learned weights are sufficient to simulate any algorithm.

This work significantly reframes the scientific perspective on LLM capabilities by drawing a sharp line between computational *expressiveness*—which is inherent to the model architecture—and *programmability*—which is acquired through training. By demonstrating that training merely facilitates the discovery of prompts to access pre-existing capabilities, the paper shifts the challenge of eliciting complex reasoning from a question of fundamental ability to one of interface design. This suggests that the barrier to general artificial intelligence may not be creating new computational architectures, but rather developing better methods to "program" the intrinsic universality already present in existing decoding processes.

## Key Findings

*   **Autoregressive Output Enables Universal Computation:** Chaining a language model's autoregressive output is theoretically sufficient to perform universal computation.
*   **Intrinsic Capability of Untrained Models:** Randomly initialized, untrained language models possess the capacity for universal computation.
*   **Training Enhances Programmability, Not Expressiveness:** Training does not create computational expressiveness; instead, it improves 'programmability', defined as the ease of finding a suitable prompt to access the model's intrinsic capabilities.

---

## Methodology

The authors employ a theoretical proof to establish that the chaining of autoregressive outputs allows language models to simulate any algorithm. Additionally, they demonstrate this computational capacity using randomly initialized language models to prove that the capability stems from the architecture and decoding process rather than learned weights or training data.

## Technical Details

The paper establishes a theoretical equivalence between extended autoregressive decoding and Lag systems, specifically targeting the universal system $L(U_{15,2})$. The implementation is structured as follows:

### Theoretical Framework
*   **Extended Autoregressive Decoding:** Defined as utilizing a sliding context window, multi-token output per step, and a halt symbol to enable unbounded memory.
*   **Universality Proof:** The Language Model must simulate Lag system rules via injective mappings using an Encoder ($E$) and Decoder ($D$).

### Implementation Strategies
1.  **Strategy A:** Uses a non-empty system prompt discovered via trial-and-error in trained models.
2.  **Strategy B:** Uses a trained injective codebook (separate encoder and decoder networks) with a frozen, randomly initialized Language Model.

### Operational Protocol
*   **Context Management:** Sliding context window with the system prompt prepended.
*   **Determinism:** Relies on fixed random seeds and greedy sampling at a temperature of zero.

*   **Untrained Model Validation:** Untrained, randomly initialized models were proven computationally universal via the codebook strategy across various architecture sizes (2 to 512) and encoder/decoder widths (32 to 1024).
*   **Metrics:** Key metrics include 'log-norm Time-to-Universality' for measuring codebook training convergence.
*   **Conditions:** All verification experiments utilized a temperature of T=0.

## Contributions

*   **Theoretical Clarification of LM Capabilities:** The paper provides a formal theoretical basis for the computational power of language models, equating their decoding process with universal computation.
*   **Reframing the Prompting Challenge:** It shifts the scientific perspective on eliciting computational behavior from a question of fundamental capability to a question of 'programmability' (prompt engineering).
*   **Distinction Between Architecture and Training:** The work clearly delineates the roles of model architecture (which provides computational expressiveness) and training (which provides a usable natural language interface).
