## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Traditional Learned Image Compression (LIC) models rely on fixed-precision quantization, applying uniform bit-widths across all network layers. This "one-size-fits-all" strategy is fundamentally sub-optimal; it fails to recognize that specific layers significantly impact reconstruction quality when quantized, while others are robust. Consequently, uniform quantization leads to inefficient resource utilization, forcing a trade-off where model size is reduced only at the cost of disproportionate losses in coding performance.

**Innovation**
The paper introduces the **Flexible Mixed Precision Quantization (FMPQ)** framework, which optimizes performance by assigning heterogeneous bit-widths to different layers. The core innovation is a bit-assignment criterion defined by the "fractional change in rate-distortion loss," prioritizing higher bit-widths for layers where quantization causes the highest RD degradation. To manage combinatorial complexity, the authors developed an **adaptive search algorithm** that efficiently identifies optimal bit-width distributions without exhaustive brute-force computation.

**Results**
Empirical validation demonstrates that FMPQ consistently outperforms traditional baselines. Under model size constraints targeting ~25% of the original floating-point size, the method achieves BD-Rate savings of roughly **3.1% to 4.5%** on the Kodak dataset. Furthermore, the adaptive search algorithm reduces search time from several hours (or days) to **less than an hour**, representing a speedup factor of over **100x**.

**Impact**
This research establishes that layer-aware, mixed-precision strategies are strictly superior to uniform quantization. By shifting the focus to intelligent, sensitivity-based resource allocation, the FMPQ framework facilitates the deployment of high-efficiency LIC on resource-constrained edge devices. The release of the source code ensures reproducibility and broader community adoption.

## Methodology

The research introduces the **Flexible Mixed Precision Quantization (FMPQ)** framework, designed to overcome the limitations of uniform quantization.

*   **Layer-wise Bit Assignment:** The framework employs a specific bit-assignment strategy based on the *fractional change in rate-distortion loss*. This metric prioritizes assigning bits to layers where they yield the highest efficiency.
*   **Adaptive Search:** To handle the complexity of mixed precision, the authors utilize an adaptive search algorithm. This rapidly determines the optimal distribution of bit-widths that satisfies specific model size constraints, avoiding the computational expense of exhaustive search.
