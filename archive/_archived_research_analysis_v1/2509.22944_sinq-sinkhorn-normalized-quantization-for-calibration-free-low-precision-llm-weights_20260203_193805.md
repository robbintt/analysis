## Executive Summary

Post-training quantization (PTQ) of Large Language Models (LLMs) to low bit-widths ($\le$ 4 bits) is critical for efficient inference but frequently results in significant perplexity degradation caused by weight outliers and asymmetric distributions. Existing mitigation strategies typically rely on calibration datasets to optimize quantization parameters, introducing data dependency, privacy risks, and computational overhead. This paper addresses the challenge of maintaining model accuracy at low precisions without relying on activation data or calibration steps, a necessary requirement for deploying models in resource-constrained or data-sensitive environments.

The authors introduce **SINQ (Sinkhorn-Normalized Quantization)**, a calibration-free PTQ augmentation that utilizes a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm to normalize weight matrices prior to quantization. Technically, the method introduces an additional second-axis scale factor that balances per-row and per-column variances, effectively reshaping the weight distribution to mitigate the impact of outliers. By approximating the characteristics of activation-aware quantization through mathematical analysis of the weight matrix structure alone, SINQ eliminates the dependency on forward passes or calibration data, functioning as a lightweight, additive layer to existing quantization pipelines.

SINQ demonstrates robust performance in mitigating accuracy loss, achieving a greater than 50% reduction in the perplexity gap on WikiText2 and C4 datasets compared to standard uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines. The method maintains efficacy at aggressive low bit-widths of 4 bits and below while incurring zero to negligible computational overhead during the optimization process. Additionally, the framework was validated as highly compatible, capable of being stacked with existing non-uniform quantization techniques to further enhance performance without conflict.

The significance of this research lies in decoupling high-performance low-precision inference from the bottleneck of calibration data, offering a practical "inference-free" optimization path. Because SINQ is architecture-agnostic and involves no interactions between layers, it can be trivially applied to any linear layer in novel or existing model architectures. By providing a drop-in solution that substantially closes the performance gap between full-precision and quantized models without added complexity, SINQ establishes a more accessible and efficient standard for LLM deployment.

## Technical Details

**Core Mechanism**
SINQ utilizes **Sinkhorn normalization** (specifically the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm) to transform weight distributions of LLMs prior to quantization. This process shapes the distribution for uniform quantization to specifically mitigate outliers and distributional asymmetry.

**Design Philosophy**
*   **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ):** It is strictly a PTQ technique that is calibration-free.
*   **Data Independence:** It derives parameters mathematically without needing a calibration dataset.
*   **Modularity:** SINQ is designed as an additive layer that can be applied independently or stacked with other quantization pipelines.
