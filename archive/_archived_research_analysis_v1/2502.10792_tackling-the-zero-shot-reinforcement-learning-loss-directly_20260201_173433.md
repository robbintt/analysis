## Executive Summary

A fundamental challenge in zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) is the disconnect between the training objective and the desired outcome: agents must perform well on average over unknown downstream tasks, yet they cannot be trained directly on this objective because the task distribution is inaccessible. Consequently, existing methods often resort to optimizing proxy criteria or relying on arbitrary architectural choices. This creates a training objective mismatch where optimizing the proxy does not guarantee optimal performance on future tasks, leaving the theoretical underpinnings of successful zero-shot methods like VISR unclear and limiting the robustness of learned behaviors.

This paper introduces a theoretical framework enabling the direct optimization of the zero-shot RL loss without prior knowledge of the downstream task distribution. The innovation lies in the use of "non-informative priors"—specifically white noise, temporally smooth, and scattered sparse rewards—rather than complex or dense reward assumptions. Technically, the author derives a direct loss function and proves that the optimal policy for this loss is deterministic and derived from the mean posterior reward. A key technical breakthrough is revealing that the empirical formulation of the VISR method is mathematically recovered when a white noise prior is adopted, thereby validating VISR's use of Von Mises–Fisher distributions as a theoretically sound design choice rather than a heuristic.

As the study is primarily theoretical, it does not present empirical benchmarks or quantitative performance metrics. Instead, the results consist of rigorous mathematical proofs establishing that learning optimal zero-shot features is algorithmically feasible across wide mixtures of non-informative priors. The analysis demonstrates that while white noise priors successfully recover and justify the VISR objective, relying exclusively on Gaussian dense reward priors is theoretically detrimental, leading to "narrow optimal features" that compromise the robustness of the learned policy.

This work significantly advances the field by resolving the training objective mismatch in zero-shot RL, shifting the paradigm from proxy-based training to direct loss optimization. By demystifying the VISR method and providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for its architecture, the paper opens the door to more efficient optimization strategies for zero-shot agents. Furthermore, the categorization of effective priors offers concrete guidance for future research, ensuring that prior selection in reinforcement learning is grounded in the goal of maximizing downstream performance rather than convenient mathematical assumptions.

## Key Findings

*   **Direct Optimizability:** The zero-shot reinforcement learning loss can be optimized directly without knowing the distribution of downstream tasks. This is achievable by utilizing non-informative priors, such as white noise rewards, temporally smooth rewards, scattered sparse rewards, or mixtures thereof.
*   **Theoretical Justification for VISR:** The study provides theoretical backing for the VISR [HDB+19] method. By adopting a white noise prior, the specific objective used in VISR is theoretically recovered, proving that its design choices—such as using Von Mises–Fisher distributions—indeed maximize downstream performance.
*   **Algorithmic Learnability:** It is algorithmically feasible to learn optimal zero-shot features across a wide mixture of priors. This shifts the approach from relying on proxy criteria to directly optimizing the desired outcome.
*   **Limitations of Dense Priors:** Relying exclusively on Gaussian dense reward priors within the zero-shot RL objective leads to a tendency to produce "narrow optimal features." This limitation can restrict the robustness of the learned behavior.

## Methodology

The author employs a rigorous theoretical approach to prove the direct optimizability of the zero-shot RL loss. The methodology diverges from previous practices that relied on proxy criteria or explicitly set complex priors (such as reward functions given by random neural networks).

Instead, this method analyzes and utilizes a range of **"non-informative" priors**. By mathematically deriving the optimization objective from these priors—specifically white noise—the study connects this new theoretical framework to the empirical formulation found in existing VISR methods. This approach validates previous empirical successes through direct mathematical derivation rather than experimental trial and error.

## Technical Details

The paper proposes a method to optimize zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) performance by introducing non-informative priors over downstream tasks.

### Core Concepts
*   **Direct Loss Function:** The authors define a direct loss function to minimize expected downstream performance loss, differing from proxy criteria methods like VISR.
*   **Occupation Measures & Gaussian Forms:** The analysis utilizes occupation measures and general Gaussian forms to handle dense priors within the mathematical framework.

### Reward Priors
The approach utilizes mixtures of specific reward priors to train agents:
*   **White Noise Prior:** Rewards are independent. This specific prior recovers VISR's objective.
*   **Dirichlet Prior:** Used to enforce spatial smoothness in rewards.
*   **Sparse Priors:** Utilizes goal-reaching tasks to broaden learning.

### Theoretical Propositions
*   **Policy Optimality (Proposition 2):** It is established that the optimal policy $\pi_z$ is optimal for the mean posterior reward $r_z$. This results in a deterministic behavior without induced stochasticity, providing a clear target for optimization algorithms.
