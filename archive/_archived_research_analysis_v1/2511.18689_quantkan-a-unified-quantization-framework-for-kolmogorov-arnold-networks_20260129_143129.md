## Executive Summary

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by utilizing learnable spline functions on network edges. However, this architectural sophistication introduces significant computational overhead and memory footprint, hindering deployment on resource-constrained hardware. This paper addresses the critical lack of efficient compression techniques for spline-based networks, specifically tackling the challenge that standard quantization methods designed for linear weights fail to account for the unique, non-linear structure and distinct statistical properties of KAN components.

The authors introduce **QuantKAN**, the first unified framework specifically designed to bridge spline learning with modern quantization techniques. The core technical innovation is a "branch-aware" quantization strategy that recognizes the fundamental difference between the **Base Branch** (linear weights + SiLU activation) and the **Spline Branch** (spline coefficients + B-spline basis expansion). Because spline coefficients exhibit wide dynamic ranges compared to the narrower distributions of base weights, the framework applies separate, branch-specific quantizers to each. QuantKAN integrates state-of-the-art algorithms—including LSQ, GPTQ, and AWQ—to support both Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), utilizing Straight-Through Estimators (STE), and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), which employs composite reconstruction loss minimization.

Extensive benchmarking across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 on four distinct KAN architectures (EfficientKAN, FastKAN, PyKAN, and KAGN) demonstrates that deeper KAN variants are robust enough for low-bit quantization. The data reveals significant method-architecture interactions: for QAT in shallow models, LSQ, LSQ+, and PACT are the most effective, while DoReFa is necessary to maintain stability in deeper models. Conversely, in PTQ scenarios, GPTQ and Uniform quantization methods achieved the best overall performance. Ablation studies underscore the necessity of the branch-aware approach, confirming that using a shared quantizer across branches leads to training divergence or substantial accuracy drops due to violated distribution homogeneity assumptions.

This research establishes the first systematic benchmarks for low-bit spline networks, providing a foundational reference for the efficient deployment of KANs. By validating that complex spline-based architectures can be compressed without significant performance degradation, QuantKAN enables the practical application of KANs in edge computing environments where power and memory are strictly limited.

## Key Findings

*   **KAN Compatibility**: KANs, particularly deeper variants like KAGN, are generally compatible with low-bit quantization, enabling a reduction in memory footprint without catastrophic performance loss.
*   **Method-Architecture Interaction**: The effectiveness of quantization algorithms depends on the model depth and training strategy:
    *   **QAT**: LSQ, LSQ+, and PACT are effective for shallow models; DoReFa provides necessary stability for deeper models.
    *   **PTQ**: GPTQ and Uniform quantization perform best overall.
*   **Branch Sensitivity**: Research confirms that branch-aware quantization is critical. Applying a single quantizer across both base and spline branches causes divergence or significant accuracy loss due to differing statistical distributions.
*   **Benchmark Establishment**: This work presents the first systematic benchmarks for low-bit spline networks across standard vision datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100).

## Technical Details

QuantKAN introduces a **branch-aware quantization framework** designed to handle the unique structure of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. KANs feature learnable non-linearities on edges split into two distinct components:

### 1. Architecture Components
*   **Base Branch**:
    *   *Composition*: Linear weights + SiLU activation.
    *   *Characteristics*: Features narrow weight distributions.
*   **Spline Branch**:
    *   *Composition*: Spline coefficients + B-spline basis expansion.
    *   *Characteristics*: Features wide dynamic ranges in coefficients.

### 2. Quantization Strategy
To handle the distinct statistical properties, QuantKAN employs **separate quantizers** for:
*   Base weights
*   Spline weights
*   Activations

### 3. Implementation Modes
*   **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**:
    *   Utilizes Straight-Through Estimator (STE).
    *   Algorithms: LSQ, LSQ+, PACT, DoReFa.
*   **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)**:
    *   Minimizes a composite reconstruction loss.
    *   Algorithms: AdaRound, AWQ, GPTQ.

## Methodology

The authors developed **QuantKAN** as a unified framework for KAN quantization. The methodology extends modern quantization algorithms—such as LSQ, GPTQ, and AWQ—to spline-based layers using the branch-specific quantizers described above. The framework supports both QAT and PTQ modes and was rigorously validated on four distinct KAN architectures to ensure generalizability.

## Results

Experimental benchmarks were conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 across the following models: EfficientKAN, FastKAN, PyKAN, and KAGN.

*   **Deep Models**: Deeper KAN variants (specifically KAGN) demonstrated strong compatibility with low-bit quantization.
*   **QAT Performance**:
    *   **Shallow Architectures**: LSQ, LSQ+, and PACT were most effective.
    *   **Deep Architectures**: DoReFa provided the required stability.
*   **PTQ Performance**: GPTQ and Uniform quantization achieved the best overall results across the test sets.
*   **Ablation Studies**: Validated that branch-aware quantization is necessary. Sharing a single quantizer across branches led to failure due to the invalid assumption of homogeneous distributions.
