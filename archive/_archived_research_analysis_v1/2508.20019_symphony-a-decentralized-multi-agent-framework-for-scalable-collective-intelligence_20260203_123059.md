## Executive Summary

Current multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems predominantly rely on centralized architectures, which introduce critical bottlenecks regarding scalability, high infrastructure costs, and single points of failure. This dependence on expensive, industrial-grade compute resources limits the accessibility and deployment of advanced collective intelligence solutions. *Symphony* addresses the challenge of achieving scalable, high-performance reasoning coordination without requiring centralized infrastructure, aiming to democratize access to multi-agent AI capabilities.

Symphony introduces a decentralized multi-agent framework built on a Decentralized Ledger for tracking agent capabilities and a Beacon-selection protocol that queries available nodes to facilitate dynamic task allocation. The system is architected to offload workloads to consumer-grade hardware—such as NVIDIA RTX 4090s or Apple M-series chips—utilizing quantized LLMs like Mistral-7B.

Operationally, the framework follows a pipeline of **Decomposition, Selection, Execution, and Voting**. Tasks are intelligently assigned using a Capability Match Score, calculated via cosine similarity between an agent's capability vector and the task's requirements, while final outputs are synthesized through Weighted Result Voting that aggregates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning based on an Aggregated Confidence Score.

The research demonstrates that Symphony achieves substantial accuracy gains over a centralized cluster of equivalent models. By validating a fault-tolerant, privacy-preserving architecture, Symphony opens new pathways for deploying resilient multi-agent systems in environments where data sovereignty or hardware availability is a constraint.

## Key Findings

The analysis of Symphony reveals several significant advantages over traditional centralized systems:

*   **Superior Accuracy:** Symphony outperforms centralized agent baselines on reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains.
*   **Consumer-Grade Scalability:** It successfully enables the coordination of lightweight LLMs on consumer-grade GPUs, removing the barrier to expensive industrial hardware.
*   **Robustness:** The system demonstrates high robustness across models of varying capacities and hardware environments.
*   **System Efficiency:** Results in a privacy-saving, fault-tolerant system with low operational overhead.

## Methodology

The researchers developed Symphony using a three-pronged methodological approach to handle decentralized coordination:

1.  **Decentralized Ledger:** Utilized to track agent capabilities and maintain system state without a central authority.
2.  **Beacon-selection Protocol:** A dynamic task allocation mechanism that queries the network to find the most suitable agents for specific tasks.
3.  **Weighted Result Voting:** An aggregation method that combines results based on the quality of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning provided by the agents.

## Technical Details

### System Architecture
Symphony utilizes a decentralized framework designed to offload workloads to consumer-grade hardware using quantized models (e.g., Mistral-7B).

*   **Components:**
    *   **Worker Nodes:** Execute the inference tasks.
    *   **Gateways:** Manage entry points and routing.
    *   **Planning Agents:** Orchestrate the decomposition and aggregation of tasks.
*   **Operational Pipeline:**
    1.  **Decomposition**
    2.  **Selection**
    3.  **Execution**
    4.  **Voting**

### Core Algorithms
*   **Capability Match Score ($s_j(t_{i,k})$):**
    *   Used by the Beacon-Selection Protocol.
    *   Calculated using **cosine similarity** between the agent's capability vector and the task's requirement vectors.
    *   Score Range: 0 to 1.
*   **Aggregated Confidence Score:**
    *   Used in Weighted Result Voting.
    *   Calculated as the arithmetic mean of match scores to determine the weight of an agent's vote.
