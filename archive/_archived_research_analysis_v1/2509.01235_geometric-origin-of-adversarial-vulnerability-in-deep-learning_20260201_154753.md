## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental geometric origins of adversarial vulnerability in deep neural networks, investigating why minor input perturbations lead to catastrophic classification failures. A persistent challenge in the field is the trade-off between maintaining high standard accuracy and ensuring robustness against attacks. By analyzing the geometry of data within the feature space, the authors aim to understand and mitigate these vulnerabilities without sacrificing the model's generalization performance or learning capacity.

The key innovation is a **Geometry-Aware Layer-wise (GAL)** training framework that diverges from standard global backpropagation. Instead, the method utilizes sequential feedforward blocks trained independently via layer-wise local training. This approach employs local random classifiers and specific geometric constraints to enforce intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, effectively sculpting the internal data manifold to be smoother. Theoretically, the framework is grounded in an energy model utilizing Hebbian coupling, which minimizes representation interference and bridges artificial optimization with biological learning mechanisms.

In a proof-of-concept evaluation conducted on MNIST and modified, greyscaled CIFAR-10 (28x28) datasets, the GAL method achieved classification accuracy comparable to standard backpropagation, with performance improving alongside network depth. The framework demonstrated superior adversarial robustness compared to baseline MLPs against Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attacks, Gaussian noise, and notably, black-box attacks. Furthermore, spectral analysis of feature covariance matrices revealed a power-law decay with exponents ($\gamma_1$ ranging 0.38–1.32; $\gamma_2$ ranging 2.11–3.57). These metrics are significant as they indicate the network captures abstract semantic information consistent with "smooth coding" principles observed in biological neural systems, rather than merely memorizing statistical noise.

This work advances the theoretical understanding of the "physics of learning" by directly linking Hebbian coupling in energy models to network performance and adversarial robustness. By identifying the geometric source of vulnerability and providing a biologically plausible mitigation strategy through local learning dynamics, the research aligns artificial and biological intelligence paradigms.
