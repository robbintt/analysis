## 📋 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical fragmentation within the field of Multi-Agent Cooperative Decision-Making (MACDM), a capability essential for high-stakes dynamic environments such as autonomous driving, disaster rescue, drone navigation, and simulated military confrontations. As the technical landscape expands, the proliferation of disparate algorithms and simulation platforms has created a barrier to understanding the state of the art.

The authors tackle this by synthesizing the field to clarify how intelligent agents can coordinate effectively, contrasting traditional heuristic methods with modern data-driven approaches to resolve the complexities of current research. The key innovation is a systematic three-phase methodology that establishes a unified technical framework:

1.  **Environment Analysis:** The authors analyze simulation environments using a rigorous three-dimensional metric: task formats, reward allocation mechanisms, and underlying technologies.
2.  **Taxonomy:** They introduce a comprehensive classification of decision-making architectures into five distinct classes: rule-based (fuzzy logic), game theory-based, evolutionary algorithms, Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Deep MARL), and LLM reasoning-based.
3.  **Deep-Dive Review:** Finally, they conduct a technical review of the two most promising paradigms—Deep MARL and LLM-based reasoning—examining specific methodological structures, including algorithms such as QMIX and MAPPO, and identifying technical bottlenecks such as the credit assignment problem.

The survey demonstrates that modern techniques have achieved performance levels that surpass human capabilities in complex competitive scenarios. While traditional methods remain relevant for constrained tasks, the analysis clearly indicates that modern approaches offer superior scalability and adaptability. These findings are validated through experimental application across primary domains. Furthermore, the authors explicitly identify prominent research directions and potential challenges within Deep MARL and LLM reasoning, detailing the technical bottlenecks that remain to be solved. This research provides a strategic roadmap for the field, guiding the transition from classical control strategies to learning-based multi-agent systems.
