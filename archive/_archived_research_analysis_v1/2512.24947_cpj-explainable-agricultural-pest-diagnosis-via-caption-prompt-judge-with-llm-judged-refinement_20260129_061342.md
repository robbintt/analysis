## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Agricultural pest diagnosis faces critical challenges regarding model generalization and interpretability. Existing methods frequently suffer from performance degradation under domain shifts—where real-world environmental conditions differ from training data—and often operate as "black boxes" lacking transparent reasoning. Furthermore, these approaches typically require costly supervised fine-tuning to maintain accuracy across different crops or regions, limiting their scalability and practical deployment in resource-constrained farming environments.

**Innovation**
The researchers introduce **CPJ (Caption-Prompt-Judge)**, a training-free, few-shot framework designed to leverage the generative capabilities of foundation models without parameter updates. The architecture consists of three modular components:
1.  **Caption Generation:** Utilizes Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to create structured, multi-angle image descriptions.
2.  **LLM-Judged Refinement:** An "LLM-as-Judge" module that iteratively analyzes and enhances these captions.
3.  **Dual-Answer VQA:** Uses the refined text to drive a Visual Question Answering process for diagnosis.

By employing a cascaded approach using models like GPT-5-mini and GPT-5-Nano, the system utilizes zero-shot reasoning to ensure outputs are evidence-based and robust against domain variations.

**Results**
The CPJ framework demonstrated substantial performance gains over existing baselines. It achieved a **+22.7 percentage point improvement** in disease classification accuracy compared to methods lacking caption inputs. Additionally, the approach secured a **+19.5 point increase** in Question Answering scores on the CDDMBench dataset. These results highlight the efficacy of the training-free paradigm, outperforming configurations that rely solely on standard model combinations by significantly enhancing both diagnostic precision and the quality of generated reasoning.

**Impact**
This work advances the state of the art in Agri-Tech by successfully decoupling high-performance pest diagnosis from the need for expensive fine-tuning, thereby offering a cost-effective and scalable solution. The integration of structured, interpretable captions addresses the urgent need for explainable AI, providing farmers and agronomists with transparent, evidence-based decision support. By establishing new performance baselines on CDDMBench and publicly releasing code and data, the authors provide a robust foundation for future research into training-free, generalizable agricultural AI systems.
