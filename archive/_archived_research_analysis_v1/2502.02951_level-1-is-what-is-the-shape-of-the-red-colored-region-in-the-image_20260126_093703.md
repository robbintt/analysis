## Executive Summary

This research addresses a fundamental ambiguity in current Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks: the inability to systematically distinguish between low-level perceptual tasks and high-level cognitive reasoning. Existing VQA datasets often conflate simple feature extraction with complex logical deduction, creating a noisy environment where it is difficult to assess a machine's true understanding. While large-scale datasets exist, they frequently suffer from ambiguous phrasing and a lack of semantic structure, preventing the accurate measurement of a system's ability to perform granular, stepwise logic. This gap hinders the development of systems that can progress beyond superficial pattern matching to genuine visual understanding.

The core innovation is the introduction of the **VQA-Levels dataset**, which applies a rigorous 7-level Hierarchical Classification to categorize questions based on cognitive complexity, moving beyond unstructured or template-based approaches. Grounded in **Marr’s Theory** of vision and CBIR systems, the methodology defines a clear progression of difficulty:

*   **Level 1:** Low-level feature extraction (e.g., color, shape, texture).
*   **Level 2:** Object identification combined with low-level features.
*   **Levels 3–7:** Advancement to symbolic, semantic, and abstract reasoning.

To mitigate the ambiguity issues plaguing current datasets, the authors utilize a human-centric validation protocol where ground truth answers are restricted to unambiguous single words or short phrases, verified through independent annotation by students.

The study provides a comparative benchmark of the VQA landscape, quantifying the scale of existing datasets against the structural depth of the proposed VQA-Levels framework. Existing benchmarks such as COCO-QA, CLEVR, and TDIUC are analyzed to demonstrate that while they offer significant volume, they lack the systematic complexity grading of VQA-Levels. The authors establish that the proposed hierarchy successfully dissects visual reasoning into distinct cognitive stages, providing a granular metric for evaluation that is absent in larger, less structured collections.

The significance of this work lies in establishing a structured, human-centric benchmark that forces VQA systems to demonstrate competence across a spectrum of cognitive complexity rather than relying on dataset biases. By defining explicit levels of reasoning difficulty backed by theoretical underpinnings, the authors provide a roadmap for evaluating visual understanding capabilities. This approach challenges the field to prioritize architectural depth and semantic precision over sheer data scale, setting a precedent for future research focused on developing systems capable of genuine, hierarchical visual reasoning.

## Technical Details

The paper introduces the VQA-Levels dataset to address limitations in existing VQA datasets regarding ambiguity, human relevance, and hierarchical complexity.

### Dataset Design & Hierarchy
The dataset is organized by a **7-level Hierarchical Classification** based on cognitive complexity:

*   **Level 1:** Low-level feature extraction (color, shape, texture).
*   **Level 2:** Object identification combined with low-level features.
*   **Levels 3–7:** Progressive steps involving symbolic, semantic, and abstract reasoning, with Level 7 requiring whole-scene analysis.

### Validation & Methodology
*   **Human-Centric Design:** Utilizes natural questions rather than contrived or automated generation in the initial phase to ensure quality.
*   **Ground Truth Protocol:** Answers are restricted to unambiguous single words or short phrases.
*   **Verification:** Validated through a protocol where multiple students answer independently to ensure consistency.

### Theoretical Foundations
*   **Marr's Theory of Vision:** Serves as a basis for the theoretical framework.
*   **CBIR Systems:** Integrated into the approach for content-based image retrieval contexts.
