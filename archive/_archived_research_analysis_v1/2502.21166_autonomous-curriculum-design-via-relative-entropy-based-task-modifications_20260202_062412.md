## Executive Summary

Curriculum Learning (CL) enhances Reinforcement Learning (RL) by sequencing tasks from simple to complex, but designing these sequences typically requires significant human domain expertise or manually designed heuristics. This dependence on manual intervention creates a scalability bottleneck, limiting the autonomy of RL agents and preventing their deployment in environments where the task progression is unknown. The research addresses the fundamental challenge of creating a curriculum design framework that operates autonomously. The goal is to generate efficient learning sequences without prior task knowledge, thereby improving sample efficiency and asymptotic performance in complex environments without the need for continuous human supervision.

The paper introduces **READ-C** (Relative Entropy based Autonomous Design for Curriculum Learning), a novel framework that utilizes Relative Entropy (KL Divergence) to quantify the divergence between the learner's current policy and a historical reference policy. Unlike previous summaries that conflated this metric with epistemic uncertainty, READ-C specifically uses this divergence to identify states where the agent's behavior is changing most significantly, indicating regions of high learning potential. The algorithm employs a two time-scale optimization framework: a slower scale manages the curriculum by adaptively modifying the Markov Decision Process (MDP)—specifically resetting the start state to these high-divergence regions—while a faster scale handles policy parameter updates.

READ-C was rigorously evaluated against randomly generated curricula, direct learning, and established methods like Narvekar et al. across benchmarks including Half-Cheetah and navigation tasks. Quantitative results demonstrate that READ-C consistently outperformed these benchmarks; in the Half-Cheetah environment, READ-C achieved asymptotic rewards exceeding **6,000**, whereas direct learning methods often plateaued near **4,000**. Furthermore, the algorithm significantly improved sample efficiency, reducing the time to convergence by approximately **50%** compared to the best-performing baseline. By effectively using policy divergence to drive task modification, the authors enable fully unsupervised agent development, establishing a new standard for robustness and efficiency in curriculum learning research.
