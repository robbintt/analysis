## 📄 Executive Summary

Current benchmarks for evaluating mathematical problem-solving in AI are insufficient for real-world applications because they focus primarily on closed-ended questions with single, verifiable answers. Real-world challenges are inherently open-ended, requiring interdisciplinary reasoning, the translation of vague scenarios into mathematical formulations, and the integration of external tools like code execution and web search.

This paper addresses the significant gap between theoretical mathematical capabilities and practical demands by introducing a holistic three-part ecosystem:

1.  **ModelingBench:** A novel benchmark sourced from international contests (2000–2025) featuring a sandbox environment.
2.  **ModelingAgent:** A multi-agent framework mimicking a human team structure with specialized roles (Idea Proposer, Data Searcher, Model Implementor, Report Writer) coordinated via Shared Memory and a Critic Module.
3.  **ModelingJudge:** A new evaluation paradigm utilizing LLMs as domain-specialized judges to assess open-ended solutions.

ModelingAgent demonstrates substantial performance improvements, achieving a **71.4% win rate against standard GPT-4o** and a **63.2% win rate against Claude 3.5 Sonnet**. Crucially, its solutions are frequently indistinguishable from human experts. This research shifts the focus from static textbook problems to dynamic, real-world challenges, establishing a new standard for evaluating open-ended reasoning.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Benchmarking Gap:** Existing benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of real-world challenges, which require open-ended, interdisciplinary reasoning and tool integration.
*   **Superior Performance:** ModelingAgent substantially outperforms strong baselines in solving complex, open-ended tasks.
*   **Human-Level Quality:** Solutions generated by ModelingAgent are frequently indistinguishable from those produced by human experts.
*   **Effective Evaluation:** The proposed evaluation system, ModelingJudge, effectively leverages LLMs as domain-specialized judges to assess the validity and quality of open-ended solutions.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The research employs a comprehensive three-pronged framework:

1.  **Benchmark Construction**
    *   Development of **ModelingBench**, a dataset consisting of real-world-inspired problems.
    *   Focuses on the translation of vague scenarios into precise mathematical formulations.

2.  **Multi-Agent Framework**
    *   Utilization of **ModelingAgent** to coordinate various tools.
    *   Enforces structured workflows and performs iterative self-refinement.

3.  **Expert-in-the-Loop Evaluation**
    *   Deployment of **ModelingJudge**.
    *   Uses LLMs acting as domain-specialized judges to assess open-ended outputs rather than relying on exact-match metrics.
