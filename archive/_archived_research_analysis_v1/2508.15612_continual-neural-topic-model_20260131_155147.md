## Executive Summary

Existing topic modeling methodologies face a fundamental trade-off between capturing temporal evolution and maintaining computational efficiency in streaming environments. Traditional Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs) generally require access to the entire corpus upfront, rendering them inefficient for real-time applications. Conversely, standard Online Topic Models, while capable of incremental processing, are plagued by "catastrophic forgetting," where the model loses previously learned topics upon assimilating new data streams. This paper addresses the critical lack of a framework capable of handling the temporal evolution of topics in an online setting while effectively retaining long-term memory without prohibitive computational costs.

The authors introduce the **Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM)**, a framework built on the Dirichlet Variational AutoEncoder (DVAE) that decouples global long-term knowledge from local temporal patterns to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Technically, CoNTM employs a continuously updated global prior distribution characterized by persistent parameters ($\phi_{global}$). To incorporate new data, the model derives local topics for specific time steps ($\phi_{local, t}$) using the transformation function $\phi_{local, t} = g(\phi_{global}, \Delta\phi_{local, t})$. A key innovation for efficiency is that only the perturbations ($\Delta\phi_{local, t}$) are updated during training. This allows the model to maximize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) and integrate new information without the computational burden of reprocessing historical data.

In benchmarking against state-of-the-art baselines—including Dynamic LDA, Dynamic Embedded Topic Model, and Dynamic BERTopic—CoNTM demonstrated superior performance across three primary datasets: Twitter, NYTimes, and Wikipedia. The model achieved significantly lower predictive perplexity and generated topics with higher Topic Coherence (NPMI) compared to traditional dynamic models. Furthermore, CoNTM achieved superior Topic Diversity, a metric measured by assessing the uniqueness of top-ranked words across topics to ensure non-redundancy. Crucially, runtime efficiency was validated through the model's architecture; by updating only local perturbations rather than the full history, CoNTM achieved substantial efficiency gains over baselines that require full retraining. The model also successfully quantified its mitigation of catastrophic forgetting, learning new topic structures without degrading the representation of historical data.

This research establishes a significant advancement in natural language processing by validating that continual learning approaches can outperform traditional dynamic models on key metrics while maintaining the flexibility required for online data streams. By bridging the gap between temporal modeling and memory retention, CoNTM provides a scalable solution for analyzing large, evolving corpora in real-time, such as social media feeds or news archives. The model's ability to capture topic evolution through a decoupled global-local architecture sets a new standard for future research in dynamic and continual topic modeling, offering a robust framework for handling the increasing volume of streaming text data.

## Methodology

The researchers proposed the **Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM)** to bridge the gap between two existing approaches with significant limitations:

1.  **Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs):** These require the entire corpus to be available at once, making them inefficient for streaming data.
2.  **Standard Online Topic Models:** These can process data incrementally but lack long-term memory and suffer from catastrophic forgetting.

**The Core Mechanism:**
To overcome these issues, CoNTM utilizes a **global prior distribution**. This prior is continuously updated as new data arrives at subsequent time steps. This architecture allows the model to incorporate new information while simultaneously retaining the knowledge gained from previous data, effectively balancing adaptability with memory retention.

## Technical Details

CoNTM is architecturally grounded in the **Dirichlet Variational AutoEncoder (DV AE)**. It specifically addresses catastrophic forgetting by decoupling global long-term knowledge from local temporal patterns.

### Architecture Components
*   **Global Parameters ($\phi_{global}$):** These serve as the model's persistent long-term memory.
*   **Local Topics ($\phi_{local, t}$):** Derived for specific time slices to capture immediate trends.

### Mathematical Transformation
The relationship between global and local topics is defined by the transformation function:
$$ \phi_{local, t} = g(\phi_{global}, \Delta\phi_{local, t}) $$
*   **Efficiency Update:** Only the perturbations ($\Delta\phi_{local, t}$) are updated during the training process for new time steps, rather than recalculating the entire model.

### Generative and Inference Processes
*   **Generative Process:**
    *   Document-topic distributions are drawn from a Dirichlet prior.
    *   Words are drawn from a Multinomial distribution.
*   **Inference:**
    *   Performed by maximizing the **Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)**.
    *   The variational distribution is defined as:
        $$ q_\theta(z) = \text{Dirichlet}(\alpha_\theta(w)) $$
