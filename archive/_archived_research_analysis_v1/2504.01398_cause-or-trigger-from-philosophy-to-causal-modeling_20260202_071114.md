## Executive Summary

In the natural sciences, distinguishing between an event's underlying **cause** (the internal energy supply or maintenance factor) and its **trigger** (the external releasing factor that initiates the event) is a persistent theoretical and practical challenge. Traditional causal modeling frameworks often conflate these two distinct roles, treating the spark that initiates a process identically to the fuel that sustains it. This ambiguity hinders accurate scientific understanding and limits the effectiveness of intervention strategies in fields such as meteorology, where understanding the onset of a phenomenon is distinct from understanding its propagation.

This paper addresses this gap by establishing a rigorous, operational definition that differentiates causes from triggers directly from observational data. The study introduces the **"Cause-Trigger" algorithm**, a novel computational method that bridges metaphysical philosophy with quantitative data science.

Technically, the approach formalizes the distinction using the statistical concept of a 'moderator' within a Granger-causality framework. The algorithm preprocesses standardized time series into lagged matrices and iteratively eliminates candidate triggers to compare a Baseline model against an Interaction model (Granger-Moderator). It utilizes an F-statistic to compare the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), testing the null hypothesis that the interaction coefficient is non-significant. The final trigger is selected based on the candidate variable that results in the highest increase in the mean value of the effect variable, effectively isolating the initiating event from background energy variables.

The proposed framework was empirically validated using high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis data (25-30 km resolution) on two distinct weather events: Cyclone Freddy (Feb 4–7, 2023) and Cyclone Zazu (Dec 11–15, 2020). The analysis utilized an 8x8 grid (~100 km radius) for Freddy and a 9x9 grid (~125 km radius) for Zazu, incorporating variables such as Divergence, Geopotential, Ozone mass mixing ratio, and wind direction.

The algorithm successfully detected the specific processes that triggered high wind speeds during the cyclogenesis of both storms. These findings demonstrated strong quantitative agreement with established meteorological expert knowledge, confirming the model's ability to accurately distinguish causal energy buildup from triggering processes without prior labeling.

By enabling the identification of precursor triggers solely from observational data—without requiring experimental intervention—the "Cause-Trigger" algorithm offers significant practical utility for domains requiring timely decision-making, such as climate change mitigation and disaster evacuation planning.
