## 📄 Executive Summary

Standard adversarial training (AT) is the predominant method for defending against worst-case distribution shifts and adversarial attacks. However, this paper identifies a critical limitation: while improving robustness on average, current methodologies often degrade generalization on clean examples and create significant performance disparities across different classes. The authors investigate "spill-over effects," revealing that adversarial training disproportionately harms specific classes, resulting in a class-wise robustness gap. This renders models unreliable for real-world deployment where equitable performance is essential.

To address this, the authors propose **"enhanced labeling,"** a strategy integrating Label Augmentation directly into the Adversarial Training pipeline (referred to as **Adv+**). The innovation modifies loss function targets by constructing an augmented label vector: `Concat[(1 - δ)y_i, δz_j]` (where $\delta = 0.03$). The model minimizes negative log-likelihood over this augmented vector using a ResNet-50 architecture.

The proposed **Adv+** model demonstrates substantial improvements. Achieving a PGD-40 error rate of **32.70%** (a 53.50% improvement over baseline), it successfully overcomes the typical robustness-accuracy trade-off, achieving a clean error rate of 26.70%. The approach also showed superior corruption robustness and effectively mitigated class imbalance, reducing the standard deviation of class-wise errors by up to 7.87% on ImageNet-ReaL. This research suggests that the robustness-accuracy trade-off is not inherent but a byproduct of standard procedures, positioning enhanced labeling as a potential standard for training fair, high-performance vision systems.
