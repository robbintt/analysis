## Executive Summary

Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents face a critical optimization challenge: **balancing the performance benefits of test-time scaling against strict inference latency constraints**. While increasing computation time generally improves reasoning quality, existing agentic systems lack the intrinsic architecture necessary to calibrate their reasoning depth dynamically against time limits. This absence of temporal awareness creates a disconnect where models cannot effectively manage finite computational budgets, hindering their deployment in real-time interactive environments.

The authors propose **"Timely Machine,"** a framework designed to integrate explicit temporal awareness into the inference pipeline. Technically, the system utilizes a time-aware inference binding mechanism that segments operations into four distinct latency modes: No, Low, Medium, and High. This architecture allows the agent to dynamically modulate its output strategy by binding the inference process to these specific operational modes. By actively adjusting reasoning depth in response to the remaining time budget, the mechanism ensures that computational resources are allocated efficiently across the agent's decision trajectory rather than being consumed statically.

The methodology was evaluated using the Jericho dataset across four text adventure games: Zork1, Advent, Enchanter, and Detective. Experiments scaled inference steps from 30 to 20,000—correlated with wall-clock time up to 20,000 seconds—to measure performance against varying budgets. The study utilized normalized scores as the primary metric, revealing significant variability in responsiveness to test-time scaling: Enchanter showed the highest range (25–100), Zork1 demonstrated moderate scaling (40–56), while Advent (0–30) and Detective (0–32) exhibited lower performance ceilings. The data indicates a clear correlation between increased compute and performance, though saturation points differ across the Low, Medium, and High latency settings depending on game complexity.

This research provides evidence that effective agentic scaling requires explicit time-management mechanisms rather than raw compute increases alone. By validating that distinct latency modes can maintain or improve performance across variable time budgets, the study establishes temporal awareness as a necessary component for reliable LLM systems. This work shifts the field toward developing autonomous agents that are not only computationally capable but also temporally adaptive, ensuring robustness in time-sensitive deployment scenarios.
