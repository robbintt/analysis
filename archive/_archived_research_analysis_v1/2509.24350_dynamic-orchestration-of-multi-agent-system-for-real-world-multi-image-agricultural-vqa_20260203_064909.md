## 📋 Executive Summary

Current agricultural Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems are fundamentally limited by their reliance on single-image inputs and static processing models. These approaches fail to synthesize the complex, complementary information required in real-world farming, such as data across varying spatial scales, distinct plant growth stages, and diverse environmental views. Furthermore, existing models typically operate in evidence-constrained settings, lacking the capability to dynamically integrate external factors—such as real-time weather data, agricultural policies, or scientific literature—that are essential for accurate, context-aware decision support.

This paper addresses the critical gap between these static, single-image research models and the dynamic, multi-modal data requirements of practical agricultural applications. The core innovation is a **self-reflective, self-improving multi-agent framework** designed to orchestrate the processing of multi-image and multi-modal data. Evaluated on the AgMMU benchmark, the proposed framework achieved competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods, including KisanQRS, AgAsk, and ShizishanGPT.

The evaluation demonstrated the system's superior ability to synthesize information from complementary views, spatial scales, and temporal growth stages—specifically where traditional models typically falter. Analysis confirmed that the parallel Answerer architecture effectively reduced generation bias, while the self-reflective mechanism proved robust in adapting to scenarios with incomplete initial evidence. This research significantly advances agricultural AI by introducing a unified, non-rigid pipeline capable of handling the multifaceted nature of farm data, establishing a new standard for dynamic contextualization.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Competitive Performance:** The proposed multi-agent framework achieves strong results on the AgMMU benchmark, specifically outperforming traditional models in multi-image agricultural QA tasks.
*   **Multi-Image Synthesis:** The system successfully addresses the limitations of single-image approaches by effectively synthesizing information from complementary views, spatial scales, and growth stages.
*   **Bias Reduction:** Utilizing two parallel Answerers to draft candidate responses proved effective in reducing bias during the answer generation phase.
*   **Adaptive Retrieval:** The integration of a self-reflective mechanism (via the Reflector and Improver) enables the system to adapt to incomplete evidence by dynamically triggering information retrieval and iterative refinement.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The researchers developed a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework featuring distinct collaborative roles:

*   **Retriever:** Responsible for formulating queries and gathering up-to-date external agricultural information.
*   **Reflector:** Assesses the adequacy of retrieved information and triggers sequential query reformulation.
*   **Answerer:** Employs two parallel agents to draft candidate responses simultaneously to minimize bias.
*   **Improver:** Refines the drafted responses through iterative checks to ensure alignment and utilization of information from multiple images.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The paper proposes a self-reflective, self-improving multi-agent framework for agricultural VQA featuring an iterative, multi-loop architecture.

### Agent Roles
1.  **Manager:** The central orchestrator.
2.  **Retriever:** Handles information gathering with adaptive keyword rewriting.
3.  **Parallel Answerers:** Two agents responsible for drafting and cross-evaluating to reduce bias.
4.  **Reflector:** Evaluates retrieval quality.
5.  **Improver:** Evaluates answer quality based on visual evidence, completeness, and correctness.

### System Loops
*   **Retrieval Loop:** Operates between the Reflector and Retriever to ensure context adequacy.
*   **Reasoning Loop:** Operates between the Improver and Answerer to ensure answer fidelity.

### Data Processing
*   **Inputs:** Multi-modal data, specifically multi-image inputs across various views and growth stages.
*   **External Context:** Integrates external data such as weather, policies, and scientific literature.

## ✨ Research Contributions

*   **Real-World Adaptation:** Bridges the gap between evidence-constrained settings and real-world agricultural demands by handling multi-image inputs with complex, complementary data.
*   **Dynamic Contextualization:** Enhances agricultural VQA systems by integrating up-to-date external knowledge bases, allowing the system to function even when initial visual evidence is incomplete.
*   **Systematic Quality Control:** Introduces a non-rigid, dynamic pipeline that uses self-reflection and iterative improvement to maintain high standards of answer quality, moving beyond static processing models.
