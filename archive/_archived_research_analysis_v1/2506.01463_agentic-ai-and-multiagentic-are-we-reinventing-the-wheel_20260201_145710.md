## 📋 Executive Summary

The rapid emergence of LLM-based "Agentic AI" and "Multiagentic AI" is currently plagued by **terminological redundancy** and a **disconnect from historical scientific foundations**. This paper addresses the critical issue that the current hype cycle is effectively marketing decades-old concepts—"intelligent agents" and "multi-agent systems" (MAS)—as novel inventions.

Overlooking the genealogy of these fields creates a substantial risk of "reinventing the wheel." Consequently, modern development often neglects essential agent properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, and social capability) and relies on ad-hoc implementations rather than established engineering standards.

The core innovation proposed is a framework to **retrofit modern LLM-based agents** with the rigorous engineering standards of classical MAS. This includes integrating legacy coordination mechanisms—such as automated negotiation, task assignment, consensus protocols, and trust models—into current LLM orchestration frameworks. The paper calls for scientific rigor to prevent a fragmented landscape of incompatible agent standards, advocating for a convergence of generative capabilities and proven reliability.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Terminological Redundancy:** The terms 'Agentic AI' and 'Multiagentic AI' are largely identified as marketing buzzwords that conceptually duplicate established 'intelligent agents' and 'multi-agent systems' (MAS).
*   **Historical Disconnect:** Current generative AI discourse frequently overlooks decades of foundational research, including theoretical origins in social sciences, philosophy, and classical agent architectures.
*   **Omission of Core Properties:** The hype surrounding LLM-based agents often neglects essential agent properties defined in classical AI, such as:
    *   Autonomy
    *   Reactivity
    *   Proactivity
    *   Social Capability
*   **Risk of Redundancy:** There is a significant risk of 'reinventing the wheel' in the development of LLM-agent platforms if existing standards, communication languages, and coordination algorithms are not integrated.

## 🧬 Methodology

The paper employs a **critical conceptual analysis and literature review** methodology. It traces the genealogy of the term 'agentic' from its roots in social sciences and philosophy to foundational AI engineering works. This approach contrasts classical definitions against contemporary LLM implementations and multi-agent orchestration frameworks to identify specific theoretical and engineering gaps.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Comparative Analysis: Classical vs. Modern

The paper contrasts Classical Agent/Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) architectures with modern LLM-based 'Agentic AI.'

| **Classical Architecture** | **Characteristics** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Reactive Agents** | Direct mapping; Subsumption Architecture. |
| **Deliberative Agents** | Symbolic models; logical deduction. |
| **Goal-based & Utility-based** | Driven by specific goals or utility functions. |
| **Learning Agents** | Adaptation over time. |

### Proposed Integration Strategy

The authors propose retrofitting LLM-based agents with established MAS engineering standards to bridge the gap between the two paradigms.

*   **Structured Communication Protocols:**
    *   *Self-Referential Communication*
    *   *Agora*
*   **Classical Coordination Mechanisms:**
    *   Task assignment
    *   Consensus building
    *   Voting protocols
*   **Agreement Technologies:**
    *   Automated negotiation
    *   Argumentation frameworks
    *   Trust models

## 📈 Results

As this is a theoretical and conceptual position paper, **no quantitative metrics or benchmark scores** are present. The qualitative findings include:

*   **Terminology Confirmation:** Confirmed redundancy between modern "Agentic" terminology and established MAS concepts.
*   **Property Gaps:** Identification that current LLM implementations frequently lack the four critical agent properties: autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, and social capability.
*   **Scalability Risks:** Highlights that existing unstructured natural language communication approaches between agents face scalability risks that are effectively solved by classical structured protocols.
