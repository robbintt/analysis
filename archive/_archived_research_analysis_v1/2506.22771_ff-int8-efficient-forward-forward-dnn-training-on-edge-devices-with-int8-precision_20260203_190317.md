## Executive Summary

Training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) directly on resource-constrained edge devices remains a significant challenge due to the high computational and memory demands of standard backpropagation. The traditional backpropagation algorithm requires storing intermediate activations for gradient calculation, creating a substantial memory bottleneck that prohibits on-device learning. Furthermore, training typically utilizes high-precision floating-point arithmetic (FP32), which consumes excessive energy and processing power. This research addresses the need for an efficient training framework that minimizes memory footprint and energy consumption while maintaining model accuracy, thereby enabling continuous learning and personalization on edge hardware.

The authors propose **FF-INT8**, a novel framework that combines the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm with aggressive INT8 quantization for the entire training process. Unlike backpropagation, the FF algorithm updates weights layer-by-layer using local objective functions, eliminating the memory-intensive backward pass and the need to store intermediate activations. To stabilize training with low-precision INT8 weights and activations, the researchers developed a quantization-aware approach tailored for layer-wise processing. Additionally, they introduced a **"Look-Ahead" mechanism** to overcome the accuracy limitations of the standard greedy FF algorithm. This scheme incorporates the goodness of subsequent layers into the current layer's loss function ($L_{new} = L_1 + \lambda \times \sum L_{future}$), allowing the model to optimize for global performance with minimal computational overhead, avoiding the complex derivative chains of backpropagation.

Empirical evaluation on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano demonstrates that FF-INT8 offers significant efficiency gains while preserving competitive accuracy. The system achieved a 27.0% reduction in memory usage, an 8.3% decrease in energy consumption, and a 4.6% increase in training speed compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Computationally, the framework reduced operation counts to 23.8M 8-bit MULs and ADDs, representing a 37.7x reduction in MAC operations relative to FP32 and INT8 Backpropagation baselines. In terms of model performance, FF-INT8 achieved higher convergence accuracy in fewer epochs (130 epochs) compared to baseline methods (180 epochs). Notably, for ResNet-18, the approach significantly improved stability and accuracy over standard FF implementations, which previously struggled to reach 60% accuracy.

This research significantly advances the feasibility of on-device DNN training by shifting the efficiency paradigm from inference to the training phase. By validating that the Forward-Forward algorithm can be effectively combined with INT8 quantization, the authors provide a viable pathway for deploying "lifelong learning" capabilities on edge devices without relying on cloud connectivity. The successful mitigation of FF's accuracy limitations through the Look-Ahead scheme suggests that biologically plausible, local learning algorithms can serve as practical alternatives to backpropagation in resource-constrained environments. This work paves the way for more privacy-preserving, energy-efficient, and responsive AI applications at the edge.
