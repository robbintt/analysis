## Executive Summary

**Problem: Optimizing Compute Allocation in LLMs**
This research addresses the critical resource allocation problem in Large Language Models (LLMs): determining the optimal balance between pre-training parameter scaling and test-time compute expenditure. As model inference costs rise, the paper investigates whether performance bottlenecks are more efficiently solved by increasing the number of parameters or by strategically allocating a budget of inference tokens during runtime. The study specifically targets the limitation of current scaling laws, which fail to account for performance gains derived from extended reasoning processes, search algorithms, and verification loops activated during the inference phase.

**Innovation: Oracle Scaling Laws and Formal Frameworks**
The core technical innovation is the derivation and validation of "Oracle Scaling Laws," which establishes a theoretical upper bound for LLM performance based on test-time compute. The authors formalize the "Oracle" as a model with access to a perfect Ground Truth Reward Model (GTRM) or verifier, allowing for the optimal pruning of search paths. This framework systematically isolates inference tokens—consumed via chain-of-thought reasoning, "Best-of-N" sampling, or search—from static parameters and pre-training data. By mathematically characterizing the relationship between the allocated token budget ($N$) and the reduction in error rate, the paper provides a mechanism to quantify the return on investment for inference computation compared to traditional parameter scaling.

**Results: Validation on MATH and GSM8K**
Empirical experiments conducted on standard reasoning benchmarks, including **MATH** and **GSM8K**, validate the proposed scaling laws with quantitative precision. The results demonstrate a linear-to-super-linear scaling relationship between inference tokens and performance on complex tasks. Specifically, the "Oracle" experiments show that for difficult queries, increasing the inference budget via verifier-guided search significantly outperforms scaling model parameters under a fixed compute budget. The findings validate the hypothesis that "most progress is made with more tokens," particularly distinguishing between optimal strategies: "Best-of-N" sampling is favored for simpler queries under tight budgets, while sequential reasoning and verification provide superior returns for harder problems as the budget expands.

**Impact: Shifting Paradigms to Inference Optimization**
This work redirects the AI development paradigm from purely parameter-centric scaling to the optimization of test-time compute algorithms. By providing theoretical evidence that inference tokens are a primary driver of reasoning capability, the study advocates for architectural advancements that maximize the utility of generation steps—such as reinforcement learning with verifiers, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and long-context retrieval. Consequently, the research establishes a new standard for evaluating model efficiency, suggesting that future state-of-the-art performance will be defined not just by model size, but by the effective deployment of inference-time computation to solve complex reasoning problems.
