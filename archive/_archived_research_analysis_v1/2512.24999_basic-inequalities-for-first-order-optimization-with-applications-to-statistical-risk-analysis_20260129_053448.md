## 📋 Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental theoretical disconnect between **implicit regularization** (which arises naturally from early stopping in first-order optimization) and **explicit regularization** (enforced through penalty terms). Understanding this relationship is critical for explaining why optimization algorithms like gradient descent (GD) and mirror descent (MD) generalize well to unseen data.

The authors introduce a unified mathematical framework termed **"basic inequalities,"** which upper bounds the difference between the objective function at the current iterate and any arbitrary reference point. Technically, the framework establishes these bounds by analyzing geometric properties—specifically Euclidean distance for GD and Bregman divergence for MD—linking initialization points, current iterates, and reference points.

A core breakthrough is interpreting the accumulated step size ($\eta T$) as an **inverse regularization coefficient**, effectively bridging the gap between optimization and statistical literature. The paper derives rigorous results, most notably "Regularization Equivalence," demonstrating that under constant step sizes, GD behaves identically to an explicitly regularized solution. This work provides a comprehensive toolset for unifying these concepts, allowing for the rigorous translation of statistical risk bounds into the optimization domain.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The paper introduces a unified mathematical framework to bound the difference $f(\theta_T) - f(z)$. This framework bridges implicit and explicit regularization by interpreting accumulated step size $\eta T$ as an inverse regularization coefficient.

### Algorithm-Specific Assumptions

**Gradient Descent (GD)**
*   **Requirements:** Function $f$ must be convex, differentiable, and $L$-smooth.
*   **Step Size:** $\eta_t \in (0, 1/L]$.
*   **Distance Metric:** Euclidean distance.

**Mirror Descent (MD)**
*   **Generalization:** MD generalizes GD using Bregman divergence $D_\phi$.
*   **Requirements:** Potential function $\phi$ must be Legendre type and $\alpha$-strongly convex.
*   **Step Size:** $\eta_t \in (0, \alpha/L]$.

### Key Theorems
*   **Theorem 1:** GD Basic Inequality (Upper bounds on objective value difference).
*   **Theorem 2:** MD Basic Inequality.

## 📊 Results

Theoretical results established in the paper include:

*   **Regularization Equivalence (Corollary 1):** For constant step size $\eta$, the GD iterate behaves like an explicitly regularized solution with parameter $\lambda_T = 1/(\eta T)$. The result is bounded within a fixed **1:4** coefficient ratio.
*   **Training Dynamics (Corollary 2):** With infinite total step size, the algorithm is consistent, and the distance to the solution set is non-increasing.
*   **Inductive Bias Formalization:** The analysis proves convergence to the projection of the initialization onto the solution set ($\theta_\infty = \text{Proj}_S(\theta_0)$) for affine solution sets.
*   **Statistical Risk Analysis:** The framework connects to Lasso basic inequalities, allowing for the translation of statistical risk bounds (e.g., fast rates) to the implicit regularization setting of gradient descent.
