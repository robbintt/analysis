## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical vulnerability of contrastive learning to labeling errors, a pervasive issue in real-world datasets where the "label consistency assumption" fails. In standard contrastive frameworks, different augmented views of the same image are assumed to share the same label; however, when this assumption is violated due to noisy labels, the model treats semantically distinct samples as positive pairs. These "false positives" significantly degrade downstream classification performance by corrupting the learned representation. The paper highlights that this is not merely a robustness issue but a fundamental theoretical bottleneck, as existing frameworks lack a mechanism to quantify or mitigate the impact of these errors on the InfoNCE loss.

The key innovation is the application of Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as a pre-processing dimensionality reduction technique to act as a denoising filter. Technically, the authors formalize the impact of labeling error by decomposing the InfoNCE loss into variance terms corresponding to true positives, false positives, and negatives. By applying Truncated SVD to unlabeled samples, the method reduces the variance of false positives, thereby theoretically lowering the labeling error rate from $\alpha$ to $\alpha_q$. However, the study identifies a critical "double-edged sword" trade-off: while SVD suppresses noise, aggressive truncation reduces graph connectivity (spectral gap), which harms the model's ability to learn manifold structures. The theoretical framework relies on spectral graph theory and the normalized graph Laplacian to bound classification risk.

Empirical evaluations using SimCLR with ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 encoders on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 demonstrate that combining SVD with data inflation yields optimal performance. Specifically, on CIFAR-10, the proposed method achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 72.55% using Spectral Contrastive loss and 71.21% using InfoNCE loss, outperforming baselines of 71.54% and 70.87%, respectively. The experiments further revealed that embedding dimensions are crucial: moderate dimensions (512, 1024) provided the best results, while lower dimensions (128, 256) caused significant performance drops (e.g., falling to 72.35% on STL-10), and higher dimensions (2048) resulted in plateaus. Additionally, aggressive SVD truncation (low $q$) was shown to deteriorate accuracy due to the loss of graph connectivity.

The significance of this work lies in bridging the gap between the theoretical understanding of labeling noise and practical optimization strategies for contrastive learning. It provides the first theoretical formalization of how labeling errors inflate the classification risk bound and offers actionable guidelines for practitioners, specifically advocating for moderate embedding dimensions and weak augmentation to balance the trade-off between noise reduction and connectivity preservation. By validating that SVD can effectively mitigate false positives without expensive re-labeling, this research offers a computationally efficient path toward more robust contrastive learning systems in noisy environments.

## Technical Details

The paper proposes a theoretical and empirical framework to mitigate labeling errors in contrastive learning using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and a dimensionality reduction perspective.

**Theoretical Framework**
The approach refines the bounds of mean classification risk ($L_{CE}$) by decomposing InfoNCE loss into variance terms for:
*   True positives ($V(f(x))$)
*   False positives ($V^-(f(x))$)
*   Negatives ($V(f(x^-))$)

This decomposition includes an approximation error $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{M-1}{2}}\right)$ and a constant term. The dataset is modeled as an **Augmentation Graph** using spectral graph theory and the normalized graph Laplacian $L$.

**Core Intervention**
The method applies **Truncated SVD** with a hyperparameter $q$ to unlabeled original samples. This theoretically reduces the labeling error rate from $\alpha$ to $\alpha_q$ and satisfies the classification error bound:
$$E(f^*, W^*) \le \frac{4\alpha_q}{\lambda_{k+1,q}} + 8\alpha_q$$

The analysis covers both InfoNCE loss and Spectral Contrastive loss ($L_{spe}$).

## Results

Experiments evaluated SimCLR with ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 encoders using Downstream Classification Top-1 Accuracy.

**CIFAR-10 Performance**
Combining SVD ($q=30$) with data inflation achieved optimal performance:
*   **Spectral Contrastive Loss:** 72.55% (Baseline: 71.54%)
*   **InfoNCE Loss:** 71.21% (Baseline: 70.87%)

While SVD alone was comparable to data inflation, aggressive truncation (low $q$) degraded accuracy, highlighting the inherent trade-off.

**Impact of Embedding Dimensions**
Results across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 demonstrated that embedding dimensions play a critical role:
*   **Optimal:** Moderate-to-high dimensions (512, 1024) yielded the best results.
*   **Suboptimal:** Low dimensions (128, 256) consistently yielded lower accuracy (e.g., dropping to 72.35% from 73.88% on STL-10).
*   **Plateau:** High dimensions (2048) showed slight degradation or plateauing.
