## 📋 Executive Summary

Current meta-reinforcement learning approaches face significant limitations in non-stationary environments, primarily due to their reliance on uni-modal Gaussian distributions. The **TIMRL** framework addresses these challenges by integrating a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Transformer networks within a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture. This combination enables the effective handling of complex, multi-modal task distributions.

In validation across MuJoCo benchmarks, TIMRL demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods. It achieved significantly lower Recognition and Reconstruction errors while maintaining balanced regularization. This research advances the field of meta-RL by successfully addressing non-stationarity challenges, establishing a robust architecture for finer-grained task representation control and flexibility in dynamic environments. This sets a new standard for future research in multi-task and non-stationary reinforcement learning.
