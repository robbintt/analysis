## Executive Summary

> Deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices requires aggressive model compression to minimize latency and memory usage without sacrificing accuracy. Traditional Knowledge Distillation (KD) effectively transfers knowledge from a large "teacher" model to a compact "student" model, but it often functions as a "black box," failing to explicitly guide the student on which input features are critical for decision-making. This paper addresses the need for more efficient, interpretable compression techniques that enhance the transparency of the distillation process, ensuring that compressed models deployed on edge hardware retain the robust decision-making capabilities of their larger counterparts.
>
> The authors introduce a novel framework that augments standard Knowledge Distillation with Integrated Gradients (IG), an attribution method typically used for explainability. Technically, the method pre-computes IG attribution maps from the teacher model to identify pixel-level feature importance. These maps are then utilized as a unique data augmentation strategy: they are overlaid onto training images to highlight critical regions before being fed to the student model. This feature-level guidance forces the student to mimic the teacher’s decision rationale by focusing on the specific features that drive the teacher's inferences, transforming attribution maps from an analysis tool into a functional training component.
>
> The proposed framework was validated on the CIFAR-10 benchmark using a MobileNet-V2 teacher, where the method achieved a 4.1-fold compression of the teacher model and reduced inference latency from 140 ms to 13 ms, representing a tenfold speedup. The student model attained 92.5% accuracy, outperforming traditional KD baselines. This research is significant because it establishes a synergistic link between model compression and explainability, demonstrating that attribution methods can serve a dual purpose as both interpreters and trainers.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Accuracy:** Achieved **92.5% accuracy** on CIFAR-10, successfully outperforming baseline models and traditional Knowledge Distillation methods.
*   **Significant Latency Reduction:** Reduced inference latency from **140 ms to 13 ms**, representing a **tenfold speedup** in performance.
*   **High Compression Ratio:** Compressed the MobileNet-V2 teacher model by **4.1-fold**, making it highly suitable for edge deployment.
*   **Synergistic Effect:** Combining Knowledge Distillation with Integrated Gradients creates a synergistic effect that enhances both model performance and explainability.
*   **Effective Feature Guidance:** Using Integrated Gradients as a data augmentation strategy successfully guided the student model toward critical feature representations, improving decision rationale.

## Methodology

The research employed a structured approach to integrate explainability directly into the compression pipeline:

1.  **Framework Integration**
    *   Developed a machine learning framework that augments standard Knowledge Distillation (KD) with Integrated Gradients (IG).

2.  **Data Augmentation Strategy**
    *   Introduced a novel technique where precomputed IG maps are overlaid onto training images. This process highlights critical features, effectively turning attribution data into training input.

3.  **Feature-Level Guidance**
    *   Trained the compact student model on IG-overlayed images. This guided the student toward the teacher's decision-making insights, ensuring it learned *why* a decision was made, not just *what* the decision was.

4.  **Optimization**
    *   Involved rigorous hyperparameter optimization and validation using ablation studies to ensure the robustness of the framework.

## Technical Details

The proposed method is an augmented Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework designed specifically for edge computing platforms. It integrates Integrated Gradients (IG) to enhance model compression through the following mechanisms:

*   **Core Architecture:** The system utilizes feature-level guidance via IG attribution maps (pixel-level importance). These maps are pre-computed from the teacher model to serve as a data augmentation strategy.
*   **Training Process:** The student model is trained to mimic the teacher's decision rationale. By focusing on critical features identified by the IG maps, the student learns to prioritize the same visual cues as the larger teacher model.
*   **Efficiency Strategy:** To ensure computational efficiency, the framework employs a pre-computation strategy for IG maps. This transforms the gradient calculation from a recurring runtime cost into a one-time preprocessing step.
*   **Theoretical Compliance:** The process satisfies the theoretical properties of sensitivity and implementation invariance required for robust attribution methods.

*   **Edge Computing Optimization:** Contributed a scalable and interpretable technique designed explicitly for resource-constrained edge devices.
*   **Validation of Attribution Utility:** Demonstrated the practical utility of attribution maps, proving they can be functional tools for improving knowledge transfer and compression rather than just post-hoc analysis tools.

### Performance on CIFAR-10 Benchmark
The proposed method achieved significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy:

*   **Accuracy:** 92.5%
*   **Latency:** Reduced from 140 ms to 13 ms
*   **Compression:** 4.1-fold reduction in model size

### Comparative Analysis
When compared to existing techniques, the proposed framework offers a balanced trade-off between compression and accuracy:

*   **Bhardwaj et al. (2019):** Achieved 19.35x compression with 94.53% accuracy.
*   **Gou et al. (2023):** Achieved 1.91x compression with 95.53% accuracy.
*   **General Spectrum:** Existing techniques generally achieve compression factors between 1.9x and 20.8x, with accuracy impacts ranging from -8.63% to +0.30%. The combination of KD and IG in this study is reported to have a synergistic effect, enhancing both performance and explainability relative to the complexity of the task.
