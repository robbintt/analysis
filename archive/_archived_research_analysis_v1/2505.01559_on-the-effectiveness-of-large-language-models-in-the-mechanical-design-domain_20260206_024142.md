## Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of effectively applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to the specialized domain of mechanical design. While LLMs have shown success in general natural language processing, they often struggle with the technical vocabulary and semantic relationships inherent to engineering, such as the complex dependencies between assemblies and parts in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) data. Furthermore, the mechanical engineering domain suffers from a scarcity of large, labeled datasets, making standard fine-tuning prone to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. Bridging this gap is essential for enabling automated semantic understanding and intelligent design tools that can interpret unstructured engineering data.

The study introduces a domain-specific adaptation of a BERT-based Transformer architecture designed to handle the nuances of mechanical engineering language. Utilizing the ABC dataset—refined from approximately 1 million CAD models down to 61,725 unique assemblies—the authors constructed a framework for evaluating semantic understanding. The technical innovation involves an architectural modification that adds a Multi-Head Attention layer to the output layer, alongside an input layer designed to construct auxiliary sentences. To counter the limitations of a small domain-specific corpus, the researchers employed rigorous regularization strategies, including tuning learning rates, dropout values, sequence lengths, and layer selection, while also utilizing contrastive pre-training for zero-shot classification capabilities.

The fine-tuned model demonstrated measurable improvements over established baselines, validating the efficacy of the proposed architectural and hyperparameter optimizations. In the binary sentence-pair classification task—designed to determine part-assembly relationships—the model achieved an accuracy of 0.62. Additionally, in the zero-shot classification task, the model attained a top-1 accuracy of 0.386. The experiments also revealed that specific regularization techniques were critical in mitigating overfitting, while simultaneously highlighting specific failure modes where standard NLP techniques fail to capture domain-specific mechanical engineering concepts.

This work establishes a foundational benchmarking framework for semantic understanding within mechanical engineering using the ABC dataset. By identifying the specific limitations and failure modes of standard LLMs in technical domains, the study provides a roadmap for future research into domain-specific artificial intelligence. The optimization insights regarding architectural modifications and hyperparameter tuning offer a reproducible methodology for training robust models on small, specialized corpora, ultimately advancing the potential for intelligent automation in mechanical design and CAD analysis.
