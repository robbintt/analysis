## Executive Summary

> Large Language Models (LLMs) face a critical bottleneck in scientific discovery: the inability to sustain strategic coherence over ultra-long horizons spanning days or weeks. Current agentic systems typically rely on static context windows that quickly become overwhelmed by the high-dimensional data generated during iterative experimentation. This limitation causes agents to lose sight of long-term objectives amidst the noise of immediate execution details, preventing them from effectively managing complex, multi-stage engineering tasks such as Machine Learning Engineering (MLE), where feedback is sparse and cumulative experience is essential.
>
> The authors introduce "Cognitive Accumulation," a framework that reframes context management from a static storage problem into a dynamic process of structural differentiation. The core technical innovation is Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tier architecture inspired by computer systems that decouples immediate execution from long-term strategy. HCC dynamically distills transient execution traces into two distinct forms of memory: "Stable Knowledge" (task-specific insights) and "Cross-task Wisdom" (generalizable strategies). This approach allows the agent to retain high-level strategic guidance over extended durations without relying on increasingly large context windows.
>
> The proposed architecture was instantiated in ML-Master 2.0 and evaluated on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under strict 24-hour budget constraints. The system achieved a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%, a significant improvement over the previous ML-Master version's 48.5%. Furthermore, ML-Master 2.0 outperformed a range of competitor agents, including AIRA-dojo, Neo, R&D-Agent, InternAgent, and Operand. These metrics validate the effectiveness of cognitive accumulation, demonstrating that the system can successfully navigate complex engineering workflows and consolidate sparse feedback into actionable long-term guidance.
>
> This research represents a significant advancement in "Agentic Science," providing a scalable blueprint for AI agents capable of autonomous scientific discovery. By demonstrating that cognitive accumulation can overcome the limitations of static context management, the study proves that AI agents can maintain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles typically reserved for human researchers. This capability moves the field closer to fully autonomous research systems that can master complex engineering domains and accumulate wisdom in a manner analogous to the scientific process itself.
