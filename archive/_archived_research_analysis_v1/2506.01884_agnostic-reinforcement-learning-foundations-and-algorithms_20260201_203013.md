## 📋 Executive Summary

This research addresses a fundamental theoretical gap in Reinforcement Learning (RL) concerning large state spaces that require function approximation. Standard RL theory typically relies on the "realizability assumption"—the premise that the optimal policy exists within the algorithm's pre-defined class. This assumption rarely holds in practice, leading to a lack of rigorous guarantees.

This paper focuses on **agnostic policy learning**: finding the best policy within a constrained class when the true optimal policy is fundamentally outside of it. The key innovation is a learning-theoretic framework introducing **"Spanning Capacity"** as the primary metric for statistical complexity, measuring richness via state-occupancy measures. The study establishes distinct conditions for sample-efficient learning across Generative, Online, and Imitation settings, moving beyond idealized assumptions to define the precise boundaries of what is achievable with current algorithms.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Fundamental Performance Bounds:** The research characterizes rigorous bounds for algorithms operating within the agnostic policy learning framework.
*   **Statistical Separations:** It reveals significant statistical separations that clearly delineate the powers and limitations of agnostic policy learning.
*   **Learning Under Weak Approximation:** Study establishes that sample-efficient learning is theoretically possible under the 'weakest form of function approximation,' even when the policy class does not contain the optimal policy.
*   **Critical Coverage Conditions:** Identifies coverage conditions related to state-occupancy measures as a critical axis for defining statistical complexity.

## 🧪 Methodology

The research adopts a **learning-theoretic perspective** to rigorously examine the statistical complexity of RL with function approximation. The methodology centers on a systematic exploration of *agnostic policy learning*—seeking the best policy within a given class without the realizability assumption.

The analysis is structured around three specific axes:

1.  **Environment Access:** Data collection methods and protocols.
2.  **Coverage Conditions:** Intrinsic properties of the MDP measuring state-occupancy expansiveness.
3.  **Representational Conditions:** Structural assumptions placed on the policy class.

## 📈 Results & Analysis

The study provides specific results for each interaction protocol, identifying necessary and sufficient conditions for efficiency.

### 1. Generative Model Setting
