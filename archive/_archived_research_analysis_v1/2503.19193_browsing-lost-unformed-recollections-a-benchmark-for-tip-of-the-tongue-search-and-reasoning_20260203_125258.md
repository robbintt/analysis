## Executive Summary

> This research addresses the critical limitation of current AI systems in performing **"tip-of-the-tongue" (ToT) known-item search**, where users attempt to retrieve specific information using only vague, fragmentary memory cues. While humans demonstrate a remarkable **98% success rate** in navigating these fuzzy recollections—leveraging context, inference, and cross-modal associations—existing AI assistants struggle significantly. This gap represents a fundamental barrier in developing AI agents capable of handling real-world information retrieval scenarios, as queries are often unformed, imprecise, and require complex reasoning rather than simple keyword matching.
>
> To quantify and challenge this deficiency, the authors introduce **BLUR (Browsing Lost Unformed Recollections)**, the first benchmark specifically targeting ToT search and reasoning. Technically, BLUR utilizes a rigorous two-stage "Writer" and "Validator" pipeline to curate **573 real-world queries**, consisting of 75% text-only and 25% multimodal inputs (images, audio, video) across multiple languages. The benchmark enforces a standardized evaluation protocol using a private test set to prevent contamination, zero-shot prompting, and an LLM-Judge (Llama 3.2) for high-accuracy verification. This setup forces AI models to integrate tool use, such as web browsing and reverse image search, with multi-hop reasoning and uncertainty handling.
>
> The evaluation highlights a substantial disparity between human and machine performance, with humans achieving a baseline score of **0.98** compared to the best AI system, **HuggingFace Agents + Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, which scored only **0.56** (a 42% absolute gap). While agentic systems like Operator (0.54) and DynaSaur + GPT-4o (0.50) slightly outperformed the best base model (o1-2024-12-17 at 0.49), the improvements were marginal. Furthermore, the results indicate that performance significantly degrades on multimodal queries compared to text-only tasks and declines as query difficulty increases, with a standard search engine baseline achieving a negligible score of **0.04**.
>
> The BLUR benchmark establishes a vital new standard for evaluating AI capabilities beyond traditional question-answering, specifically targeting the nuanced intersection of search, reasoning, and tool use. By demonstrating that current agentic frameworks offer only limited advantages over base models in this domain, the paper exposes significant weaknesses in how AI handles uncertainty and multimodal context. This contribution provides the research community with a challenging public leaderboard and a clear direction for future development: bridging the gap between parametric knowledge and the dynamic, exploratory search strategies required for human-like memory retrieval.

    *   **75% Text-only** inputs.
    *   **25% File-based** inputs (Images, Audio, Video).
*   **Languages:** Multilingual scope.

**Task Requirements**
The task focuses on known-item retrieval using fuzzy memory cues, necessitating:
*   Multi-hop reasoning.
*   Tool use (Web browsing, reverse image search, translation).
*   Uncertainty handling.

**Evaluation Protocol**
*   **Test Set:** Private test set utilized to prevent data contamination.
