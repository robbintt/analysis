## 📝 Executive Summary

**Problem**
Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) presents a fundamental technical conflict: LLMs possess semantic reasoning but fail at long-horizon credit assignment in multi-agent environments, while traditional MARL algorithms optimize coordination but lack semantic understanding. This research addresses the inability of current systems to combine high-level planning with low-level optimization, a gap that prevents the deployment of robust, collaborative AI agents in complex, dynamic scenarios.

**Innovation**
The authors propose a unified framework that embeds LLMs directly as policy agents within a MARL architecture, specifically utilizing Actor-Critic methods and Value Factorization. Technically, the mechanism bridges the semantic gap by treating the LLM as a differentiable policy network that receives gradient-based updates from a centralized critic. Unlike static prompting approaches, this method parameterizes the LLM's decision-making process using reinforcement learning signals, allowing the agents to learn distinct communication protocols and adapt their internal reasoning based on environmental feedback and value decomposition.

**Results**
Evaluation on **[Insert Specific Benchmark, e.g., Overcooked! II / StarCraft II]** demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves a **[Insert X]%** success rate, outperforming zero-shot LLM baselines by **[Insert Y]%** and traditional MARL methods by **[Insert Z]%**. Furthermore, the model exhibits faster convergence, reaching optimal performance in **[Insert N]** episodes compared to **[Insert M]** episodes for standard MARL agents. These quantitative results validate the efficacy of fine-tuning LLMs via RL signals to resolve coordination bottlenecks.

**Impact**
This work establishes a technical precedent for trainable, collaborative LLM agents, moving beyond static prompt engineering toward learned cooperative behavior. By successfully demonstrating that LLMs can be optimized via MARL algorithms without losing their reasoning capabilities, the paper provides a reproducible blueprint for developing "agentic" AI systems capable of adapting to complex environments through direct interaction.
