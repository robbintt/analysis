## Executive Summary

### Problem
Large Language Models (LLMs) possess advanced statistical capabilities but face inherent limitations in autonomously executing algorithms and internalizing processed data. These models struggle to perform precise, step-by-step algorithmic reasoning and variable manipulation, relying instead on probabilistic pattern matching. This deficiency hinders their application in domains requiring rigorous computational logic and mathematical accuracy. Consequently, current LLMs lack the reliability required to function as independent reasoning agents in algorithmic domains without external intervention.

### Innovation
To address these limitations, the authors introduce **LLM-DAL** (Large Language Model – Decompositional Algorithmic Learning), a specialized supervised training framework designed to facilitate reasoning decomposition. Technically, LLM-DAL utilizes Curriculum and Structured Learning to decompose complex algorithmic tasks into simpler, manageable subtasks. Unlike approaches that rely on Neural Turing Machines—which suffer from convergence issues—or External API Delegation—which introduces latency and privacy risks—LLM-DAL aims to internalize algorithmic resolution by forcing the model to capture long-term dependencies and variable states directly within its weights.

### Results
The study applies the LLM-DAL framework to a specific arithmetic function, demonstrating its capacity to handle algorithmic execution tasks that challenge current architectures. The performance is contextualized against key benchmarks:
*   An **External API baseline** achieved a 100% success rate on simple arithmetic tasks but revealed critical failures in handling nested function calls alongside significant latency and privacy drawbacks.
*   **SOTA Comparisons:** QwQ-32B-Preview achieves 90.6% on MATH-500, and Mathstral 7B achieves 74.59% on MATH.
*   LLM-DAL successfully internalized the algorithmic logic required for the arithmetic function, addressing the generalization gaps observed in external and SOTA baselines.

### Impact
The significance of this research lies in demonstrating that LLM capabilities can be extended beyond statistical inference to include autonomous algorithm execution through structural training design. By providing evidence that actively guiding the learning process via reasoning decomposition enhances generalization, the authors establish a viable pathway for creating models capable of intrinsic algorithmic logic. This contribution challenges the industry's reliance on external code interpreters, suggesting that properly engineered training methodologies are essential for evolving LLMs from statistical predictors into reliable, self-contained reasoning agents.
