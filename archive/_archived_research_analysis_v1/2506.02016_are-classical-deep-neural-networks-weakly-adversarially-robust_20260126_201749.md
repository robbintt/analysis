# Are classical deep neural networks weakly adversarially robust?

> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Standard adversarial training (AT) remains the dominant method for securing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), yet it imposes a critical trade-off: it enhances robustness at the expense of significant clean accuracy and requires high computational overhead due to adversarial sample generation. Furthermore, the prevailing consensus suggests that classical DNNs are inherently weak and lack natural defensive capabilities against adversarial threats.
>
> This paper challenges these assumptions by introducing a defense mechanism based on "**Progressive Feedforward Collapse**" (PFC) and the construction of layer-wise feature paths. The core technical insight is that while adversarial examples cause features to diverge drastically in final classification layers, they maintain strong correlation with clean samples in intermediate layers. To exploit this, the system constructs feature paths for inputs and compares them to pre-computed class-centered paths using Cosine Similarity. Detection utilizes Otsu's method for thresholding, while classification is performed via an intermediate-layer weighted voting mechanism.
>
> Evaluated on CIFAR-10 against AutoPGD attacks, the method demonstrates a distinct efficiency-robustness profile. On ResNet-20, the approach achieved **82.77% clean accuracy** and **44.17% adversarial accuracy**, marking a **5.13% improvement in clean accuracy** over the AT baseline (77.64%). The method's generalizability was confirmed on ResNet-18, where it achieved **80.01% clean accuracy** and **46.1% adversarial accuracy**, validating that the approach works effectively on standard architectures.
>
> This research challenges the established consensus that classical DNNs are inherently weak, empirically demonstrating that latent robustness can be extracted through internal feature analysis. By providing a cost-effective alternative to standard AT, the authors open new avenues for lightweight defense strategies.
