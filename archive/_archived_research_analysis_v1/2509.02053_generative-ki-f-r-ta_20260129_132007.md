## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical challenge of integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into Technology Assessment (TA) workflows, a task complicated by AI's dual role as both an analytical instrument and a subject requiring scrutiny. The problem is structurally significant because standard technical updates fail to resolve inherent risks associated with data quality and model opacity. For a field like TA, which demands high evidentiary standards, the persistence of "structurally induced risks"—such as factual errors arising from training data contamination—poses a fundamental barrier to adoption.

The study highlights that treating these issues as mere transient bugs is insufficient, as the underlying architecture of current GenAI creates systemic vulnerabilities that threaten scientific integrity. The authors propose a conceptual framework grounded in critical discourse analysis to establish rigorous operational requirements for using GenAI in scientific contexts.

Technically, the innovation involves dissecting existing GenAI architectures to pinpoint how features like training on scraped internet data and non-uniform data distributions lead to model hallucinations and generalization errors. The core contribution is a set of specific operational prerequisites for TA applications: AI outputs must be understandable, traceable, controllable, coherent, non-discriminatory, and sourced. The analysis concludes that it is "practically impossible" to verify the factual correctness of datasets at training scale and that structurally induced risks persist despite technical advancements.

## Key Findings

*   **Dual Role of AI:** The study establishes that AI functions in TA both as an **instrument** for analysis and as a **subject** of critical research.
*   **Structural Persistence:** Structurally induced risks (vs. transient bugs) persist despite technical advancements and model updates.
*   **Feasibility Variances:** While solutions to structural problems exist conceptually, their implementation feasibility varies significantly.
*   **Operational Requirements:** Successful integration requires adherence to specific operational standards to ensure responsibility.

## Methodology

The paper employs a **conceptual and analytical approach** rather than relying on empirical data collection. The process is structured as a critical discourse and follows these logical steps:

1.  **Outline:** Defining the phenomenon of GenAI in TA.
2.  **Formulation:** Identifying necessary operational requirements.
3.  **Analysis:** Performing a detailed analysis of structural causes.
4.  **Evaluation:** Concluding with a prescriptive evaluation of solution feasibility and practical examples.

## Technical Details

Note: The text analyzes existing Generative AI architectures rather than proposing a novel model.

### Architecture Characteristics
*   **Data Sources:** Trained on scraped internet data, books, and journals.
*   **Data Quality:** Characterized by contamination (synthetic data, protocols, redundancy) and non-uniform distributions (clustering and gaps).
*   **Distribution Shift:** Non-uniform data directly contributes to generalization errors in new situations.
*   **Opacity:** Models operate as opaque "black boxes."
*   **XAI Limitations:** Current Explainable AI (XAI) approaches fail to meet expectations for these architectures.
*   **Alignment Risks:** Alignment interventions intended to correct behavior can introduce new biases.

### Operational Requirements for TA
For Scientific TA workflows, the following output characteristics are mandated:
*   Understandable
*   Traceable
*   Controllable
*   Coherent
*   Non-discriminatory
*   Accompanied by disclosed sources
