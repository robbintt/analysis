> ### 📋 Executive Summary
>
> This research addresses the critical challenge of learning effective policies for complex, long-horizon tasks in embodied AI systems, such as robotic manipulation and autonomous driving. Traditional reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to maintain coherence over extended temporal horizons, failing to effectively manage long-range dependencies within high-dimensional, multi-modal observations.
>
> The core innovation is the **"Wavelet Policy"** framework, which integrates learnable multi-scale wavelet decomposition into reinforcement learning architectures using **"lifting schemes."** Implemented within a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework, the architecture performs multi-resolution analysis on input signals. By isolating low-frequency signals (global context) from high-frequency signals (fine-grained details), the lifting scheme enables the agent to process complex temporal data efficiently.
>
> The significance of this work lies in establishing a new paradigm that bridges signal processing and deep reinforcement learning. It provides a versatile architecture that enhances the capability of AI agents to operate reliably over long periods, validating its efficacy through rigorous benchmarking against Transformer and LSTM baselines.
