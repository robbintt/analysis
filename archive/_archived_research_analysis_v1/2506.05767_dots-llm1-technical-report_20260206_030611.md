## Executive Summary

The research addresses the escalating computational costs and resource demands associated with training state-of-the-art dense Large Language Models (LLMs). As the parameter count of dense models increases to achieve higher performance, the financial and infrastructure requirements for both training and inference become prohibitively expensive, creating a barrier to accessibility. Additionally, current scaling laws often necessitate massive datasets, leading many practitioners to rely on synthetic data generation—a practice that can introduce quality and stability issues. This paper investigates how to maintain high-performance capabilities while drastically reducing computational overhead and eliminating the reliance on synthetic data.

The authors introduce **`dots.llm1`**, a large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture designed to decouple total parameter count from active computational load. The model comprises 142B total parameters but utilizes sparse activation, engaging only 14B parameters per token through a system of 128 routed experts and 2 shared experts with Top-6 routing. To ensure training stability without the typical overhead of auxiliary loss, the team implemented a load balancing strategy using dynamic bias terms and FP32 precision for routing. Furthermore, the methodology emphasizes data purity via a rigorous three-stage processing pipeline that curates 11.2 trillion high-quality tokens (balanced between Chinese and English) while strictly excluding synthetic data.

The **`dots.llm1`** model achieves performance comparable to the dense Qwen2.5-72B model, demonstrating that sparse architectures can match dense models significantly larger than their active parameter count. The custom infrastructure, featuring the Cybertron framework and optimized Grouped GEMM kernels, delivered measurable hardware efficiency gains; tests on H800 GPUs showed an average forward computation speed-up of **14.00%** (peaking at 24.68%) and a backward computation improvement of **6.68%** compared to Transformer Engine 2.1. Training dynamics were robust, with zero token drops reported, and the model maintains efficient inference capabilities capable of operating on a single node with 8 GPUs.

This work establishes a practical blueprint for efficient LLM scaling, validating that MoE architectures can replicate the capabilities of large dense models with a significantly lower computational footprint. By successfully training a high-performance model on purely natural data, the report challenges the industry consensus on the necessity of synthetic data for pretraining. Moreover, the decision to open-source intermediate training checkpoints at one-trillion-token intervals provides the research community with a unique resource for studying learning dynamics and model evolution, potentially accelerating future advancements in efficient AI architecture.
