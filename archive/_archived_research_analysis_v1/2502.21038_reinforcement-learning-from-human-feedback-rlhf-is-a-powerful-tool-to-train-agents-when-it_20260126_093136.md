## Executive Summary

Current Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) frameworks are fundamentally limited by their reliance on isolated, homogeneous feedback modalities. Practitioners typically restrict inputs to simple scalar ratings or pairwise comparisons, disregarding the richer spectrum of natural human signals—such as demonstrations, corrections, and descriptive preferences—that annotators provide intuitively. This lack of a unified methodology to integrate heterogeneous data types constrains data efficiency, limits training robustness, and forces researchers to discard valuable interactive information.

This research introduces a generalized **joint-reward modeling framework** that unifies six distinct classes of human feedback into a single training pipeline. The core technical advancement is a unified noise modeling strategy that applies a **Truncated Gaussian distribution**, controlled by a coefficient $\beta$, to the underlying reward distribution; this mathematically standardizes noise handling across all modalities.

To support training at scale, the authors developed a sophisticated **synthetic feedback generation pipeline** utilizing 20 checkpoints from four diverse expert models. The study establishes significant benchmarks in data synthesis configuration, successfully aggregating signals from distinct expert models while enforcing distribution consistency via calibration sets. This work shifts the paradigm of RLHF from single-modality optimization to a flexible, multi-modal architecture that mirrors the way humans naturally provide oversight.

2.  **F2 (Comparative):** Pairwise comparisons.
3.  **F3 (Demonstrative):** Agent demonstrations.
4.  **F4 (Corrective):** Intervention-based corrections.
5.  **F5 (Descriptive):** Natural language descriptions.
6.  **F6 (Descriptive Preferences):** Preferences based on descriptions.

### Synthetic Feedback Generation Pipeline
*   **Source Data:** 20 checkpoints derived from 4 distinct expert models.
*   **Processing Techniques:**
    *   **F1 (Rating):** Uses **equal-width binning**.
    *   **F2 (Comparative):** Employs **reward difference exclusion**.
    *   **F5 (Descriptive):** Utilizes **mini-batch k-means clustering**.
*   **Calibration:** A specific calibration set is used for rating bins to maintain distribution consistency.
