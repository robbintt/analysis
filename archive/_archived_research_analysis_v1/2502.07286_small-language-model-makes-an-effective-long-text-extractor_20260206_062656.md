# Small Language Model Makes an Effective Long Text Extractor
*Yelin Chen; Fanjin Zhang; Jie Tang*

> ### 📋 Executive Summary
>
> The research addresses the persistent challenge of extracting long entity spans from extended text sequences, a task where current Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods struggle. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general tasks, they often fail to accurately generate long entity spans and incur prohibitively high fine-tuning costs. Simultaneously, traditional span-based methods face computational limitations, frequently encountering Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors and excessive processing overhead when handling long inputs. This paper targets the need for a solution that maintains high extraction accuracy without requiring massive GPU memory or the computational resources associated with heavy LLMs.
>
> The authors propose **SeNER**, a lightweight, span-based NER framework designed specifically for long-context processing. The architecture’s core innovation is the **Bidirectional Sliding-window Plus-shaped Attention (BiSPA)** mechanism, which models interactions between token-pair spans simultaneously. This approach effectively eliminates the need for exhaustive enumeration of candidate spans, thereby significantly reducing redundant computations. Additionally, SeNER employs a **Bidirectional Arrow Attention Mechanism with LogN-Scaling** on the [CLS] token. This scaling stabilizes entropy across variable input lengths, allowing the model to capture information from extended sequences efficiently. The model is further optimized using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a whole word masking strategy during training.
>
> SeNER achieves state-of-the-art extraction accuracy across three long-text NER datasets while remaining GPU-memory-friendly. It demonstrates the ability to process input texts up to six times longer than previous span-based methods without encountering OOM errors. In direct comparison, SeNER significantly outperformed LLM baselines, which achieved a low F1 score of 21.87%. On the SciREX dataset, SeNER also maintained lower inference times compared to existing solutions. Sensitivity analysis further validated the design, revealing that while small window sizes limit information aggregation, BiSPA’s optimized approach avoids the focus difficulties and redundant candidate generation seen in excessively large windows.
>
> This paper is significant because it validates that high performance in long-text extraction does not require massive parameter counts or extensive computational resources. By demonstrating that small language models can outperform or match heavy LLM-based approaches, the research challenges the prevailing "bigger is better" paradigm. The introduction of SeNER offers a more accessible and efficient path for future research, proving that architectural innovations—specifically in attention mechanisms and span modeling—can effectively solve complex extraction tasks in resource-constrained environments.
