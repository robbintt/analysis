## Executive Summary

The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale necessitates the use of quantization to reduce computational costs and memory footprints. However, selecting the appropriate Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) method is currently fraught with complexity due to unpredictable tradeoffs between inference performance, energy consumption, and output quality. Furthermore, the impact of quantization is not isolated; it interacts intricately with workload characteristics, hardware architectures (e.g., NVIDIA A100 vs. H100), and system-level parallelism strategies. This lack of a holistic understanding makes capacity planning and scheduling extremely difficult, as "one-size-fits-all" solutions often fail to account for the multifaceted degradation or improvement across these critical dimensions.

To systematically address these complexities, the authors introduce **qMeter**, a fully automated online characterization framework designed for the fine-grained analysis of LLM serving stacks. qMeter integrates a Profile Coordinator, EngineHandler, Benchmarker, and GPUMonitor to automate configuration synthesis and saturation detection using binary search to determine maximum Queries Per Second (QPS). Leveraging this tool, the study performs a comprehensive, four-layered evaluation across application, workload, parallelism, and hardware levels. The benchmark covers 11 distinct PTQ methods—ranging from Weight-Only (W8A16, W4A16) to Activation Quantization (W8A8) and KV Cache Compression—deployed across Llama-2 models (7B to 70B) on NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs using TensorRT-LLM v0.19.0.

The characterization reveals that no single quantization method dominates across all metrics; rather, optimal configurations are highly sensitive to specific workload inputs and intensities. Counter-intuitively, the data shows that larger quantized models can sometimes outperform smaller full-precision models in efficiency. The study highlights distinct workload sensitivities: short outputs primarily impact Time-To-First-Token (TTFT), while long inputs degrade Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT). Regarding system scaling, activation quantization maintains effective scaling with Tensor Parallelism, whereas combining weight-only quantization with KV cache compression results in compounded overhead. Additionally, while H100 GPUs offer superior latency and scalability, A100 GPUs demonstrate higher energy efficiency at moderate loads, underscoring the necessity for hardware-aware deployment strategies.

This research provides one of the first holistic system studies jointly analyzing performance, energy, and quality in the context of LLM quantization. By releasing the qMeter framework and providing detailed empirical data, the authors offer the community a standardized tool for automated analysis and three practical optimization case studies for capacity planning and scheduling. The findings challenge current assumptions regarding quantization efficiency, proving that simplistic, single-objective optimization often leads to suboptimal system performance. This work ultimately empowers system architects and researchers to move beyond generic quantization rules toward workload-aware, multi-objective tuning for efficient LLM deployment.
