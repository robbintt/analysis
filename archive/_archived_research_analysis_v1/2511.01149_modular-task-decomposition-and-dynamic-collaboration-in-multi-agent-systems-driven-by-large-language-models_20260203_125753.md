## Executive Summary

Large Language Model (LLM)-driven systems face critical scalability hurdles when transitioning from single-agent to multi-agent architectures, primarily due to the difficulty of balancing intricate task complexity with communication overhead. Single-agent systems are often insufficient for handling multifaceted objectives, while current multi-agent approaches suffer from performance degradation caused by redundant communication, uneven resource allocation, and instability within dynamic environments. Addressing these trade-offs is essential for enabling complex, autonomous task execution that demands both high-level reasoning and efficient distributed operations.

The authors propose a novel multi-agent architecture centered on a four-step LLM-driven pipeline: semantic representation, modular decomposition, dynamic scheduling, and consistency management. The system translates natural language inputs into unified semantic representations and decomposes goals into hierarchical sub-tasks. The core technical innovation consists of a dynamic scheduling and routing protocol, which facilitates real-time collaboration and strategy adaptation based on environmental feedback, alongside a global consistency mechanism. This consistency mechanism utilizes constraint parsing to ensure coherent connections between sub-tasks and strictly balance workloads, thereby optimizing the trade-off between computational complexity and communication costs.

Experimental validation confirms that the proposed architecture achieves superior performance and robustness compared to existing methodologies. The system was rigorously evaluated across four quantitative dimensions: Task Success Rate, Decomposition Efficiency, Sub-task Coverage, and Collaboration Balance. The results demonstrate that the dynamic adjustment mechanism successfully maintains system efficiency and stability within complex environments, while the global consistency mechanism effectively mitigates the performance degradation typically caused by redundant communication or resource imbalance.

This research establishes a systematic solution for task execution in complex environments, providing a scalable blueprint for overcoming the limitations inherent in single-agent LLMs. By integrating modular decomposition with dynamic resource management, the work validates the feasibility of language-driven collaboration in multi-agent systems. The introduction of global consistency mechanisms and dynamic adaptation protocols is poised to influence future designs of autonomous agent orchestration, particularly in applications requiring adaptive strategy adjustment and rigorous resource optimization.

## Methodology

The researchers propose a multi-agent architecture driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) utilizing the following four-step process:

1.  **Semantic Representation**
    Natural language task descriptions are converted into unified semantic representations using an LLM.
2.  **Modular Decomposition**
    A modular mechanism breaks down the overall goal into multiple hierarchical sub-tasks.
3.  **Dynamic Scheduling and Routing**
    A dynamic scheduling and routing mechanism facilitates the division of labor and real-time collaboration among agents.
4.  **Consistency Management**
    A constraint parsing and global consistency mechanism is employed to ensure coherent connections between sub-tasks and to balance workloads.
