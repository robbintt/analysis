## 📑 Executive Summary

### **Problem**
This research addresses the theoretical gap surrounding Multitask Representation Learning (MRL), particularly in the context of decision processes like reinforcement learning. While deep learning has empirically demonstrated that sharing representations across multiple tasks significantly improves performance and sample efficiency, theoretical grounding has been largely limited to linear settings. This paper matters because it moves beyond these simplifying linear assumptions to investigate **non-linear** representation learning, providing the first rigorous mathematical explanation for when and why multitask learning outperforms learning tasks independently.

### **Innovation**
The key innovation is the introduction of the **Generalized Functional Upper Confidence Bound (GFUCB)** algorithm, designed to handle unknown, non-linear function classes typical in neural network architectures. Technically, the method employs a shared representation function, $\phi \in \Phi$, which maps state-action pairs to a low-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^k$, combined with task-specific linear value functions ($F = L \circ \phi$). The authors utilize a "multihead function class" to capture inter-task relationships and rely on advanced complexity metrics—including Eluder dimension, covering numbers, and Inherent Bellman Error—to manage the exploration-exploitation trade-off across $M$ simultaneous tasks without prior knowledge of the ground-truth representation.

### **Results**
The study establishes the first provably sample-efficient regret bounds for general representation function bandits and linear MDPs. Specifically, the authors achieve a regret bound for Multitask Contextual Bandits of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{MT \cdot \text{dim}_E(F)(Mk + \log N(\Phi))})$. For Multitask Episodic RL, the bound is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{MTH \cdot \text{dim}_E(F)(Mk + \log N(\Phi) + MTHI^2)})$. Crucially, these upper bounds are shown to beat the lower bounds of independent task learning, theoretically proving that sharing representations is strictly advantageous under the identified conditions. Empirical validation in online and transfer learning settings further confirms these theoretical gains in sample efficiency using neural networks.

### **Impact**
This work significantly bridges the divide between theory and practice by extending MRL analysis to non-linear representations that align with modern deep learning. By defining the specific conditions under which representation transfer is beneficial, the paper provides a robust theoretical mechanism for transfer learning in online environments. The introduction of GFUCB offers a new algorithmic tool for the community, paving the way for the development of more efficient, theoretically grounded multitask reinforcement learning systems.
