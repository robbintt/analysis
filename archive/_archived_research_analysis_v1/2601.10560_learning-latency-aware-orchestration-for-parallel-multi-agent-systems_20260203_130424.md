## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental inefficiency of current orchestration strategies in multi-agent systems, which largely rely on sequential execution assumptions. In real-world deployments where agents operate concurrently, these traditional methods introduce artificial synchronization barriers that prevent true parallelism, resulting in suboptimal wall-clock latency. The problem is critical because optimizing solely for task accuracy or total computational cost—standard metrics in existing literature—fails to capture the temporal bottlenecks inherent in parallel environments. Consequently, there is a need for a framework that shifts focus from aggregate cost to the specific dependencies that dictate the speed of execution in concurrent systems.

The authors introduce **LAMaS (Latency-Aware Multi-agent System)**, the first learning-based orchestration framework designed explicitly for parallel query-level execution. The core technical innovation is the optimization of the "critical execution path"—the longest sequence of dependent tasks—rather than total computational cost. LAMaS utilizes an "Agentic Supernet" architecture modeled as a probabilistic Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). It employs a policy network for autoregressive topology construction, using threshold-based sampling to dynamically adjust the graph's width and depth. By incorporating explicit latency supervision into the learning process and decoupling dependencies to remove synchronization barriers, LAMaS effectively separates latency optimization from computational cost.

Empirical validation demonstrates that LAMaS achieves substantial improvements in efficiency without sacrificing task quality. The framework reduces the critical execution path length by **38% to 46%** compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including sequential, cost-optimization, and static parallel methods. Furthermore, these latency gains do not compromise system capability; LAMaS maintains or improves overall task performance (accuracy) across all tested benchmarks. The results highlight that methods assuming sequential execution are significantly outperformed by LAMaS in terms of both flexibility and latency control.

This work signifies a paradigm shift in multi-agent system design, moving the optimization focus from sequential inference costs to parallel execution constraints. By proving that explicit critical path optimization is essential for efficient concurrency, the authors establish a new standard for future research in latency-sensitive agentic workflows. The release of the source code alongside the paper facilitates reproducibility and further innovation. Ultimately, LAMaS provides the architectural foundation necessary to deploy scalable, responsive multi-agent systems in real-world applications where time-efficiency is paramount.

## Methodology

The authors propose **LAMaS (Latency-Aware Multi-agent System)**, a learning-based orchestration framework designed specifically for parallel multi-agent environments. The methodology is built upon three core pillars:

1.  **Explicit Latency Supervision:** Incorporating direct latency signals into the learning process, moving away from implicit sequential execution assumptions.
2.  **Parallel Processing:** Enabling true parallel processing capabilities rather than forcing concurrent tasks into sequential queues.
3.  **Topology Graph Construction:** Designing execution topology graphs specifically engineered to minimize the critical execution path, thereby reducing wall-clock time.
