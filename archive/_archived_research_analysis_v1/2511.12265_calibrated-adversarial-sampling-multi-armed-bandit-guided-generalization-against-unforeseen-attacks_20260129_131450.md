## Executive Summary

Current Adversarial Training (AT) frameworks face a critical limitation: they rely heavily on specific, known attack sets during training, rendering Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) vulnerable to unforeseen adversarial perturbations and corruptions encountered in deployment. This specificity necessitates a difficult trade-off, where improving robustness against known attacks often results in significant degradation of clean accuracy.

The authors propose **Calibrated Adversarial Sampling (CAS)**, an efficient fine-tuning technique grounded in a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) optimization framework. Unlike static approaches, CAS dynamically samples and calibrates adversarial examples by optimizing a reward function that balances exploration (testing diverse attack types) and exploitation (refining defenses against known weaknesses). Technically, the method utilizes a sampling probability distribution proportional to $w_v \cdot \exp(\alpha \cdot R_v)$ to manage the interdependence of various robustness dimensions, reaching an "externality-aware equilibrium." The paper provides theoretical guarantees for this approach, establishing a safe parameter-drift threshold and proving convergence to an optimal parameter configuration using the Robbins-Siegmund Almost Supermartingale Theorem.

Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that CAS effectively mitigates the accuracy-robustness trade-off while defending against unseen attacks. On **CIFAR-10**, the method achieved a clean accuracy of **84.32–86.02%** and an average robustness of **50.42–51.81%**. For the more complex **CIFAR-100** dataset, CAS maintained a clean accuracy of **57.48–58.88%** with an average robustness of **27.46–28.08%**. Additionally, on the **SVHN** dataset, the model reported a clean accuracy of **92.98–94.03%** and an average robustness of **57.17–57.90%**.

This research represents a paradigm shift in DNN robustness by introducing a unified framework capable of handling unforeseen attack vectors through bandit-guided generalization. By demonstrating that robustness can be positively transferred across different perturbation types (e.g., from Gabor filters to L1 attacks), CAS offers a pathway to deploying models in hostile environments where the specific nature of an attack cannot be anticipated.
