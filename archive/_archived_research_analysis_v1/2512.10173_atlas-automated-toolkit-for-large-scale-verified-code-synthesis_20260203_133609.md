## Executive Summary

Formal verification offers the gold standard for software correctness by requiring machine-checked proofs, yet it remains prohibitively difficult to automate. A primary bottleneck is the extreme scarcity of high-quality training data; unlike general programming, verified code requires rigorous specifications and proofs that are rarely available in open repositories.

This paper addresses the critical challenge of data scarcity in formal verification, aiming to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate formally verified code in languages like Dafny without relying on expensive, expert-curated datasets. The core innovation is the **ATLAS (Automated Toolkit for Large-Scale Verified Code Synthesis)** pipeline, a system that automatically converts standard Python solutions into verified Dafny programs complete with formal specifications and proofs.

Leveraging the TACO dataset of Python problems, ATLAS translates code and generates the necessary verification artifacts, which are then rigorously checked. To optimize learning, the pipeline employs task decomposition, breaking down the 2,700 synthesized verified programs into 19,000 granular training examples.

Fine-tuning the Qwen 2.5 7B Coder model on the ATLAS dataset yielded substantial performance improvements across formal verification benchmarks. On DafnyBench, accuracy improved from 32.4% to 56.9%, representing a 24.5 percentage point increase. The impact was even more significant on DafnySynthesis, where accuracy surged from 15.8% to 65.8%—a 50 percentage point gain.

This research demonstrates that synthetic data generation is a viable, scalable strategy for overcoming the data bottleneck in formal verification. By releasing the ATLAS toolkit and the resulting dataset, the authors provide the community with a reproducible method to create massive verified codebases without manual expert intervention.
