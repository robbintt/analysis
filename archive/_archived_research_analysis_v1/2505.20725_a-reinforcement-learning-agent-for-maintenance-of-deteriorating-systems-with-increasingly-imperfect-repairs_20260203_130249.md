## Executive Summary

This research addresses the optimization of maintenance strategies for deteriorating systems subject to "increasingly imperfect repairs," a specific type of aging where repair effectiveness diminishes cumulatively with each intervention. This creates a non-stationary stochastic environment where the system’s physical properties evolve over time, rendering traditional maintenance models that rely on fixed preventive thresholds or perfect repair assumptions ineffective. The challenge lies in managing the continuous degradation process (modeled as a gamma process) without manual intervention, a critical requirement for Industry 4.0 applications that demand automated, adaptive decision-making frameworks capable of handling dynamic system states.

The key innovation is the development of a **Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)** reinforcement learning agent designed to handle continuous state spaces without relying on predefined thresholds. Technically, the authors define the state vector as $s_t = [X_t, N_t]$, where $X_t$ represents the current continuous degradation level and $N_t$ represents the cumulative number of repairs performed. This formulation allows a neural network function approximator to map the continuous degradation state to optimal maintenance actions. The architecture utilizes the DDQN mechanism to decouple target action selection from evaluation, effectively mitigating the overestimation bias common in standard Q-learning. This allows the agent to navigate the non-stationary transition functions inherent in the model and learn a dynamic policy that adapts to the system's specific aging profile.

Evaluating the agent using long-run maintenance cost as the primary metric, the study demonstrates that the DDQN approach achieves substantial economic benefits over standard benchmarks. Specifically, the agent realized a cost reduction of approximately **14.5%** compared to the traditional "Limit Policy" (a fixed-threshold preventive strategy) and significantly outperformed corrective-only maintenance strategies. The agent exhibited high convergence speed and stability, successfully identifying optimal intervention thresholds that dynamically adjusted to the system's degradation history. These results confirm that the DDQN agent can effectively minimize operational costs in complex, continuous environments without human tuning of intervention parameters.

This work advances the field of maintenance engineering by bridging the gap between theoretical reinforcement learning models and the physical realities of non-stationary system aging. By successfully applying deep RL to a framework that accounts for the diminishing returns of repairs, the authors provide a realistic, automated tool for asset management that eliminates reliance on expert heuristics. The ability to optimize maintenance without predefined thresholds offers a scalable, flexible solution for Industry 4.0, enabling more responsive and cost-effective operations. This research sets a precedent for utilizing advanced machine learning architectures to solve complex reliability problems where system dynamics evolve over time.
