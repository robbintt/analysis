## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical limitation of **"visual blindness"** in text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) when applied to Visual Question Answering (VQA). While LLMs demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities in textual domains, they frequently fail to process fine-grained visual content necessary for complex, multi-step inference tasks. This inability prevents standard models from effectively bridging the gap between visual perception and high-level reasoning, limiting their utility in real-world multimodal applications where understanding detailed visual context is as important as processing the query itself.

The key innovation is the **SQ-InstructBLIP framework**, a transparent, instruction-tuned architecture designed to augment LLMs with intrinsic visual reasoning capabilities. The framework employs a self-questioning mechanism utilizing three distinct components—**Questioner**, **Answerer**, and **Reasoner**—that share the same underlying InstructBLIP architecture. The system operates through an iterative decomposition strategy (typically 2-3 cycles), generating "image-aware" sub-questions and answers conditioned on specific visual features.

**Performance Highlights:**
*   **A-OKVQA:** 59.8% accuracy (Substantial improvement over baseline InstructBLIP's 53.1%).
*   **VQAv2:** 86.2% accuracy.
*   **OK-VQA:** 62.5% accuracy.

This work significantly advances the field by providing a reproducible, open alternative to opaque black-box models, offering distinct human-readable reasoning traces that enhance explainability and reliability.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Superior VQA Performance:** The proposed SQ-InstructBLIP framework achieves more accurate reasoning on VQA tasks compared to previous methodologies by leveraging generated sub-questions as additional information.
*   **Mitigation of LLM Limitations:** The framework successfully addresses the inability of text-based LLMs to process fine-grained visual content by generating "image-aware" sub-questions and answers.
*   **Iterative Reasoning Efficacy:** The study confirms that an iterative process of generating sub-questions and sub-answers significantly assists in inferring answers to complex, multi-step main questions.
*   **Reproducibility and Transparency:** Unlike approaches relying on black-box LLMs, the proposed method offers an accessible internal mechanism that facilitates better reproducibility.

## 🧠 Methodology

The research utilizes the **SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP framework**. This architecture augments a standard Large Language Model (LLM) with visual capabilities through a structured, iterative process.
*   **Architecture:** Three distinct components—**Questioner**, **Answerer**, and **Reasoner**—share the same underlying InstructBLIP architecture.
*   **Process Workflow:**
    1.  **Decomposition:** The Questioner generates image-aware sub-questions based on the main query and visual input.
    2.  **Information Retrieval:** The Answerer provides sub-answers to these generated questions.
    3.  **Iteration:** Steps 1 and 2 repeat to gather granular details.
    4.  **Synthesis:** The Reasoner compiles the intermediate sub-questions and sub-answers to perform final reasoning and generate the answer to the main question.
