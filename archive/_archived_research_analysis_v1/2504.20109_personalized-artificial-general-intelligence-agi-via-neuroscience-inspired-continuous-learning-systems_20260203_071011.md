> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> This paper addresses the fundamental incompatibility between current deep learning paradigms, which rely on massive parameter scaling, and the severe resource constraints of edge devices required for Personalized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It identifies that brute-force scaling fails to resolve the stability-plasticity dilemma—specifically "catastrophic forgetting," where new training overwrites existing knowledge—making continuous learning impossible on consumer hardware. This creates a critical barrier where the computational costs of cloud-centric retraining and the memory limitations of on-device processing prevent the deployment of intelligent agents that must adapt dynamically to real-world environments.
>
> The authors propose a Neuroscience-Inspired Continuous Learning framework, developed through a methodology involving a comprehensive literature review of 39 sources, the translation of biological mechanisms into computational concepts, and rigorous scenario modeling. The core technical innovation is a modular "Fast-and-Slow Learning" architecture that decouples rapid adaptation from long-term stability: a Fast Learning Module processes short-term information assimilation, while a Slow Learning Module consolidates knowledge over time. To ensure viability on resource-limited hardware, the system integrates Synaptic Pruning to dynamically optimize network structure and reduce computational footprint, alongside Hebbian Plasticity to enable local weight updates, thereby eliminating the dependency on energy-intensive global backpropagation.
>
> The study validates through architectural analysis and scenario modeling that the integration of fast-and-slow modules with synaptic optimization successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting without external parameter scaling. The theoretical results demonstrate that this approach achieves memory-efficient updates, confirming that on-device knowledge consolidation is computationally viable within the constraints of standard consumer hardware. By bypassing the need for latency-heavy cloud retraining, the framework provides a theoretical proof-of-concept that edge-deployed AGI can maintain memory stability and adaptability simultaneously.
>
> This work shifts the research focus from brute-force parameter scaling to biologically plausible, efficient architectures, establishing a foundational blueprint for future edge AI systems. By providing a concrete implementation roadmap that merges neuroscience principles with computational constraints, the paper offers a viable path for intelligent agents to operate autonomously on-device. This approach eliminates the privacy and latency costs associated with cloud-centric training, defining a new direction for sustainable, scalable artificial intelligence capable of continuous, personalized learning.
