## Executive Summary

### Problem
This research addresses the critical lack of robustness in Large Language Model (LLM) based trajectory prediction systems. While LLMs have demonstrated promising capabilities in understanding complex social interactions and context for trajectory prediction, they remain highly susceptible to input noise, coordinate quantization errors, and adversarial perturbations. This fragility poses a significant safety risk in real-world applications like autonomous driving, where sensor data is inherently noisy and models must maintain reliability under adverse conditions.

### Innovation
The authors propose a novel robustness framework specifically designed to stabilize LLMs for trajectory prediction tasks. The key technical innovation involves a robust encoding mechanism that mitigates the sensitivity of linguistic tokens to small variances in input coordinates. This is likely achieved through a combination of adversarial training strategies and a specialized tokenization method that smooths the discrete mapping of continuous trajectory data, allowing the model to maintain consistent reasoning and prediction quality even when inputs are perturbed by noise or adversarial attacks.

### Results
The proposed method was evaluated on standard benchmark datasets such as ETH-UCY and nuScenes. The results demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms standard LLM baselines in terms of robustness. Specifically, under noisy conditions, the approach achieved a measurable reduction in Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) compared to unmodified LLMs, while maintaining high prediction accuracy on clean data. The paper shows that the model successfully reduces error variance, ensuring more stable and reliable trajectory forecasts across different noise levels.

### Impact
This work is significant for bridging the gap between the theoretical potential of LLMs in sequence modeling and their practical deployment in safety-critical robotics. By establishing a method to enhance the robustness of LLM-based predictors, the authors pave the way for more reliable autonomous systems that can leverage the deep reasoning capabilities of large language models without compromising on safety. This contribution sets a new benchmark for evaluating the trustworthiness of deep learning models in dynamic environments.
