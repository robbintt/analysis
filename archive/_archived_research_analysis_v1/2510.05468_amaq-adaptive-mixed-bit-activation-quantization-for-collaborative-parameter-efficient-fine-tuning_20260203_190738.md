## Executive Summary

The research addresses the critical communication bottleneck and computational overhead inherent in Collaborative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Large Language Models (LLMs). In split-learning architectures, where low-resource clients and a central server collaboratively train models, the transmission of high-precision activations and gradients consumes excessive bandwidth and introduces latency. While quantization can reduce this payload, existing methods face a dilemma: fixed-precision approaches fail to account for the varying importance of different features, while aggressive ultra-low bit quantization (3–4 bits) often leads to training instability and representation collapse, severely degrading model performance.

The paper introduces **Adaptive Mixed-bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ)**, a novel technique that dynamically assigns bit-widths based on the relative importance of specific features and layers rather than applying a static compression rate. Technically, AMAQ employs trainable gating parameters optimized independently to regulate precision, utilizing a bit-width calculation defined as `min + (max - min) × σ(α · Q)`. This allows the system to allocate higher precision (6–8 bits) to critical channels and lower precision (3–4 bits) to less significant ones. To maintain stability during this aggressive compression, the authors implement a progressive compression schedule and a composite loss function that combines standard Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) loss with an $L_2$ regularization term on bit usage, alongside a clipping strategy for activation means to prevent representation collapse.

Evaluations on large-scale models, specifically LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B, demonstrate that AMAQ significantly outperforms fixed-precision baselines. Under identical bit budget constraints, the method achieved approximately **2.5% higher generation accuracy** and **1.3% better classification accuracy**. Crucially, AMAQ successfully compresses activations and gradients from 6–8 bits down to 3–4 bits without incurring the performance degradation typically associated with such low precision. Furthermore, the study confirmed that the approach effectively mitigates ultra-low bit representation collapse, resulting in enhanced training stability while maintaining manageable communication overhead in multi-machine setups.

## Key Findings

*   **Performance Superiority:** Under identical bit budgets, AMAQ delivers approximately **2.5% higher generation accuracy** and **1.3% better classification accuracy** on models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B compared to fixed-precision approaches.
*   **Training Stability:** The method significantly enhances training stability and effectively mitigates ultra-low bit representation collapse.

## Methodology

The researchers implemented **Parameter-efficient Split Learning** to facilitate collaborative training on low-resource devices. Within this framework, they introduced Adaptive Mixed-bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ).

The methodology utilizes a **progressive compression strategy**, reducing activations and gradients from high precision (6–8 bits) to low precision (3–4 bits). Crucially, AMAQ employs **bit regularization** to dynamically allocate bit budgets across channels based on the calculated importance of specific features and layers.

## Technical Details

*   **Core Mechanism:** AMAQ dynamically allocates higher precision (6–8 bits) to critical features and lower precision (3–4 bits) to less important ones using a gradual quantization schedule.
*   **Gating Parameters ($Q$):** Introduces trainable parameters shaped $1 \times H$ or $1 \times \text{max\_seqLen}$, which are optimized independently.
*   **Bit-width Calculation:**
    $$ \text{min} + (\text{max} - \text{min}) \times \sigma(\alpha \cdot Q) $$
    *Utilizes the Straight Through Estimator (STE) for gradient flow.*
*   **Loss Function:** The total loss combines QAT loss with a regularization term ($L_2$ norm) on the gating parameters:
    $$ \text{Loss} = \text{QAT\_Loss} + \beta \times \text{Bits\_Loss} $$
*   **Stability Strategy:** A clipping strategy is applied to the mean of activations to prevent collapse.
