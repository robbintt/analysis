## Executive Summary

Traditional machine learning models are increasingly impractical for urgent or rapidly evolving scenarios because they rely on vast datasets that are time-consuming and expensive to collect. This paper addresses the critical challenge of data scarcity, emphasizing **Few-Shot Learning (FSL)** as a solution for developing automated tools with minimal training samples.

Crucially, the survey highlights that FSL is not a monolithic solution; its effectiveness varies significantly depending on data modality. This necessitates a domain-specific examination to understand the distinct challenges and strengths inherent in audio, image, text, and multimodal applications.

The core innovation of this work is a comprehensive, cross-domain survey that systematically categorizes existing FSL literature based on data modality. Rather than listing algorithms in isolation, the authors evaluate a spectrum of architectures—specifically within the context of audio, image, and text domains.

**Key Takeaways from the Analysis:**

*   **Efficiency Disparities:** Standard Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is identified as the least efficient approach, with latencies reaching up to 120 seconds due to high computational costs.
*   **Practical Recommendations:** Transfer Learning is highlighted as the most efficient approach for end-users, followed by Dynamic Few-Shot Learning (DFSL).
*   **Domain Bottlenecks:** Data labeling in the audio domain is noted as a severe bottleneck due to labor intensity.

This research offers significant value by bridging the gap between theoretical FSL capabilities and practical application requirements, guiding researchers in selecting methodologies based on specific domain constraints.
