## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses a significant gap in multimodal learning by focusing on the underexplored speech-vision domain. Current research predominantly emphasizes text-vision integration, while existing audio-visual approaches rely on cascaded pipelines that convert speech to text before processing, introducing latency and discarding valuable paralinguistic information such as prosody and emotion.

The authors propose **SViQA**, a unified end-to-end tri-modal model built on the TinyLLaVA framework with a Phi-2 LLM. SViQA's core innovation is its direct audio processing architecture that bypasses ASR entirely by employing a frozen Whisper encoder. It introduces a two-stage temporal-speech adapter to aggregate audio frames and align them with visual features, achieving remarkable parameter efficiency by training only 2.84% of parameters.

SViQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SBVQA benchmark with **75.62% accuracy** using pure speech input, which improved to **78.85%** with mixed speech-text input. The model demonstrated competitive capabilities across additional datasets, maintained high speech recognition accuracy (93.7%), and operated with low latency. This work significantly advances speech-vision multimodal learning by demonstrating that high-performance visual understanding can be achieved through direct speech processing rather than text conversion.
