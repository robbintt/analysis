## Executive Summary

Large Language Models (LLMs) typically excel at capturing statistical correlations within text but lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics and causal reasoning. This deficiency limits their ability to perform zero-shot physical reasoning—predicting the outcomes of hypothetical interactions or interventions in the physical world without specific training examples. Addressing this gap is critical for developing reliable AI systems that can operate effectively in real-world environments where understanding cause-and-effect relationships is as important as processing linguistic patterns.

The paper introduces the **Causal World Model Induction (CWMI) framework**, designed to embed an explicit causal physics model directly within an LLM. The architecture centers on a **Causal Physics Module (CPM)**, which functions as a latent-space physics engine connected to the language model via a projection layer. Technically, the model is trained end-to-end using a novel "Causal Intervention Loss" ($L_{causal}$). This loss function forces the model to predict the results of hypothetical interventions using multimodal data, thereby shifting the learning objective from simple statistical pattern matching to the mastery of structured cause-and-effect relationships.

Evaluations conducted on the established PIQA benchmark and the newly introduced PhysiCa-Bench dataset yielded quantifiable improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. On the PIQA benchmark, the CWMI framework achieved a **Reasoning Accuracy of 82.5%**, surpassing the baseline by a margin of **7.3%**. In the more complex PhysiCa-Bench evaluations, the model demonstrated a **Causal Consistency Score (CCS) of 0.89**, significantly outperforming standard LLMs which averaged below 0.65. Additionally, the model improved Future State Prediction Accuracy (FSPA/MSE) by **24%**, confirming its superior capability in predicting physical states and maintaining causal consistency.

This research validates the hypothesis that inducing causal world models is a fundamental requirement for building generalizable and reliable AI systems. By successfully demonstrating that LLMs can overcome their inherent lack of intuitive physics through explicit architectural embedding, the work provides a blueprint for future advancements in physically grounded AI.
