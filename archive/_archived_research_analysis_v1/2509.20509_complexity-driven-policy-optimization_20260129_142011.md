## Executive Summary

Standard reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), typically rely on entropy regularization to facilitate exploration. However, this approach faces a fundamental limitation: maximizing entropy often corresponds to maximizing disorder, resulting in unstructured, uniform random noise rather than the efficient discovery of novel strategies. Furthermore, agents utilizing standard entropy regularization are notoriously brittle, with performance that is acutely sensitive to the specific value of the entropy coefficient. This fragility forces practitioners to engage in extensive, computationally expensive hyperparameter tuning to prevent the agent from either converging prematurely to suboptimal deterministic policies or engaging in ineffective random behavior.

To address these issues, the authors introduce **Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO)**, a novel algorithm derived from PPO that substitutes the standard entropy bonus with a "complexity" regularizer. Technically, this complexity is defined using the López-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet (LMC) measure, calculated as the product of Shannon entropy and "disequilibrium"—where disequilibrium quantifies the statistical distance (Kullback-Leibler divergence) of the policy from a uniform distribution. By integrating this complexity term into the loss function ($L_t(\theta)$), CDPO drives the policy toward the "**edge of chaos**," a dynamic regime that balances stochasticity with structural organization.

Empirical evaluation on discrete action space benchmarks demonstrates that CDPO provides substantial performance gains and robustness. In the `Four Rooms` navigation task, CDPO achieved a perfect normalized return of 1.0 (100% success rate), whereas standard PPO frequently failed to converge. In Atari `Boxing`, CDPO outperformed PPO, achieving final scores approximately 2 to 3 times higher than the baseline. Crucially, sensitivity analysis revealed a stark difference in stability: while PPO’s performance collapsed when the regularization coefficient deviated slightly from the optimal narrow range, CDPO maintained high, stable performance across a wide sweep of coefficient magnitudes (spanning orders of magnitude).

## Key Findings

*   **Structured vs. Unstructured Exploration:** Maximizing entropy leads to unstructured, uniform random exploration. The proposed "complexity" measure effectively balances stochasticity with structural organization, avoiding inefficient noise.
*   **Balanced Behavioral Regimes:** The complexity regularizer successfully suppresses both extremes of behavior—maximal disorder and complete order—encouraging the development of useful, non-trivial, and adaptable strategies.
*   **Hyperparameter Robustness:** The CDPO algorithm demonstrates significantly higher robustness to the choice of its regularization coefficient compared to the standard PPO's sensitivity to the entropy coefficient.
*   **Performance in Discrete Action Spaces:** In discrete action space environments requiring extensive exploration, CDPO outperforms standard entropy-based approaches by avoiding inefficient uniform random exploration.

## Methodology

The authors introduce **Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO)**, an algorithm derived from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The core methodological innovation is the substitution of the standard entropy bonus with a **complexity bonus** used as a regularizer.

**Theoretical Foundation:**
The complexity is mathematically defined as the product of two components:
1.  **Shannon Entropy:** Measures the uncertainty or randomness of the policy.
2.  **Disequilibrium:** Quantifies the policy's distance from a uniform distribution.

By maximizing this product, the algorithm guides agents toward policies that maintain a balance between randomness and structural order, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of pure entropy maximization (which leads to uniform noise) and pure determinism.

## Technical Details

**Base Architecture:**
CDPO is built upon the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework but replaces the standard entropy bonus with a complexity regularizer based on the **LMC complexity measure**.

**The Objective Function:**
The loss function is defined as:

$$L_t(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t [L^{CLIP}_t(\theta) - c_{vf} L^{VF}_t(\theta) + c_{reg} C[\pi_\theta](s_t)]$$

Where:
*   $L^{CLIP}_t(\theta)$ is the PPO clipped surrogate objective.
*   $L^{VF}_t(\theta)$ is the value function loss.
*   $c_{reg} C[\pi_\theta](s_t)$ is the novel complexity regularization term.

**Optimization Target:**
By maximizing complexity, the algorithm targets the 'edge of chaos'. This strategic objective prevents the policy from becoming too deterministic (which halts exploration) or too uniformly random ( which makes exploration unstructured).
