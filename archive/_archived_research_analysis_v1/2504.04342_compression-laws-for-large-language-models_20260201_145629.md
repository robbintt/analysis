## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical challenge of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments where the high memory and computational demands of state-of-the-art models are prohibitive. While model compression (reducing model size) is a standard remedy, the field lacks precise, predictive laws governing how different compression ratios affect complex performance metrics. The authors aim to bridge this gap by establishing a theoretical framework that defines the relationship between compression intensity and model degradation, moving beyond heuristic trial-and-error approaches to a more deterministic understanding of the efficiency-capability trade-off.

The study introduces **"compression laws"** as a formal counterpart to neural scaling laws, providing a quantitative framework to predict post-compression behavior. Technically, the research is grounded in a large-scale empirical analysis of over 1,000 experiments across eight pre-trained models (0.5B to 14B parameters), utilizing the Qwen2.5 family for granular analysis. The authors apply structured weight modification followed by recovery fine-tuning, uncovering a crucial divergence in degradation patterns: test cross-entropy loss increases quadratically with the compression ratio, while performance on downstream reasoning and language understanding tasks declines only linearly.

The empirical outcomes highlight the essential role of recovery fine-tuning, which was shown to recover up to 55% of the test cross-entropy loss and significantly enhance generation quality. In terms of inference efficiency, models compressed at high ratios (up to 90%) achieved a 60% increase in inference speed compared to uncompressed baselines. However, the study found that speed gains are non-uniform across model scales; smaller models ($\le$ 7B parameters) saw speed improvements capped at approximately 35%, while larger models benefited much more substantially. These performance trade-offs were validated across multiple benchmarks, including ARC-c, PIQA, Winogrande, and MMLU.

## Key Findings

*   **Divergent Performance Degradation:** The study reveals a distinct split in how compression affects metrics: test cross-entropy loss increases **quadratically** with the compression ratio, whereas performance on downstream tasks declines only **linearly**.
*   **Efficacy of Recovery Fine-tuning:** Recovery fine-tuning is identified as a critical step for compressed models, capable of improving test loss by **up to 55%** and significantly enhancing generation quality.
*   **Speed vs. Compression Ratio:** At high compression ratios (up to 90%), compressed models achieve a **60% increase** in inference speed compared to uncompressed models, helping to compensate for performance degradation.
*   **Model Size Dependency:** Computational gains are not uniform across sizes. Smaller models (<= 7B) show limited speed improvements (peaking at 35%), while larger models benefit significantly more from compression.
