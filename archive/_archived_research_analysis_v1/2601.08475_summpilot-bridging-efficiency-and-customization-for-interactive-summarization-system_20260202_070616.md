## Executive Summary

This research addresses the persistent trade-off between **computational efficiency** and **user-centric customization** in automatic text summarization.

While standard automated systems offer speed, they frequently fail to align with specific user intents or contextual requirements. Conversely, achieving high levels of personalization often necessitates complex interactions that can undermine efficiency.

**The Solution:** The paper introduces **SummPilot**, a novel system architecture driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) that facilitates a hybrid workflow. It combines fully automatic generation with interactive customization.
*   **Technical Approach:** The system utilizes an LLM backbone to produce initial summaries efficiently, then introduces three distinct interactive tools:
    *   **Semantic Graphs:** For visualizing content relationships.
    *   **Entity Clustering:** For organizing structural information.
    *   **Explainable Evaluation:** For providing transparency and feedback.
*   **Outcome:** By leveraging these components, SummPilot allows users to visualize data structures and actively guide the refinement process, effectively bridging the gap between static algorithmic output and dynamic user requirements.
*   **Validation:** Validated through live demonstrations and user studies, the system confirmed high adaptability in real-world scenarios. *Note: Specific quantitative metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, latency) are absent, focusing instead on qualitative utility.*

## Key Findings

*   **Efficiency & Customization:** SummPilot successfully integrates computational efficiency with user-centric customization, solving the "one-size-fits-all" limitation of traditional summarizers.
*   **LLM Integration:** The utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables seamless support for both fully automatic and interactive summarization workflows.
*   **Interactive Components:**
    *   **Semantic Graphs** enable users to visualize document flow.
    *   **Entity Clustering** helps in structural analysis.
    *   **Explainable Evaluation** offers transparency in how summaries are generated.
*   **User Empowerment:** These tools allow users to effectively understand document content and personalize outputs based on specific interests.
*   **Real-World Viability:** Empirical results from demos and user studies validate the system's adaptability and practical usefulness in real-world customizable summarization scenarios.

## Methodology

The research proposes an **interaction-based system architecture** driven by a Large Language Model (LLM) backbone. The methodology facilitates a dual-process workflow:

1.  **Automatic Generation:** The system first generates automatic summaries to ensure high efficiency and speed.
2.  **User Intervention:** It then enables user intervention for personalization. This is achieved through specific interactive components that visualize data structures, organize information, and provide transparency.

This allows users to tailor the final output to their specific interests without starting from scratch.
