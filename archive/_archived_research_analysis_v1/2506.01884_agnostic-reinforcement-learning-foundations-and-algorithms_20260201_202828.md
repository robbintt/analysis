## **Executive Summary**

This research addresses the fundamental challenge of characterizing the statistical complexity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in high-dimensional environments where the optimal policy $\pi^\star$ is not contained within the learner's policy class $\Pi$, a scenario known as **model misspecification**. Traditional RL theory relies on realizability—the assumption that the hypothesis space contains the ground truth—which rarely holds in practice. This thesis focuses on "agnostic policy learning," which aims to minimize the misspecification gap $\epsilon = V^{\pi^\star} - \max_{\pi \in \Pi} V^\pi$. Crucially, the work establishes agnostic policy learning as the "**weakest form of function approximation**," providing a foundational baseline for understanding the limits of large-scale RL applications where function approximation is necessary but imperfect.

The key innovation is a comprehensive learning-theoretic framework that characterizes agnostic policy learning across three axes: **Environment Access** (generative, online), **Coverage Conditions** (spanning, concentrability), and **Representational Conditions** (Eluder dimension, Sign Rank). Central to this work is the introduction of the "**Sunflower Property**," a novel structural condition that distinguishes between the requirements for generative and online learning. While previous work conflated these settings, this research demonstrates that efficient Online RL strictly requires the Sunflower Property in addition to standard coverage measures.

The study establishes precise statistical separations and sample complexity bounds. For Generative Models and Local Simulators, the thesis proves that Spanning Capacity $\kappa$ is both necessary and sufficient for efficient learning, achieving a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{H^4 \kappa^2}{\epsilon^2})$, extended to infinite policy classes. Conversely, the research demonstrates that adapting to Coverability is statistically intractable. A major separation result reveals that Spanning Capacity is insufficient for efficient Online RL; instead, Online RL strictly requires both Spanning Capacity and the Sunflower Property. Furthermore, Theorem 3.3 establishes a fundamental equivalence between Policy Eluder Dimension $\dim_E(\Pi)$ and Sign Rank $\operatorname{sign-rank}(\mathcal{G}_\Pi)$.

## **Methodology**

The author utilizes a rigorous learning theoretic perspective to examine the statistical complexity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) under function approximation. The methodology centers on an **'agnostic policy learning' framework** rather than relying on standard realizability assumptions.

The research systematically analyzes the problem across three distinct dimensions:
1.  **How data is collected** from the environment (Access).
2.  **The intrinsic properties** of the MDP (Coverage).
3.  **The structural assumptions** of the policy class (Representation).
