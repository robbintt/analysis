## 📋 Executive Summary

> Modern applications generate massive volumes of unstructured emotional data that exceed the processing capacity of traditional single-node environments, creating a critical bottleneck in NLP regarding the tension between scaling and accuracy. This paper introduces an empirical framework to isolate architectural constraints by directly comparing single-node configurations against distributed architectures using identical sentiment analysis models. The results validate that while distributed systems are necessary for large data volumes, they introduce significant trade-offs, revealing a measurable inverse relationship between processing performance and model accuracy compared to single-node setups. Consequently, this research shifts the focus to a holistic view of infrastructure constraints, advocating for a co-design approach to balancing scalability and precision in high-volume domains.
