## Executive Summary

**The Problem:** Deep visual perception systems in dynamic environments are highly susceptible to physical-world adversarial attacks, such as adversarial patches and 3D objects. Passive defense mechanisms (e.g., adversarial training) often fail against adaptive, evolving attacks in 3D spaces, posing severe risks in safety-critical fields like autonomous driving.

**The Solution:** The authors propose **Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD)**, a proactive framework utilizing reinforcement learning (RL). This enables agents to actively adjust their viewpoints to mitigate threats. The system employs a dual-module recurrent architecture:
*   **Perception Model:** Integrates observations with belief states.
*   **Policy Model:** Governs visual control.

**The Mechanism:** The core innovation lies in **Multi-step Objective Optimization**, balancing immediate accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, and **Uncertainty-oriented Reward Shaping**. This allows the agent to maneuver to perspectives where perturbations are occluded or ineffective, without requiring differentiable environments.

**The Impact:** Validated across 3D object classification, face recognition, and autonomous driving, Rein-EAD significantly reduces Attack Success Rates (ASR)—dropping from over 90% to below 5% in classification tasks—while preserving high accuracy on benign data. This research marks a paradigm shift from passive filtering to proactive, embodied defense.

*   **Generalization Capabilities:** The framework demonstrates strong generalization to unseen and adaptive adversarial attacks, outperforming static defense paradigms in dynamic scenarios.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** Through an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism, the method enables efficient policy updates and reduces computational overhead.
*   **Broad Applicability:** The approach is validated across diverse, safety-sensitive tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition, and autonomous driving.

## Methodology

The proposed framework centers on two core technical components designed to facilitate active defense:

1.  **Multi-step Objective Optimization**
    *   Balances immediate prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization over a temporal horizon.
    *   Explicitly integrates entropy minimization to handle scenes containing adversarial 3D objects.

2.  **Uncertainty-oriented Reward Shaping**
    *   Facilitates efficient policy updates by focusing specifically on uncertainty reduction.
    *   Removes the dependency on differentiable environments, enhancing operational feasibility.
