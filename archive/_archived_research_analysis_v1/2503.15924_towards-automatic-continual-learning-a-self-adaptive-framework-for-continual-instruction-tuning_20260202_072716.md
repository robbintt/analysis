## Executive Summary

Continual instruction tuning presents a critical challenge in deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly the need to integrate new, incrementally acquired knowledge without degrading existing capabilities or suffering from catastrophic forgetting. While existing research primarily focuses on mechanisms to retain old knowledge, this paper identifies a significant gap in optimizing the selection of new knowledge. In real-world applications, data distributions shift dynamically, and data quality varies, making manual curation unsustainable and computationally expensive. The industry lacks a framework that can autonomously manage these updates while handling the engineering complexities of deployment.

The authors introduce a self-adaptive, automated framework for continual learning that shifts the focus from retention to source data optimization. The system operates via a four-module closed-loop pipeline: Data Generation, Data Filtering, Model Tuning, and Model Evaluation. A key technical innovation is the use of a dynamic proxy model that performs three-stage filtering—including calculating Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD) scores—to eliminate redundancy and low-quality data before training. Crucially, this proxy model evolves continuously alongside the deployed model (**Self-Adaptive Alignment**), ensuring filtering criteria remain accurate as the model's state changes. The framework also incorporates system engineering features such as version rollback and automated checkpoint evaluation to facilitate seamless industrial deployment.

Validated in a complex, real-world Chinese medical scenario, the framework demonstrated superior performance over static baseline methods in managing shifting data distributions. The most significant quantitative outcome was a **66.7% reduction in computational costs**, achieved by filtering out unnecessary training samples and utilizing a smaller proxy model for quality control. Furthermore, the system achieved fully autonomous operation, successfully generating synthetic instruction-response pairs via Chain-of-Thought prompting and executing continuous updates and evaluations without human intervention while maintaining high model performance.

This work bridges the gap between theoretical continual learning algorithms and practical system engineering, offering a viable solution for the automated lifecycle management of LLMs. By prioritizing the optimization of new knowledge selection, the framework provides a scalable blueprint for reducing operational expenditures in high-stakes environments. The successful deployment in the medical field demonstrates the robustness of self-adaptive architectures, suggesting that similar automated pipelines could become industry standards for maintaining model performance in dynamic production environments.
