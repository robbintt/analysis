## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
Current voice assistants are fundamentally limited to single-turn, passive command-response interactions, failing to bridge the gap toward autonomous, multi-step task execution. This paper addresses the critical inability of existing systems to perform cognitive reasoning required for decomposing complex user goals and interacting with external software tools. The core challenge lies in maintaining context and functional accuracy when transitioning from spoken language understanding to practical, action-oriented automation. Specifically, the fragility of current systems becomes apparent when Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) errors propagate into downstream logic, causing agents to fail at tasks that require robust interpretation of ambiguous or noisy audio inputs.

### **Innovation**
The authors introduce **"AURA"** (Agent for Understanding, Reasoning, and Automated Tool Use), a comprehensive voice agent framework and a novel benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented voice interactions. Technically, AURA utilizes a modular architecture that integrates OpenAI Whisper for ASR with Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning—leveraging both **GPT-4o** and **Llama-3**—to convert speech to text, infer user intent, and generate step-by-step execution plans. The system interfaces with external APIs to complete tasks across eight distinct domains: **Music, Weather, Alarm, Calendar, Messaging, Email, Reminders, and Smart Home**. The benchmark comprises 880 audio samples and contrasts AURA's specialized reasoning pipeline against a "traditional baseline pipeline," defined as a standard cascaded approach where raw ASR output is fed directly to an LLM without the benefit of AURA's dedicated error recovery or planning modules.

### **Results**
Experimental results indicate that while AURA significantly outperforms standard methods, the task of autonomous voice agency remains a substantial challenge.
*   **GPT-4o Backbone:** Achieved a **Task Success Rate (TSR) of 50.2%**, a marked improvement over the baseline's 15.3%, yet highlighting that nearly half of complex multi-step tasks still fail.
*   **Llama-3-8B Backbone:** Achieved a **TSR of 35.5%**, demonstrating that while smaller open-source models outperform the baseline, they still lag behind proprietary frontier models in complex reasoning scenarios.
*   **Robustness:** The reasoning component successfully recovered from approximately **17.8% of ASR errors**, correcting misinterpreted audio tokens through contextual logic rather than failing outright.

### **Impact**
The significance of this work lies in establishing the first rigorous benchmark for **"Agentic AI"** in voice interfaces, shifting the research focus from simple speech recognition accuracy to complex task automation. By quantifying the performance gap between text-based and voice-based agents, AURA provides a new standard for evaluating spoken dialogue systems. These findings expose the limitations of current state-of-the-art models in handling voice-specific noise and suggest that future research in human-computer interaction must prioritize robust reasoning architectures that can mitigate the inherent unreliability of ASR to enable truly proactive voice agents.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Performance Leap:** The AURA framework improves Task Success Rates by more than 3x compared to traditional cascaded baselines (50.2% vs 15.3%).
*   **Benchmark Establishment:** Introduces the first rigorous benchmark for "Agentic AI" specifically designed for voice interactions across 8 distinct domains.
*   **ASR Error Recovery:** The system demonstrates the ability to self-correct; the reasoning module successfully recovered from **17.8%** of errors introduced by the ASR component.
*   **Model Disparity:** Proprietary models (GPT-4o) significantly outperform open-source alternatives (Llama-3-8B) in this complex reasoning context (50.2% vs 35.5% TSR).
*   **Persistent Challenges:** Despite improvements, roughly half of all complex multi-step voice tasks still fail, indicating substantial room for future development in autonomous voice agency.
