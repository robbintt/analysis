## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical bottleneck in agentic AI known as the **"Manager Agent Challenge."** As individual AI agents become more capable, the difficulty of orchestrating them within complex, dynamic workflows emerges as a significant hurdle. The problem is not merely task execution, but high-level management: decomposing abstract goals, assigning tasks to heterogeneous agents (human and AI), and adapting to changing conditions in real-time.

This matters because current systems struggle to balance competing objectives—such as speed, safety, and accuracy—limiting the scalability and reliability of autonomous multi-agent systems in real-world applications.

The authors introduce the **"Autonomous Manager Agent"** as a unified architectural solution and research challenge. Technically, they formalize workflow management as a **Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG)**, defining the environment through a tuple of states, actions, observations, and rewards. This framework identifies four foundational challenges: compositional reasoning, multi-objective optimization, ad hoc team coordination, and governance.

To operationalize this, the authors developed **"MA-Gym,"** an open-source simulation framework utilizing an Orchestrator-Worker model. This architecture employs Dynamic Task Graphs for real-time dependency management and shifts the paradigm from human-in-the-loop to human-on-the-loop, relying on Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to handle the stochastic nature of the environment.

Empirical evaluations were conducted using GPT-5-based Manager Agents tested against 20 distinct workflows within the MA-Gym environment. Performance was measured across three specific metrics: **goal completion, constraint adherence, and runtime**. The results revealed that current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models face a significant performance gap; specifically, the GPT-5-based agents demonstrated an inability to jointly optimize for all three metrics simultaneously. The models consistently struggled to manage the trade-offs between competing objectives, failing to balance execution speed with the need for strict constraint adherence and successful goal completion within the dynamic POSG framework.

This paper significantly influences the field of agentic AI by defining a standardized path forward for multi-agent orchestration. By releasing MA-Gym as an open-source tool, the authors provide a reproducible benchmark for the community, enabling consistent evaluation of future manager architectures. Ultimately, this work establishes the Manager Agent not just as a software component, but as a distinct area of study.
