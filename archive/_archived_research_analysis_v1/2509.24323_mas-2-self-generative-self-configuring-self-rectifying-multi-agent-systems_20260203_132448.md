## Executive Summary

Current Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are typically bound by static, "generate-once-and-deploy" architectures. This rigidity renders them ineffective in dynamic, real-world environments where task requirements fluctuate, uncertainty is high, or underlying large language models (LLMs) are swapped. The core challenge lies in creating systems that can autonomously adapt their internal structure and resource allocation in real-time to maintain high performance without escalating computational costs.

The authors introduce **MAS²**, a recursive self-generation paradigm that shifts away from static design toward a dynamic tri-agent framework: the **Generator**, the **Implementer**, and the **Rectifier**. The Generator acts as a system architect, designing workflow templates (roles, protocols, and tools); the Implementer serves as a resource allocator, mapping these roles to specific LLM backbones; and the Rectifier functions as an online monitor that intervenes to correct failures or budget overruns.

To specialize these meta-agents, the paper proposes **Collaborative Tree Optimization (CTO)**, a training mechanism that constructs decision trees for queries and utilizes Value-Scaled Preference Learning to optimize a cost-sensitive reward function. MAS² demonstrates superior performance across seven benchmarks, achieving gains of up to **19.6%** over state-of-the-art multi-agent systems in complex scenarios. It exhibits robust cross-backbone generalization, improving performance by **15.1%** even when utilizing unseen LLMs. Crucially, the system maintains high cost-efficiency, consistently residing on the Pareto frontier to represent the optimal trade-off between performance and computational expense.

This research represents a significant paradigm shift in multi-agent system design, establishing a foundation for self-evolving AI ecosystems. By demonstrating that a MAS can effectively generate, configure, and rectify another MAS, the authors validate a move toward fully autonomous system management.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Performance Gains:** MAS² achieved performance improvements of up to **19.6%** over state-of-the-art multi-agent systems when operating in complex scenarios.
*   **Robust Generalization:** The system demonstrated strong cross-backbone generalization capabilities, delivering performance improvements of up to **15.1%** even when utilizing unseen LLMs.
*   **Cost-Efficiency:** The system consistently resides on the **Pareto frontier**, maintaining an optimal trade-off between high performance and computational cost.
*   **Adaptive Rectification:** Unlike rigid systems, MAS² successfully addresses real-world dynamism and uncertainty through its adaptive rectification mechanisms.

## Methodology

The authors propose **MAS²**, a paradigm based on recursive self-generation. This approach moves beyond static deployment by employing a specialized tri-agent team responsible for the lifecycle management of the system:

1.  **Dynamic Composition:** The system is capable of dynamically composing a target agent system tailored to specific task demands.
2.  **Adaptive Rectification:** The system modifies its configuration in real-time in response to changing task requirements.
3.  **Training Mechanism:** Collaborative Tree Optimization is utilized to specialize the meta-agents, ensuring they can effectively manage the decision-making process.

## Technical Details

### Recursive Framework Architecture
MAS² introduces a recursive framework where a Multi-Agent System generates and manages another MAS, creating a self-adapting ecosystem. The architecture relies on three distinct meta-agents:

*   **The Generator ($A_{gen}$):**
    *   **Role:** System Architect.
    *   **Function:** Creates workflow templates defining Roles, Protocols, and Tools.
*   **The Implementor ($A_{imp}$):**
    *   **Role:** Resource Allocator.
    *   **Function:** Maps specific roles defined by the Generator to appropriate LLM backbones.
*   **The Rectifier ($A_{rec}$):**
    *   **Role:** Online Monitor.
    *   **Function:** Intervenes to modify configurations if resource consumption exceeds a budget or if system failures occur.

### Training: Collaborative Tree Optimization (CTO)
The system is trained using CTO, a framework designed to optimize the meta-agents' decision-making capabilities.

*   **Decision Trees:** CTO constructs a decision tree for each specific query to guide the system's actions.
*   **Reward Function:** It optimizes a cost-sensitive reward function defined as $R(\tau) = 1/C_{norm}(\tau)$.
*   **Learning Algorithm:** Utilizes **Value-Scaled Preference Learning**, which employs a loss function that weights gradient updates by preference margin. This prioritizes high-impact decisions during the training process.

## Results

The empirical evaluation of MAS² across seven benchmarks yielded the following outcomes:

*   **Complex Scenario Performance:** A performance improvement of up to **19.6%** was observed compared to current state-of-the-art multi-agent systems.
*   **Cross-Backbone Generalization:** The system showed a **15.1%** improvement in performance when using LLMs that were not present in the training data (unseen backbones).
*   **Pareto Efficiency:** The system maintained high cost-efficiency, consistently positioning itself on the Pareto frontier.
*   **Real-World Adaptability:** The Rectifier component successfully managed real-world dynamism and uncertainty through adaptive correction mechanisms.
