## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical limitation of static Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, which typically output raw feature importance scores (such as SHAP values) that fail to provide actionable, domain-specific insights. While traditional XAI identifies *which* variables influence a model, it often struggles to translate these technical signals into practical recommendations that non-expert stakeholders can implement. This gap between technical explanation and practical utility hinders the adoption of AI in high-stakes domains like precision agriculture, where users require context-aware advice rather than abstract data.

The authors propose "Agentic XAI," a novel framework that integrates SHAP value analysis with autonomous multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a dynamic, iterative refinement process. Technically, the system employs a three-component architecture: a Random Forest model generates baseline SHAP visualizations, which are then processed by a Multimodal LLM agent. Utilizing the ReAct paradigm and Chain-of-Thought prompting, the agent functions autonomously to iteratively analyze the data, generating and executing Python code to deepen its understanding. This moves beyond simple text translation, allowing the AI to progressively refine explanations through multiple rounds of self-correcting analysis.

Evaluated in an agricultural context using rice yield data from 26 Japanese fields, the framework achieved a 30–33% average improvement in recommendation quality compared to the non-agentic baseline. Performance, as rated by both human crop scientists and LLM evaluators, peaked at rounds 3–4 of the iterative process across key metrics including Specificity, Clarity, Practicality, and Crop Science Credibility. However, the study also revealed a significant limitation: continuing refinement beyond these optimal rounds resulted in a substantial drop in quality, as the agent began to exhibit verbosity and ungrounded abstraction.

This study provides the first empirical exploration of integrating agentic AI workflows with XAI, offering vital evidence that more processing does not guarantee better results. By identifying a bias-variance trade-off in agentic explanation generation—where early iterations lack depth and late iterations introduce noise—the paper establishes the necessity of "early stopping" mechanisms (regularization) for agentic systems. These findings offer concrete design principles for building reliable AI agents, ensuring that iterative enhancement maximizes utility without drifting into hallucination or irrelevance.

## Key Findings

*   **Optimization via Iterative Refinement:** The Agentic XAI framework significantly improved recommendation quality, achieving an average score increase of **30–33%** from the baseline (Round 0), with performance peaking at Rounds 3–4.
*   **Diminishing Returns from Over-Processing:** Excessive refinement beyond the optimal rounds led to a substantial drop in recommendation quality, challenging the assumption that iterative processing yields monotonic improvement.
*   **Bias-Variance Trade-off in Explanations:** The study identified a bias-variance dynamic in agentic explanation generation, where early iterations lacked depth (bias) and excessive iterations resulted in verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance).
*   **Consensus Across Evaluators:** Both human experts (crop scientists) and LLM evaluators validated the effectiveness of the framework, scoring high on metrics such as Specificity, Clarity, Practicality, and Crop Science Credibility.
*   **Necessity of Early Stopping:** The findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is critical to maximizing the practical utility of agentic AI systems.

## Methodology

*   **Framework Architecture:** The researchers developed an "Agentic XAI" framework that integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values with multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs).
*   **Agentic Workflow:** The LLMs function as autonomous agents that perform iterative refinement on initial SHAP results, conducting additional analyses to progressively enhance explanations.
*   **Use Case:** The system was implemented as an agricultural recommendation system utilizing rice yield data collected from 26 fields in Japan.
*   **Evaluation Protocol:** The study conducted 11 rounds of refinement (Rounds 0–10). The generated explanations were assessed by two distinct groups—12 human crop scientists and 14 LLMs—using seven specific metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility.
