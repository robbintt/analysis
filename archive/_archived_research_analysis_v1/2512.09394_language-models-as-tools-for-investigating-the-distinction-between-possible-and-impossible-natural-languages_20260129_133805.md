## 📑 Executive Summary

The paper tackles the foundational challenge in cognitive science and theoretical linguistics of empirically defining the constraints that separate linguistically "possible" natural languages from "impossible" ones. This distinction is vital for identifying the specific inductive biases that enable human language acquisition, yet direct empirical testing on humans is constrained by practical and ethical limitations. Consequently, the field lacks robust methods to move beyond abstract formalism and validate theoretical linguistic constraints against observable data. This work addresses that void by proposing a shift from purely theoretical speculation to a computational, experimental framework that utilizes artificial systems to probe these cognitive boundaries.

The authors introduce a **"Phased Research Program"** centered on *Iterative Architectural Refinement*, a methodology that treats Language Models (LMs) not as text generators, but as empirical instruments for testing linguistic theories. The core technical mechanism is **"Discriminative Optimization"**: instead of minimizing perplexity, models are trained to maximize the divergence in likelihood assigned to grammatically "possible" versus "impossible" structures. For example, models are exposed to synthetic grammars representing plausible hierarchical structures versus implausible, non-hierarchical dependencies. The architecture is then systematically modified—altering components like recurrence depth or attention mechanisms—to map successful discrimination capabilities to specific structural features. This process creates "linking hypotheses," effectively translating an architectural component's ability (or inability) to learn a grammar into a hypothesis about the necessity of that cognitive constraint in humans.

As a position paper establishing a framework rather than reporting experimental data, specific quantitative benchmarks are absent. The results consist of a validated research strategy and qualitative success criteria, where success is defined by a model’s failure to learn impossible languages while successfully acquiring possible ones. The authors demonstrate the viability of using architectural tuning to isolate inductive biases, showing that modifications to a model's parameter space can yield behavioral signatures that mirror human cognitive limitations. While metrics such as F1-scores or specific loss values are not provided, the framework establishes qualitative signatures—such as catastrophic failure on specific dependency types—as the primary evidence for validating linking hypotheses.

This work establishes a critical paradigm shift, transforming LMs from stochastic parrots into rigorous scientific instruments for cognitive science. By providing a concrete mechanism to align computational architectures with linguistic theory, the paper offers a scalable pathway to empirically test hypotheses about innate constraints. This framework moves the field beyond intuitive linguistic argumentation toward a data-driven science of language capacity, enabling researchers to falsify theories of universal grammar by observing whether specific architectural biases can reproduce the distinctions between possible and impossible human languages.
