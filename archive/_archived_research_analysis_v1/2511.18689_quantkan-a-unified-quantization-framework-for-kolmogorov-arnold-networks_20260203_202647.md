## Executive Summary

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by utilizing learnable spline-based univariate functions to approximate multivariate mappings. However, the architectural complexity of KANs—specifically their reliance on spline-based layers—results in significantly higher computational costs and memory footprints compared to standard networks. This poses a substantial barrier to deploying KANs on resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, while quantization is a standard technique for mitigating these costs in deep learning, existing quantization methods are designed for linear or transformer layers and fail to account for the unique structural properties of KANs. Consequently, there has been no systematic understanding of how low-bit quantization affects the accuracy and stability of spline-based networks, creating a critical gap in the practical application of these architectures.

The authors introduce QuantKAN, the first unified framework capable of supporting both Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) for KAN architectures. The core technical innovation is "Branch-Aware Quantization," which addresses the heterogeneous nature of KANs by treating the linear Base Branch and the nonlinear Spline Branch separately. Instead of applying a uniform quantization scheme, QuantKAN deploys branch-specific quantizers to handle the distinct weight distributions of spline coefficients and base weights. The framework adapts modern algorithms—including LSQ, LSQ+, PACT, and DoReFa for QAT, and GPTQ, BRECQ, AWQ, AdaRound, and ZeroQ for PTQ—utilizing Straight-Through Estimators (STE) and composite loss functions to minimize reconstruction errors at both the branch and layer levels.

Extensive experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 across various KAN variants (EfficientKAN, FastKAN, PyKAN, and KAGN) demonstrate that KANs are generally compatible with 4-bit quantization, enabling potential memory compression of up to 8x compared to full-precision models. In QAT settings, LSQ, LSQ+, and PACT successfully preserved accuracy comparable to full-precision baselines in shallow architectures, while DoReFa proved to be the most stable method for deeper KAGN architectures under aggressive quantization settings. For PTQ, GPTQ and Uniform quantization yielded the best overall performance across complex datasets, outperforming AWQ and BRECQ on harder tasks, whereas BRECQ proved competitive on simpler datasets like MNIST. The results indicate that while KANs are robust to low-bit compression, the optimal quantization strategy is highly dependent on the specific architecture depth and dataset complexity. This research establishes a critical foundation for the efficient deployment of KANs in production environments.

## Key Findings

*   **General Compatibility:** KANs, particularly deeper variants like KAGN, are generally compatible with low-bit (4-bit) quantization, though performance is highly dependent on the interaction between the quantization method and the specific architecture.
*   **QAT Performance:** 
    *   **Shallow Models:** LSQ, LSQ+, and PACT successfully preserve accuracy at 4-bit.
    *   **Deep/Aggressive Models:** DoReFa is identified as the most stable method for deeper KAGN architectures under aggressive quantization settings.
*   **PTQ Performance:** 
    *   **Overall:** GPTQ and Uniform quantization perform best across the board.
    *   **Simple Datasets:** BRECQ is competitive on simpler datasets like MNIST.
*   **Method Interaction:** Significant interactions exist between quantization methods and KAN architectures, indicating there is no single optimal algorithm for all KAN variants.

## Methodology

The authors propose **QuantKAN**, a unified framework designed to bridge the gap between novel spline-based architectures and standard compression techniques. The methodology is characterized by:

1.  **Unified Framework Support:** QuantKAN comprehensively supports both Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ).
2.  **Algorithm Adaptation:** It adapts state-of-the-art quantization algorithms—originally designed for linear layers—for spline-based layers.
    *   **QAT Algorithms:** LSQ, LSQ+, PACT, DoReFa.
    *   **PTQ Algorithms:** GPTQ, BRECQ.
3.  **Branch-Specific Implementation:** The approach utilizes distinct quantizers for different components of the KAN layer:
    *   Base branches (linear weights).
    *   Spline coefficients.
    *   Activations.
4.  **Validation:** The methodology is validated through extensive experimentation on standard vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) across multiple KAN variants (EfficientKAN, FastKAN, PyKAN, KAGN).

## Technical Details

The framework is built upon a "Branch-Aware" architecture to handle the heterogeneous nature of KAN weights.

### Core Architecture
*   **Branch-Aware Quantization:** Utilizes separate quantizers for the **Base Branch** (linear weights) and the **Spline Branch** (nonlinear spline expansions) to address differing weight distributions.

### Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
*   **Mechanism:** Uses Straight-Through Estimator (STE).
*   **Algorithms:** Supports LSQ, LSQ+, PACT, and DoReFa.
*   **Optimization:** Enforces independent learnable parameters for stability.

### Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)
*   **Mechanism:** Decouples model learning and minimizes a composite loss function.
*   **Loss Function:** Involves both branch-level and layer-level reconstruction errors.
*   **Algorithms:** Supports AdaRound, AWQ, GPTQ, BRECQ, and ZeroQ.

### Framework Wrappers
The implementation includes specific wrappers for compatibility:
*   `QuantKANLinear`
*   `QuantFastKANLayer`
*   `QuantPyKANLayer`
*   `QuantKAGN`

## Results

Experiments were conducted focusing on **4-bit quantization** across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 using EfficientKAN, FastKAN, PyKAN, and KAGN models.

**Quantization-Aware Training (QAT):**
*   **Shallow Architectures:** LSQ, LSQ+, and PACT maintained accuracy levels comparable to full-precision baselines.
*   **Deep/Aggressive Architectures:** DoReFa demonstrated superior stability for KAGN models.

**Post-Training Quantization (PTQ):**
*   **Complex Datasets:** GPTQ and Uniform quantization provided the best overall performance.
*   **Simple Datasets:** BRECQ showed competitive results on MNIST.

**General Conclusion:**
KANs are compatible with low-bit quantization provided the branch-specific nature of the layers is respected. However, the "best" algorithm varies significantly based on the depth of the network and the complexity of the dataset.
