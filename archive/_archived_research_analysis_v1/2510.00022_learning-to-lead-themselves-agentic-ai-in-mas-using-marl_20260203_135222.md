## 📝 Executive Summary

> As sectors like logistics and warehouse automation scale up autonomous fleets, reliance on explicit inter-agent communication creates prohibitive bottlenecks in bandwidth and computational overhead. This paper addresses the critical challenge of enabling efficient task allocation within Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) where constant communication is unavailable or operationally expensive. The research focuses on the necessity for systems where homogeneous agents can autonomously self-organize, maintain internal states, and pursue long-term goals in dynamic environments without external coordination protocols, a requirement for scaling industrial fleets.
>
> The core innovation integrates "agentic AI" concepts into a MARL framework through a lightweight implementation of Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO). Implemented in PyTorch, the system utilizes a Centralized-Training, Decentralized-Execution (CTDE) paradigm modeled as a Markov Game. The architecture employs centralized critics with access to global states and joint actions during training to maximize expected discounted return, while deploying decentralized actors that rely solely on local observations. This allows agents to learn cooperative strategies—such as distinct target coverage and collision avoidance—and embed them directly into individual policies, eliminating the need for real-time negotiation.
>
> Simulations conducted in the PettingZoo environment validated the framework's capability, with homogeneous agents achieving full target coverage (100%) while operating with zero inter-agent communication bandwidth. The study confirmed that agents could successfully self-organize and maintain distinct target assignments solely through learned policies. Although specific convergence speed metrics were not detailed, the IPPO implementation was validated as computationally feasible, enabling the system to converge to stable cooperative policies suitable for complex tasks like drone delivery and warehouse automation.
>
> By validating the CTDE-IPPO framework for communication-free operation, this research bridges the gap between theoretical MARL prototypes and practical industrial deployment. The elimination of constant messaging protocols directly reduces the hardware costs and latency constraints associated with autonomous drone fleets and warehouse systems. This work sets a technical precedent for robust, cooperative intelligence in automation, proving that complex coordination can be offloaded from communication layers to agent-level policies, thereby enhancing system scalability and operational stability.
