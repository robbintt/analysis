## Executive Summary

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics faces a critical bottleneck in reward specification. Manually engineering dense rewards is labor-intensive and frequently misaligned with human intent, while soliciting explicit human feedback imposes a high cognitive load on the user. This necessity for constant, conscious input limits the scalability of RL agents in dynamic environments, creating a barrier for the widespread deployment of autonomous systems.

The authors introduce **Reinforcement Learning from Implicit Human Feedback (RLIHF)**, a framework that utilizes passive, implicit neural signals to train robotic agents without active user intervention. The system leverages **Error-Related Potentials (ErrPs)**—neural responses generated when a human observes an error—as the primary supervisory signal. Technically, the implementation employs a compact convolutional neural network (`EEGNet`) to decode raw electroencephalography (EEG) streams. These components are integrated into the RL pipeline via a specific reward function, calculated as $r_{\text{ErrP}}^t = 1 - p_{\text{ErrP}}$. This reward is combined with environmental signals to train a **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** agent, utilizing a streaming ring buffer architecture to handle the temporal dynamics of continuous action spaces.

The framework was evaluated using a **Kinova Gen2** robotic arm within a **MuJoCo** physics simulation, performing complex pick-and-place tasks involving obstacle avoidance. In a study comprising 12 human subjects across five independent runs, RLIHF agents were benchmarked against 'Sparse' and 'Dense' reward baselines. The results demonstrated that RLIHF consistently outperformed the Sparse baseline and achieved performance parity with agents trained using dense, manually designed rewards. Crucially, the study found that decoding accuracies only slightly above chance level were sufficient to drive effective learning, validating the method's robustness with noisy neural data.

This work establishes the viability of using implicit neural feedback as a substitute for explicit human supervision in robotic control, significantly reducing the cognitive burden required to train embodied agents. By proving that latent brain signals contain sufficient informational bandwidth for complex tasks, the research establishes a new paradigm for scalable human-aligned robotics.
