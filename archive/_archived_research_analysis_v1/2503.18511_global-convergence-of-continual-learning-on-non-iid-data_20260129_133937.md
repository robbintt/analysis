## Executive Summary

> Continual learning (CL) research has historically relied on empirical validation, lacking the rigorous theoretical frameworks necessary to guarantee algorithm stability in dynamic environments. A fundamental barrier to establishing such theory has been the reliance on standard machine learning assumptions—specifically that data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and that feature data satisfies persistent excitation conditions. In real-world non-stationary streams, these assumptions are almost always violated, creating a significant void between theoretical possibility and practical application.
>
> This paper addresses this gap by formulating a rigorous mathematical analysis to determine whether regression models in continual learning settings can reliably converge when processing general, non-IID data streams that drift over time.
>
> The key innovation lies in the development of a novel theoretical framework that proves global convergence without imposing strict i.i.d. or persistent excitation constraints. The authors utilize **stochastic Lyapunov functions** in conjunction with **martingale estimation techniques** to analyze the stability of general continual learning algorithms. By relaxing the persistent excitation condition—which typically demands rich, continuous feature variation—the methodology remains valid even for sparse data or scenarios with significant feature drift. This approach allows for the precise characterization of algorithm behavior under "general data conditions," effectively bridging the gap between the idealized environments of standard optimization theory and the complex reality of continual learning.
>
> The study successfully establishes that continual learning algorithms applied to regression models achieve Almost Sure Convergence (convergence with probability 1) under these relaxed, non-IID conditions. Addressing the critical need for quantitative metrics, the authors derive explicit convergence bounds: the forgetting measure and estimation error are proven to converge to zero at a rate of **$O(\log t / t)$**, while the cumulative regret is bounded by **$O(\log t)$**. These specific results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains stability and retains knowledge effectively, with performance errors decaying sublinearly over time despite the absence of strict theoretical data constraints.
