# Lifted Neural Networks
*Internal Adversarial, Chalmers University, Christopher Zach, Lifted Neural*

> ### ⚡ Executive Summary
>
> This research addresses the vulnerability of Lifted Neural Networks (LNNs) to adversarial attacks, identifying a critical barrier to their use in security-sensitive applications. Unlike standard neural networks that process data in a single pass, LNNs determine outputs through a mathematical optimization process, making them susceptible to interference at both the input layer and within internal computations.
>
> The key innovation is the **Generalized Adversarial Relaxed Optimal Value Reformulation (Generalized AROVR)**, a novel training method that strengthens the network without altering its physical structure. The approach introduces "Reweighted Network Potentials," modifying the loss function to create direction-specific defense zones. By adjusting how errors are weighted across different network layers via a reweighting ratio ($\gamma_{k'}/\gamma_k$), the model resists both targeted and untargeted perturbations. This strategy integrates protective measures directly into the training objective, enhancing security through code changes rather than architectural overhauls.
>
> The study validates the framework through rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that the Generalized AROVR formulation is "strictly harder to optimize" than standard methods—a necessary trade-off where increased computational cost yields significantly stronger robustness guarantees. Additionally, the authors derive a precise stability threshold: for the least-squares loss, the weighting parameter ($\gamma_L$) must exceed the regularization strength ($\beta$) to maintain stability. This work advances robust optimization by demonstrating that high-level security can be achieved through loss function engineering alone, securing the entire inference pipeline from input to internal states.

*   **Generalization Improvement:** The proposed framework yields improved generalization performance compared to baseline methods.

## 🧪 Methodology

The research utilizes **Lifted Neural Networks (LNNs)**, an architecture where inference is treated as an explicit optimization task. The network determines neural activities by minimizing a **Network Potential** ($U_\theta(z; x)$).

The methodology centers on adversarial training achieved by manipulating the training loss function. The authors engineered a new loss function to synthesize targeted and untargeted adversarial perturbations, specifically designed to overcome prior limitations in robustness. This allows the network to defend against attacks that interfere not just with the input, but with the internal computational states.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The technical approach is grounded in the optimization of network potentials and advanced reformulation strategies.

### Core Components
*   **Network Potential ($U_\theta$):** Defined using either a Least-Squares Penalizer or Fenchel-Young Divergence.
*   **Training Frameworks:**
    *   **ROVR:** Relaxed Optimal Value Reformulation.
    *   **AROVR:** Adversarial ROVR.
*   **Generalized AROVR:** Introduces a generic distance-like mapping ($d_\gamma(z, z^*)$) and employs a **reweighting strategy** using Reweighted Network Potentials.

### Mechanism: Reweighting Strategy
*   **Scaling Error Signals:** The strategy scales error signals between units by the ratio of weighting parameters ($\gamma_{k'}/\gamma_k$).
*   **Dynamics:** Reweighted potentials introduce corrective terms based on upstream errors, controlled by the ratio of gamma weights.
*   **Geometry:** Analysis indicates that element-wise Euclidean distances primarily scale loss terms rather than altering the internal geometry, allowing for anisotropic adversarial regions where perturbation magnitudes vary across units.

### Stability Constraints
To ensure stability, specific constraints must be met depending on the loss type:
*   **Least-Squares Loss:** Requires $\gamma_L > \beta$.
*   **Regime:** Analysis is focused on the interpolation regime (high capacity).
