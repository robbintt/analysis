## Executive Summary

Standard sparse retrieval techniques face a critical efficiency bottleneck when deployed in asymmetric, inference-free architectures. In these systems (e.g., IDF-SPLADE-doc-distill), documents are encoded as high-dimensional sparse vectors during indexing, while queries remain simple bag-of-words, eliminating query-time neural inference. However, the research identifies that standard FLOPS regularization—typically designed for symmetric dual-encoder models—is suboptimal for this asymmetric setup. When applied indiscriminately, this regularization causes representation collapse, where document vectors become overly sparse or lose discriminative power. This failure creates a barrier to adopting inference-free retrieval, forcing engineers to choose between the low latency of lexical search and the high accuracy of neural models that require expensive query-side processing.

To resolve the regularization mismatch, the authors propose a novel $\ell_0$-inspired sparsification framework tailored for inference-free models. The approach integrates two key technical mechanisms. First, the $\ell_0$ Mask Loss resolves the collapse issue by selectively applying FLOPS regularization; it imposes penalties only on documents exceeding a specific sparsity threshold $t$, thereby preventing the optimizer from forcing all weights to zero. Second, the authors introduce an $\ell_0$ Approximation Activation, which utilizes log-based transformations to serve as a differentiable surrogate for the discrete $\ell_0$ norm. This activation function shifts the optimization objective from minimizing weight magnitude to directly minimizing the actual count of active tokens. Together, these mechanisms modify the BERT-based IDF-SPLADE architecture (30,522 dimensions) to optimize for true sparsity without discarding semantic information.

The proposed method was rigorously evaluated on the BEIR benchmark, a standard suite for out-of-domain retrieval, using NDCG@10 as the primary metric. The $\ell_0$-inspired model achieved state-of-the-art performance among inference-free sparse retrievers. Crucially, the results demonstrate that the model closes the performance gap with heavier architectures: it attains performance parity with leading Siamese sparse retrievers (e.g., SPLADE) and outperforms representative dense retrievers (e.g., BGE) in zero-shot settings. By eliminating the need for neural query processing, the model achieves these accuracy metrics with a fraction of the computational cost, specifically removing the query-time latency inherent in Siamese and dense models.

This work disrupts the prevailing assumption that query-side neural encoding is a prerequisite for state-of-the-art retrieval effectiveness. By bridging the accuracy gap between lightweight inference-free models and resource-intensive Siamese architectures, the research provides a practical path for production search systems to achieve high throughput without sacrificing relevance. The ability to match the NDCG performance of complex neural models while maintaining the low latency of lexical search marks a pivotal advancement for the field, offering a scalable solution for large-scale information retrieval where efficiency and accuracy are paramount.
