## Executive Summary

This research addresses the pervasive issue of "conversation regret"—the inability to recall specific segments of auditory information due to distraction, ambient noise, or hearing impairment. While current assistive technologies typically offer broad recording or linear transcription, they lack the semantic sophistication to help users identify and understand exactly *what* they missed in a multi-speaker environment. This paper matters because it moves beyond simple audio capture to solve the cognitive challenge of reintegration: enabling a user to query a system to recover not just the text of a missed conversation, but the specific semantic context, spatial origin, and timing of that information.

The key innovation is the Beamforming-LLM architecture, a novel pipeline that integrates spatial signal processing with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Technically, the system utilizes a miniDSP UMA-8 microphone array with a specific circular configuration and employs Pyroomacoustics for Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation and MVDR beamforming filters to separate directional audio streams. These separated streams are transcribed using OpenAI’s Whisper and segmented into chunks, which are then encoded by MiniLM and stored in a FAISS vector database with metadata including spatial coordinates and timestamps. When a user submits a natural language query, the system retrieves semantically relevant segments and employs a lightweight LLM (GPT-4o-mini) to generate "contrastive summaries" that distinguish between attended and non-attended conversation segments.

The study validates the system's feasibility through functional demonstration, showing that the integration of spatial audio with LLMs enables accurate semantic retrieval of missed conversations. While specific quantitative performance metrics such as Word Error Rate or processing latency were not provided, the system successfully executed complex retrieval tasks, answering natural language queries by distinguishing between attended and non-attended segments based on spatial context. Validation scenarios confirmed that the lightweight `GPT-4o-mini` model is sufficient for generating high-quality, contrastive summaries without the overhead of larger models. The system effectively demonstrated its end-to-end utility by delivering a comprehensive output package: summarized text of missed segments, their spatial origin, and timestamped audio snippets for direct playback.

This work establishes a foundational framework for "Intelligent Auditory Memory," significantly advancing the field of context-aware personal spatial computing. By bridging traditional beamforming techniques with modern generative AI, it offers a superior approach to meeting summarization and assistive technology that goes beyond flat transcription. For the hearing impaired or individuals in high-cognitive-load environments, this architecture provides a critical pathway for reintegrating into conversations, thereby influencing future developments in wearable technology and smart auditory prosthesis. The research underscores the potential for spatial context to enhance semantic understanding in human-computer interaction, setting a new standard for assistive listening systems.

## Methodology

The proposed system, Beamforming-LLM, utilizes a multi-stage pipeline combining audio signal processing with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The process follows these four stages:

1.  **Audio Capture & Separation:** Uses a microphone array and beamforming to separate directional audio streams.
2.  **Transcription & Embedding:** Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text and sentence encoders to store data in a vector database.
3.  **Query Processing & Retrieval:** User natural language queries are processed to retrieve semantically relevant segments from the database.
4.  **Temporal Alignment & Summarization:** Retrieved segments are aligned with unattended segments and summarized using a lightweight LLM (`GPT-4o-mini`).
