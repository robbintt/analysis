## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become a dominant architecture in computer vision, yet they face significant security challenges from evasion attacks. This paper addresses the critical incompatibility between state-of-the-art Adversarial Training (AT) methods—such as Generalist and DBAT—and the ViT architecture. The authors demonstrate that when these standard AT methods are applied directly to ViTs, they fail to provide effective defense. This gap is problematic because it leaves widely deployed transformer models vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, necessitating a defense mechanism specifically tailored to the unique structural and representational dynamics of ViTs.

**Innovation**
The key innovation is **MIMIR** (Masked Image Modeling for Mutual Information-based Adversarial Robustness), a self-supervised framework grounded in information theory. The authors derive theoretical bounds proving that the Mutual Information (MI) between an adversarial example and its latent representation within a ViT must be constrained to ensure robustness. MIMIR implements this via an Encoder-Decoder structure that processes adversarial inputs to reconstruct natural images. The method integrates an MI penalty based on the Information Bottleneck principle during training, minimizing the information shared between the adversarial input and the latent representation. Additionally, MIMIR enhances computational efficiency by discarding 75% of image patches, utilizing a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm adaptable to various ViT variants.

**Results**
MIMIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K, outperforming standard baselines like PGD and APGD AT on both ViT-S and ViT-B architectures under RobustBench protocols ($L_2 \epsilon=4/255$). In tests on CIFAR-10, the method demonstrated approximately 59–60% robust accuracy. Beyond standard metrics, MIMIR exhibited improved resilience against unforeseen attacks and common corruptions (ImageNet-C). Crucially, the method offers significant efficiency gains, reducing the wall-clock training time for ViT-B from 451.39 hours to 123.76 hours. These results were validated even in white-box scenarios where the adversary possessed full knowledge of the defense.

**Impact**
This research significantly advances the field by bridging a theoretical gap between information theory and adversarial robustness in transformers. It provides the first systematic investigation into why modern evasion attacks threaten ViTs and establishes a necessary theoretical link between MI bounds and robustness. By introducing a scalable, theoretically grounded solution that withstands adaptive attacks and common corruptions, the authors offer a viable path forward for securing next-generation vision systems. The public release of code and models further ensures that these findings can serve as a foundation for future research in robust self-supervised learning.

## Methodology

The authors utilize an information-theoretic approach, specifically analyzing Mutual Information (MI) within the context of autoencoder-based self-supervised pre-training for ViTs.

The proposed **MIMIR** method employs a specific MI penalty during the training process and utilizes self-supervised Adversarial Training (AT) via masked image modeling integrated with autoencoders to facilitate adversarial pre-training.
