## 📝 Executive Summary

Current deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically focus solely on maximizing cumulative rewards, often resulting in complex, high-variance behaviors that lack predictability. In high-dimensional control tasks such as locomotion, these "jittery" or chaotic policies are prone to failure when deployed in real-world environments subject to external perturbations, sensor noise, or model inaccuracies. This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving the robustness and stability of RL policies, bridging the gap between simulated training in environments like MuJoCo and the reliability required for physical deployment.

The authors propose **Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning (TERL)**, a novel approach that introduces an inductive bias towards "simplicity" by explicitly minimizing the conditional entropy of action trajectories rather than just instantaneous actions. TERL minimizes the number of bits required to describe action information given state trajectories, thereby promoting periodic and compressible behaviors. Technically, the method estimates conditional entropy using a variational parameterized action prediction model to construct an information-regularized reward function. The algorithm employs a joint optimization strategy for the policy network and the prediction model, governed by a hyperparameter $\alpha$; notably, setting $\alpha=0$ recovers the standard Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.

TERL was evaluated on six high-dimensional locomotion tasks in the MuJoCo environment against baselines including RPC, RPC-Orig, LZ-SAC, and SAC. TERL outperformed SAC in five out of six tasks, achieving a score of $137 \pm 19$ on the H1 Walk task (compared to SAC’s 85) and $479 \pm 52$ on Humanoid Walk. However, TERL failed to outperform the baselines on the Humanoid-Run task, highlighting a boundary where the bias towards simplicity may hinder performance in more complex gaits. In robustness tests, TERL retained $75.5\%$ performance under a mass scale of 0.50 and $90.1\%$ performance at an action noise strength of 0.30, significantly outperforming both LZ-SAC and the RPC baselines. Additionally, at an observation noise of 0.04, TERL maintained $92.9\%$ performance. Trajectory analysis confirmed that TERL produced more periodic behaviors, achieving the smallest average bzip2 file size compared to baselines, while ablation studies confirmed that increasing $\alpha$ effectively reduces normalized trajectory file size.

The significance of this research lies in establishing a strong empirical link between minimizing conditional entropy (behavioral simplicity) and achieving control robustness. By demonstrating that policies which are more predictable and compressible are also more resilient to domain shifts and noise—outperforming even robustness-focused baselines like RPC—TERL provides a valuable new framework for developing reliable robotic systems. This work shifts the optimization paradigm from purely reward-driven to information-regularized control, offering a promising direction for sim-to-real transfer and safety-critical applications where stability is as important as task performance.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Simplicity Bias:** Introducing an inductive bias towards "simplicity" via trajectory entropy minimization leads to more robust control policies.
*   **Performance Superiority:** TERL outperformed the standard Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm in 5 out of 6 evaluated high-dimensional locomotion tasks.
*   **Noise Resilience:** The method demonstrated exceptional robustness, retaining over 90% performance even with significant action noise ($0.30$) and over 92% performance with observation noise ($0.04$).
*   **Compressibility:** Trajectory analysis using bzip2 compression confirmed that TERL generates more periodic and compressible behaviors than baselines.
*   **Trade-off Limit:** While generally effective, the bias towards simplicity can hinder performance in highly complex tasks requiring intricate gaits (e.g., Humanoid-Run).

## 🛠️ Methodology

The proposed methodology centers on **Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning (TERL)**. Unlike traditional RL methods that maximize only cumulative reward, TERL jointly maximizes cumulative rewards and minimizes the entropy of entire action trajectories. This is achieved by defining trajectory entropy as the number of bits required to describe action information given state trajectories.

To estimate this entropy, the authors utilize a **variational parameterized action prediction model**. This model allows for the construction of an information-regularized reward function. The system employs a joint optimization strategy that trains both the policy network and the prediction model simultaneously. A critical hyperparameter, $\alpha$, controls the trade-off between maximizing rewards and minimizing entropy; setting $\alpha=0$ effectively reduces TERL to the standard Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
