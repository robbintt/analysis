## Executive Summary

This research addresses a critical disconnect in current Explainable AI (XAI) literature, specifically regarding the theoretical foundations of counterfactual explainability. The authors argue that transparency research frequently isolates interpretability methods from fundamental artificial intelligence concepts, leading to approaches that lack robustness and theoretical grounding. This oversight matters because generating valid counterfactual explanations (what-if scenarios) requires a deep understanding of a model's confidence. Without integrating principles of uncertainty quantification, counterfactual explanations risk being unstable or misleading, particularly in data regions where the model lacks sufficient knowledge, ultimately undermining user trust and model reliability.

The paper’s primary innovation is establishing **Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)** as a unifying theoretical framework for counterfactual explainability, positioning UQ and ante-hoc interpretability as complementary rather than competing paradigms. Technically, the authors propose decomposing uncertainty into its two constituent components—**aleatoric** (data noise) and **epistemic** (model knowledge gap)—to guide the generation of explanations. By shifting focus from post-hoc manipulation to ante-hoc integration, the approach leverages architectures capable of probabilistic reasoning, such as Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) or Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs).

As this work is primarily a theoretical and position paper, it does not present standard experimental metrics or numerical benchmarks (such as validity, sparsity, or proximity) typically associated with new algorithmic implementations. Instead, the "results" are conceptual, consisting of a rigorous demonstration that standard transparent models are insufficient for delivering human-centered insights without uncertainty awareness. The significance of this work lies in its potential to redefine the research agenda for trustworthy AI, bridging the gap between technical model performance and the nuanced explanations required by human users.
