## 📝 Executive Summary

Deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices, such as Microcontroller Units (MCUs), requires navigating a complex triad of constraints: **high inference accuracy**, **resilience against adversarial attacks**, and **strict adherence to memory (KiB) and power (µW) limitations**. While deep quantization is the standard technique for reducing model footprints to meet these hardware constraints, it frequently degrades a model's robustness, leaving it vulnerable to malicious perturbations.

This paper addresses a critical gap in TinyML research, demonstrating that existing state-of-the-art models, such as those in the MLCommons/TinyML benchmarks, struggle to maintain security defenses when subjected to the extreme compression required for untrusted, real-world environments.

The authors propose a **co-optimization strategy** that integrates Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) using the QKeras framework with adversarial robustness techniques. The core technical innovation is the application of **Stochastic Ternary Quantization (STQ)**, which quantizes parameters incrementally based on a probability inversely proportional to quantization error. To mitigate the loss of robustness typically associated with this aggressive compression, the methodology employs **per-layer Jacobian Regularization (JR)**.

This research establishes a new quantitative baseline for secure TinyML, demonstrating that adversarial robustness can be preserved against both white-box and black-box attacks in deeply quantized, ultra-low-power environments.

*   **Cross-Dataset Performance:** Achieved superior performance on average across two distinct datasets: **CIFAR-10** (image) and **Google Speech Commands** (audio).
*   **Validation:** The study validates the effectiveness of combining **quantization-aware training** with **adversarial robustness** techniques to optimize models for resource-constrained edge environments.
