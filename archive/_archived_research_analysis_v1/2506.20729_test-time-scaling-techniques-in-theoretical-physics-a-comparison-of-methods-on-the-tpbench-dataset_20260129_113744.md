## Executive Summary

This research addresses a critical limitation in applying **test-time scaling**—increasing inference computation to boost performance—to complex scientific reasoning. While effective in general mathematical domains like the AIME benchmark, established methods exhibit a significant **cross-domain generalization gap** in theoretical physics, specifically on the TPBench dataset. This discrepancy highlights that general-purpose reasoning capabilities do not automatically translate to physics, where problems are defined by long-horizon derivations and domain-specific structural constraints. Solving this is essential for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) from solving standard word problems to aiding in genuine scientific discovery, where a single logical error in a multi-step derivation invalidates the entire result.

The paper introduces a specialized **"symbolic weak-verifier" framework** designed to leverage the structural logic of physics problems to enable better parallel scaling. Technically, the framework decomposes complex cosmological calculations, such as computing Bogoliubov coefficients, into a structured 10-step pipeline (Mode Equation derivation, Scale Factor calculation, Integral Setup, Pole identification, Residue calculation, etc.). Instead of relying solely on textual consistency, the system generates a Python function (e.g., "abs_beta") and utilizes a symbolic verification engine for granular validation. This mechanism isolates failures to specific logical steps, allowing the model to validate intermediate stages of the derivation against symbolic constraints rather than assessing the final output in isolation.

The proposed framework demonstrated quantifiable improvements over standard test-time scaling methods, significantly outperforming baselines on the TPBench dataset while maintaining high effectiveness on the AIME benchmark. In a detailed case study involving Bogoliubov coefficient calculations, the system's verification mechanism exhibited high precision in the early stages of derivation, correctly validating Steps 1–4 (Mode Equation through Integral Setup) and successfully pinpointing Step 9 (Phase Integral calculation) as the specific source of error. Although the system produced an incorrect final analytical output ($|\beta(k)| \approx \frac{\pi}{2} e^{-2k/H_I}$), it achieved a 100% success rate in generating executable Python code capable of handling physical parameters (wavenumber, mass, and Hubble parameter), demonstrating robust computational structuring capabilities.

This work advances the state-of-the-art in test-time scaling by proving that domain-specific structural leveraging is superior to general-purpose approaches in scientific contexts. By establishing strong new performance baselines on the TPBench dataset, the authors provide a rigorous benchmark for future research into physics-capable AI. The findings suggest that the path toward reliable scientific reasoning lies not just in scaling model size or compute, but in integrating symbolic verification and domain-aware pipelines that enforce mathematical consistency. This approach shifts the paradigm from pure probabilistic reasoning to a hybrid of generation and symbolic verification, a critical step toward automating complex theoretical derivations.
