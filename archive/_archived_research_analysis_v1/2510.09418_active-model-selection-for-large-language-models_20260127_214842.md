## Executive Summary

The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a critical bottleneck in model evaluation: identifying the optimal model for a specific task is prohibitively expensive and resource-intensive. Traditional evaluation methods rely on exhaustive testing across large datasets or full pairwise comparisons between models, which scales poorly with the number of candidates. As the volume of available models grows, the cost of human annotation and computational inference for comprehensive evaluation becomes unsustainable, creating an urgent need for a more efficient, budget-aware methodology for model selection.

The authors introduce **LLM SELECTOR**, the first framework designed for active model selection in the LLM domain, shifting the paradigm from static evaluation to an adaptive active learning approach. Rather than evaluating entire datasets, the framework utilizes an algorithm that sequentially selects specific queries offering the highest information gain regarding the optimal model's identity. Technically, it employs a two-parameter probabilistic model (accounting for loss and draw) to minimize the expected conditional entropy of the best model.

To reduce complexity from O(m²) to O(m), the system compares candidates against a single baseline using Direct Preference Judgments and employs "Weak Judges" (k-gram language models) to simulate noisy annotations and aggregate likelihoods in the absence of an oracle. Validated across 6 benchmarks involving 151 distinct LLMs, LLM SELECTOR demonstrated superior efficiency compared to traditional exhaustive evaluation and random sampling.

The framework achieved a reduction in annotation costs of up to **59.62%** while maintaining high selection quality. It successfully identified both the top-performing and near-best-performing models within limited budgets, outperforming heuristic subsets. The results prove that intelligent, limited annotation can achieve accuracy comparable to full pairwise ranking but with a significantly lower computational burden. This research establishes a new evaluation standard for the field, challenging the assumption that fully annotated datasets are strictly necessary for accurate model selection.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Cost Reduction:** The framework reduces annotation costs by **up to 59.62%** compared to traditional evaluation methods.
*   **High Accuracy:** Effectively identifies the best-performing and near-best-performing LLMs for specific tasks.
*   **Extensive Validation:** The approach was validated through extensive experiments spanning **6 benchmarks** and **151 distinct** Large Language Models.
*   **Adaptive Efficiency:** Proves that adaptively selecting specific queries for annotation is more efficient than random or exhaustive sampling.

## Technical Details

The LLM SELECTOR framework utilizes advanced statistical methods to optimize model selection:

*   **Core Objective:** Aims to identify the best model from a set of candidates by maximizing mutual information between the subset of annotations and the best model identity.
*   **Algorithm:** Sequentially selects queries that minimize the expected conditional entropy of the best model.
*   **Complexity Management:**
    *   Uses a single baseline strategy to reduce complexity from **O(m²) to O(m)**.
    *   Utilizes Direct Preference Judgments and a Win Rate metric relative to the baseline.
*   **Probabilistic Modeling:** Performance relationships are modeled using a **two-parameter probabilistic model** involving:
    *   `epsilon_loss` (probability of loss)
    *   `epsilon_draw` (probability of draw)
*   **Simulation Strategy:** To estimate selection without a human oracle, it employs **'Weak Judges'** (k-gram language models) to simulate noisy annotations and aggregate likelihoods.

## Methodology

The core methodology is **Active Model Selection**, which shifts from static, full-dataset evaluation to an active learning paradigm. The framework adaptively selects a small, specific subset of queries to annotate, focusing on those that provide the highest information gain regarding which model is optimal. A judge-based oracle model is employed to handle the annotation process to minimize costs and resource expenditure.

*   **Paradigm Shift:** Establishment of a new evaluation standard that proposes a resource-efficient alternative adaptive to specific tasks, challenging the necessity of fully annotated datasets.
*   **Empirical Evidence:** Providing proof that intelligent, limited annotation strategies can outperform exhaustive evaluation in cost-efficiency while maintaining high selection quality.
