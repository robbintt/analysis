## 📑 Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDGs) with text attributes, specifically focusing on the difficulties of context window limitations and high domain variability. Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically require extensive, dataset-specific supervised training to model the complex interplay between evolving graph topologies and node features. This limitation creates a need for more generalized solutions that can adapt to new domains without the cost of retraining. Addressing this is critical because it opens the door to transferable, zero-shot learning capabilities for dynamic graph analysis, reducing reliance on large-scale labeled datasets and enabling broader applicability across diverse domains.

The key innovation is the **GraphAgent-Dynamic (GAD)** framework, a collaborative multi-agent system designed to decouple prediction tasks into specialized roles rather than relying on a single monolithic LLM. The architecture comprises six distinct components: an Initial Agent for dataset description, a Local Summary Agent and a Global Summary Agent for analyzing node-level insights and topology respectively, a Temporary Predictor Agent for intermediate predictions, a Knowledge Reflection Agent that refines predictions, and a Database for maintaining consistency. To effectively solve context window constraints, the framework utilizes heuristic structural metrics—Historical Interaction (HI), Common Neighbors (CN), and Node Frequency (NF)—to compress extensive structural data into concise summaries. GAD leverages multiple LLM backbones, including DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3-8b, to employ a zero-shot or few-shot strategy that maintains a unified architecture while transferring knowledge across domains without fine-tuning.

The study evaluated GAD on five datasets from the DTGB benchmark (Enron, GDELT, Googlemap_CT, ICEWS1819, Stack_elec) using a rigorous 70/15/15 chronological split involving 10,240 sampled test instances. The framework was tested on Future Link Prediction (LP), Node Retrieval (NR), and Future Edge Classification (EC) tasks. Results demonstrated that GAD achieves performance comparable to or exceeding fully-supervised GNN baselines without dataset-specific training. Specifically, on the Enron dataset, GAD achieved an LP Accuracy of **0.872**, while on GDELT it reached **0.744**. For Node Retrieval (Hits@10), the model scored **0.617** on ICEWS1819 and **0.889** on Stack_elec. In Edge Classification, GAD attained a Weighted F1 score of **0.921** on Googlemap_CT. The experiments further revealed that text-only prompts are insufficient for capturing temporal dynamics; the integration of structure-aware prompts with heuristic metrics was essential for achieving these high performance metrics.

This paper establishes a significant precedent as the first work to successfully explore LLMs as predictors for dynamic text-attributed graphs. It proves that LLM-based predictors can serve as potent alternatives to traditional GNNs, effectively mitigating the need for extensive training data and dataset-specific fine-tuning. By validating a multi-agent architecture that handles structural complexity and temporal dynamics, the authors provide a roadmap for future research, highlighting the importance of structural heuristics and offering design guidelines for developing more adaptable, generalizable graph learning systems.
