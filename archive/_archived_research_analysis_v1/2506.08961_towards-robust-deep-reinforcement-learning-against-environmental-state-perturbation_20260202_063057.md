## 📝 Executive Summary

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents deployed in embodied AI scenarios suffer from a critical fragility to **environmental state perturbations**—slight irregularities or noise in sensor data that cause catastrophic performance failures. Existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for different threat models and fail to mitigate these specific environmental shifts, creating a significant barrier to the reliable deployment of DRL in real-world robotics.

To solve this, the authors introduce the **Boosted Adversarial Training (BAT)** framework, a hybrid training methodology combining supervised learning and adversarial reinforcement learning. BAT operates in two distinct stages:

1.  **Supervised Fine-tuning:** Stabilizes the agent to prevent catastrophic forgetting.
2.  **Adversarial Reinforcement Training:** Hardens the policy against attacks.

Additionally, the researchers propose a **"calibration adversary,"** a novel non-targeted attack method designed specifically to benchmark and exploit agent sensitivity to state perturbations within MuJoCo environments.

Experimental evaluation provides numerical evidence of the framework's efficacy. Under the calibration adversary, standard DRL agents experienced catastrophic failure, with average returns dropping by more than **90%**—often collapsing to near-zero scores—demonstrating their inability to cope with state noise. In contrast, the BAT framework successfully maintained agent stability, preserving approximately **80% to 90%** of the original reward returns across various MuJoCo benchmarks.
