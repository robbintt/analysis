## Executive Summary

This research addresses the prohibitive computational and monetary costs associated with deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized engineering tasks, specifically Register Transfer Level (RTL) hardware design. While LLMs have demonstrated proficiency in generating Verilog code, their massive scale results in unsustainable energy footprints and high inference costs—often ranging from $15,000 to $45,000 for medium-scale System-on-Chip (SoC) processing. The paper challenges the prevailing industry assumption that scaling up foundation models is the only viable path to high performance, highlighting the urgent need for efficient alternatives that can maintain design integrity without the significant resource burden of "Goliath"-sized models.

The core innovation is an **"SLM-aware Agentic Framework"** designed to empower Small Language Models (SLMs) with fewer than 20 billion parameters to perform complex reasoning typically reserved for larger models. The architecture orchestrates five cooperating agents in a "senior mentor" and "junior engineer" dynamic, utilizing scaffolding mechanisms such as task decomposition, iterative refinement loops, and autonomous error correction. This workflow fosters adaptive behavior by allowing agents to dynamically adjust strategies based on intermediate verification feedback, effectively compensating for the inherent limitations of SLMs by optimizing for **"intelligence per watt"** rather than raw parameter scale.

Experimental validation on the CVDP benchmark demonstrates that the agentic approach significantly narrows the performance gap between SLMs and state-of-the-art LLMs. While generic single-shot SLMs typically achieve a pass rate of only 35–45%, the proposed framework enables SLMs to achieve performance levels rivaling advanced baselines like ChipNeMo (72.3%) and RTLCoder (82.3%). Crucially, energy consumption tests revealed that DeepSeek-7B utilized only **0.55 ± 0.06 Wh** compared to GPT-4o-mini’s **7.24 ± 1.67 Wh**—a roughly **13× reduction** in energy usage. This efficiency translates to massive potential monetary savings, reducing the operational costs that traditionally reach $15,000–$45,000 per SoC design by an order of magnitude.
