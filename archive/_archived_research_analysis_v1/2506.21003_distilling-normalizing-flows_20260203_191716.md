## Executive Summary

Normalizing flows are a highly effective class of generative models capable of exact likelihood estimation and high-fidelity sampling, but their utility is often constrained by high computational demands and large parameter counts. Achieving state-of-the-art performance typically requires deep architectures with expensive invertible transformations, creating a significant barrier for deployment in resource-constrained environments or latency-sensitive applications. This paper addresses the critical challenge of compressing normalizing flows to reduce inference costs and memory footprints without sacrificing the density estimation accuracy and generative quality that make these models valuable.

The authors introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework specifically designed for Compositional Normalizing Flows, moving beyond traditional methods that merely match final output logits. The key technical innovation lies in leveraging the unique, invertible structure of flows—specifically the bijective transformations between layers—to facilitate knowledge transfer at intermediate stages. By training a smaller "student" model to mimic the internal latent representations and transformations of a larger "teacher" model, the approach enables non-traditional knowledge transfer. This method aligns the student's feature spaces with the teacher's throughout the entire flow chain, allowing the compact model to learn the complex, multi-modal distributions modeled by the teacher more effectively than standard training or output-only distillation.

The study provides concrete evidence that the distillation framework enables substantial model compression with minimal performance degradation. On image benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, student models reduced to approximately 50% of the teacher's parameter count achieve Bits Per Dimension (BPD) scores nearly identical to the teacher (e.g., 3.37 BPD vs. 3.34 BPD), effectively closing the gap with larger architectures. Furthermore, the compressed models deliver significant efficiency gains, exhibiting up to a 2x increase in inference throughput (measured in samples per second) compared to the baseline teacher. In experiments on tabular UCI datasets (e.g., GAS, HEPMASS), the distilled students successfully match the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) of the teachers, whereas students trained from scratch suffer a significant drop in likelihood performance.

This research significantly advances the field of generative modeling by providing a rigorous methodology for deploying normalizing flows in production environments where efficiency is paramount. By demonstrating that high-fidelity generative models can be distilled into architectures half their size without losing accuracy, the authors open the door for using normalizing flows on edge devices and real-time applications. The specific insights regarding bijectors and intermediate-layer transfer offer a new blueprint for model compression, encouraging future research to develop architecture-specific distillation techniques that exploit the structural properties of deep generative models rather than relying on generic, task-agnostic approaches.
