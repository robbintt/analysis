## 📑 Executive Summary

Current Spoken Language Models (SLMs) face a significant computational bottleneck due to their reliance on high-frame-rate acoustic tokens. Because these models process audio at the frame level, they generate excessively long input sequences. This creates a critical efficiency challenge given the quadratic scaling complexity of self-attention mechanisms in Transformers, where computational cost increases exponentially with sequence length. Consequently, training these models is resource-intensive and slow, and processing long-context audio remains impractical, limiting the scalability of spoken language processing systems.

This research introduces **"Syllabic Speech Tokenization,"** the first systematic approach to applying syllabic-level acoustic tokenization to spoken language modeling. Instead of utilizing high-frame-rate tokens, the method segments speech into discrete syllabic units, operating at a significantly reduced rate of 4-5 Hz. By employing a self-supervised learning (SSL) approach to identify these syllabic boundaries, the architecture drastically compresses token lengths. This reduction in sequence length directly mitigates the quadratic scaling issues of self-attention, allowing the model to maintain semantic understanding while processing far less data per time step.

The study demonstrates that models trained with syllabic tokens match or surpass the performance of high-frame-rate token baselines on Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) benchmarks. Beyond maintaining accuracy, the method delivers substantial efficiency gains: it achieved a greater than 5x reduction in Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and a more than 2x reduction in training time. Furthermore, the researchers validated these findings across varying scales of training data, confirming that the approach generalizes effectively and scales robustly without sacrificing model quality.
