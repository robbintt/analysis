## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the challenge of effectively integrating natural language solutions, particularly those powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), into reinforcement learning (RL) environments. While RL agents are proficient at sequential decision-making, they often lack the interpretability and high-level guidance that language can provide. The authors identified a gap in the software infrastructure required to bridge these modalities, noting that existing methods often lack a unified, accessible framework. This integration matters because it promises to enhance agent performance through human-readable instructions and accelerates the broader scientific exploration of language-augmented artificial intelligence.

The key innovation is **`elsciRL`**, an open-source Python library that extends the HELIOS framework by implementing the "Language Adapter with Self-Completing Instruction Following" (LASIF) model. Technically, the system utilizes an LLM Adapter (specifically Llama3.2) to transform environmental states into language observations ($f: s \to o$), incorporating caching to handle partial observability. The instruction-following mechanism relies on pre-computed states and matches user inputs using Cosine Similarity with MiniLMv6 embeddings, including processes for instruction decomposition and validation. Additionally, the authors introduced a Python Flask-based graphical user interface that allows users to input text prompts, which the system uses to generate and self-complete instructions with minimal setup.

Empirical evaluation was conducted across Classroom, FrozenLake, and Maze environments using a "Single Setting" methodology (training with rewards, testing without). The results indicated that Q-Learning generally outperformed Deep Q-Networks (DQN) due to the simplicity of the tested problems. While the instruction-following mechanism successfully improved early training rewards and overall testing performance, the integration of LLM-generated descriptions did not generally aid performance and, in the Maze environment, resulted in a local optima trap. The authors explicitly note that these findings are subject to potential statistical limitations given the low sample sizes, which ranged between 5 and 10 runs.

## Key Findings

*   **Performance Enhancement:** Empirical results demonstrate that instructions generated via the proposed framework have the potential to improve the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) agents.
*   **Framework Extensibility:** The Language Adapter with Self-Completing Instruction framework can be successfully extended and implemented using Large Language Models (LLMs).
*   **Ease of Application:** The approach allows for the integration of language solutions into RL problems with minimal setup requirements, making it easily adaptable to new applications.
*   **Effective User Interaction:** The system successfully enables users to generate and self-complete instructions through text input provided via a GUI.

## Methodology

The authors developed `elsciRL`, an open-source Python library designed to bridge language solutions with reinforcement learning environments. The specific technical approach involves extending the "Language Adapter with Self-Completing Instruction" framework by incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs).

To facilitate this interaction, they implemented a novel Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to input text prompts. The LLM processes these inputs to generate instructions, which are subsequently self-completed by the system. The methodology prioritizes a software-centric approach that requires minimal setup to apply to various applications.
