> ## 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Current research on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) disproportionately focuses on open-vocabulary capabilities, leaving a critical gap in understanding their efficacy as foundational backbones for conventional computer vision tasks. This lack of systematic insight into closed-set detection, domain adaptation, and few-shot segmentation hinders reliable industrial adoption where robustness is required. This study addresses this paucity of data by rigorously investigating VLM performance beyond novel category recognition, targeting the need for versatile models capable of handling diverse downstream vision challenges.
>
> The authors introduce a unified, standardized benchmark framework that evaluates prominent VLMs—including **GLIP**, **Grounding DINO**, **OWL-ViT**, and **ViLD**—across 16 distinct scenarios: 8 for object detection and 8 for segmentation. The core technical innovation is the **"Granular Strategy Analysis,"** a methodology designed to isolate performance variables by dissecting three specific fine-tuning methodologies: *Zero Prediction*, *Visual Fine-tuning*, and *Text Prompt strategies*. Additionally, the study employs empirical correlation analysis to systematically map relationships between specific task characteristics—such as object scale and scene density—and underlying model architectures.
>
> The comprehensive evaluation refutes the "one-size-fits-all" hypothesis, demonstrating that no single VLM architecture achieves optimal performance across all downstream tasks. Quantitative results indicated that **Visual Fine-tuning** was the decisive factor for high performance in detection tasks, significantly outperforming Zero Prediction and Text Prompt strategies in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP), particularly in domain adaptation scenarios. The study established specific architectural correlations: models like GLIP, optimized for fine-grained feature extraction, proved superior in small object detection, while architectures capable of managing complex spatial relationships excelled in crowded scenes. These findings highlight non-linear efficacy, where the alignment between training strategy and task constraints directly dictates success.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Task-Dependent Performance:** VLMs exhibit varying advantages and limitations depending on the downstream task. Evaluation across 8 detection and 8 segmentation scenarios revealed that **no single architecture is optimal for all scenarios**.
*   **Impact of Fine-Tuning:** In detection tasks, the fine-tuning method significantly alters results. The efficacy of "zero prediction," "visual fine-tuning," and "text prompt" strategies varies based on the specific nature of the task.
*   **Correlation Insights:** Discernible correlations exist between task characteristics, model architectures, and training methodologies. Specific architectural choices are better suited for specific challenges (e.g., small object detection vs. crowded scenes).

## 🧪 Methodology

The study employs a rigorous multi-faceted approach to evaluate VLMs:

*   **Systematic Review & Benchmarking:** The authors conducted a systematic review of VLM-based detection and segmentation, treating VLMs as foundational models rather than mere tools for open-vocabulary tasks.
*   **Comprehensive Multi-Scenario Evaluation:** The study performed the **first comprehensive evaluation** across a wide range of downstream tasks, specifically testing against **16 distinct scenarios**:
    *   **8 Detection Settings:** Including closed-set, domain adaptation, and crowded objects.
    *   **8 Segmentation Settings:** Including few-shot, open-world, and small object tasks.
*   **Granular Strategy Analysis:** For detection tasks, models were evaluated under three specific fine-tuning granularities:
    1.  Zero Prediction
    2.  Visual Fine-tuning
    3.  Text Prompt
*   **Empirical Correlation Analysis:** The researchers analyzed empirical data to identify relationships between task characteristics, model architectures, and training methodologies to derive design insights.
