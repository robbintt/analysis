## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Current approaches to Multitask Learning (MTL) on tabular data predominantly rely on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures. These approaches struggle to capture complex, non-linear feature interactions and often fail to scale effectively with large datasets. Given that tabular data remains ubiquitous in high-stakes domains (e.g., recommendation systems, socioeconomic modeling), there is a critical need for architectures that leverage shared representations without succumbing to *negative transfer*, where learning one task degrades the performance of another.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce **MultiTab-Net**, the first multitask transformer architecture tailored for tabular data, moving significantly beyond traditional MLP backbones. The core technical innovation is a novel **Multitask Masked-Attention Mechanism** that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating inter-task competition. The architecture employs learnable task tokens and utilizes specific masking strategies—such as preventing tasks from attending to other tasks ($T \not\to T$)—to isolate and optimize task-specific representations. Additionally, the authors released **MultiTab-Bench**, a custom synthetic dataset generator for systematic evaluation.

**Results**
MultiTab-Net demonstrated superior performance compared to established MTL baselines (MMoE, PLE, STEM) and single-task transformers (TabTransformer, FT-Transformer). Ablation studies revealed that utilizing **multiple task tokens** combined with the **$T \not\to T$ masking strategy** yielded the best results. This configuration successfully mitigated severe negative transfer observed with single token configurations, yielding substantial Multitask Gain ($\Delta m$) across benchmarks.

**Impact**
This research significantly advances tabular deep learning by proving that transformer architectures can outperform MLP-based approaches in multitask scenarios, offering a path to greater scalability and expressiveness. The introduction of MultiTab-Net provides practitioners with a robust tool for handling complex feature interactions, while MultiTab-Bench offers a valuable resource for standardizing the evaluation of multitask dynamics.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview
MultiTab-Net is designed specifically to capture complex feature interactions within tabular data. Inputs are processed as embeddings, allowing the transformer to leverage standard attention mechanisms on structured data.

### Multitask Masked-Attention Mechanism
The core of the system utilizes learnable task tokens to handle multiple objectives.
*   **Variable Task Tokens:** The system tests configurations using single shared tokens versus multiple learned tokens.
*   **Masking Strategies:** To mitigate task competition, several strategies were evaluated:
    *   **No Masking:** Standard attention.
    *   **Feature to Task Prevention ($F \not\to T$):** Prevents features from attending to tasks.
    *   **Task to Task Prevention ($T \not\to T$):** Prevents tasks from attending to other tasks.
    *   **Combined Approach:** Utilizing both restrictions.
