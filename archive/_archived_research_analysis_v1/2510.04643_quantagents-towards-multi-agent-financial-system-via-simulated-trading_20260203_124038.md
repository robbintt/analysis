## Executive Summary

Current large language model (LLM) agents in financial trading suffer from a critical reliance on reactive "post-reflection" rather than proactive long-term trend prediction. This reactive limitation creates a significant "reality gap," causing AI-driven strategies to deviate substantially from the operational dynamics of real-world fund companies. Additionally, the field lacks robust mechanisms for the comprehensive evaluation of investment strategies that do not require assuming actual financial risk, hindering the safe development and deployment of autonomous trading systems.

The researchers introduce **QuantAgents**, a multi-agent framework designed to mimic real-world fund operations through a specialized architecture of four distinct roles: a Manager, a Simulated Trading Analyst, a Risk Control Analyst, and a Market News Analyst. These agents collaborate via structured meetings—*Market Analysis*, *Strategy Development*, and *Risk Alert*—while utilizing 26 integrated tools and three types of memory. Technically, the system employs a novel dual-front feedback mechanism that optimizes strategies by analyzing both real-world market performance and predictive accuracy. This architecture allows the system to process stock prices, news, and financial reports to execute proactive trend forecasting within a simulated NASDAQ-100 trading environment.

Evaluated on the PRUDEX benchmark, QuantAgents achieved a cumulative return of nearly 300% over a three-year period, significantly outperforming established baselines such as ZMR, TSM, SAC, DeepTrader, AlphaMix+, FinGPT, FinMem, FinAgent, and HedgeAgents. The framework demonstrated superiority across all evaluated performance metrics, specifically excelling in **Risk Control**, **Profitability**, **Explainability**, **Reliability**, **Diversity**, and **Universality**.

This research represents a significant advancement in bridging the reality gap between AI agents and human fund management by shifting the paradigm from reactive reflection to proactive prediction. By enabling risk-free, comprehensive strategy evaluation through simulated trading, QuantAgents provides a safe and scalable platform for the future development of autonomous financial systems. The introduction of a feedback architecture that harmonizes real-world performance with predictive accuracy sets a new standard for multi-agent systems, influencing future work in economic decision-making and large-scale agent collaboration.

## Methodology

The researchers proposed **QuantAgents**, a multi-agent system designed to mimic real-world fund operations. It features a multi-agent architecture with four specialized roles collaborating through structured meetings. The system utilizes a simulated trading environment and employs a **dual-front feedback mechanism** based on real-world market performance and predictive accuracy.

### Agent Roles
*   **Manager (Otto):** Oversees operations.
*   **Simulated Trading Analyst (Bob):** Handles trading simulations.
*   **Risk Control Analyst (Dave):** Manages risk assessment.
*   **Market News Analyst (Emily):** Processes news and information.

### Coordination Structure
Agents coordinate via three specific types of structured meetings:
1.  Market Analysis
2.  Strategy Development
3.  Risk Alert

## Contributions

*   **Bridging the Reality Gap:** The system reduces deviation from real-world fund companies by emphasizing long-term trend prediction over post-reflection.
*   **Risk-Free Strategy Evaluation:** The framework enables comprehensive assessment of investment strategies without assuming financial risk.
*   **Novel Feedback Architecture:** A multi-agent collaboration model using a dual feedback loop to optimize real-world performance and predictive accuracy.
