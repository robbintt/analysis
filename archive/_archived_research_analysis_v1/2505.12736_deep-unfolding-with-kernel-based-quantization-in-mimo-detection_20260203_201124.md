## 📝 Executive Summary

Deep unfolding networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in MIMO detection but face significant deployment barriers on resource-constrained edge devices due to high computational costs. While quantization is the standard remedy, existing Quantization Aware Training (QAT) techniques rely on parametric distribution assumptions (e.g., Gaussian) that often fail to match real-world MIMO signal distributions. This mismatch leads to severe Bit Error Rate (BER) degradation, particularly at low-bit widths (e.g., 4-bit).

This paper introduces the **Kernel-based Adaptive Quantization (KAQ)** framework, a novel approach that abandons parametric assumptions in favor of a non-parametric, data-driven strategy. The core innovation is a **Distribution Alignment** mechanism using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to minimize the statistical distance between full-precision and quantized activations. Furthermore, KAQ employs a **Dynamic Step Size Adjustment** mechanism, updating quantization step sizes in real-time based on current wireless channel statistics rather than relying on static values.

Experimental results on 64x64 MIMO systems demonstrate that KAQ effectively bridges the accuracy gap between quantized and full-precision models. Unlike standard QAT methods that fail to converge or exhibit high error floors at 4-bit, KAQ maintains BER performance comparable to 32-bit baselines across various SNR regimes. The framework reduces memory and computational complexity by approximately 87.5%, enabling real-time processing on edge hardware without sacrificing detection integrity. This work represents a paradigm shift, facilitating the deployment of sophisticated deep unfolding detectors in power-sensitive environments like IoT and mobile terminals.

    *   Aligns the activation distributions of full-precision and quantized models without relying on rigid parametric assumptions.

2.  **Dynamic Step Size Adjustment**
    *   Implements a method to dynamically update quantization step sizes based on specific wireless network channel conditions.
    *   Replaces traditional static step sizes with a responsive mechanism that reacts to real-time input statistics.
