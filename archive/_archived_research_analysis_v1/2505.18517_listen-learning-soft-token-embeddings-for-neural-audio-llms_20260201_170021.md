## Executive Summary

Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for audio processing currently faces significant challenges due to the standard reliance on discrete audio tokenization. This method converts continuous audio signals into text-like tokens, introducing quantization loss and training instability while necessitating large-scale, task-specific datasets. Furthermore, existing models often overfit in multitask settings due to excessive parameter tuning.

**LiSTEN** (Learning Soft Token Embeddings for Neural Audio LLMs) addresses the critical challenge of efficiently integrating continuous audio modalities into pre-trained LLMs without sacrificing stability or incurring prohibitive computational costs. The framework introduces a parameter-efficient solution that bypasses discrete tokenization entirely by utilizing continuous soft token embeddings.

The architecture is distinguished by a **simplified single-stage training process** and a mechanism based on learnable key-value pairs for task-specific information storage. Audio features are projected into a query space to retrieve relevant prompts (the "values") by matching learned "keys." These selected continuous soft tokens are then mapped into the input space of a frozen LLM backbone. Crucially, the system freezes the LLM weights and updates only the projector and key-value prompt embeddings.

Evaluated across diverse tasks, LiSTEN matches or strictly outperforms discrete token baselines with an order of magnitude fewer trainable parameters. The framework demonstrates superior data efficiency, mitigating overfitting by narrowing the performance gap between large-scale and small-scale training data. By eliminating heavy discrete tokenization, LiSTEN preserves the continuous nuances of audio signals—such as prosody and subtle acoustic cues—resulting in richer, higher-fidelity representations.

## Key Findings

*   **Parameter Efficiency:** Achieves competitive performance with significantly fewer trainable parameters (reduced by an order of magnitude) compared to discrete token baselines.
*   **Data Efficiency:** Reduces reliance on large-scale task-specific datasets and shows a smaller performance gap between large and small-scale data scenarios.
*   **Robustness:** Prevents overfitting in multitask settings through restricted parameter updating.
*   **Interpretability:** Offers enhanced interpretability through prompt analysis, confirming that learned embeddings cluster semantically by phonemes or audio events.

## Methodology

The authors propose **LiSTEN**, a novel framework designed to adapt pre-trained LLMs for audio modalities. The methodology centers on replacing the standard discrete audio tokenization process with a dynamic, continuous approach:

1.  **Dynamic Prompt Selection:** Instead of static inputs, the model uses learnable key-value pairs to retrieve task-specific information dynamically.
2.  **Continuous Projection:** Audio inputs are processed by a pre-trained audio encoder (e.g., HuBERT) and passed through a trainable projector. This outputs continuous vectors without the need for quantization.
3.  **LLM Integration:** The resulting continuous soft tokens are fed into a frozen LLM backbone (e.g., LLaMA-2), allowing the model to leverage the reasoning capabilities of the LLM without modifying its weights.

This approach utilizes a **simplified single-stage training process** that contrasts sharply with the complex multi-stage pipelines often required in audio-language tasks.
