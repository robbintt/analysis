## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical limitation of current Large Language Models (LLMs) in acquiring and reasoning with "local knowledge"—facts and cultural context specific to particular regions, particularly in languages underrepresented in training data such as Czech, Slovak, and Ukrainian. While LLMs excel at general-domain benchmarks, they frequently fail to grasp region-specific nuances that are intuitive to native speakers. This gap is problematic because robust AI systems must operate effectively across diverse linguistic landscapes, not merely in English-centric or global contexts. The paper highlights the absence of rigorous, multi-modal benchmarks to evaluate this specific capability, necessitating a resource that moves beyond general knowledge to test deep, region-specific understanding across different modalities.

The core innovation is the introduction of CUS-QA, a comprehensive, manually curated benchmark for open-ended regional question answering covering both textual and visual modalities, explicitly including English translations to facilitate broader research. The dataset is constructed using a rigorous human-in-the-loop workflow where native speakers identify region-specific facts from Wikipedia pages filtered by DBPedia entities and language exclusivity. To ensure high quality, the authors employed a custom web annotation tool with strict quality control, resulting in a 22% rejection rate and 8% correction rate. Technically, the pipeline leverages Claude 3.5 Sonnet for high-fidelity automatic cross-lingual translation, GliNER for entity recognition, and LLaMA 3.3 70B for categorizing questions into six distinct types (Geography, Culture, Politics, History, Sports, Other).

Evaluation of state-of-the-art open-weight LLMs on the CUS-QA benchmark reveals significant performance gaps, with the best models achieving only slightly over 40% accuracy on textual questions and less than 30% on visual questions. The evaluation utilized specific prompting techniques, testing textual and visual models using zero-shot prompting with nucleus sampling ($p=0.9$). Geography emerged as the dominant category, covering 32% to 60% of the dataset, a variance reflecting the distribution of entities across the target languages. An important methodological finding is that while LLM-based evaluation metrics demonstrated a strong correlation with human judgments, traditional string-overlap metrics (like BLEU or ROUGE) also performed well. The researchers attribute this to the structure of the answers, which are typically short noun phrases averaging ~20–30 characters with a high density of named entities.

The CUS-QA benchmark provides the field with a vital tool for diagnosing and improving the cultural and linguistic adaptability of LLMs. By establishing that even top-performing open-weight models struggle with region-specific multi-modal queries, the paper sets a new, more difficult standard for model evaluation that extends beyond English-centric data. The findings regarding evaluation metrics offer practical guidance to the community, validating the use of LLM-based evaluators while noting that string-overlap metrics may be sufficient for entity-heavy tasks. Ultimately, this work underscores the necessity of incorporating diverse, human-verified local knowledge into training pipelines to develop truly global AI systems.

## Key Findings

*   **Performance Gap:** Even the best open-weight LLMs struggle significantly with the benchmark.
    *   **Textual Questions:** Slightly over **40%** accuracy.
    *   **Visual Questions:** Less than **30%** accuracy.
*   **Metric Correlation:** LLM-based evaluation metrics show a **strong correlation** with human judgments.
*   **String-Overlap Efficacy:** Traditional string-overlap metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) perform surprisingly well, largely because correct answers contain a high prevalence of named entities.
