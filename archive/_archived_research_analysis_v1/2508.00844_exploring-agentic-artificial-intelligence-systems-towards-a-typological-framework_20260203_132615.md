## Executive Summary

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has given rise to "agentic" systems capable of autonomous action, yet the field currently lacks a standardized structural classification framework. This absence creates a significant gap in the literature, hindering researchers and practitioners from effectively comparing systems, assessing specific capabilities, or evaluating the risks associated with varying levels of autonomy. Without a common taxonomy, it is difficult to systematically analyze the spectrum of agency or anticipate how these systems will evolve, making the development of a rigorous typological framework a critical prerequisite for the disciplined study of agentic AI.

To address this, the authors developed a comprehensive **Typological Framework** defined by eight distinct dimensions structured ordinally to allow for scaled assessment rather than binary categorization. The architecture bifurcates agency into two primary domains:

*   **Cognitive Agency:** Governs internal processing and decision-making.
*   **Environmental Agency:** Dictates the system's interaction with and impact on the external world.

The framework was constructed and validated using a **human-AI hybrid methodology**, which combined human domain expertise with AI capabilities to distill complex dimensions into specific "constructed types" or archetypes.

The primary result of this research is the successful validation and operationalization of the typological framework, which enables the granular analysis of agency levels across current AI systems. While the study does not utilize traditional quantitative metrics such as accuracy scores or benchmarks, its output is the generation of distinct "constructed types" derived from the intersection of the eight ordinal dimensions. This allows for the precise differentiation of AI systems based on their degree of agency, providing a validated metric for assessing where a system falls on the cognitive and environmental spectrums.

This work establishes a foundational analytical tool that serves as a significant reference point for both academic research and practical application in the field of AI. By offering a structural method for classifying and comparing agentic systems, the framework provides a common language for discussing autonomy and capability. This contribution is vital for anticipating future developments in agentic AI, enabling stakeholders to better understand the trajectory of the technology and make more informed decisions regarding system design, implementation, and governance.

## Technical Details

**Typological Framework Architecture**

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Function** | Designed to classify and assess Agentic AI systems. |
| **Dimensions** | Defined by **8 distinct dimensions** structured ordinally for scaled assessment. |
| **Primary Domains** | • **Cognitive Agency:** Internal processing and decision-making capabilities.<br>• **Environmental Agency:** Interaction and impact on the external world. |
| **Output** | Produces **'constructed types'** (archetypes) derived from the intersection of these dimensions. |

**Assessment Methodology**
*   The framework does not rely on traditional quantitative metrics (e.g., accuracy scores, benchmarks, dataset sizes).
*   The primary "metric" is the **ordinal scaling capability** of the framework itself.
