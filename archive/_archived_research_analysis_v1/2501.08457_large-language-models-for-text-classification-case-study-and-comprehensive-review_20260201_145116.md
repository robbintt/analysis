## 📋 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the operational uncertainty surrounding the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for text classification, specifically weighing the high computational cost and latency of decoder-only models against the efficiency of traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning baselines. As organizations seek to integrate generative AI, the critical dilemma is whether the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs translate to sufficient predictive performance to justify their resource intensity compared to lightweight alternatives like SVM or RoBERTa.

The key innovation is a rigorous experimental framework that benchmarks a diverse architectural spectrum—including Mistral, Llama3, GPT-4, Gemma, and RoBERTa—across two distinct task complexities: a multiclass classification of employee work locations and a binary fake news detection task. The technical setup employs aggressive optimization strategies (AWQ quantization, vLLM, Groq LPU accelerators) to ensure fair hardware comparisons and systematically varies prompt engineering strategies.

Results highlight a distinct performance dichotomy tied to task complexity. In multiclass scenarios, LLMs achieved superior Weighted F1-scores (GPT-4: 0.86), validating the necessity of deep contextual reasoning. However, for binary tasks, traditional ML models offered a superior performance-to-time trade-off, delivering competitive accuracy with millisecond latency. This research establishes vital evidence-based guidelines, defining the "break-even" points at which the resource intensity of LLMs yields practical returns over simpler alternatives.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Task Complexity dictates Model Choice:**
    *   **Multiclass/Complex:** LLMs (specifically Llama3 and GPT-4) outperform state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models.
    *   **Binary/Simple:** Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models provide a better performance-to-time trade-off.
*   **Latency vs. Accuracy:** While LLMs offer high accuracy for complex tasks, they incur significantly longer inference times compared to simpler ML models.
*   **Sensitivity to Prompting:** There are significant variations in model responses and performance based on the specific prompting strategies employed (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Few-shot).
*   **Practical Applicability:** The decision to use an LLM depends heavily on the complexity of the classification task and the acceptable latency thresholds of the application.
