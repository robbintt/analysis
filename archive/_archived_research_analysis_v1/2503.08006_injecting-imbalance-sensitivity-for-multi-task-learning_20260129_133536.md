## 📄 Executive Summary

Current optimization-based Multi-Task Learning (MTL) paradigms suffer from a critical oversight: they disproportionately prioritize resolving task conflicts—where gradients point in opposing directions—while neglecting the more pervasive issue of task imbalance and dominance. This research identifies that in many scenarios, performance degradation stems not from conflicting directions, but from the magnitude of a single task's gradient overwhelming the shared representation. This dominance causes the model to converge to solutions that favor the dominant task, effectively erasing the progress of smaller or noisier tasks. Addressing this imbalance is essential for developing robust MTL systems that perform well across all tasks rather than averaging performance.

The authors introduce **IMGrad (IMbalance-sensitive Gradient descent)**, a novel optimization algorithm designed to inject "imbalance-sensitivity" directly into the learning process. Technically, IMGrad enhances existing baseline MTL techniques by imposing mathematical constraints on the projected norms of the gradients. Unlike conflict-focused methods (e.g., PCGrad, CAGrad) that manipulate gradient directions, IMGrad specifically regulates gradient magnitudes to prevent single-task domination. By constraining projected norms, the method ensures balanced progress across all tasks during representation learning and seeks Pareto optimality without allowing high-magnitude tasks to hijack the optimization trajectory.

Empirical testing highlights IMGrad’s superior ability to handle dominance, particularly in a synthetic imbalanced benchmark with task weights of 0.9 and 0.1. Where baseline methods such as Linear Scalarization, PCGrad, CAGrad, and Nash-MTL failed to converge to the global optimum or suffered from severe optimization bias, IMGrad successfully adhered to the Pareto front. A key metric introduced in the study, the **"Imbalance Ratio,"** demonstrated that PCGrad surged to levels between 120-150—indicating critical domination—while IMGrad maintained a stable ratio near zero. Additionally, the method validated its robustness by delivering consistently competitive performance across mainstream benchmarks in both supervised learning and reinforcement learning domains.

This research significantly shifts the narrative in gradient-based MTL by establishing norm constraints as a viable and superior mechanism for addressing dominance issues. By proving that task imbalance is often a more significant bottleneck than task conflict, the authors highlight a critical gap in previous research. The broad applicability of IMGrad suggests that future MTL frameworks must inherently account for gradient magnitude to ensure fairness and performance across disparate tasks.

## Methodology

The authors propose a novel optimization algorithm named **IMGrad (IMbalance-sensitive Gradient descent)**. This method enhances existing baseline MTL techniques by explicitly injecting 'imbalance-sensitivity' into the optimization process.

Specifically, this is achieved by imposing mathematical constraints on the **projected norms of the gradients**. This approach shifts the focus from solely mitigating task conflicts to addressing the dominance of certain tasks over others during the representation learning phase.
