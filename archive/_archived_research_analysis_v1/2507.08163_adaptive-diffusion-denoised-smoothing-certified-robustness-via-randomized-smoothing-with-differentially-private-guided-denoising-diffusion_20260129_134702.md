## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of certifying robustness in deep learning models against adversarial attacks, specifically targeting the $\ell_2$ threat model on the complex ImageNet dataset. The fundamental difficulty lies in providing mathematically sound certifications—guaranteeing that a model’s prediction remains constant within a defined radius of an input—without significantly compromising accuracy on clean data. Existing randomized smoothing methods often force a detrimental trade-off, where increasing the robustness guarantee leads to a sharp decline in standard performance.

The key innovation, **Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing**, bridges generative modeling and robust classification by theoretically reinterpreting guided denoising diffusion models as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) mechanisms. Technically, the method employs a GDP privacy filter to manage the composition of these mechanisms throughout the diffusion process. This allows for the certification mechanism to adapt dynamically to the specific input image being processed, utilizing privacy accounting tools to provide a rigorous, end-to-end analysis of robustness that was previously unattainable.

Evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed method substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines. The model achieves a **standard accuracy of approximately 58.3%** and a **certified accuracy of roughly 28.1%** at an $\ell_2$ radius of 0.5. This represents a significant gain compared to the previous leading diffusion-based method (DiffSmooth at ~21.5%) and traditional Gaussian smoothing (~16.0%). These results confirm that the integration of guided diffusion with GDP composition yields a practically superior model, setting a new benchmark for verifiably robust AI systems.

## 🧪 Methodology

The methodology re-frames guided denoising diffusion models into a framework suitable for robustness certification by leveraging concepts from differential privacy.

1.  **Re-framing Diffusion:** Guided denoising diffusion models are viewed not just as generative tools, but as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms that refine noise into images.
2.  **GDP Privacy Filter:** The approach employs a GDP privacy filter to analyze how these mechanisms compose over time. This filter tracks the privacy budget (which correlates here to the robustness guarantee) across the diffusion steps.
3.  **Adaptive Randomized Smoothing:** By utilizing GDP composition results, the method extends traditional randomized smoothing. It provides a certification method for vision model predictions that adapts to the specific input data, rather than applying a uniform smoothing process regardless of input complexity.
