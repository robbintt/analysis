## Executive Summary

Parametric optimization in critical infrastructure faces a fundamental paradox: traditional exact solvers offer mathematical rigor but are computationally prohibitive for real-time operations. This latency creates a critical gap between Operations Research capabilities and the operational requirements of modern power grids, particularly for complex tasks like Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SCOPF) and Economic Dispatch. As grid complexity grows, the inability to solve these massive formulations in real-time prevents operators from performing essential N-1 contingency analyses, forcing a trade-off between analytical depth and operational speed.

This paper introduces **"Optimization Proxies,"** a novel class of differentiable programs designed under a **"Trustworthiness by Design"** paradigm to learn the input/output mapping $\Phi(x) = \text{argmin}_y f_x(y)$. The architecture utilizes a hybrid mechanism that fuses deep learning universal approximators with specialized constraint-handling layers: repair layers ($\Phi^\uparrow$) to transform raw outputs into strictly feasible primal solutions, and completion layers ($\Phi^\downarrow$) to ensure valid lower bounds in dual proxies.

This structure enables end-to-end self-supervised training, allowing the system to learn directly from problem structure and historical data without external labeled datasets while rigorously maintaining physical feasibility. The methodology delivers efficiency improvements of **"orders of magnitude"** relative to state-of-the-art solvers, a performance gain that successfully shifts the resolution of complex formulations like SCOPF from offline analysis to real-time execution.

Rather than relying on standard regression loss ($L_2$ norm), the study validates results using strict operational metrics: **Feasibility** (100% adherence to equality and inequality constraints) and **Bound Quality** (ensuring dual outputs provide mathematically valid lower bounds). This capability allows for the real-time assessment of systems with significant combinatorial complexity, handling the burdensome computational load associated with exhaustive N-1 contingency screening that typically bogs down traditional optimization tools.

This work formally establishes "Optimization Learning" as a discipline bridging machine learning and operations research, fundamentally shifting the focus from black-box prediction to constrained decision support. By integrating differentiable programming with domain-specific constraints, the approach provides the mathematical guarantees required for high-stakes environments where feasibility is non-negotiable.

## Methodology

The methodology centers on the design of **'optimimization proxies'** conceptualized as differentiable programs. The architecture combines traditional deep learning technologies with repair or completion layers; the deep learning component predicts solutions while the repair layers enforce feasibility.

These models are trained **end-to-end** using a self-supervised learning approach. This allows the system to learn directly from problem structure and data without explicit external labeling.
