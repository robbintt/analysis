## Executive Summary

As the machine learning landscape becomes increasingly dominated by deep learning (DL) approaches, the unique advantages of classical margin-based methods are often overlooked. This paper addresses the critical lack of consolidated research regarding the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin Support Vector Machines (TWSVMs) within multi-task frameworks. While DL offers high performance, it often lacks the interpretability, theoretical rigor, and data efficiency required in high-stakes fields like bioinformatics and safety-critical systems. This survey re-positions margin-based methods as viable, scalable alternatives, particularly for small datasets or complex theoretical constraints.

The key innovation is the development of a granular taxonomic framework classifying MTL architectures by their knowledge-sharing mechanisms:
*   **Feature-Based:** Utilizing $l_{2,1}$ regularization to enforce sparsity across tasks.
*   **Parameter-Based:** Employing low-rank constraints and task covariance to couple parameters.
*   **Instance-Based:** Strategies such as data pooling and co-regularization.

The authors provide a distinct technical contribution through the detailed analysis of TWSVMs, which differ from standard SVMs by generating two non-parallel hyperplanes optimized via two smaller Quadratic Programming Problems (QPPs) rather than one large QPP. The survey systematically reviews 40 research papers, mapping theoretical properties and optimization strategies across supervised and semi-supervised settings.

Synthesizing qualitative findings, the report indicates that margin-based MTL models consistently outperform DL baselines in interpretability and small-sample efficacy. Specifically, TWSVM-based approaches offer superior computational efficiency and better handling of imbalanced datasets. Feature-based MTL methods utilizing $l_{2,1}$ regularization show marked efficacy in high-dimensional environments by reducing overfitting. However, the survey identifies **Negative Transfer**—where combining unrelated tasks degrades performance—as a primary failure mode.

By mapping current limitations and future directions, this work encourages the development of scalable, reliable non-deep learning frameworks, influencing the community to revisit classical methods for modern applications in computer vision, NLP, and bioinformatics.
