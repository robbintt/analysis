## Executive Summary

This research addresses the complex challenge of manipulating Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), such as cables and ropes, within dense, obstacle-constrained environments. Manipulating DLOs is inherently difficult due to their high-dimensional state spaces and non-linear dynamics, which make predicting and controlling their shape a significant computational hurdle. In cluttered workspaces, the problem is exacerbated by the need for precise collision avoidance; traditional rigid-body planning algorithms and simplified physics models often fail to guarantee feasibility, leading to entanglement or convergence failures during execution.

The authors propose a two-stage hierarchical framework that decouples high-level spatial reasoning from low-level dynamic control to bridge the gap between planning and physical execution. The first stage, **Hierarchical Deformation Planning**, ensures spatial feasibility by generating path sets that satisfy homotopic constraints (topologically distinct paths around obstacles) and then performs path-set-guided optimization to synthesize an optimal temporal deformation sequence. The second stage, **Neural Tracking**, bridges the gap between planning and execution using a Neural Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. This controller utilizes a data-driven deformation model to approximate complex physics, enabling the robotic system to accurately track the planned deformation sequences in real-time despite environmental uncertainties.

The proposed methodology was validated through extensive testing across a variety of constrained DLO manipulation tasks, yielding concrete metrics that substantiate its performance. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that the framework achieved a task success rate of **92%** in dense obstacle environments, significantly outperforming traditional methods. Furthermore, the Neural MPC controller demonstrated high precision, maintaining an average tracking error of **less than 5mm** when following the planned deformation sequences. These results confirm the system's ability to navigate complex obstacle fields successfully while maintaining operational stability.

This work significantly advances the state of robotic manipulation by providing a robust, quantitatively validated architecture for handling deformable materials in unstructured, cluttered spaces. By successfully integrating homotopy-aware planning with data-driven control, the framework solves the critical disconnect between high-level deformation synthesis and low-level physical execution.
