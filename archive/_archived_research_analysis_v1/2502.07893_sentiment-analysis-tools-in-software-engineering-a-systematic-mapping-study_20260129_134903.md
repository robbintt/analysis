# Sentiment Analysis Tools in Software Engineering: A Systematic Mapping Study

*Martin Obaidi; Lukas Nagel; Alexander Specht; Jil Klünder*

---

> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> The application of sentiment analysis within Software Engineering (SE) has grown significantly as researchers seek to understand developer emotions and team dynamics through text data found in commit messages, issue trackers, and communication forums. However, the field has become fragmented, populated by a wide array of tools, algorithms, and datasets with no standardized framework for comparison or selection.
>
> To address this fragmentation, the authors performed a **Systematic Mapping Study (SMS)** analyzing **106 primary studies**. The study introduces a rigorous classification framework based on six dimensions: application domain, purpose, datasets, approaches, existing tool usage, and difficulties.
>
> **Key Takeaways:**
> *   **Performance:** Neural Networks are the dominant and best-performing approach, with **BERT** identified as the highest-performing specific tool (RoBERTa achieved an F1-score of 0.83).
> *   **Scope:** The technology is predominantly applied to **Open Source Software (OSS)**, accounting for **74.5%** of analyzed papers.
> *   **Challenges:** The primary hurdles are "Adaptation to SE Domain" and the detection of complex linguistic nuances like "Irony/Sarcasm."
>
> This study provides a definitive benchmark for the SE community, recommending Neural Network-based approaches and highlighting the need to adapt general-purpose NLP models to the unique vernacular of software engineering.
