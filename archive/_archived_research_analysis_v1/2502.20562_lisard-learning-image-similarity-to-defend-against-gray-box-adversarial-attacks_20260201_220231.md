## 🎯 Executive Summary

Deep neural networks face **critical vulnerabilities under realistic gray-box threat models**—where attackers possess complete knowledge of model architectures and training datasets but lack gradient access—yet current defenses systematically fail to address this operational scenario. The adversarial robustness literature suffers from **profound evaluation bias**: methods like Adversarial Distillation (AD) are predominantly validated against unrealistic white-box attacks (full gradient access), creating a false sense of security that collapses when exposed to gray-box constraints.

**LISArD** introduces a computationally efficient, AT-free defense based on dual-objective optimization that eliminates dependency on expensive adversarial data augmentation. The method simultaneously trains networks for standard classification while enforcing geometric constraints on feature embeddings through similarity-based regularization. Concretely, for each training pair consisting of a clean image and its adversarially perturbed counterpart, the network constructs **cross-correlation matrices** between their latent embeddings and trains to diagonalize these matrices—minimizing off-diagonal correlations that represent entanglement between adversarial signals and legitimate features.

Unlike Adversarial Training's prohibitive 5–10× computational overhead, LISArD incurs **zero additional computational cost** relative to standard training while maintaining compatibility across ResNet, WideResNet, and Vision Transformer architectures. Comparative analysis reveals that existing state-of-the-art defenses (specifically Adversarial Distillation) exhibit **severe degradation** when decoupled from AT or exposed to gray-box rather than white-box attacks, exposing reliance on gradient obfuscation rather than genuine robustness.

This work establishes **gray-box evaluation as a necessary benchmark** for operational security assessment, shifting the field's focus from gradient-access assumptions toward practical, limited-knowledge attacker models.

## 🔑 Key Findings

- **Vulnerability in Realistic Threat Models**: Deep neural networks exhibit substantial vulnerability to gray-box adversarial attacks, where attackers possess complete knowledge of model architecture and training datasets but lack access to gradient information.

- **Computational Efficiency without AT**: LISArD achieves effective robustness against both gray-box and white-box attacks without requiring Adversarial Training (AT), while incurring **no additional computational or temporal costs** compared to standard training.

- **Generalization Across Architectures**: The defense mechanism demonstrates cross-architecture compatibility, with defensive capabilities that successfully transfer from gray-box to white-box attack scenarios.

- **Limitations of Existing Defenses**: State-of-the-art Adversarial Distillation (AD) models exhibit severe performance degradation when decoupled from AT or evaluated against gray-box (rather than white-box) attacks, indicating critical robustness deficiencies in current evaluation paradigms.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### Dual-Objective Optimization Framework
LISArD simultaneously conducts standard classification learning while enforcing geometric constraints on feature embeddings through similarity-based regularization.

### Cross-Correlation Matrix Diagonalization
The core mechanism constructs cross-correlation matrices using embeddings from paired clean and perturbed images, then trains the network to approximate these matrices toward **diagonal configurations** (minimizing off-diagonal correlations).

### Embedding-Space Alignment
This diagonalization constraint enforces **orthogonality or disentanglement** between adversarial perturbation signals and clean image representations, effectively neutralizing adversarial artifacts at the feature level.

### Realistic Threat Model Evaluation
The methodology establishes rigorous evaluation protocols against **gray-box attacks** (attacker capabilities: architecture knowledge + dataset knowledge; attacker constraints: no gradient access) rather than relying solely on unrealistic white-box assumptions.
