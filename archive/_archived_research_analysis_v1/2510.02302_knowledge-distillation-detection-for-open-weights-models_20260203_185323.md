## Executive Summary

**Problem**
As the prevalence of open-weight AI models grows, ensuring model provenance and protecting intellectual property (IP) becomes increasingly critical. This paper addresses the novel challenge of Knowledge Distillation Detection (KDD): determining whether a specific "teacher" model was used to distill knowledge into a target "student" model. This issue is of paramount importance because distillation is frequently used for both legitimate model compression and malicious model theft; however, detecting this lineage is historically difficult without access to the original training data or the internal training logs.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce a model-agnostic framework designed to operate in a practical, data-free setting, requiring only access to the student's weights and the teacher's black-box API. The core innovation is a three-stage pipeline consisting of Input Construction, Score Computation, and Prediction. Technically, the method employs a Mixup-based strategy to synthesize inputs that maximize student confidence while aligning with the student’s Batch Normalization Statistics (BNS). Detection is formulated as a multiple-choice task, utilizing a Point-wise Score (based on the inverse of KL Divergence) and a Set-level Score (Aligned Cosine Similarity using SVD on centered logit matrices) to measure statistical dependencies between the student and potential teachers.

**Results**
The proposed method demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks. In image classification tasks, the framework achieved **59.6%** accuracy on CIFAR-10 and **71.2%** accuracy on ImageNet. Furthermore, the approach exhibits broad applicability beyond discriminative tasks, achieving **20.0%** accuracy in detecting distillation within text-to-image generation scenarios. These results validate the method's ability to reliably identify the source teacher model from a pool of candidates.

**Impact**
This research formally defines the KDD task and provides the first comprehensive, practical solution for detecting distillation lineage without training data. By establishing a feasible detection mechanism in a resource-constrained environment (using only student weights and teacher APIs), the work offers a vital tool for auditing the AI supply chain and protecting model IP. The release of open-source implementation code further ensures that the findings will serve as a benchmark for future research in model security and provenance for both discriminative and generative architectures.

## Methodology

The researchers introduce a **model-agnostic framework** designed to detect knowledge distillation without access to training datasets. The methodology relies on two core components:

1.  **Data-free Input Synthesis:** Probing the models to generate synthetic inputs that maximize the student model's confidence.
2.  **Statistical Score Computation:** Analyzing the interactions between the synthesized inputs, the student weights, and the outputs from the teacher API to determine lineage.

## Technical Details

The approach formulates Knowledge Distillation Detection (KDD) as a multiple-choice task to identify if a specific teacher model distilled a student model. It operates under strict constraints: open-weight student access, black-box teacher API access, and data-free availability.

### Pipeline Architecture

The framework utilizes a three-stage pipeline:

1.  **Input Construction**
2.  **Score Computation**
3.  **Prediction**

### Input Synthesis Strategy
*   **Technique:** Mixup-based strategy.
*   **Optimization:** A generator is trained to maximize student confidence.
*   **Alignment:** Aligns Batch Normalization Statistics (BNS) with the student's internal data distribution.

### Scoring Metrics
Detection relies on two primary metrics to measure statistical dependencies:

*   **Point-wise Score:** Calculated as the inverse of KL Divergence.
*   **Set-level Score:** Calculated using Aligned Cosine Similarity (ACS), applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on centered logit matrices.
