> ### 📑 Executive Summary
>
> Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is fundamentally constrained by the difficulty of maintaining precise spatio-temporal alignment between linguistic queries and dynamic visual content. Traditional supervised models frequently generate hallucinations—text that is semantically plausible but visually ungrounded—and struggle to track objects over time. Furthermore, these systems rely heavily on expensive, task-specific annotated datasets, which severely limits their generalization capabilities to new domains or questions involving novel objects.

> The authors introduce **ViQAgent**, a zero-shot closed-loop agent framework that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) as a central controller for visual understanding. The system integrates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework to decompose complex queries and employs YOLO-World for open-vocabulary object detection, enabling localization without predefined class constraints. The core technical advancement is the **Grounding Validation Loop**: a mechanism that generates spatio-temporal hypotheses (e.g., an object’s presence at a specific timestamp), cross-checks these against grounded visual evidence from YOLO-World, and filters answers based on detection confidence scores. This creates a self-correcting pipeline where reasoning is strictly verified against observed pixel data.

> ViQAgent achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the NExT-QA, iVQA, and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. Significantly, this zero-shot approach outperformed existing supervised methods, demonstrating superior generalization without task-specific training data. Ablative studies quantified the contribution of the system's architecture, confirming that the Grounding Validation Loop was the primary driver of success. This research demonstrates that modular, zero-shot agent architectures can surpass the performance of supervised SOTA models, offering substantial efficiency gains by eliminating the need for expensive, large-scale video annotations.
