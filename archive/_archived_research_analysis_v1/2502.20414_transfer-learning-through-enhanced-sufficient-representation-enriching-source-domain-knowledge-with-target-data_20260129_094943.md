## 📝 Executive Summary

Traditional transfer learning is severely limited in scenarios where target domains suffer from data scarcity or structural divergence from source domains. Existing methods generally rely on strict domain invariance or rigid structural assumptions, such as requiring identical model types (e.g., restricting transfer from regression to regression). This paper addresses the critical challenge of **heterogeneous transfer learning**—enabling effective knowledge transfer when source and target tasks differ fundamentally (e.g., regression to classification)—without requiring structural alignment. Solving this is essential for broadening the applicability of transfer learning to real-world problems where abundant source data exists but is structurally distinct from the target.

The core innovation is the **Transfer Learning through Enhanced Sufficient Representation (TESR)** framework, a two-phase paradigm that decouples source knowledge from target-specific adaptation. Technically, TESR constructs a final representation by concatenating two independent components: the **Sufficient and Invariant Representation ($R_c$)** and the **Enhanced Target Representation ($R_t$)**. 

*   In **Phase 1**, $R_c$ is estimated from pooled source data to preserve predictor-response sufficiency and ensure domain invariance.
*   In **Phase 2**, $R_t$ is derived from target data under the strict constraint that it must be orthogonal to $R_c$.

This mathematical separation ensures that the source component provides a robust foundation while the target component captures unique nuances, satisfying **Target Sufficiency** (conditional independence of the target response from predictors given the representation) and eliminating the need for structural similarity.

The research validates TESR through theoretical proofs and extensive empirical testing across simulated and real-world datasets. In finite sample settings with scarce target data, TESR demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to traditional transfer learning baselines, which fail to account for structural heterogeneity. The method effectively manages complex task shifts, specifically achieving high accuracy and stability when transferring from regression-based source models to classification-based targets. Empirical studies confirm that the framework achieves reliable convergence and maintains sound statistical properties, minimizing error rates where rigid approaches struggle. These results provide concrete quantitative evidence that leveraging multiple source domains via orthogonal representation significantly enhances distinct target tasks.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Effectiveness in Finite Samples:** The TESR method demonstrates strong performance even when target data is scarce, validated through both simulation studies and real-world applications.
*   **Overcoming Traditional Limitations:** Successfully removes the requirement for a high degree of similarity or rigid structural assumptions between source and target domains.
*   **Handling Heterogeneous Tasks:** The method is versatile enough to transfer knowledge between fundamentally different task types, such as from regression-based source models to classification-based target tasks.
*   **Theoretical Soundness:** Theoretical analysis confirms that the method possesses properties suitable for a wide range of supervised learning problems.

## 🔬 Methodology

The TESR methodology follows a distinct two-phase process designed to bridge the gap between source and target domains:

### Phase 1: Source Representation Estimation
This phase involves estimating a **'sufficient and invariant representation'** based solely on the data from source domains. This creates a foundational knowledge base that is robust across source environments.

### Phase 2: Target Data Enhancement
This phase augments the initial representation by integrating an independent component specifically derived from the target data. This integration ensures the resulting representation is sufficient for the target domain while remaining adaptable to its unique characteristics.

## ⚙️ Technical Specifications

The proposed framework, **Transfer Learning through Enhanced Sufficient Representation (TESR)**, is formulated to handle heterogeneous tasks (e.g., regression to classification) using predictors $X$ and responses $Y$.

### Representation Structure
The final representation is a concatenation of two distinct components:
1.  **Sufficient and Invariant Representation ($R_c$):**
    *   Derived from pooled source data.
    *   Ensures predictor-response sufficiency and domain invariance.
2.  **Enhanced Target Representation ($R_t$):**
    *   Derived from target data.
    *   Constrained to be independent of $R_c$.
    *   Captures target-specific information.

### Key Conditions
*   **Target Sufficiency:** $Y_0$ is independent of $X_0$ given the combined representation.
*   **Orthogonality:** $R_c$ must be independent of $R_t$.

### Estimation Procedure
1.  Estimate $R_c$ from source data.
2.  Estimate $R_t$ from target data under the orthogonality constraint.
