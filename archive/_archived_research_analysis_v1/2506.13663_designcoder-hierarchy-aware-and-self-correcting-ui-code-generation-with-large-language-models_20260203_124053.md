## 📝 Executive Summary

> This research addresses the critical limitations of current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in automating front-end development, specifically the generation of React Native code from UI design mockups. Existing models frequently struggle with visual consistency, functional completeness, and the preservation of complex, nested UI hierarchies. These deficiencies result in code that is often structurally unsound and visually inaccurate, preventing the widespread adoption of automated tools in professional, agile development environments where high-fidelity translation from design to implementation is essential.
>
> The authors introduce **DesignCoder**, a novel framework that employs a hierarchy-aware and self-correcting architecture to improve code generation. The system operates through a three-step process: first, UI Grouping Chains utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy to parse complex mockups into hierarchical component trees; second, a Hierarchical Code Generation module translates this structure into organized code and styles; and third, a Self-Correction Mechanism creates a feedback loop. This loop leverages Appium to render the generated code, capture screenshots, and visually compare them against the original designs to automatically identify and rectify rendering errors, such as misalignment or missing elements.
>
> In an evaluation of 300 high-fidelity mockups against strong baselines including GPT-4o, DesignCoder demonstrated substantial performance gains. Visual similarity metrics improved by **37.63% in MSE**, **9.52% in CLIP Score**, and **12.82% in SSIM**, indicating superior visual fidelity. Furthermore, code structure similarity saw significant increases, with a **30.19% improvement in TreeBLEU**, **29.31% in Container Match**, and **24.67% in Tree Edit Distance**. Beyond quantitative metrics, a user study with professional developers confirmed that the generated code scored highly in usability, readability, and maintainability.
>
> DesignCoder represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted software engineering, establishing the first framework specifically designed to address hierarchy and self-correction in UI code generation. By bridging the gap between design mockups and production-ready code, this work sets a new benchmark for React Native generation and validates the potential of LLMs to align with industry best practices.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The proposed framework, DesignCoder, utilizes a three-step hierarchical and self-correcting process:

1.  **UI Grouping Chains:** Enhances the MLLM's capability to understand and predict complex, nested UI hierarchies from mockups.
2.  **Hierarchical Divide-and-Conquer:** Breaks down front-end code generation into a hierarchical structure for better layout management.
3.  **Self-Correction Mechanism:** Features an integrated feedback loop to assess the fidelity of rendered pages and automatically identify and rectify code errors.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

DesignCoder translates UI design mockups into React Native code to address limitations in visual fidelity, structural hierarchy, and error correction. Its architecture consists of three core modules:

### 1. UI Grouping Chain (Hierarchy Extraction)
*   **Strategy:** Constructs a hierarchical component tree using a divide-and-conquer strategy.
*   **Validation:** Utilizes algorithmic validation for non-overlapping regions.
*   **Prompting:** Employs a two-stage prompting strategy for semantic extraction and component grouping.

### 2. Hierarchy-Aware Code Generation
*   **Process:** Generates structured code and styles based on the component tree.
*   **Approach:** Uses a divide-and-conquer approach and a 4-step prompt to ensure organized output.

### 3. Self-Correcting Code Refinement
*   **Rendering:** Leverages **Appium** to render code and capture screenshots.
*   **Comparison:** Compares rendered screenshots against original designs to identify errors.
*   **Repair:** Generates repair suggestions and merges the refined code snippets.
