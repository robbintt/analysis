## Executive Summary

This research addresses the persistent challenge of converting graphical design files (specifically PSDs) into executable, production-ready front-end code. Existing automated design-to-code methods frequently fail to bridge the gap between visual design and structural implementation, resulting in code that suffers from structural inconsistencies, asset misalignment, and poor visual fidelity. As these tools often require significant manual refactoring to be deployable, they create a bottleneck in the development workflow. Solving this problem is critical for advancing automated software engineering and enabling the seamless transition from design to industrial-grade web applications.

The key innovation is the **"ParseAlignGenerate" pipeline**, a three-stage framework that adopts a "PSD-first" approach to provide precise structural context rather than relying on free-form visual synthesis. Technically, the system operates by first parsing the PSD file to extract hierarchical layer trees, normalize coordinates, and classify elements (containers, text, or images). In the second stage, a constraint-based alignment strategy maps design references to engineering assets, ensuring strict resource consistency. Finally, the generation stage utilizes Structured Prompt Construction to feed this aligned, structured data into a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), which synthesizes the output into React+SCSS code.

The PSD2Code system was evaluated on a dataset of 150 real-world UI designs using comprehensive metrics including Code Similarity (CodeBLEU, CodeBERT), Visual Similarity (SSIM, PSNR, MSE), and Layout Detection (mAP, APs, APm, APl). The method demonstrated significant performance gains over existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a **CodeBLEU score of 0.438** and a **CodeBERT score of 0.652**, which markedly outperform baseline models. In terms of visual fidelity, the system attained an **SSIM of 0.912** and a **PSNR of 28.5 dB**, reflecting high perceptual quality. Furthermore, the framework achieved a **mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.724** in layout detection, validating its robustness in structural understanding.

The significance of this research lies in its establishment of a new state-of-the-art standard for design-driven automated front-end development. By successfully integrating structured design information with multimodal LLMs, PSD2Code moves the field closer to true "production-ready" automation, reducing the need for developer intervention to fix structural or asset errors. Furthermore, the framework's independence from specific model architectures suggests a robust, generalizable solution that can evolve alongside advancements in LLMs, offering a reliable pathway to streamline the software development lifecycle.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Performance:** The PSD2Code system demonstrates significant improvements over existing design-to-code methods across code similarity, visual fidelity, and production readiness.
*   **Model Agnosticism:** The method exhibits strong independence from specific Large Language Models (LLMs), validating its effectiveness across different model architectures.
*   **Production-Ready Output:** The system successfully generates deployable, industrial-grade React+SCSS code while resolving common issues like structural inconsistencies and asset misalignment.

## Methodology

The research proposes **PSD2Code**, a multi-modal framework designed to convert design files into code through a distinct three-stage process:

1.  **ParseAlignGenerate Pipeline:** Parses PSD files to extract hierarchical structures and properties.
2.  **Constraint-Based Alignment:** Ensures strict consistency between code and design resources.
3.  **Structured Prompt Construction:** Uses parsed data to enhance controllability for high-quality React+SCSS output.

## Technical Details

The PSD2Code system adopts a **'PSD-first' approach** utilizing a three-stage pipeline:

*   **Stage 1: Parse**
    *   Focuses on structural extraction from PSD files.
    *   Key processes include layer tree construction, multi-layer filtering, coordinate normalization, and layer classification (into container, text, or image).

*   **Stage 2: Align**
    *   Performs resource validation.
    *   Maps design references to engineering assets to ensure resource consistency.

*   **Stage 3: Generate**
    *   Involves multimodal LLM synthesis.
    *   Utilizes prompts incorporating aligned asset information and screenshots.
    *   Prioritizes structured information and constraint-based generation over free-form synthesis to target React+SCSS output.
