## 📝 Executive Summary

Designing optimal incentives for large populations of rational agents is a computationally intractable challenge in traditional mechanism design. As the number of agents $N$ increases, the complexity of calculating the Nash Equilibrium grows exponentially, leading to the curse of dimensionality. This issue is particularly acute in sequential auction environments, where discontinuous dynamics further complicate optimization. This paper addresses the critical need for scalable incentive design methods capable of maximizing revenue and other objectives in large-scale multi-agent systems without requiring exact computation of intractable finite-agent equilibria.

The core innovation is the introduction of the **Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive Design (AMID)** algorithm, which formalizes the problem as a Parameterized Mean-Field Game (PMFG). By assuming exchangeability among agents and, crucially, **Lipschitz-continuous dynamics and rewards**, the authors reduce the problem's complexity via an infinite-population limit. AMID employs Online Mirror Descent (OMD) to find the Mean-Field Nash Equilibrium and utilizes explicit differentiation through iterated equilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. A significant theoretical breakthrough is the proof that this framework maintains an approximation rate of $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ for the finite-agent objective, with guarantees that extend to non-smooth settings like sequential auctions.

The study provides rigorous theoretical and empirical results validating the PMFG approach. Theoretically, the authors prove that the strategy profile derived from the PMFG constitutes an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$-Nash Equilibrium for the finite-agent system. In experimental evaluations involving sequential batched auctions, the empirical data confirms the theoretical convergence rate. Economically, the AMID algorithm demonstrated substantial performance gains, achieving **revenue over 3 times higher** than standard first-price auction formats and outperforming existing benchmark methods across diverse auction settings in terms of both exploitability and revenue generation.

This work bridges the gap between theoretical game theory and practical, scalable mechanism design. By extending mean-field approximations to non-smooth domains like sequential auctions, the paper unlocks the potential for applying these scalable techniques to a broader range of real-world economic problems. The combination of mathematical approximation bounds with optimization guarantees ensures that AMID is not only theoretically sound but also computationally feasible for large-scale deployment.
