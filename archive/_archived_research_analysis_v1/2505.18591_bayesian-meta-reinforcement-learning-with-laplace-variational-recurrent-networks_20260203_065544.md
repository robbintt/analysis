## Executive Summary

Meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) aims to equip agents with the ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks using limited data, a requirement that demands precise uncertainty quantification. The field currently faces a critical trade-off between architectural efficiency and statistical rigor. Standard point-estimate methods, typically implemented via Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are computationally efficient and easy to train but suffer from statistical limitations: they produce overconfident estimators and fail to satisfy consistency requirements. Conversely, full-distribution variational methods, such as Variational RNNs, address these uncertainty issues but incur high computational costs due to complex, parameter-heavy inference networks. Resolving this tension is essential for deploying meta-RL in safety-critical environments where reliable uncertainty estimates are as vital as task performance.

This paper introduces the **Laplace Variational Recurrent Network (Laplace VRN)**, a novel architecture that bridges the gap between point-estimate efficiency and Bayesian accuracy. The innovation lies in augmenting standard RNNs post-hoc or during training using the Laplace approximation, rather than replacing them with complex variational models. The method treats the RNN's hidden state as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate and approximates the task posterior as a Gaussian distribution centered at this point. Technically, the covariance of this Gaussian is derived from the Hessian of the loss via a second-order Taylor expansion. State updates are performed by summing means and precisions calculated through a convolution of Gaussian densities over history steps, with policy actions determined via Monte Carlo integration. This approach is fully modular, requiring no modifications to the base model architecture.

The Laplace VRN demonstrates that rigorous uncertainty quantification can be achieved without sacrificing performance or efficiency. In zero-shot regression tasks, the method achieved a predictive cross-entropy of approximately 1.5 nats, statistically matching full-distribution variational baselines while significantly outperforming standard RNNs, which exhibited higher cross-entropy due to overconfidence. On the MuJoCo Ant-v2 locomotion benchmark, the Laplace VRN attained an average return of roughly 1,800, substantially surpassing the standard Variational RNN baseline (which plateaued below 1,000) and performing competitively against more complex state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, the Laplace VRN delivers these results with significantly higher parameter efficiency; by eliminating the need for a separate inference network, the method reduces parameter overhead by nearly 50% compared to standard variational approaches. Ablation studies further confirmed that the method maintains robust performance whether applied jointly during training or post-hoc to pre-trained models.

This research significantly advances the field of meta-RL by demonstrating that Bayesian-level uncertainty awareness is accessible without the computational burden of traditional variational architectures. The ability to calculate distribution statistics—such as entropy—provides researchers with new diagnostic tools for analyzing agent behavior and consistency, which were previously unavailable for non-Bayesian agents. Most notably, the modularity of the Laplace VRN allows practitioners to augment existing, pre-trained models with robust uncertainty measures post-hoc, drastically lowering the barrier to adoption. This work establishes a practical pathway for developing agents that are both parameter-efficient and reliable, facilitating the deployment of meta-RL systems in high-stakes domains where understanding uncertainty is paramount.

## Key Findings

*   **Overconfidence in Standard Methods:** Point-estimate based meta-RL methods are shown to produce overconfident estimators and fail to satisfy necessary consistency requirements.
*   **Laplace Approximation Utility:** The Laplace approximation enables the estimation of valuable distribution statistics (such as entropy) even for agents that are not inherently Bayesian.
*   **Performance Parity:** The proposed method performs on par with full-distribution variational baselines despite being significantly more parameter-efficient.
*   **Implementation Flexibility:** The Laplace approximation can be effectively applied at various stages—at the start, during, or after learning—without requiring modifications to the underlying base model architecture.

## Methodology

The authors approach meta-reinforcement learning from a **Bayesian perspective**, interpreting it as amortized variational inference over the posterior distribution of training tasks. 

Instead of relying on complex full-distribution models or simple point-estimates via standard Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the proposed methodology augments standard point-estimate RNNs with the **Laplace approximation**. This allows for the derivation of full distributions while retaining the original base model architecture, effectively bridging the gap between efficient point-estimates and rigorous Bayesian inference.
