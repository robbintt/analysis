## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), which must reason over structured, factual data to answer complex queries. Current methodologies suffer from critical trade-offs: compiling complete SPARQL queries is brittle and prone to syntax errors; retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise that confuses the model; and complex multi-agent frameworks often lead to exponential search space expansion. These issues are particularly acute given the sheer scale of modern knowledge graphs like Wikidata and Freebase, which contain billions of triples and complex schemas, making efficient and accurate navigation difficult for models that lack inherent structural reasoning capabilities.

**Innovation**
The researchers introduce **Search-on-Graph (SoG)**, a framework that enables iterative, informed graph navigation through a simplified "observe-then-navigate" principle. Unlike pre-planning approaches, SoG utilizes a single, unified `SEARCH` tool function to retrieve 1-hop neighbors dynamically, allowing the LLM to inspect the actual relations of the current entity before deciding the next step. This "Think-Act" loop—where the LLM analyzes the state, calls the function, and observes results in a markdown table—replaces complex multi-agent architectures with a streamlined process. Furthermore, SoG incorporates adaptive filtering mechanisms to manage high-degree nodes and varying schemas, enabling the system to handle structural complexities without requiring upfront schema knowledge or model fine-tuning.

**Results**
SoG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across six KGQA benchmarks covering both Freebase and Wikidata. Notably, the framework delivers a **16% improvement in accuracy** on Wikidata benchmarks alongside consistent gains on Freebase datasets. These results were obtained without any model fine-tuning, demonstrating the framework's robust generalization capabilities. The system was successfully evaluated on massive scales, handling Freebase (1.9 billion triples) and Wikidata (16 billion triples), while effectively mitigating common pitfalls such as noise introduction and the brittleness associated with static query compilation.

**Impact**
The significance of this work lies in its demonstration that LLMs can perform complex, multi-hop reasoning over massive knowledge graphs using a well-designed iterative framework rather than retrieval or fine-tuning. By resolving the trade-offs between brittle SPARQL generation, noisy subgraph retrieval, and agent complexity, Search-on-Graph establishes a new paradigm for LLM interaction with structured data. The "observe-then-navigate" principle offers a generalizable blueprint for tool use that prioritizes dynamic decision-making based on real-time environmental feedback, potentially influencing future research on grounding LLMs in complex external systems beyond knowledge graphs.

## Methodology

The researchers propose **Search-on-Graph (SoG)**, a framework designed to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform iterative, informed graph navigation.

*   **Unified Search Function:** The methodology utilizes a single 'Search' function rather than complex agent frameworks to prevent exponential expansion of the search space.
*   **Observe-then-Navigate Principle:** It employs a principle where the LLM examines the actual available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop, rather than pre-planning paths.
*   **Adaptive Filtering:** The system incorporates adaptive filtering mechanisms to handle high-degree nodes and adapt to different Knowledge Graph schemas.

## Technical Details

Search-on-Graph (SoG) utilizes an iterative, informed navigation strategy allowing the LLM to explore the Knowledge Graph (KG) step-by-step rather than using static retrieval.

**Core Architecture & Functions**
*   **`SEARCH` Tool:** Relies on a single unified tool function to retrieve 1-hop neighbors of a target entity.
    *   **Parameters:** Entity ID, direction (outgoing/incoming), and optional property filters.
    *   **Output:** Returns results in a markdown table with a row count prefix.
*   **"Think-Act" Loop:** The system employs a reasoning loop where the LLM analyzes the current state, calls the SEARCH function, and observes the new table results.

**Handling Complexity**
*   **Structural Adaptation:** The architecture handles structural complexities like high-degree nodes and varying schemas through adaptive filtering.
*   **Schema Agnostic:** Operates without requiring upfront schema knowledge.

**Task Formulation**
*   **Reasoning Paths:** Uses gold entity annotations to focus purely on reasoning paths defined as sequences of triples.
