## Executive Summary

As governments seek to mitigate catastrophic risks from advanced AI through mechanisms like model licensing and research classification, they must navigate a complex landscape of U.S. constitutional constraints. This paper addresses the critical challenge of implementing AI safety governance within the limits of the U.S. Constitution, specifically examining the tension between regulatory authority and First Amendment free speech protections, administrative law principles, and Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. The analysis is vital because without a clear constitutional framework, proposed governance measures face substantial risks of being invalidated by courts, potentially stalling essential efforts to ensure AI safety.

The authors introduce a legal-doctrinal framework to evaluate the susceptibility of specific AI regulatory proposals to constitutional challenge. Technically, the work distinguishes between levels of constitutional protection for different AI components, determining that while AI algorithms and outputs likely receive First Amendment protection, model weights and LLMs as entities are treated as functional conduct and do not. The research proposes adapting established regulatory templates—such as FAA Type Certification, FDA Staged Approval, and NRC Accident Prevention Requirements—to fit these constitutional scrutiny standards. It further defines the applicable legal tests, establishing that content-neutral regulations face intermediate scrutiny, while content-based restrictions trigger strict scrutiny.

The analysis confirms that administrative law requirements and procedural due process constitute the hardest constraints on governance, specifically concerning when developers acquire vested legal interests in their models. The findings indicate that while agencies face significant hurdles in defining their scope and authority without overstepping, arguments based on substantive due process and equal protection present minimal obstacles to implementation. By evaluating these legal boundaries, the paper identifies the precise procedural thresholds that governance measures must satisfy to be considered valid, distinguishing viable regulatory pathways from those likely to fail in court.

This research provides policymakers with a constitutional roadmap for balancing AI safety objectives against fundamental speech and property rights. By identifying procedural due process and administrative law as the primary legal hurdles, while affirming that the First Amendment allows for some regulation of algorithms, the paper offers actionable guidance for drafting durable AI governance. The findings enable the development of model licensing and research classification regimes that can withstand judicial scrutiny, significantly reducing legal risk for agencies and providing clearer compliance pathways for AI developers.

## Key Findings

*   **First Amendment Protection:** AI algorithms and outputs receive protection under the First Amendment, though this protection does not completely preclude government regulation.
*   **Administrative Law Constraints:** Proposals for agency governance are significantly constrained by administrative law requirements regarding scope and authority.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** The government is required to clearly define when developers acquire a vested legal interest in their models.
*   **Minimal Constitutional Obstacles:** Arguments based on substantive due process and equal protection present minimal obstacles to the implementation of AI governance measures.

## Technical Details & Legal Framework

The paper outlines a comprehensive legal framework for AI governance, specifically analyzing model licensing and research classification.

### Governance Templates
The authors propose adapting existing high-stakes regulatory frameworks as templates for AI:
*   **FAA Type Certification**
*   **FDA Staged Approval**
*   **NRC Accident Prevention Requirements**

### Constitutional Classification of AI Components
*   **Protected:** Algorithms and outputs (likely subject to First Amendment protections).
*   **Not Protected:** Weights and LLMs treated as entities (classified as functional conduct).

### Scrutiny Standards
*   **Content-Neutral Restrictions:** Require **intermediate scrutiny**.
*   **Content-Based Restrictions:** Trigger **strict scrutiny**.

### Legal Constraint Analysis
*   **Procedural Due Process:** Focuses heavily on the definition of "vested legal interests" for developers.
*   **Administrative Law:** Limits agency scope and authority; identified as a major constraint.
*   **Substantive Due Process & Equal Protection:** Noted as minimal obstacles to governance measures.

## Methodology

The paper employs a **legal-doctrinal analysis** to evaluate the susceptibility of specific AI regulatory proposals to constitutional challenge. The authors interpret the First Amendment, administrative law principles, and the Fourteenth Amendment specifically within the context of model licensing and AI research classification.

---

## Results

The paper does not contain empirical experimental results. Instead, it provides **quantitative historical analogies** to contextualize regulatory urgency and impact, including:
*   **Unemployment Rate:** Cited at 10% prior to the Dodd-Frank Act.
*   **Operation Warp Speed:** Initiated two months following the WHO pandemic declaration.
*   **Aviation Incident:** The 1956 Grand Canyon midair collision is referenced as a significant historical incident.

---

## Contributions

*   **Risk Evaluation:** Provides a specific evaluation of legal risks associated with model licensing and research classification.
*   **Policy Roadmap:** Offers policymakers a constitutional roadmap for balancing AI safety against speech and property rights.
*   **Actionable Guidance:** Contributes practical guidance for implementing AI governance that can withstand procedural due process and administrative scrutiny.
