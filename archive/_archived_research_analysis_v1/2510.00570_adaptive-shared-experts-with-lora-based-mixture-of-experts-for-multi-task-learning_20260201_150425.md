## Executive Summary

Existing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods for Multi-Task Learning (MTL) struggle with inefficient knowledge sharing and redundant parameter adaptation when migrating from single-task pretrained backbones. This redundancy causes parameter bloat and performance degradation, hindering smooth task transitions and optimal expert specialization. Addressing these inefficiencies is critical for developing scalable MTL architectures that leverage pretrained knowledge without the penalties associated with traditional adaptation methods.

This paper introduces the **Adaptive Shared Experts (ASE)** architecture within a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-based MoE framework. ASE employs a routing mechanism that assigns gating weights to shared experts, which are jointly normalized with sparse experts to foster better collaboration. Crucially, the method implements a fine-grained strategy that increases the total number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their individual ranks. This adjustment maintains a comparable parameter budget while significantly enhancing the granularity of knowledge sharing and specialization.

Extensive experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark validate the ASE approach, demonstrating consistent outperformance against existing baselines in semantic segmentation. The architecture achieved superior mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores compared to standard LoRA and other MoE variants. These findings confirm that the fine-grained strategy—increasing expert quantity while reducing rank—effectively balances the trade-off between specialization and cooperation within a strict parameter limit.

This research represents a significant advancement in parameter-efficient MTL by offering a robust solution to the redundancy issues inherent in single-to-multi-task transitions. The introduction of Adaptive Shared Experts establishes a new design paradigm for scalable MoE architectures, demonstrating that parameter efficiency does not necessitate a performance sacrifice. By proving that optimizing expert count and rank distribution yields better knowledge sharing, this work provides a viable pathway for enhancing expert specialization and cooperation in complex multi-task scenarios.

## Methodology

The research proposes a novel approach utilizing a **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The methodology is defined by two primary components:

1.  **Adaptive Shared Experts (ASE):**
    *   Shared experts are introduced into the architecture and assigned gating weights computed by a router.
    *   These weights are jointly normalized with sparse experts to ensure balanced activation and cooperation.

2.  **Fine-Grained Expert Strategy:**
    *   The approach implements a strategy to increase the number of LoRA experts.
    *   To maintain a comparable parameter budget, the rank of each expert is proportionally reduced as the quantity increases.
