## Executive Summary

Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces the fundamental challenge of **distribution shift**, where the learned policy diverges from the behavior policy in the static dataset, leading to erroneous value function extrapolation. While constraining the policy via Behavior Cloning (BC) regularization is a common mitigation strategy, determining the appropriate constraint strength is difficult; the optimal scale varies significantly across different tasks and dataset qualities. Existing algorithms typically rely on fixed hyperparameters that require extensive, per-dataset manual tuning, limiting their robustness and making them brittle when applied to new environments without expert intervention.

The authors introduce **Adaptive Scaling of Policy Constraints (ASPC)**, a second-order differentiable framework built upon the TD3+BC architecture to dynamically balance RL and BC objectives during training. ASPC optimizes a combined objective function maximizing value estimation while minimizing deviation from the dataset actions. The key technical innovation is a differentiable scaling mechanism for the weighting coefficient $\lambda$. Unlike standard approaches that detach the gradient of the scaling denominator—preventing the optimization of constraint strength—ASPC treats this scaling as a fully differentiable process. This allows the framework to automatically adjust the trade-off between exploration (RL) and conservatism (BC) based on the current training state, supported by a symmetric regularization term and theoretical performance guarantees.

ASPC was evaluated extensively on **39 datasets** across four D4RL domains: HalfCheetah, Hopper, Walker, and Maze. It consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms as well as other adaptive constraint methods. A critical finding is that ASPC achieved superior performance using a single, unified hyperparameter configuration across all diverse datasets. In contrast, competing methods like ReBRAC and A2PR suffered severe performance degradation without task-specific tuning. Furthermore, the method demonstrated high computational efficiency, incurring only minimal overhead compared to standard non-adaptive baselines.

This work represents a significant step toward "zero-shot" generalization in offline RL by effectively eliminating the need for laborious per-dataset hyperparameter tuning. By providing a theoretically grounded method that automatically adapts to dataset quality, ASPC increases the deployability and robustness of offline RL agents in real-world scenarios where data characteristics may vary unpredictably. The ability to maintain high performance across diverse domains with a single model configuration sets a new benchmark for automation in the field, potentially shifting the standard practice toward adaptive, self-tuning constraint mechanisms.
