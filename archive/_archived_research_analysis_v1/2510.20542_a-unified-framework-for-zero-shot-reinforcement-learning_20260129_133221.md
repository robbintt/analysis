## Executive Summary

The field of Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning (RL) currently lacks a unified theoretical foundation, resulting in a disjointed methodological landscape where algorithms cannot be rigorously compared or evaluated. Unlike conventional RL, which optimizes policies for fixed, specific rewards, Zero-Shot RL requires agents to adapt immediately to new tasks by optimizing over a distribution of downstream reward functions without test-time training. This absence of standardized notation—particularly the conflation of occupancy measures with successor measures—and a common analytical lens has hindered theoretical progress, making it difficult to establish performance guarantees for zero-shot value transfer or to assess the relative efficacy of competing representation learning strategies.

The authors introduce a unified theoretical framework that formalizes Zero-Shot RL as learning a mapping from reward functions to state-action distributions. A key technical contribution is the rigorous disambiguation of discounted state-action successor measures from occupancy measures; specifically, the framework utilizes successor measures to model expected future visitations from a specific state, which strictly facilitates value recovery. Using this foundation, the authors establish a precise taxonomy that classifies existing algorithms into **"Direct Representations,"** which employ end-to-end mappings such as Universal Value Function Approximators (UVFA), and **"Compositional Representations,"** which exploit value function substructures through optimization strategies, exemplified by Successor Feature (SF) methods.

The paper delivers quantitative analytical results regarding the limitations of algorithmic performance, deriving a specific suboptimality bound for Successor Feature methods within the zero-shot regime. This mathematical proof establishes that the zero-shot performance gap scales **linearly** with the approximation error of the learned successor matrices (measured by the spectral norm) and the norm of the task-specific reward weight parameters. By explicitly defining this relationship, the authors validate that the fidelity of the learned geometry of the state-action space is the primary determinant of performance, providing a concrete upper bound on the agent's ability to recover value entirely across new tasks. This research consolidates a fragmented field into a coherent structure, providing a principled foundation that establishes a common analytical lens for researchers.

## Key Findings

*   **Paradigm Shift**: Zero-shot RL differs fundamentally from conventional RL by optimizing for rich, adaptable representations rather than fixed rewards, enabling agents to adapt immediately without test-time training.
*   **Unified Taxonomy**: All existing zero-shot RL approaches can be systematically classified into two distinct families: **direct representations** and **compositional representations**.
*   **Theoretical Bounds**: The derivation of an extended bound for successor-feature methods provides a fresh theoretical perspective on their performance capabilities within the zero-shot regime.
*   **Fragmentation Issue**: The field currently suffers from a lack of a common analytical lens, which has historically hindered direct comparison between different methods.

## Technical Details

**Formalism & Definitions**
*   **Problem Definition**: Zero-Shot RL is formalized as optimizing a policy $\pi$ over a distribution of downstream reward functions without further learning at inference.
*   **Policy Structure**: Policies are defined as mappings from reward functions to state-action distributions.
*   **Core Mechanism**: The framework relies on the discounted state-action successor (occupancy) measure to enable transfer and value recovery.

**Taxonomy Dimensions**
The paper classifies algorithms based on two primary axes:
1.  **Training Objective**:
    *   *Reward-Free*
    *   *Pseudo-Reward-Free*
2.  **Representation Structure**:
    *   *Direct Representations*: Utilizing end-to-end mappings (e.g., UVFA).
    *   *Compositional Representations*: Exploiting value function substructure via optimization (e.g., Successor Features).
