## 📝 Executive Summary

Current Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) face significant challenges in scalability, distributed coordination, and the seamless integration of heterogeneous services. While protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have streamlined tool invocation, they lack native support for agent-level collaboration and comprehensive lifecycle management. This paper addresses the critical gap between static tool usage and dynamic, service-oriented agent orchestration, highlighting the need for a unified paradigm capable of managing complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse computational environments.

The researchers introduce **Agent-as-a-Service based on Agent Network (AaaS-AN)**, a framework grounded in the Role-Goal-Process-Service (RGPS) standard. The architecture centers on a **Dynamic Agent Network** where agents and groups self-organize as vertices based on task and role dependencies, enabling dynamic routing and recursive invocation. This is orchestrated by a **Service Scheduler** utilizing an Execution Graph to manage distributed coordination, context tracking, and runtime tasks. The system formalizes Agent Roles ($A$) and Agent Groups ($G$) to encapsulate service discovery, registration, and interoperability, effectively bridging the gap in MCP by extending support to full agent collaboration.

In comparative testing, the AaaS-AN framework outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in both mathematical reasoning and application-level code generation tasks. The system demonstrated robust scalability by successfully managing a heterogeneous Multi-Agent System of over 100 agent services, including RPA workflows and MCP servers. Operationally, the Service Scheduler effectively maintained context tracking and coordination across this distributed environment. Additionally, the authors released a dataset of 10,000 long-horizon multi-agent workflows to facilitate future research into long-chain collaboration.

This research significantly advances the field by extending the Model Context Protocol (MCP) from basic tool invocation to sophisticated agent-level collaboration and lifecycle management. By consolidating the entire agent lifecycle—construction, integration, interoperability, and networked collaboration—into a single service-oriented paradigm, AaaS-AN provides a scalable blueprint for future autonomous systems. The architectural innovation of combining a Dynamic Agent Network with an Execution Graph offers a new standard for role-based self-organization, while the release of the extensive workflow dataset provides a vital resource for the community to develop more resilient and collaborative AI agents.
