## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of **catastrophic forgetting** in neural networks trained via Continual Learning (CL). While empirical methods have been proposed to mitigate the loss of knowledge from previous tasks, the field lacks a rigorous theoretical understanding of the mechanisms driving forgetting and the specific factors that influence its rate.

This paper is significant because it moves beyond heuristic observations to establish a **mathematically grounded framework** for understanding the limitations of sequential optimization. It seeks to quantify exactly how learning a new task erodes performance on previous ones, providing a necessary theoretical foundation for strategies that are currently largely based on intuition.

The key innovation lies in deriving precise, closed-form mathematical bounds on the rate of forgetting within a tractable theoretical setting. The authors analyze a one-hidden-layer quadratic neural network trained using standard Gradient Descent (GD) within the kernel (lazy) regime. The study utilizes a structural "XOR cluster dataset" superimposed with Gaussian noise, where tasks are defined as distinct clusters characterized by orthogonal means.

By employing unregularized Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) without interventions like replay buffers, the study isolates the dynamics of forgetting. This approach allows for a rigorous characterization of learning interactions across $K$ independent tasks using a specific network architecture with a $1/\sqrt{m}$ scaling factor.

The study establishes that the rate of forgetting is explicitly bounded by a functional dependence on four key variables: the number of optimization iterations ($T$), sample size ($n$), number of tasks ($K$), and hidden layer size ($m$). Crucially, the analysis distinguishes between training-phase and evaluation-phase errors, providing specific bounds for both. Rather than vague decay trends, the results demonstrate that forgetting error scales inversely with sample size $n$, proving that larger sample sizes effectively mitigate errors. Additionally, the results reveal a nuanced relationship with network width: increasing hidden layer size ($m$) reduces forgetting specifically when employing early stopping in the kernel regime; however, if the network is trained to full convergence, this beneficial effect vanishes.

These theoretical characterizations of sample, iteration, and computation complexities were corroborated by numerical experiments. This work significantly bridges the gap between theoretical bounds and practical application in the field of continual learning. By providing mathematical proofs for phenomena previously observed only empirically, the paper offers deep insights into the structural factors that contribute to learning stability.
