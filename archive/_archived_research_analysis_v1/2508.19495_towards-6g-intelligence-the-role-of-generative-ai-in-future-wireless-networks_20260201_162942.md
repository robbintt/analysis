## Executive Summary

**Problem**
The transition to 6G networks aims to realize Ambient Intelligence (AmI), a global ecosystem requiring seamless connectivity and autonomous decision-making. However, traditional discriminative AI models face critical limitations in achieving this vision, specifically regarding data scarcity, the inability to generate novel scenarios, and privacy concerns inherent in intent-based interactions. This research addresses the gap between the theoretical potential of 6G and the technical constraints of current AI architectures, establishing that a "creative core" is missing to handle the complexity and dynamic nature of future wireless environments.

**Innovation**
The key innovation is the positioning of Generative AI (GenAI) as the foundational infrastructure for 6G, transforming the network from a communication pipe into an intelligent entity. Technically, the authors propose an architectural mapping that aligns specific GenAI models—GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, and generative transformers—with 6G enablers such as edge computing, IoT swarms, and Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS). This framework utilizes GenAI capabilities for synthetic data generation to overcome dataset shortages and applies intent translation to enhance user privacy, thereby enabling distributed workloads capable of real-time perception and autonomous action.

**Results**
As a conceptual review and architectural mapping, the paper achieves qualitative results by validating the infrastructural compatibility of 6G technologies to host distributed GenAI workloads. The study successfully maps distinct generative architectures to specific AmI use cases and performs a gap analysis that isolates four critical areas for future development: energy-efficient on-device training, trustworthiness, standardization, and federated generative learning. While no experimental performance metrics were provided, the synthesis of 40 foundational citations provides a validated technical roadmap, identifying that current distributed intelligence frameworks are viable but require significant optimization in energy consumption and security protocols.

**Impact**
This research establishes a definitive framework for integrating GenAI into the wireless stack, shifting the paradigm of 6G from high-speed connectivity to ambient intelligence. By detailing how generative models can be deployed across edge and IoT infrastructure, the paper provides a blueprint for overcoming the data and privacy bottlenecks that hinder current network development. This work influences the field by setting a clear research agenda focused on federated generative learning and energy efficiency, guiding both academia and standardization bodies in the architectural design of future autonomous networks.
