## 📑 Executive Summary

The rapid adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a significant gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding. While LoRA is widely used for its parameter efficiency, the field lacks rigorous mathematical guarantees regarding its behavior within the non-convex optimization landscapes typical of deep learning. This absence of a unified theoretical framework poses risks of instability and unforeseen optimization failures, particularly as these methods are applied to increasingly large-scale models where heuristic approaches may not scale safely.

To address this, the study introduces **Bernoulli-LoRA**, a unified theoretical framework that fundamentally reformulates the standard LoRA update as a Projected Gradient Step onto a low-rank manifold. The key innovation lies in a probabilistic Bernoulli mechanism that randomly selects which update matrices are modified at each iteration. By treating this matrix selection as a random variable, the framework converts disparate heuristic strategies into a single, analyzable mathematical form. This approach allows the complex dynamics of low-rank adaptation to be rigorously modeled within stochastic optimization settings, moving beyond ad-hoc implementations to a generalized foundation.

The authors establish explicit complexity bounds and convergence guarantees for a broad class of optimization algorithms, encompassing gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and advanced variance-reduction techniques (including PAGE, MVR, QGD, MARINA, and EF21). In non-convex settings, the framework proves a convergence rate of $O(1/\epsilon)$ for deterministic gradient descent and $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for stochastic methods. The analysis further extends to convex non-smooth functions, maintaining $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ rates for both constant and adaptive Polyak-type step sizes. Empirical validation on Linear Regression with Non-Convex Regularization and an MLP on MNIST confirms that Bernoulli-LoRA matches the practical efficacy of standard baselines (such as RAC-LoRA) while strictly adhering to the derived theoretical bounds.

This research provides the first comprehensive theoretical grounding for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, bridging the historical divide between practical application and mathematical rigor. By unifying diverse optimization strategies under a single provable framework, Bernoulli-LoRA equips researchers with the tools necessary to design future low-rank adaptation algorithms with guaranteed stability. The advanced analysis of Polyak-type adaptive stepsizes is particularly significant for the evolving landscape of LLM training, ensuring that computational efficiency does not come at the cost of convergence reliability as model architectures continue to scale.
