## Executive Summary

### Problem
The proliferation of disinformation poses a critical threat to information integrity, with automated detection systems struggling to accurately analyze news article titles and short text snippets. Unlike full-length articles, these short-form texts lack the contextual density and linguistic cues required for traditional verification methods, making relation extraction particularly difficult. This paper addresses the challenge of creating a robust, automated system capable of high-accuracy detection within these constrained contexts, where false positives and negatives remain prevalent in existing solutions.

### Innovation
The authors introduce a novel Multi-Agent System (MAS) orchestrated via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which manages shared context and enables live learning across components. The architecture integrates four heterogeneous agents:
*   **Machine Learning Agent** (Logistic Regression)
*   **Wikipedia Knowledge Check Agent** (NER)
*   **Coherence Detection Agent** (LLMs)
*   **Web-Scraped Data Analyzer**

The key technical advancement is a mathematically derived weighted aggregation method for the ensemble; rather than using standard algorithmic threshold optimization, the system dynamically calculates weights based on the individual misclassification rates of each agent.

### Results
The proposed system demonstrated superior performance in empirical testing, achieving an overall accuracy of **95.3%** and an F1 score of **0.964**. The ensemble approach significantly outperformed individual agents operating in isolation, as well as established traditional disinformation detection methods. Furthermore, the study empirically validated that the novel weighted aggregation method is more effective than standard threshold optimization techniques.

### Impact
This research establishes a new benchmark for accuracy in detecting disinformation within short text content and validates the efficacy of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for coordinating complex agentic AI workflows. The modular and scalable nature of the architecture allows for the seamless integration of diverse AI paradigms—statistical, symbolic, and generative—into a unified system. By preserving the details of decision processes, the framework offers a high degree of interpretability and traceability.
