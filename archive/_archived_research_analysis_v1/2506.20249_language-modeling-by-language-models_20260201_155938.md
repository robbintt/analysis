## Executive Summary

This research addresses the computational and creative bottleneck inherent in manually designing neural architectures for Natural Language Processing. By investigating whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can autonomously navigate the complex search space of model design, the paper challenges the reliance on human intuition for architecture innovation. Instead of treating LLMs as passive tools, the authors propose treating them as active agents capable of executing the full scientific research lifecycle—from ideation to verification—to discover novel architectures that might remain obscured to human researchers.

The core innovation is **Genesys**, a framework built upon the Language Model Architecture Discovery Environment (LMADE) that integrates a Genetic Programming (GP) backbone with multi-agent LLM simulation. Unlike direct prompting methods, Genesys employs a **'Ladder of Scales'** strategy that verifies designs at incrementally larger parameter sizes, ranging from 14M to 350M, under narrowing budget constraints. The system utilizes **'Designer'** agents—grounded by a Knowledge Engine indexing 297 LM papers—to propose architectural modifications, and **'Verifier'** agents to execute a multi-stage symbolic checking process involving static, dynamic, and semantic analysis to ensure architectural validity before training.

Genesys demonstrated high efficacy in large-scale experimentation, generating a total of **1,162** novel LM designs and successfully verifying **1,062** of them, representing a 91.3% success rate. This genetic programming approach yielded an approximately **86 percentage point** improvement in valid design generation compared to direct prompt generation methods. Furthermore, the architectures discovered by Genesys surpassed established baselines, outperforming both GPT-2 and Mamba2 on **6 out of 9** specific downstream benchmarks.

This work establishes a robust, fully automated paradigm for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) where AI designs AI, offering a scalable solution to accelerate innovation in model development. By providing empirical evidence that autonomous agents can perform high-level scientific discovery—including complex reasoning and code verification—the paper validates the potential of multi-agent systems to uncover novel design patterns that rival or exceed human-defined architectures.

## Methodology

The framework employs a **multi-agent LLM simulation** designed to simulate the full research lifecycle. The process covers three primary phases:

1.  **Ideation:** Generating initial concepts and architectural variations.
2.  **Code Generation:** Writing the implementation code for the proposed designs.
3.  **Evaluation:** Testing and validating the performance of the models.

**Key Strategy: Ladder of Scales**
The system operates by verifying designs at increasingly larger scales—starting from **14M parameters** up to **350M parameters**. This occurs under narrowing budget constraints, ensuring resources are allocated to the most promising candidates as they grow in complexity.
