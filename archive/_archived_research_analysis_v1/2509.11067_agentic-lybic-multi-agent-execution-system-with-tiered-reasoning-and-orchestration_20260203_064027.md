## 📋 Executive Summary

### **Problem**
Existing autonomous agents struggle with generalized desktop automation, particularly when executing complex, long-horizon tasks that require high reliability. The core limitations of current methods are **poor coordination** between different execution strategies and **inadequate quality control**, which frequently leads to unrecoverable errors during multi-step operations. Without a mechanism for dynamic oversight and rigorous validation, these systems often fail to adapt to unexpected states or correct their own mistakes, significantly limiting their practical utility in real-world environments.

### **Innovation**
The researchers introduce **Agentic Lybic**, a novel multi-agent system architected as a Finite-State Machine (FSM) to enable dynamic orchestration and tiered reasoning. The system utilizes a four-tier structure comprising a **Controller** (global state management), a **Manager** (workflow coordination), and **Specialized Workers** (Technician for code, Operator for GUI, and Analyst for decision support), all overseen by an **Evaluator** for quality gating. This FSM-based framework facilitates dynamic strategy selection and routing between hybrid execution modalities, while continuous quality control triggers adaptive replanning and error recovery to ensure robust task completion.

### **Results**
Evaluated on the OSWorld benchmark with a strict 50-step constraint, Agentic Lybic achieved a **State-of-the-Art (SOTA) success rate of 57.07%**. This performance substantially outperforms existing baselines, including CoAct-1 and GUI-Owl. The results empirically validate that the system’s architecture successfully resolves coordination issues and maintains high reliability, demonstrating superior capability in handling complex, multi-step workflows through its structured approach to agent interaction.

### **Impact**
This research establishes a principled architectural framework for building reliable autonomous agents, shifting the paradigm from ad-hoc coordination to structured, state-driven execution. By demonstrating that combining FSM-based routing with specialized labor division significantly improves success rates, Agentic Lybic sets a new standard for multi-agent systems. The findings suggest that dynamic orchestration and continuous quality gating are essential advancements for the future of generalized desktop automation, providing a blueprint for more resilient and capable AI agents.
