## 📄 Executive Summary

Diagnosing mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) presents a persistent challenge due to the frequent ambiguity of symptoms and the subtlety of neurological markers in imaging data. This ambiguity often leads to diagnostic uncertainty in medical environments where timely intervention is critical. This paper addresses this limitation by developing an automated diagnostic system designed to aggregate and interpret complex data, providing a tool for medical professionals in scenarios where clear biological indicators are absent.

The core innovation is the **"Proof-of-TBI"** system, a four-layer hybrid architecture that synthesizes fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM. The system employs a consortium of five distinct VLMs fine-tuned on labeled TBI MRI scans. Crucially, the implementation utilizes **QLoRA with 4-bit quantization** via the Unsloth library to optimize training on consumer-grade hardware. LLM Agents serve as the orchestration layer, using LangChain and LlamaIndex to aggregate independent predictions from the VLM consortium before passing them to the OpenAI-o3 reasoning layer for logical evaluation and final consensus generation.

Regarding performance, the study focuses on operational validation rather than statistical benchmarks; specific metrics such as accuracy rates or F1-scores are not reported. However, qualitative experiments confirmed that the QLoRA optimization method allows for effective model training on consumer-grade hardware without performance degradation. The system's viability for diagnosing ambiguous TBI symptoms was validated by the U.S. Army Medical Research team. Additionally, the study demonstrated that LLM Agents could successfully automate end-to-end decision-making.

This research establishes a precedent by being the first to apply fine-tuned vision-language models integrated with a reasoning LLM specifically for TBI prediction. The study has significant implications for the accessibility of medical AI, demonstrating that state-of-the-art models can be fine-tuned on standard consumer hardware, bridging the gap between visual medical data and high-level logical reasoning.
