## 📋 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical deficiency in spatial intelligence within current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While MLLMs have achieved parity with humans in many linguistic and general visual tasks, they struggle significantly to understand and reason about spatial relationships—such as depth, orientation, and relative position—which is fundamental for real-world applications like robotics, autonomous navigation, and complex scene understanding. The authors identify that the field's progress is hindered by fragmented and limited evaluation standards, which fail to provide a holistic view of model capabilities, thereby obscuring the true extent of the performance gap between state-of-the-art models and human-level intelligence.

The paper proposes a holistic ecosystem to evaluate and enhance spatial reasoning through three integrated components:

1.  **SpatialScore:** A rigorous benchmark comprising 5,000 manually verified samples across 30 distinct tasks and multiple visual data types.
2.  **SpatialCorpus:** A large-scale dataset of 331,000 multimodal question-answer pairs designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to embed spatial knowledge directly into model weights.
3.  **SpatialAgent:** A training-free solution utilizing a multi-agent system equipped with 12 specialized spatial perception tools, employing Plan-Execute and ReAct reasoning paradigms to solve problems dynamically without requiring model weight updates.

The study conducted an extensive evaluation of 40 representative MLLMs, confirming a substantial disparity between current model capabilities and human-level spatial intelligence. The results demonstrate that existing evaluations are indeed fragmented, failing to capture the breadth of spatial reasoning deficits. However, the proposed interventions proved effective: fine-tuning models with the SpatialCorpus (e.g., Qwen3-VL) yielded significant improvements on spatial tasks, while the SpatialAgent framework achieved substantial gains in reasoning accuracy purely through tool utilization and agentic workflows, circumventing the need for costly additional training.

This work significantly advances the field by establishing the most comprehensive and diverse benchmark for multimodal spatial intelligence to date. By releasing the SpatialScore benchmark and the SpatialCorpus dataset, the authors provide the community with essential, standardized resources for future research and model development. The introduction of SpatialAgent further offers a novel, cost-effective pathway to enhance spatial reasoning without retraining, suggesting that agentic frameworks are vital for closing the gap between artificial and human spatial understanding. Collectively, these contributions lay a foundational framework for the evolution of spatially intelligent AI systems.
