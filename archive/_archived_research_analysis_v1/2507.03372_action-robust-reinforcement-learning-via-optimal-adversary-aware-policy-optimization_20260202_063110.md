# Action Robust Reinforcement Learning via Optimal Adversary Aware Policy Optimization
*by Buqing Nie; Yangqing Fu; Jingtian Ji; Yue Gao*

> **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
>
> Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies face a critical fragility when deployed in physical environments: they are exceptionally vulnerable to small perturbations in their action space. Whether resulting from sensor noise, actuator degradation, or adversarial interference, these minute deviations can cause catastrophic failures in performance and safety. This lack of "action robustness" represents a significant barrier to the adoption of DRL in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and robotics, where an agent must maintain reliability even when executed actions deviate from the intended policy.
>
> To address this, the authors introduce the **Optimal Adversary-aware Policy Iteration (OA-PI)** framework, a methodological advancement that explicitly integrates optimal adversary analysis into the policy optimization loop. The framework formulates an "Action-Adversarial MDP" and establishes a novel Bellman operator, providing a rigorous mathematical proof that it is a contraction mapping under the sup-norm. Technical implementation relies on Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to estimate worst-case perturbations and a hyperparameter ($\omega$) to balance nominal performance with robustness.
>
> Experimental validation on MuJoCo continuous control benchmarks provides quantifiable evidence of the framework's efficacy. Under bounded action perturbations ($\epsilon=0.1$), standard algorithms like TD3 often suffer catastrophic performance collapse. In contrast, OA-TD3 maintains robust returns, successfully retaining the majority of the agent's nominal performance. Furthermore, the framework eliminates the typical robustness-accuracy trade-off; OA-PI-based algorithms achieve nominal returns comparable to standard baselines while simultaneously outperforming standard adversarial training methods in robust tasks, which often suffer significantly degraded sample efficiency and nominal performance.
