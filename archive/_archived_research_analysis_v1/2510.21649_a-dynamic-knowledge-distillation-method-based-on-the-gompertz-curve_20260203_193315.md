## Executive Summary

This section provides a high-level overview of the research, covering the problem statement, innovation, results, and impact.

**Problem**
Traditional Knowledge Distillation (KD) suffers from the inefficiency of static loss weighting. Standard methods apply a fixed balance between the student model's loss and the teacher's guidance throughout the entire training process. This rigidity fails to account for the student's evolving capacity to absorb information; treating early-stage training the same as late-stage training limits the effectiveness of knowledge transfer.

**Innovation**
The core innovation is the **"Gompertz-CNN"** framework, a dynamic knowledge distillation method that utilizes the Gompertz growth model to govern the training process. This introduces a stage-aware strategy where the weight of the distillation loss is dynamically adjusted based on the student model's learning trajectory, effectively mimicking human-like cognitive progression stages. The framework employs a multi-loss objective function combining:
*   **Wasserstein Distance:** To minimize feature-level discrepancies.
*   **Gradient Matching:** To align backward propagation behaviors.

**Results**
The Gompertz-CNN framework demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional knowledge distillation baselines:
*   **CIFAR-10:** Accuracy gains of up to **8%**.
*   **CIFAR-100:** Accuracy gains of up to **4%**.
These results were validated across various teacher-student architecture pairings (e.g., ResNet50 and MobileNet_v2).

**Impact**
This paper contributes a novel mathematical perspective to model compression by being the first to apply the Gompertz growth model to knowledge distillation. By establishing a method that adapts to a student's "cognitive capacity," it offers a more effective and architecture-agnostic strategy for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained devices.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Performance:** The proposed Gompertz-CNN framework consistently outperforms traditional knowledge distillation methods.
*   **Significant Accuracy Gains:** Achieved improvements of **8% on CIFAR-10** and **4% on CIFAR-100**.
*   **Architecture Versatility:** Validated as effective across various teacher-student architecture pairings, specifically ResNet50 (teacher) and MobileNet_v2 (student).
*   **Dynamic vs. Static:** The use of the Gompertz curve for dynamic weighting proves more effective than static loss weighting strategies by accurately modeling learning progression stages.

## Methodology

The researchers introduced a **dynamic knowledge distillation framework** that integrates the **Gompertz growth model** directly into the training process.

*   **Stage-Aware Strategy:** The method dynamically adjusts the weight of the distillation loss based on the student model's learning trajectory.
*   **Multi-Loss Objective:** The framework employs a unified objective function consisting of:
    *   **Wasserstein Distance:** Used for evaluating feature-level discrepancies.
    *   **Gradient Matching:** Used for aligning backward propagation behaviors.
*   **Benchmarks:** The approach was evaluated on standard computer vision datasets: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
