## 📝 Executive Summary

> This research addresses the critical limitations of current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in Radiology Visual Question Answering (RVQA), specifically their inability to perform the complex, high-stakes reasoning required for accurate clinical diagnostics. Existing models frequently struggle with factual inaccuracies, hallucinations (generating medically unsupported information), and cross-modal misalignment where visual data from X-rays is incorrectly synthesized with textual queries. These deficiencies pose significant barriers to clinical adoption, as medical AI systems require a high degree of reliability and trustworthiness that standard, monolithic MLLM architectures—which often map inputs to outputs in a single, opaque pass—fail to provide. The paper highlights that without a mechanism to decompose the reasoning process, current models lack the precision necessary for safe clinical integration.

To overcome these issues, the paper introduces a **Modular Multi-Agent System (MAS)** that decomposes the complex reasoning process into a sequential pipeline of three specialized agents. This is a technical departure from standard end-to-end or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches. Unlike monolithic models that attempt to process visual and textual context simultaneously—often leading to distraction by irrelevant features—the sequential pipeline assigns distinct, optimized roles to each component: a Context Understanding Agent (CUA) retrieves and reranks relevant QA examples; a Multimodal Reasoning Agent (MRA), acting as an MLLM, generates answers based on these refined inputs; and an Answer Validation Agent (AVA) estimates confidence scores and triggers automated correction if thresholds are not met.

In evaluations, the proposed MAS demonstrated superior performance compared to strong MLLM baselines. The system's robustness was further validated against a rigorously curated "hard case" dataset derived via "model disagreement filtering." This work signifies a pivotal shift toward creating explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications by proving that multi-agent architectures can effectively reduce hallucination rates while improving diagnostic accuracy.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The researchers developed a Multi-Agent System (MAS) specifically designed to handle complex reasoning tasks within the radiology domain. The methodology emphasizes a **division of labor** across three distinct specialized agents:

1.  **Context Understanding:** Handles initial comprehension of the query.
2.  **Multimodal Reasoning:** Processes the integration of visual and textual information.
3.  **Answer Validation:** Verifies the accuracy and consistency of the final output.

**Evaluation Strategy:**
The system was assessed using a challenging RVQA dataset curated through **'model disagreement filtering'**. This process ensured the test set comprised hard cases where multiple MLLMs typically fail to agree, providing a rigorous stress test for the system's reasoning capabilities.
