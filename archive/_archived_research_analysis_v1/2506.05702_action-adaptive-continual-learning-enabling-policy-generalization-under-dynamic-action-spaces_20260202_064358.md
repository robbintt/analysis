## Executive Summary

Traditional Continual Learning (CL) methods operate under the assumption of static agent capabilities. This limitation renders them ineffective in real-world scenarios where agents must adapt to evolving physical constraints or varying tool availability. This paper addresses this critical gap by formalizing the **Continual Learning with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC)** problem, which models environments where action spaces are not fixed but undergo specific dynamics categorized as Expansion, Contraction, Partial Change, and Complete Change.

The authors argue that without addressing dynamic action spaces, autonomous systems cannot achieve the resilience required for long-term deployment, as current methods fail catastrophically when action dimensionality or availability changes.

To solve CL-DC, the authors propose the **Action-Adaptive Continual Learning (AACL)** framework, a biologically inspired method that decouples high-level policy logic from specific action definitions. Technically, AACL constructs an "Action Representation Space" using self-supervised learning to capture semantic relationships between actions. The framework utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture; the encoder maps state representations to the abstract action space, while the decoder generates specific actions.

When encountering new action spaces, AACL employs adaptive fine-tuning on the encoder-decoder module. This mechanism balances **plasticity**—adapting to new capabilities or dimensions—with **stability**—preserving previous knowledge—allowing the agent to generalize policies across fundamentally different action sets without retraining from scratch.

The study validated AACL using a new benchmark across three distinct environments. In scenarios featuring significant dynamics (e.g., LunarLander), AACL maintained high performance (Avg. Return ≈ 240), whereas baselines like EWC and MAS suffered severe degradation (Returns 20–60), and Fine-tuning failed completely. This research establishes CL-DC as a vital new area of study, laying the groundwork for adaptable AI in robotics and autonomous systems.

## Key Findings

*   **Limitations of Current CL:** Existing Continual Learning methods are unrealistic because they assume static agent capabilities, leading to failure in dynamic environments.
*   **Problem Formalization:** The study defines the **'Continual Learning with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC)'** problem, shifting the focus to policy generalization with varying action spaces.
*   **Superior Performance:** The proposed **Action-Adaptive Continual Learning (AACL)** framework significantly outperforms popular existing methods by generalizing across diverse action spaces.
*   **Validation:** Experimental results on a new benchmark spanning three environments (LunarLander, FetchPush, GridWorld) validate AACL's effectiveness in maintaining performance where baselines collapse.

*   **Decoupling Logic:** The core innovation is decoupling high-level policy logic from specific, rigid action definitions.
*   **Architecture:** The approach utilizes an **Encoder-Decoder** architecture.
    *   **Action Representation Space:** A constructed space that maps action representations.
    *   **Encoder:** Maps states to abstract action representations.
    *   **Decoder:** Translates these representations into specific executable actions.
*   **Adaptive Fine-Tuning:** Upon encountering new action spaces, the encoder-decoder undergoes fine-tuning.
    *   **Objective:** To balance **Stability** (retaining previous knowledge) and **Plasticity** (adapting to new capabilities), ensuring the agent does not forget past tasks while learning new ones.

## Technical Details

### Problem Formalization
The study formalizes **Continual Learning with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC)** as a sequence of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) characterized by:
*   A **constant state space**.
*   **Dynamic action spaces** that change over time.

### Categories of Action Space Dynamics
The research categorizes the ways in which action spaces can evolve:
1.  **Expansion:** Adding new actions to the space.
2.  **Contraction:** Removing actions from the space.
3.  **Partial Change:** Altering a subset of actions.
4.  **Complete Change:** A total overhaul of the available actions.

### Mechanism Integration
*   **Neuroscience Inspiration:** The Action Representation Space is inspired by biological cortical functions.
*   **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL):** Integrated to maximize the average expected return over tasks.
*   **Handling Dimensionality:** Unlike standard CL, AACL explicitly handles changes in action space dimensionality or membership (adding/removing actions).

## Results

### Evaluation Metrics & Setup
*   **Primary Metric Average Expected Return:** Measured across all tasks to assess overall performance.
*   **Benchmark:** A new benchmark introduced across three distinct environments, including robot grasping capabilities (FetchPush).

### Performance Highlights
*   **AACL Success:** The AACL framework successfully enables policy generalization across diverse and dynamic action spaces.
*   **Baseline Failures:**
    *   **Fine-tuning:** Failed completely when confronted with action space dimensionality changes.
    *   **Regularization Methods (e.g., EWC, MAS):** Lacked the flexibility to accommodate new action definitions, often dropping to returns between 20 and 60 in dynamic tests compared to AACL's ~240.

### Conclusion on Results
While existing methods fail due to static capability assumptions, AACL demonstrates that policy logic can remain effective even when the underlying action capabilities change drastically.
