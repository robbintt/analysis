## Executive Summary

This research addresses the **interpretability crisis** inherent in modern statistical language models, which typically function as opaque "black boxes" lacking explicit representations of grammatical structure. The study focuses on the specific challenge of modeling **unsupervised language acquisition**: understanding how linguistic systems derive discrete grammatical categories—specifically the distinction between **Functional Categories** (e.g., determiners) and **Content Categories** (e.g., nouns, verbs)—from raw input without external supervision. This is a fundamental issue for advancing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and cognitive science.

The core innovation is the **MODOMA (Multi-Agent Simulation) framework**, a fully parameterized computational laboratory designed to simulate language development through the interaction of two distinct agents:
1.  An **"Adult" agent** (generating exemplars).
2.  A **"Child" (daughter) agent** (acquiring knowledge).

Unlike standard deep learning models that rely on distributed weights, MODOMA utilizes a hybrid architecture integrating statistical learning procedures with rule-based methods to create a **"knowledge-based language model."** This allows acquired knowledge to be explicitly represented and fully inspectable.

Experiments validated the efficacy of the MODOMA approach, demonstrating that the Child agent successfully acquires discrete grammatical categories without supervision. The system proved robust across training and test datasets containing varying amounts of exemplars. Crucially, the machine-generated data exhibited linguistic patterns consistent with those established in human-generated data.

By bridging the gap between statistical and symbolic processing, this paper validates computational modeling as a rigorous tool for studying linguistic mechanics. The shift toward **Explicit Knowledge Representation** offers a concrete path toward Explainable AI (XAI), allowing researchers to inspect specific grammatical rules rather than relying on impenetrable neural architectures.

## Methodology

The study utilizes the **MODOMA system**, a computational multi-agent laboratory environment designed for unsupervised language acquisition experiments. The methodology simulates language development through the interaction between two distinct language models: an "**adult**" agent and a "**child**" (daughter) agent.

The framework employs a **hybrid approach**, integrating both statistical procedures and rule-based methods. The result of this interaction is a "knowledge-based language model" capable of parsing and generating new utterances. Crucially, the system is **fully parameterized**, allowing researchers to control all experimental variables and explicitly inspect the acquired grammatical knowledge.

*   **System Architecture:** Multi-Agent Simulation (MODOMA).
*   **Agent Roles:**
    *   **Adult Agent:** Generates linguistic exemplars.
    *   **Child Agent:** Acquires knowledge through interaction.
*   **Learning Paradigm:** Unsupervised Language Acquisition.
