### **Executive Summary**

The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed conversational AI from simple, response-oriented chatbots into autonomous agents capable of complex, multi-turn interactions. However, this technical leap has introduced significant fragmentation in the research landscape. The field lacks a unified framework to categorize the expanding capabilities of these agents or to systematically identify the gaps that prevent them from achieving human-level performance and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

This paper addresses this fragmentation by introducing a "Desideratum-Based Taxonomy" that establishes a unified framework for analyzing LLM-driven conversational agents. This framework classifies agent capabilities into three distinct dimensions:

1.  **Reasoning:** Distinguishes between general methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) and agentic exploration (e.g., ReAct, Tree-of-Thoughts).
2.  **Monitor:** Focuses on self-awareness mechanisms and state tracking for personalization and sentiment.
3.  **Control:** Handles tool utilization and policy learning, including constraint adherence.

As this study is a systematic survey, it does not report quantitative performance metrics. Instead, it provides a qualitative synthesis of 40 citations mapped to this new framework. The analysis highlights that while sub-capabilities like tool selection are maturing, integrated performance across all three dimensions remains rare.

This paper significantly influences the field by providing a clear roadmap toward AGI-driven agents. By defining specific desiderata, the authors highlight critical research gaps in realistic evaluation metrics, long-term multi-turn reasoning, and agent self-evolution. Furthermore, the creation of a curated repository of relevant papers serves as a vital community resource, accelerating future research by streamlining access to relevant methodologies.

## Technical Details

The paper proposes a unified framework for Conversational Agents organized into a **Three-Dimensional Capability Framework**:

### 1. Reasoning (Structured Decision Making)
Focuses on how the agent processes information and formulates decisions.
*   **General Reasoning:**
    *   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Step-by-step logical deduction.
    *   **Least-to-Most:** Decomposing complex problems into smaller sub-problems.
    *   **Code-Assisted Reasoning:** Using programming logic (e.g., PoT, PAL).
    *   **Refinement Methods:** Iterative improvement of responses.
*   **Agentic Reasoning:**
    *   **ReAct Pattern:** Combining reasoning and acting.
    *   **Tree-Based Exploration:** Methods like Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) and LATS.
    *   **Search Algorithms:** Implementation of MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search).
    *   **Dynamic Interaction:** Patterns like ReSpAct.

### 2. Monitor (Self-Awareness & Context Tracking)
Focuses on the agent's ability to understand itself and the user.
*   **Self-Awareness:**
    *   **Self-Knowledge Boundary:** Using methods like Self-DC and SMART to understand limits.
    *   **Self-Correction:** Mechanisms like Reflexion and RAP to fix errors.
*   **User & Interaction Monitoring:**
    *   **State Tracking:** Using systems like InstructTODS.
    *   **Personalization:** Utilizing frameworks like LaMP.
    *   **Emotion & Sentiment:** tracking user emotional states.

### 3. Control (Tool Utilization & Policy)
Focuses on the agent's ability to interact with the external world and adhere to rules.
*   **Tool Selection:**
    *   Models like **Gorilla** and **Toolformer** designed to select the correct API or tool.
*   **Tool Execution:**
    *   Systems like **HuggingGPT** that manage the execution of selected tools.
*   **Policy Learning:**
    *   **Constraint Adherence:** Benchmarks like τ-Bench.
    *   **Deep Dyna-Q Integration:** Advanced reinforcement learning for policy management.
