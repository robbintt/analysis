## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental lack of a rigorous mathematical definition for what it means when a language model (LM) "simulates" another system, a capability often loosely described as "role-playing." Current evaluation methods rely heavily on statistical benchmarks that fail to capture the causal mechanisms necessary for an LM to faithfully replicate a specific process. Without a formal framework grounded in causality, it is impossible to verify whether an LM is truly modeling a system's logic—such as the randomness of a fair coin toss—or simply generating text that superficially mimics the target system.

The paper introduces **Causal Abstractive Simulation (CAS)**, a formalism based on Structural Causal Models (SCMs) that rigorously defines the conditions under which a Simulator System (`L`) replicates a Referent System (`R`) for a given Observer (`O`). The **Causal Abstractive Simulation Hypothesis (CASH)** simplifies this verification by asserting that `L` simulates `R` if and only if the Observer’s model of `R` is a valid causal abstraction of `L`. Technically, this is achieved by partitioning the Simulator’s exogenous variables into observer-settable and internal variables, connected via an Interpretation Mapping Function (`$\tau_O$`). This architecture allows for a precise mapping between the internal mechanics of the LM and the logical requirements of the system it is intended to emulate.

To validate the framework, the author utilizes a controlled case study involving a fair coin toss rather than traditional quantitative benchmarking. The results provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the proposed definitions can strictly verify whether an LM meets the criteria for simulation. Through logical analysis of the coin toss example, the paper successfully validates the framework's utility, showing how it can formally demarcate a valid causal simulation—where the model correctly produces independent random events—from failure modes where the model's output is causally corrupted by prior context or textual dependencies.

This work significantly bridges the gap between statistical practice and mathematical theory by providing the first formal causal definition of LM simulation. For practitioners, it shifts the evaluation paradigm from surface-level text matching to the validation of causal structures. For philosophers and cognitive scientists, it offers a precise operationalization of simulation and role-playing concepts. Additionally, the paper contributes a theoretical advancement to the field of causal inference by extending causal abstraction theory.

## Technical Details

The paper proposes **Causal Abstractive Simulation (CAS)**, a formalism based on Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to define simulation between systems for an observer.

### Architecture Components
The system comprises three distinct entities:
1.  **Referent System (R):** The target system being simulated.
2.  **Simulator System (L):** The language model acting as the simulator.
3.  **Observer (O):** The entity observing and evaluating the simulation.

### Mathematical Definitions
*   **Causal Model (M):** Defined as a tuple $(\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{I})$, extended probabilistically.
*   **Simulator (L):** A probabilistic model where exogenous variables are partitioned into:
    *   **Observer-settable variables**
    *   **Internal variables**
*   **Observer (O):** Contains a model of the referent, priors over contexts, intervention distributions, and an **Interpretation Mapping Function (`$\tau_O$`)**.

### The Hypothesis (CASH)
The **Causal Abstractive Simulation Hypothesis (CASH)** asserts that:
> `L` simulates `R` for `O` **if and only if** `O`'s model of `R` is a causal abstraction of `L`.

This relies on a critical independence assumption between observer-controlled and internal simulator variables.
