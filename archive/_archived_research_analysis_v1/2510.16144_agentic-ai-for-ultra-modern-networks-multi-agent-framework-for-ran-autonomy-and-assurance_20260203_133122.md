## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical vulnerabilities inherent in centralized Open RAN (O-RAN) architectures, specifically those relying on a centralized Non-Real-Time RIC (Non-RT RIC) for orchestration. The authors argue that while traditional centralized control loops aim for efficiency, they are susceptible to single-point failures, policy conflicts, and data drift. A significant issue identified is that naive, predictor-driven deployments often optimize local Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) at the expense of global network health. This "local vs. global optimization" conflict can inadvertently destabilize neighboring network elements, leading to unsafe actions under unforeseen conditions and a lack of system-wide resilience.

The paper introduces a distributed **Multi-Agent Framework** designed to decouple intelligence from a central control point, thereby mitigating the risks of centralized orchestration. Technically, the architecture employs specialized agents that collaborate across distinct functions: data collection, model training, prediction, and policy deployment. The core innovation lies in the integration of a **Simulation-Based Agent (SBA)** and a **Verifier Agent (VA)**. While Predictive AI Models (MLPs and LSTMs) generate initial recommendations, the SBA evaluates policy impacts, and the VA rigorously validates these recommendations against real-time telemetry and "neighbor guardrails." If the VA detects that a proposed policy will negatively impact adjacent cells, it blocks deployment, creating a safety layer that prioritizes global Quality of Service (QoS) over isolated optimization.

In a traffic steering use case evaluated under surge and drift conditions, the Agentic framework demonstrated superior stability compared to a "No-Agent" baseline. While the No-Agent system achieved a higher local throughput of 72.4 Mbps, it caused a collapse in neighbor performance. Conversely, the Agentic system maintained the drifted baseline to protect the network. Specifically, the No-Agent approach reduced target PRB utilization (0.671 to 0.598) but triggered a massive surge in neighbor utilization (0.413 to 0.586, peaking at the 95th percentile of 0.663). Furthermore, while the No-Agent system improved local SINR by +1.14 dB, it degraded neighbor SINR, whereas the Agentic system successfully rejected this unsafe policy to maintain overall network stability.

This work advocates for a fundamental paradigm shift in Beyond 5G and 6G network architectures, positioning multi-agent systems as the solution to the increasing complexity of modern networks. By providing empirical evidence that multi-agent architectures can serve as a foundation for trustworthy AI-driven autonomy, the study establishes a new standard for resilience and safety in network orchestration. The framework’s ability to provide explainability and prevent network-wide overload under complex environmental stressors offers a path toward fully autonomous networks that can self-regulate without compromising the stability of the broader ecosystem.

## Key Findings

*   **Limitations of Centralization:** Traditional O-RAN control loops that rely on centralized RIC-based orchestration are prone to risks such as policy conflicts, data drift, and the execution of unsafe actions under unforeseen conditions.
*   **Local vs. Global Optimization:** A naive predictor-driven deployment may improve local Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) but can inadvertently destabilize neighboring network elements.
*   **Superiority of Agentic Systems:** The proposed multi-agent framework successfully identifies and blocks unsafe policies, thereby preserving global network health where traditional methods might fail.
*   **Resilience and Safety:** Replacing tightly-coupled centralized workflows with distributed agents results in a system that achieves greater autonomy, resilience, explainability, and system-wide safety.

## Technical Details

The paper proposes a Multi-Agent Framework for RAN orchestration, shifting from centralized Non-RT RIC to a distributed architecture.

### Core Components
*   **Predictive AI Models:** Utilizes MLPs and LSTMs for generating initial recommendations.
*   **Simulation-Based Agent (SBA):** Evaluates the potential impacts of policies before deployment.
*   **Verifier Agent (VA):** Validates recommendations against real-time telemetry and neighbor guardrails.

### Workflow Mechanism
1.  **Proposal:** Actions are proposed based on predictive models.
2.  **Simulation:** The SBA simulates the outcomes of these actions.
3.  **Verification:** The VA checks recommendations against real-time constraints.
4.  **Safety Block:** If the VA identifies unsafe consequences (e.g., destabilizing neighbors), it blocks deployment to preserve global QoS.

### Safety Mechanisms
*   **Neighbor Guardrails:** Specific constraints designed to prevent network-wide overload and ensure adjacent cells are not negatively impacted by local optimizations.

    *   Model training
    *   Prediction
    *   Policy generation
    *   Verification
    *   Deployment
    *   Assurance
*   **Use Case Evaluation:** The framework was substantiated through the design and evaluation of a traffic steering use case specifically tested under surge and drift conditions.
*   **Performance Metrics:** The system's effectiveness was measured using four specific KPIs:
    *   RRC connected users
    *   IP throughput
    *   PRB utilization
    *   SINR

## Results

Comparing 'No-Agent' vs. 'Agentic' systems under environmental drift:

*   **Throughput:**
    *   **No-Agent:** Achieved 72.4 Mbps locally but caused neighbor collapse.
    *   **Agentic:** Maintained drifted baseline to protect the network.
*   **PRB Utilization:**
    *   **No-Agent:** Reduced target utilization (0.671 to 0.598, 10.9%) but caused a massive surge in neighbor utilization (0.413 to 0.586, 95th percentile 0.663).
    *   **Agentic:** Prevented surge, maintaining stability.
*   **SINR:**
    *   **No-Agent:** Improved target SINR by +1.14 dB but degraded neighbor SINR.
    *   **Agentic:** Kept SINR unchanged by rejecting the unsafe policy.

**Conclusion:** The Agentic system prioritizes network-wide stability over isolated local optimization.
