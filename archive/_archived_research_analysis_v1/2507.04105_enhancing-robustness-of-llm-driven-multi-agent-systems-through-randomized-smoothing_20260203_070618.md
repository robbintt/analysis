## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical vulnerability of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to adversarial attacks and hallucinations. In safety-critical domains, such as aerospace or autonomous navigation, the propagation of malicious inputs or erroneous reasoning from a single agent can compromise the consensus and cooperative integrity of the entire network. Because LLMs often function as black boxes, ensuring reliable decision-making under adversarial influence is a significant challenge. Without robust certification mechanisms, these systems are prone to persistent oscillations and deviation from their objectives, making their deployment in high-stakes environments risky.

The authors introduce a defense framework that adapts randomized smoothing—a statistical technique traditionally used for classification robustness—to the domain of MAS consensus. This approach provides probabilistic certification for agent decisions in black-box settings, mathematically bounding the impact of perturbations to guarantee system stability. To address the high computational costs typically associated with randomized smoothing, the team developed a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism. This mechanism balances the need for robustness certification with computational efficiency by smoothing state trajectories, thereby preventing the propagation of malicious inputs and forcing the group's average state to approximate the ideal baseline.

In a 3D aerospace simulation utilizing LLM-driven UAVs, the framework demonstrated significant efficacy in maintaining system stability under adversarial conditions. When compared to a vulnerable system that exhibited an average deviation of 0.1251 to 0.1323 units with persistent oscillations, the defended system achieved a deviation of only 0.0129 units. This represents a **90.24% average reduction in deviation**. Furthermore, the simulations confirmed that the defense layer successfully maintained safe separation and effective coordination among agents, validating the framework's ability to preserve consensus performance without compromising the system's primary operational goals.

This work establishes a vital pathway for the trustworthy deployment of LLM-based multi-agent systems in real-world, safety-critical applications. By providing probabilistic guarantees regarding agent decisions, the research moves beyond empirical defense to offer certifiable robustness. The successful adaptation of randomized smoothing to MAS consensus, combined with the scalable two-stage sampling mechanism, resolves a key computational bottleneck. Consequently, this study significantly influences the field by offering a rigorous, practical solution to the problem of adversarial susceptibility in autonomous swarms and cooperative AI systems.
