## Executive Summary

Large Language Models (LLMs) currently rely on pattern matching rather than genuine causal reasoning, which limits their ability to handle interventions or novel scenarios and makes them brittle under distribution shifts. Previous research has been limited to synthetic datasets, but this paper aims to bridge the gap between associative learning and true causal reasoning to answer counterfactual questions based on real-world events.

To address this, the authors introduce **Causal Cartographer**, a two-stage framework for extracting and utilizing causal knowledge from text. The first stage uses a Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) agent named CTG-Extract to mine causal relationships and construct a knowledge graph based on Structural Causal Models (SCMs). The second stage employs a Constrained Reasoning Agent that performs step-by-step counterfactual inference bounded by the extracted graph, using "causal blankets" and "world grounding" to prevent hallucinations.

The framework's viability was demonstrated through **CausalWorld**, a large-scale network derived from 500 media events regarding 2020 oil price fluctuations. The resulting graph, comprising 975 nodes and 1,337 edges, is organized into 44 topic clusters and 109 structural communities while identifying critical bridge nodes like "Crude Oil Prices" and "Novel Coronavirus Outbreak." Compared to standard LLMs, this constrained reasoning approach reduced inference costs, improved robustness against hallucinations, and minimized spurious correlations.

This work significantly advances the field by operationalizing causal reasoning for LLMs beyond theoretical or synthetic limitations, enabling the handling of complex, real-world phenomena. By decoupling knowledge extraction from reasoning, the Causal Cartographer framework mitigates computational costs and hallucination risks, establishing a scalable pathway to transform unstructured text into actionable causal knowledge for more reliable and interpretable AI systems.

## Key Findings

*   **Limitations of Current LLMs:** Existing models lack causal reasoning capabilities and rely heavily on memorization rather than understanding the mechanisms behind events.
*   **Framework Success:** The Causal Cartographer framework successfully extracts and models causal relationships to build a real-world knowledge network.
*   **Efficiency and Robustness:** Utilizing a constrained reasoning agent improves robustness, significantly reduces inference costs, and minimizes spurious correlations compared to standard LLM approaches.
*   **Real-World Application:** The approach facilitates real-world counterfactuals, addressing previous limitations where causal models were evaluated only on synthetic datasets.

## Methodology

The research proposes the **Causal Cartographer**, a two-stage framework designed to transform unstructured text into actionable causal models.

### Stage 1: Knowledge Extraction (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

In this stage, an agent retrieves causal relationships from text to construct a large, real-world network. This process moves beyond simple information retrieval to identify distinct causal links.

### Stage 2: Constrained Reasoning

A counterfactual reasoning agent performs step-by-step causal inference. Crucially, this reasoning is constrained by the relationships identified in the first stage, ensuring that inferences remain grounded in the established knowledge graph rather than hallucinating new connections.

## Technical Details

The Causal Cartographer framework is a twofold system composed of specialized agents and rigorous theoretical underpinnings.

### System Architecture

*   **CTG-Extract (Graph-RAG Agent):** Built using the ReAct framework and Smolagents library with a Python interpreter. It operates in a Thought-Code-Observation cycle.
*   **Counterfactual Reasoning Agent:** Performs step-by-step causal inference constrained by the graph.
*   **Knowledge Base:** The resulting output is a structured database called **CausalWorld**.

### Extraction Process (5-Step Plan)

1.  **Define Variables:** Identify variables and confounders (defined by name, description, type, and context).
2.  **Matching:** Match new variables with existing nodes via GraphRAG.
3.  **Define Relationships:** Link cause and effect between variables.
4.  **Integration:** Add relationships to the graph.
5.  **World Grounding:** Save multiple "worlds" per node based on documents to ensure context specificity.

### Theoretical Basis

*   **Structural Causal Models (SCMs):** The system models relationships as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
*   **Variable Types:** Distinguishes between endogenous and exogenous variables.
*   **Causal Blankets:** Utilized to estimate true counterfactuals and isolate causal mechanisms.

## Results

The methodology was validated using the **CausalWorld** dataset, constructed from 500 media events in 2020 focused on oil price fluctuations.

### Network Statistics

*   **Nodes:** 975
*   **Edges:** 1,337
*   **Density:** ~0.001 (Supports the Sparse Mechanisms Shift hypothesis)
*   **Organization:** 44 topic clusters and 109 structural communities.

### Key Insights

*   **Bridge Nodes:** Critical connection points identified include **Crude Oil Prices**, **Novel Coronavirus Outbreak**, and **Global Economic Growth**.
*   **Performance:** The framework successfully reduced inference costs, improved robustness against hallucinations, and minimized spurious correlations compared to baseline LLMs.
