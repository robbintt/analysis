## 📋 Executive Summary

Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide significant advantages over deterministic models by quantifying uncertainty, yet they are notoriously resource-intensive, requiring substantial memory and computational power. While quantization is a standard technique for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices, applying it to BNNs presents a unique challenge: aggressive bit-reduction typically corrupts the statistical properties required to estimate probability distributions. Consequently, standard quantization methods degrade classification accuracy and, more critically, fail to disentangle epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, rendering the models unreliable for safety-critical applications.

To address these challenges, the authors introduce a framework for **Uncertainty-Preserving Quantized Bayesian Neural Networks (QBNNs)** based on Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). The core innovation is a **Joint Quantization (JQ)** strategy that systematically integrates Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ) and Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ). Crucially, to preserve distributional structure at low bit-widths, the methodology employs **logarithmic quantization for variance parameters** rather than linear uniform quantization. This is combined with specialized activation functions designed to maintain the integrity of the underlying probabilistic model, enabling stable inference even with severely compressed parameters.

Empirical validation on the Dirty-MNIST dataset demonstrates that the proposed Joint Quantization strategy achieves an **8x reduction in memory usage** compared to standard floating-point implementations. Remarkably, the framework maintains classification accuracy without sacrifice at aggressive 4-bit precision. Furthermore, uncertainty calibration metrics indicate minimal degradation in the estimation quality of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. This confirms that the QBNNs successfully retain the ability to distinguish between model uncertainty and data noise despite the significant compression of the parameter space.

This research bridges a critical gap between efficient, low-precision hardware and robust probabilistic modeling. By proving that BNNs can be quantized to 4-bit precision without losing uncertainty calibration, the authors provide a viable pathway for deploying reliable, uncertainty-aware models on edge devices. The findings also offer essential design guidelines for the development of future analog 'Bayesian Machines,' influencing the direction of hardware accelerator design for systems that operate at inherently low precisions.
