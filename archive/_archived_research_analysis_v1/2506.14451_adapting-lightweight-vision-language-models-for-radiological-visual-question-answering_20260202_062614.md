## Executive Summary

Radiological Visual Question Answering (VQA) faces a dual barrier to entry: the prohibitive computational cost of state-of-the-art large vision-language models and a scarcity of expert-labeled medical data. Unlike general computer vision domains, medical imaging lacks massive annotated datasets, limiting the training of robust, interpretable models. Consequently, leading solutions such as LLaVA-Med rely on architectures exceeding 8 billion parameters, necessitating expensive hardware and rendering advanced diagnostic AI inaccessible for many clinical settings.

The authors propose a resource-efficient framework centered on **PaliGemma-mix-448**, a lightweight 3 billion parameter model comprising a SigLIP vision tower (~400M parameters) and a Gemma language decoder. The technical innovation employs a two-stage training strategy: Stage 1 utilizes Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align the projection head with anatomical vocabulary, while Stage 2 involves full model fine-tuning. To address data limitations, the framework implements a cost-effective synthetic data pipeline using LLaMA-8B to generate question-answer pairs, augmenting specific radiological datasets. Additionally, the system integrates a saliency-based diagnostic tool employing Raw and Rollout Attention analysis, allowing domain experts to visualize model focus and identify ill-conditioned failure modes.

The model was trained on a curated mixture of SLAKE (~14k VQA pairs), PMC-VQA (~227k QA pairs), ROCO v2.0 (~79k image-caption pairs), and MedPix 2.0 (~12k cases). Evaluation on ROCO+MedPix VQA tasks demonstrated that the proposed 3 billion parameter model achieves classification accuracy comparable to LLaVA-Med, which relies on 8 billion parameters. Generative factuality was validated through GPT-4 assessment, confirming that the lightweight model maintains high diagnostic precision while requiring a **62.5% reduction in parameter count** relative to the baseline, significantly lowering computational overhead.

This research shifts the paradigm for medical AI accessibility by proving that high-performance radiological VQA does not strictly require massive parameter scales. The proposed training framework offers a scalable solution for data-scarce medical domains by successfully leveraging synthetic data generation, thereby minimizing reliance on expensive expert annotation. Moreover, the inclusion of interpretability tools directly addresses the "black box" nature of deep learning in healthcare. Collectively, these contributions enable the deployment of sophisticated diagnostic AI tools in resource-constrained medical environments without sacrificing model efficacy.
