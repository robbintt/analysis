## Executive Summary

Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to their massive computational and memory requirements. While low-rank decomposition is a standard technique for compressing neural networks, applying it effectively to LLMs remains difficult. The primary obstacle is the high variability and prevalence of outliers in activation distributions, which standard decomposition methods—typically minimizing the Frobenius norm of the weight difference—fail to account for. Consequently, existing methods often struggle with "unseen activations" during inference, leading to significant performance degradation. Addressing this issue is critical for enabling efficient, on-device deployment of powerful models without sacrificing their generative capabilities.

The authors introduce **Nested Activation-aware Decomposition (NSVD)**, a training-free post-processing framework designed to overcome the limitations of standard decomposition. Unlike traditional methods that approximate the weight matrix in isolation, NSVD minimizes reconstruction error relative to the input activation matrix. The core technical innovation involves transforming the weight matrix based on the specific activation distributions of the data, effectively "absorbing" outliers into the weights rather than allowing them to distort the approximation. The framework utilizes data whitening via a diagonal matrix derived from the absolute mean values of input activations and employs a nested decomposition structure with parameters $k1$ and $k2$ to flexibly distribute rank and handle truncation-aware whitening. This approach allows for precise decomposition without requiring fine-tuning or retraining.

Evaluations across 8 datasets, 6 models, and 3 families (LLaMA, OPT, Vicuna, and Mistral) demonstrate that NSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines like Standard SVD and ASVD in terms of Perplexity (PPL). At a 30% compression ratio, NSVD achieved a 14.7% average improvement, with the Japanese AlpacaEval dataset seeing a 54.8% reduction in PPL. At 40% compression, the average performance improvement rose to 18.3%. Crucially, under aggressive 50% compression where baselines collapsed—exemplified by ASVD reaching a PPL of 87,327 on the CMRC dataset compared to NSVD's stable 6,051—NSVD maintained robustness. Furthermore, adjusting the nested parameter $k1$ yielded significant gains in multilingual settings, improving performance on AlpacaEval JP by up to 74.8%.

This work establishes a new benchmark for training-free LLM compression, offering a highly efficient post-processing step that eliminates the resource intensity of retraining. By explicitly defining and addressing the challenges of activation variability and unseen activations, NSVD provides a robust solution that generalizes effectively across multilingual and multitask settings. The method's ability to maintain high accuracy at medium-to-high compression ratios represents a significant advancement for the field, enabling more accessible deployment of large-scale generative models on resource-constrained hardware while preserving their ability to handle diverse linguistic and functional requirements.

*   **At 30% Compression:**
    *   NSVD-I achieved a **14.7% average improvement** over baselines.
    *   AlpacaEval JP PPL dropped by **54.8%**.
*   **At 40% Compression:**
    *   Average improvement rose to **18.3%**.
*   **At 50% Compression:**
    *   NSVD maintained robustness where baselines failed.
    *   *Example:* On CMRC PPL, NSVD remained stable at ~6,051, whereas ASVD spiked to 87,327.
*   **Multilingual Adjustments:**
    *   Adjusting the nested parameter $k1$ to lower values significantly improved multilingual performance (up to **74.8%** on AlpacaEval JP) with a slight trade-off on English benchmarks.
