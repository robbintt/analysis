> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Current Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental limitation in autonomously internalizing data and executing algorithms, struggling with precise logical dependencies and relying on external tool delegation which introduces latency, privacy risks, and catastrophic failures in nested calls. The authors propose **LLM-DAL** (Large Language Model – Decompositional Algorithmic Learning), a training framework designed to force the internalization of algorithmic logic through "reasoning decomposition" by breaking complex tasks into progressive, simpler subtasks.
>
> The study applies LLM-DAL to the multiplication algorithm, contextualizing the challenge against SOTA models like Mathstral 7B and QwQ-32B-Preview, noting that while external APIs achieve 100% success on simple tasks, they fail on nested calls and advanced algebraic reasoning. The significance of this research lies in validating reasoning decomposition as a viable path to deterministic internal execution, mitigating reliance on fragile external infrastructure and suggesting that structured, progressive guidance is more critical than sheer scale for achieving reliable, complex inference.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Inherent Limitations:** LLMs currently face inherent limitations in internalizing processed data and struggle with the autonomous execution of algorithms.
*   **Enhanced Inference:** The ability of LLMs to perform complex algorithmic inferences can be significantly enhanced through specialized training techniques.
*   **Improved Generalization:** Properly designed training mechanisms improve the generalization capabilities of LLMs regarding algorithmic tasks.
*   **Reasoning Decomposition:** Guiding the model's learning process via reasoning decomposition is more effective than relying solely on the model's default statistical learning capabilities.

## 🧪 Methodology

The researchers adopted a specialized supervised training approach centered on **reasoning decomposition**.

*   **Framework Implementation:** Introduced and implemented the **LLM-DAL** (Large Language Model - Decompositional Algorithmic Learning) framework.
*   **Active Guidance:** The framework is designed to actively guide the model through the learning process to facilitate algorithm execution.
