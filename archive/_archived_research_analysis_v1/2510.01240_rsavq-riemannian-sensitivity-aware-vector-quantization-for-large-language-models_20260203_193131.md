> ### 📋 Executive Summary
>
> **The Challenge:**
> Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained hardware requires extreme compression. Existing Vector Quantization (VQ) methods typically rely on a Euclidean view of parameter space. This limitation leads to unconstrained quantization error directions and suboptimal uniform bit allocation, causing significant accuracy degradation at the low bit-widths (2-4 bits) required for edge deployment.
>
> **The Solution:**
> The authors introduce **RSAVQ** (Riemannian Sensitivity-Aware Vector Quantization), a novel framework leveraging information geometry. By treating the neural network parameter space as a non-uniformly curved Riemannian manifold rather than a flat Euclidean space, RSAVQ utilizes the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as the metric tensor.
>
> **The Mechanism:**
> RSAVQ implements two key mechanisms:
> 1.  **Error Direction Sensitivity Guidance (EDSG):** Projects quantization errors onto low-sensitivity directions using negative natural gradients.
> 2.  **Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG):** Analyzes FIM curvature to construct channel-wise sensitivity metrics for dynamic bit allocation.
>
> **The Impact:**
> In trials with the LLaMA-3 8B model under 2-bit constraints, RSAVQ outperformed state-of-the-art baselines (VPTQ and QuIP#), reducing perplexity by 0.4 and increasing zero-shot accuracy by 1.5. This work establishes a theoretical bridge between information geometry and quantization, enabling high-performance LLM deployment on consumer-grade hardware without significant quality loss.
