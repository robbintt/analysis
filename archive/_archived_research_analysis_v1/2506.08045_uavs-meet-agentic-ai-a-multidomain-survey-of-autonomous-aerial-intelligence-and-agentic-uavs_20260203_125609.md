## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the fundamental limitations of traditional Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which are restricted to SAE Level 1-2 autonomy and rely on static waypoint navigation and single-modality sensing. As UAV applications expand into complex, unstructured environments, there is a critical need for systems capable of goal-driven behavior and high-level decision-making.

Surveying seven high-impact domains—including precision agriculture, disaster response, and logistics—the authors highlight that current systems lack the necessary flexibility for dynamic real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the study identifies significant barriers to widespread adoption, including technical constraints, regulatory limitations, and critical issues regarding data-model reliability.

The core innovation is a comprehensive conceptual framework for **"Agentic UAVs"** based on the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigm. The survey provides a comparative analysis demonstrating that Agentic UAVs significantly outperform traditional systems by utilizing learned RL policies, multimodal sensing, and energy-aware path optimization. The findings point toward the development of self-evolving aerial ecosystems, emphasizing the necessity of sustainable deployment and equitable governance.
