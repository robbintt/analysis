## Executive Summary

### **Problem: Context Selection Friction in LLM-Assisted Data Analysis**
This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) within computational notebooks like Jupyter. As data analysis workflows become prolonged and iterative, notebooks often devolve into disorganized, non-linear states, causing analysts to lose track of their "mental model" dependencies. This disorganization creates severe friction in **context selection**—the process of identifying the precise code, variables, and execution states required for effective LLM prompting. When users fail to curate this context correctly, LLMs receive incomplete or irrelevant inputs, resulting in inaccurate or hallucinatory assistance.

### **Innovation: Directed Graph Visualization and Hybrid Context Management**
The core innovation is **NoteEx**, a JupyterLab extension designed to externalize an analyst's mental model through interactive visual context manipulation. Technically, NoteEx distinguishes between rigid **"code dependencies"** (linear state flow) and semantic **"mental model dependencies"** (non-linear connections such as sequential, parallel, and hierarchical relationships). The system utilizes a **hybrid selection strategy** that combines automatic dependency tracking with lightweight user-defined links. By rendering a **2D directed graph** layout rather than a linear structure, NoteEx allows users to interactively select "task-relevant context" and explicitly construct the prompts sent to the LLM.

### **Results: Quantified Gains in Context Accuracy and Model Performance**
The research validated the system through a two-phase empirical study. A formative phase involving **6 participants** (average **4.8 years** of EDA experience) analyzed **105 initial codes**, identifying **4 core themes** related to workflow friction. A subsequent comparative user study (**n=12**) evaluated NoteEx against a standard linear notebook baseline. The results demonstrated statistically significant improvements in **mental model retention** and **context selection accuracy**. Crucially, these UI-driven improvements translated directly to superior LLM performance; participants using NoteEx generated responses with significantly higher **relevance** and **accuracy** scores compared to the control group.

### **Impact: Establishing Context Management as a First-Class Interaction**
The significance of NoteEx extends beyond a single tool, establishing a new paradigm for Human-AI collaboration in data science by treating context management as a first-class interaction problem. By demonstrating that visualizing semantic dependencies directly enhances LLM response quality, this work proves that the efficacy of AI models in complex environments is heavily dependent on UI/UX mechanisms used to control context. This research shifts the focus of AI tool development toward dependency-aware environments that adapt to human cognitive processes.

## Key Findings

*   **Loss of Mental Model:** Analysts struggle to maintain mental models in long, disorganized notebooks, causing severe workflow management difficulties.
*   **Context Selection Challenges:** Users often fail to curate the correct context for LLM prompts, leading to poor assistance.
*   **Validation of Effectiveness:** A user study (n=12) showed NoteEx significantly improves mental model retention and context selection compared to a baseline.
*   **Improved LLM Performance:** Enhanced context selection via NoteEx leads to better relevance and accuracy in LLM-generated responses.

## Technical Details

*   **Dependency Distinction:** NoteEx differentiates between 'code dependencies' (rigid state flow) and 'mental model dependencies' (non-linear connections like sequential, parallel, and hierarchical).
*   **Hybrid Selection Strategy:** Combines automatic dependency checks with lightweight user-specified links to ensure comprehensive context capture.
*   **Task-Relevant Context:** Defines context to include code, variables, outputs, and errors, rather than just the linear execution order.
*   **Visualization Layout:** Employs a 2D visual space with directed graph-like layouts to manage dependencies, replacing traditional linear structures.

## Methodology

The research methodology followed a structured three-phase approach:

1.  **Formative Study:** Conducted with 6 participants to identify specific challenges in mental model maintenance and context selection within standard notebook environments.
2.  **System Implementation:** Development of NoteEx, a JupyterLab extension designed for semantic workflow visualization and interactive context manipulation.
3.  **Comparative User Study:** A controlled study with 12 participants evaluating NoteEx against a baseline method to measure improvements in workflow and LLM performance.
