## 1. Executive Summary

This paper addresses the computational complexity of solving Episodic Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), specifically focusing on the challenge of optimizing deterministic, memoryless, and finite-memory policies. A fundamental obstacle in this domain is that while the underlying environment is Markovian, the observation process generated by these policies is non-Markovian. This non-Markovian nature typically invalidates standard dynamic programming techniques and necessitates computationally prohibitive belief-state representations. The study aims to resolve these theoretical and computational barriers by establishing a framework for efficient policy iteration that operates directly in the output space, bypassing the complexities of belief tracking.

The core innovation is **Periodic Policy Iteration**, a novel framework that extends policy iteration guarantees to domains governed by non-Markovian output processes. Instead of requiring complex belief-state representations, the method performs updates in the output space using a periodic schedule with period $M$. The algorithm alternates between single-stage greedy policy improvements and evaluations, distinguishing itself through a rigorous forward/backward decomposition. This decomposition optimizes computational efficiency by separating the update logic for state distributions ($\mu_t$) from that of state-action values ($Q^\pi_t$). The authors prove that the algorithm guarantees monotonic policy improvements provided the update schedule is onto and non-redundant, and the method includes a model-free variant capable of estimating values directly from data in environments with unknown dynamics.

The theoretical analysis confirms that the algorithm converges when the policy remains unchanged over $M$ consecutive steps. Regarding performance benchmarks, the provided text explicitly notes that specific empirical speedup factors for the proposed method are absent; however, it contextualizes the results against existing baselines, noting that state-of-the-art Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) methods achieve values within 20% of the optimal solution in only 60% of test problems. While the full numerical results for the proposed method are not detailed in the provided text, the authors claim "substantial computational speedups" over these baselines and demonstrate the method's viability in both model-based and model-free settings through theoretical guarantees and abstract claims.

This research significantly impacts the field by successfully extending the theoretical guarantees of policy iteration to non-Markovian settings and finite-memory policies. By removing the dependency on belief-state representations and proving the viability of optimized periodic update patterns, the approach lowers the computational barrier for solving episodic POMDPs. The introduction of a model-free variant further enhances the method's practical utility, allowing for application in real-world scenarios where system models are unknown and establishing a theoretical foundation for future high-performance POMDP solvers.
