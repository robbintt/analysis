## Executive Summary

Current open-source Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) frameworks are disproportionately optimized for vision inputs, creating a significant gap in robust support for speech, audio, and music processing. This lack of specialized tools forces researchers to incur high engineering overhead to stitch together disparate components for audio-centric tasks. Without standardized pipelines, developing efficient Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remains resource-intensive, hindering rapid experimentation and deployment in critical domains such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), audio captioning, music understanding, and visual speech processing.

SLAM-LLM addresses these challenges through a modular architecture designed for flexible configuration of encoders, projectors, LLM backbones, and PEFT plugins. Technically, the framework utilizes a lightweight linear projector to map audio features—extracted by encoders like AV-HuBERT Large—into the input embedding space of a decoder-only LLM backbone (e.g., Vicuna v1.5-7B). It integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) specifically within attention layers to optimize parameter efficiency.

A core innovation is the standardization of detailed training and inference "recipes"—configurations synthesized from 40 academic citations—ensuring reliable methodologies for tasks ranging from speech recognition to music generation. The proposed framework demonstrates high performance and parameter efficiency across rigorous benchmarks. In Visual Speech Recognition on the LRS3 dataset, SLAM-LLM matched the performance of a strong AV-HuBERT Large baseline with a WER of 28.3% (vs. 28.6%) while reducing trainable parameters by approximately 85% (49M vs. 325M). In Contextual ASR on Librispeech, the model significantly outperformed traditional Neural Network-based methods like GA-CTC, achieving a WER of 1.33% on "test-clean" compared to the competitor's 2.4%, and 2.99% on "test-other" compared to 6.2%.

By releasing a comprehensive, open-source framework specifically tailored for audio and speech processing, SLAM-LLM lowers the barrier to entry for researchers. The establishment of standardized best practices via detailed recipes—grounded in established academic literature rather than community testing—serves to accelerate development cycles and reduce engineering debt. This work democratizes access to high-performance model checkpoints and sets a new standard for the design of modular, efficient Large Audio-Language Models, facilitating broader adoption and innovation in speech and music AI.

## Methodology

The SLAM-LLM framework is built upon a **modular architecture** that allows for the flexible configuration of four primary components:

1.  **Encoders:** For processing input modalities.
2.  **Projectors:** To map features to the LLM space.
3.  **LLMs:** The core reasoning backbone.
4.  **PEFT Plugins:** For efficient fine-tuning.

This approach relies on **standardized, detailed recipes** for training and inference pipelines. These recipes are specifically tailored to mainstream audio tasks, enabling the customized training of MLLMs for specific speech, language, audio, and music data domains without reinventing the pipeline for each experiment.
