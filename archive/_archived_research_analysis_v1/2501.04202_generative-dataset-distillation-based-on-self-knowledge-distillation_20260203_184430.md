## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of dataset distillation: the need to condense massive, high-dimensional datasets into significantly smaller synthetic subsets that retain the information necessary to train neural networks effectively. The primary bottleneck in existing methodologies is the precise alignment of prediction logits—the output vectors representing class probabilities—between the synthetic and original data. Without accurate logit alignment, synthetic data often fails to preserve the semantic logic and decision boundaries of the full dataset. This limitation restricts the utility of distilled datasets, as models trained on them suffer from performance degradation compared to those trained on real data, posing a barrier to efficient deployment in storage-constrained and edge-computing environments.

The authors propose a novel generative framework centered on two technical innovations: **Self-Knowledge Distillation (SKD)** and **Logit Standardization**. Unlike methods that simply select real data samples, this approach synthesizes new data points. The core mechanism employs SKD to refine the distribution matching process, enabling the synthetic data to replicate the overall structure and intra-class relationships of the full dataset. Complementing this, the authors introduce a logit standardization pre-processing step that normalizes the range of logits before distribution matching. This normalization mitigates inconsistencies in output ranges and scale variations, allowing the model to focus on intrinsic data structures rather than being skewed by arbitrary magnitude differences.

Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark, outperforming existing dataset distillation techniques across standard benchmarks including **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **TinyImageNet**. The method showed particular strength against strong baselines such as Meta-Transfer (MTT) and Distribution Matching (DM). For instance, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with an IPC (Images Per Class) of 10, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of **64.6%**, surpassing the MTT baseline at 63.9%. On the more complex TinyImageNet dataset (IPC 10), the method reached **37.0%** accuracy, a significant improvement over MTT's 34.9%. Similar performance gains were observed on CIFAR-100 (IPC 10), where the model achieved **37.5%** accuracy compared to the 35.9% baseline.

The significance of this work lies in its ability to produce highly efficient, high-fidelity synthetic datasets that maintain the performance characteristics of their much larger counterparts. By shifting the focus from simple pixel matching to precise logit alignment and structural preservation, this research provides a robust solution for reducing storage costs and accelerating training times in deep learning.

## Methodology

The authors propose a novel generative framework for dataset distillation that focuses specifically on the alignment of prediction logits. The approach integrates **Self-Knowledge Distillation** to refine the process, ensuring that the distribution of synthetic data matches that of the original data more precisely.

To address potential inconsistencies in the output ranges, the method implements a standardization step on the logits prior to performing distribution matching. This combination allows the model to capture intrinsic data structures and relationships while maintaining high alignment fidelity.
