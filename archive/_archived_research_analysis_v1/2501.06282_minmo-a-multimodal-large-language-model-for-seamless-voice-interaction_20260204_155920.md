## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of creating a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) that seamlessly integrates high-fidelity voice generation and comprehension with the reasoning capabilities of text-based LLMs. Existing solutions often suffer from disjointed modality processing—treating speech and text as separate pipelines—which results in high latency, an inability to handle real-time interruptions (full-duplex interaction), and a lack of granular control over vocal characteristics such as emotion or dialect. Bridging this gap is essential for developing voice assistants that can engage in natural, human-like conversation rather than turn-based, robotic interactions.

MinMo introduces an 8 billion parameter "aligned" model built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-instruct base, utilizing a lightweight alignment strategy to unify text and speech modalities. The core technical innovation lies in a novel four-stage training pipeline (Speech-to-text, Text-to-speech, Speech-to-speech, and Duplex interaction) trained on a massive dataset of 1.4 million hours. The architecture employs a SenseVoice-large encoder for input and a CosyVoice 2 flow-matching synthesizer for output. Crucially, MinMo incorporates a specialized Full-Duplex Predictor (a 1-layer Transformer) that manages interaction flow, enabling the model to listen and speak simultaneously while handling real-time interruptions.

MinMo achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current models like Moshi and GLM-4-Voice across key benchmarks. It achieves an average Word Error Rate (WER) of 1% over 10 languages and demonstrates high accuracy in Spoken QA and Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). In terms of efficiency, the model delivers an end-to-end latency of approximately 600ms on an L20 GPU. Furthermore, the model successfully executes complex instructions for voice generation, allowing for precise control over emotions, speaking rates, and voice mimicking.

This research significantly advances the field of voice AI by demonstrating that a single unified model can retain the reasoning power of LLMs while delivering professional-grade, low-latency voice interaction. The authors' commitment to releasing the code and models ensures that this work will serve as a robust foundation for the open-source community.

1.  **Stage 1: Speech-to-Text (S2T)** - Aligning speech input with text understanding.
2.  **Stage 2: Text-to-Speech (TTS)** - Aligning text output with speech generation.
3.  **Stage 3: Speech-to-Speech (S2S)** - Direct voice-to-voice interaction capabilities.
4.  **Stage 4: Duplex Interaction** - Training for simultaneous listening and speaking, including handling interruptions.

**Training Data:**
The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset totaling over **1.38 million hours**, distributed as follows:
*   ~1.2 million hours (Speech-to-Text)
*   ~171k hours (Text-to-Speech)
*   ~10.1k hours (Speech-to-Speech)
*   ~4k hours (Full Duplex interaction)
