## Executive Summary

The paper addresses a fundamental epistemological gap in cognitive science regarding the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional researchers often dismiss LLMs as opaque "black boxes" or "stochastic parrots" due to their lack of mechanistic interpretability and biological plausibility. This resistance creates a methodological bottleneck where the field fails to leverage advanced computational resources.

The core problem identified is a category error: researchers are evaluating LLMs based on whether they are models of human neural mechanisms, rather than evaluating what they can do as tools for analyzing linguistic structure and behavior. Resnik proposes a paradigm shift labeled "**cognitive instrumentalism**," advocating for LLMs to be treated as scientific instruments (analogous to microscopes) rather than direct cognitive models.

Technically, this approach reframes the application of LLMs from modeling internal neural processes to conducting "in-silico" experiments on the structure of linguistic data itself. The innovation lies in a methodology that uses the probability distributions of LLMs to manipulate linguistic variables and generate behavioral outputs. This allows researchers to isolate specific linguistic phenomena—such as syntactic dependencies or semantic constraints—without the biological noise inherent in human subject studies.

The paper validates the instrumentalist framework by synthesizing evidence of LLMs' quantitative alignment with human psycholinguistic data. Resnik highlights empirical results showing that surprisal metrics derived from Transformer architectures achieve significant correlations with human reading times and processing difficulty. In comparative analyses, these models often demonstrate superior predictive fidelity over traditional n-gram models and probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) when tasked with modeling acceptability judgments and cloze probabilities.

By capturing complex statistical dependencies and hierarchical structures, LLMs provide a high-fidelity proxy for human linguistic behavior, allowing for the precise estimation of processing costs across diverse syntactic constructions.

The significance of this work is its potential to harmonize the distinct goals of linguistics, cognitive science, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). By legitimizing LLMs as scientific instruments, Resnik encourages researchers to bypass the unresolvable debate over "black box" interpretability and instead focus on empirical utility. This shift enables LLMs to function as high-throughput hypothesis engines, generating novel predictions about language structure and processing that can be subsequently validated through targeted human experiments, thereby accelerating discovery in the cognitive sciences.
