### 📝 Executive Summary

> This research addresses the critical disconnect between the flexible reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the precise, structured nature of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Specifically, it tackles the barrier to entry for enterprise knowledge management, where traditional KG systems require expertise in specialized query languages (e.g., Cypher, SPARQL) that non-technical domain experts lack. This limitation prevents subject matter experts in high-stakes fields, such as legal and medical sectors, from effectively managing complex data.
>
> The paper highlights the need for a system that leverages the intuitive nature of natural language while maintaining the logical consistency and accuracy of structured graph data. The authors introduce **AGENTiGraph**, a multi-agent framework designed to bridge natural language inputs with KG operations without requiring specialized query languages.
>
> Technically, the system utilizes a modular, agent-driven architecture employing a sequential 7-step workflow: User Intent Interpretation, Key Concept Extraction, Task Planning, Knowledge Graph Interaction, Reasoning, Response Generation, and Dynamic Updates. By leveraging techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Few-Shot Learning, and the ReAct framework, AGENTiGraph allows for autonomous logical inference and dynamic query refinement.
>
> The framework was rigorously evaluated on an Expanded TutorQA dataset comprising 3,500 queries. Utilizing GPT-4o as the underlying LLM, AGENTiGraph achieved a Classification Accuracy of **95.12%**, an F1 Score of **0.9467**, and an Execution Success rate of **90.45%**. These results represent a substantial improvement of approximately 11.8% in classification accuracy and 13.3% in execution success compared to the best zero-shot baseline, while significantly outperforming a fine-tuned BERT classifier. Furthermore, a user study utilizing a 1-7 Likert scale reported strong user acceptance, with Overall Satisfaction at 6.0/7, Interface Intuitiveness at 5.8/7, and Relation Judgment Accuracy at 6.3/7.
>
> The significance of AGENTiGraph lies in its potential to democratize knowledge graph technology, shifting enterprise knowledge management toward a user-centric paradigm. By empowering non-technical users to build, manage, and query complex databases using natural language, the framework facilitates scalable and compliant solutions for critical domains.
