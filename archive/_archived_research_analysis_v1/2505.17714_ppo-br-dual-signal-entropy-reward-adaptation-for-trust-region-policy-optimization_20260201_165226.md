## Executive Summary

Standard Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning, relies on a static clipping parameter ($\epsilon$) to constrain policy updates within a trust region. While effective, this fixed approach creates a rigidity that hampers performance; the algorithm cannot dynamically adapt the trust region size based on the agent's current learning phase or uncertainty levels. Consequently, standard PPO often struggles to optimally balance the need for **exploration** against the requirement for **stability**, leading to slower convergence rates and higher reward variance during training.

The paper introduces **PPO-BR**, a novel extension that employs a "Dual-Signal Entropy-Reward Adaptation" strategy to overcome static clipping limitations. This method dynamically adjusts the trust region in real-time by fusing two distinct signals: "Entropy-Driven Expansion" and "Reward-Guided Contraction." Technically, the mechanism expands the trust region when entropy is high to encourage exploration, while contracting it based on reward signals to ensure stability during convergence. This creates a phase-aware, bounded trust region that evolves with the agent's learning progress. Notably, this is achieved with high efficiency, requiring a modification of only five lines of code and adding minimal computational complexity.

Empirical evaluations across six diverse benchmarks, including MuJoCo and Atari, demonstrate that **PPO-BR** significantly outperforms standard PPO and five other state-of-the-art baselines. The method achieved a **29.1% faster convergence rate** ($p < 0.001$) and reduced reward variance by a factor of **2.3x**. These performance gains are accompanied by exceptional computational efficiency, with the introduced mechanism resulting in less than **1.8% runtime overhead**, making it a highly scalable solution for complex environments.

This research establishes a new "Phase-Aware Learning Paradigm" that theoretically grounds the fusion of exploration and stability in RL optimization. The contribution is significant for its broad applicability, offering a unified entropy-reward mechanism relevant not only to general reinforcement learning but also to the optimization of Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, the method's simplicity, combined with its enhanced stability and low variance, makes it deployment-ready for safety-critical domains such as robotic surgery and autonomous drones, where reliability and computational efficiency are paramount.

*   **Enhanced Stability:** Reduces reward variance by **2.3x** relative to standard PPO, ensuring smoother training dynamics.
*   **High Efficiency & Simplicity:** Introduces less than **1.8%** runtime overhead and requires only **five lines of code** change to integrate.
*   **Superior Baseline Performance:** Outperformed five State-of-the-Art baselines across six diverse benchmarks, including MuJoCo and Atari.

## Methodology

**PPO-BR** introduces a dynamic, dual-signal adaptation for the trust region clipping parameter (epsilon) to address the limitations of static clipping.

The approach fuses exploration and convergence signals through two specific mechanisms:

1.  **Entropy-Driven Expansion:** Expands the trust region when uncertainty (entropy) is high to encourage exploration.
2.  **Reward-Guided Contraction:** Contracts the trust region based on reward signals to ensure stability during convergence.

By combining these signals, the algorithm creates a single, bounded trust region that adapts in real-time to the specific phase of learning.
