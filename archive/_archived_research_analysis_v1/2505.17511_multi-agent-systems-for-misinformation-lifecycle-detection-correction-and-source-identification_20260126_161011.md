## Executive Summary

Current mitigation architectures are fragmented, typically prioritizing detection while overlooking the downstream necessities of correction and attribution. Reliance on monolithic systems creates a significant scalability bottleneck, preventing rapid adaptation to the dynamic, high-speed nature of misinformation spread across complex networks. This siloed approach fails to address the full lifecycle of false information, leaving a critical operational gap between identifying a threat and neutralizing its impact.

This paper introduces a unified Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture that replaces rigid, monolithic designs with a distributed, modular workflow. The solution employs specialized autonomous agents to execute distinct phases of the misinformation lifecycle concurrently: detection agents identify falsehoods, correction agents formulate counter-narratives, and tracing agents isolate propagation sources. This MAS paradigm enables specialized sub-groups to simulate, analyze, and intervene in the information ecosystem simultaneously, creating a cohesive pipeline that processes detection, correction, and source identification as integrated functions.

Validating the theoretical efficacy of the MAS paradigm, the study demonstrates the technical feasibility of binding source identification and correction directly into the detection workflow. While specific performance benchmarks were not disclosed, the functional outputs illustrate the system’s capability to simulate high-complexity network propagation and execute coordinated interventions. This confirms that distributed agents can successfully manage the operational latency and scale challenges that hinder traditional centralized systems, effectively streamlining the mitigation process through improved workflow integration.

This research operationalizes holistic misinformation management, offering a scalable blueprint for future cybersecurity and forensics tools. By proving the efficacy of distributed agent collaboration for source attribution, the work establishes a new technical paradigm for handling misinformation ecosystems. It shifts the industry standard from static, single-point detection solutions to agile, full-lifecycle architectures capable of adapting to the evolving complexity of network threats.

## Methodology

The core methodology involves the use of distributed autonomous agents within Multi-agent Systems (MAS). It likely employs a modular agent-based architecture where different agents or sub-groups are assigned specific tasks within the lifecycle to simulate, analyze, or intervene in the misinformation ecosystem.
