## Executive Summary

Traditional topic modeling faces a critical challenge in navigating the stability-plasticity trade-off when processing real-time data streams. Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs) effectively capture temporal evolution but rely on batch processing, rendering them computationally expensive and ill-suited for continuous data flows. Conversely, standard Online Topic Models offer real-time adaptability but suffer from "catastrophic forgetting," where new information overwrites previously learned topics. This paper addresses the lack of a robust mechanism for continual learning in topic modeling—a necessity for applications like news monitoring and social media analysis, where systems must integrate emerging knowledge (e.g., new events or slang) without erasing historical context.

The authors introduce the **Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM)**, a neural architecture built upon the Dirichlet Variational AutoEncoder (DVAE) framework to enable true continual learning. The core technical innovation is the decomposition of topic parameters into a global component ($\phi_{global}$) and a local component ($\phi_{local}^t$). The global parameters function as a continuously updated prior, ensuring long-term stability and preventing catastrophic forgetting. The local parameters capture short-term, time-specific adaptations via a perturbation transformation defined as $\phi_{local}^t = g(\phi_{global}, \Delta\phi_{local}^t)$. Inference is performed using amortized variational inference, optimizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) to dynamically adjust the global prior as new data arrives, allowing the model to learn incrementally without reprocessing historical data.

In empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets including **20 Newsgroups** and **NYTimes**, CoNTM consistently outperformed established baselines—specifically Dynamic LDA, DETM, and Dynamic BERTopic—across quantitative metrics of topic quality and predictive performance. The results demonstrated that CoNTM achieves significantly **higher Topic Coherence (C_v)** and **lower Predictive Perplexity** compared to existing methods. For instance, CoNTM maintained superior perplexity scores across time slices, indicating better generalization, while its topics showed higher diversity and interpretability scores. Furthermore, the model proved computationally efficient for streaming scenarios; by decoupling the global prior from local updates, CoNTM avoids the quadratic scaling of batch DTMs, offering a **linear time complexity** suitable for high-velocity data streams and operating within a constant memory constraint relative to the topic size rather than the stream length.

This research significantly advances natural language processing by successfully integrating continual learning principles into neural topic modeling. By bridging the methodological gap between batch-oriented Dynamic Topic Models and fragile Online Topic Models, the authors provide a viable solution for sequential learning that prevents information loss. The empirical success of CoNTM suggests that neural architectures equipped with dynamic updating mechanisms offer distinct advantages in temporal tracking over traditional probabilistic methods. This work establishes a foundation for developing resilient real-world text analysis systems capable of handling infinite data streams, ensuring that long-term insights are preserved even as the model adapts to new linguistic trends.

## Methodology

The authors propose the **Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM)**, a neural architecture designed to address the stability-plasticity trade-off in topic modeling.

*   **Core Problem:** Balancing the need to incorporate new information (plasticity) with the need to retain previously learned knowledge (stability).
*   **Technical Mechanism:** The implementation relies on a **global prior distribution** that is continuously updated at subsequent time steps.
*   **Outcome:** This mechanism allows the model to learn from incoming data streams while mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting.

## Technical Details

The CoNTM is built on the **Dirichlet Variational AutoEncoder (DV AE)** framework to enable Continual Learning. The architecture is defined by specific parameters and inference processes:

### Parameter Decomposition
The model decomposes topics into two distinct sets of parameters:
*   **Global Parameters ($\phi_{global}$):** Serve as a global prior ensuring long-term consistency.
*   **Local Parameters ($\phi_{local}^t$):** Capture time-specific patterns derived from global topics.

### Transformation Logic
Local topics are generated via a perturbation transformation:
$$ \phi_{local}^t = g(\phi_{global}, \Delta\phi_{local}^t) $$

### Generative & Inference Process
*   **Generative Process:** Creates local topics, draws document-topic distributions, and samples words.
*   **Inference:** Utilizes amortized variational inference with a variational distribution $q_\theta(z) = \text{Dirichlet}(\alpha_\theta(w))$.
*   **Optimization:** The model is optimized by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).

### Comparative Advantages
*   **Vs. Dynamic Topic Models:** CoNTM supports online/streaming data (DTMs are batch-oriented).
*   **Vs. Algorithmic Dynamic Topic Models:** CoNTM learns domain-specific topics.
*   **Vs. Standard Online Topic Models:** CoNTM prevents catastrophic forgetting via the global prior.

*   **Diversity & Adaptability:** The analysis showed that CoNTM learns more diverse topics and exhibits superior adaptability to temporal changes and evolution.
*   **Stability:** The model successfully maintains stability without forgetting, attributed to the anchoring of local updates to the global prior.
