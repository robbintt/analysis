## Executive Summary

Smart personal assistants and robotic agents face a critical limitation in maintaining long-term, reality-grounded memory, often suffering from context-specific constraints or hallucinations that prevent them from reliably tracking complex relational information. This limitation hinders the advancement of agentic AI from simple command-response tools to capable cognitive assistants that can function autonomously in dynamic environments. The paper addresses the fundamental challenge of creating a robust memory architecture capable of consistent perception, disambiguation, and recall, which is essential for tasks requiring persistent environmental understanding.

The core innovation is a three-component architecture designed to fuse multimodal perception with hybrid knowledge representation. The perception module utilizes Vision Language Models (VLMs) for visual grounding and entity disambiguation, combined with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure consistent information extraction. This feeds into a hybrid memory system that structures data via a Knowledge Graph while augmenting it with vector embeddings for semantic similarity. Finally, the query mechanism employs a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that uniquely merges semantic search with automatic graph query generation, enabling precise reasoning over both structured and unstructured data.

Validation on a custom dataset of smart home interactions provides empirical evidence of the system's robustness. The perception module achieved an entity extraction F1-score of 0.89 and a relation extraction F1-score of 0.82, demonstrating high reliability in grounding visual data. In question-answering tasks, the hybrid retrieval mechanism outperformed standard vector-only RAG baselines, improving accuracy by approximately 20% on complex relational queries. Furthermore, the system maintained query latency under 2 seconds, confirming its viability for real-time robotic applications where speed and accuracy are paramount.

This research significantly advances the field of agentic AI by providing a quantifiable solution to the persistent problem of ungrounded or hallucinated memory. By bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning (knowledge graphs) and semantic understanding (vector embeddings), the work establishes a high-performance blueprint for memory systems capable of handling real-world nuance.
