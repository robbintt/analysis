## 📝 Executive Summary

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising heuristic for solving Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems, yet its application lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. While empirical results suggest RL can be effective, there is a significant theory gap regarding when RL agents converge to optimal solutions and what performance guarantees can be made.

This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of establishing a formal mathematical basis for value-based RL in CO, moving beyond heuristic approaches to provide the necessary conditions for convergence and optimality. The authors present a unified theoretical framework that rigorously models CO problems as equivalent undiscounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

The technical approach involves a three-stage transformation:
1.  Mapping the CO problem to a C-parametrized Finite Discrete Decision Process (DDP).
2.  Converting it to an additive Sequential Decision Process (SDP) using Karp and Held theory.
3.  Formulating it as a deterministic MDP via Tseng’s convergence theory.

The framework utilizes value-based RL with an Encoder-Decoder architecture for state-space embedding—a critical factor for success—and employs a policy based on the softmax of immediate rewards and the successor state's optimal value function.

The innovation lies in the rigorous convergence analysis that ties specific RL hyperparameters, such as batch size and projected gradient descent steps, directly to the quality of the CO solution. The paper delivers concrete theoretical findings rather than experimental benchmarks, deriving specific formulas and bounds. Key results include a derived formula for the optimality gap that correlates RL approximation accuracy with the final solution quality.

This research significantly bridges the disconnect between practical RL applications and theoretical guarantees in combinatorial optimization, shifting the field from purely empirical validation toward a more rigorous, mathematically sound discipline.
