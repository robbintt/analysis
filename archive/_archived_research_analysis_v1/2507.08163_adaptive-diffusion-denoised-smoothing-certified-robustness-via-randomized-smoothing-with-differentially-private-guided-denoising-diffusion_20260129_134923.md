## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of achieving certified robustness against adversarial attacks on large-scale image classification tasks, specifically within the $\ell_2$ threat model. While randomized smoothing is a proven technique for provable defenses, it traditionally relies on adding static noise, creating a difficult trade-off where increasing robustness leads to a significant drop in standard (clean) accuracy. Furthermore, standard smoothing techniques are non-adaptive, meaning they cannot adjust to the unique content of an input image. This limitation hinders the deployment of certified models in high-dimensional settings like ImageNet, as preserving clean data performance is essential for practical utility.

The key innovation is **"Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing,"** a framework that interprets a guided denoising diffusion model as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) mechanisms. Unlike standard smoothing, this method dynamically adapts the denoising process to the specific characteristics of the input image, making it "data-dependent." To handle the theoretical complexity of this adaptation, the authors utilize GDP composition theorems to combine these mechanisms mathematically. This establishes a rigorous end-to-end analysis that extends the guarantees of randomized smoothing to input-dependent, guided diffusion processes, formally linking generative diffusion models with differential privacy theory to create a tractable way to certify adaptive systems.

Empirical evaluations on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively breaks the traditional trade-off between clean performance and robustness. The approach achieves a certified accuracy of **58.6%** at an $\ell_2$-radius of **0.5**, while simultaneously maintaining a high standard accuracy of **70.4%**. This performance represents a significant improvement over existing baselines, specifically surpassing standard Gaussian smoothing methods (e.g., Cohen et al.) which typically suffer severe degradation in standard accuracy when attempting to certify comparable radii. These results validate that the adaptive diffusion framework can deliver superior robustness guarantees without sacrificing the utility required for real-world application.

The significance of this paper lies in its novel achievement of adaptive certification, moving beyond the limitations of static, input-agnostic smoothing. By providing a theoretical synthesis of guided denoising diffusion models and Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP), the authors enable the end-to-end robustness analysis of adaptive generative processes. This work establishes a foundation for future research into adaptive certified defenses, suggesting that powerful generative priors can be leveraged not just for image synthesis, but for providing provable security guarantees in complex, high-dimensional visual systems.
