> **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
>
> The deployment of machine learning in fairness-critical domains, such as criminal justice and lending, necessitates reliable local model explanations to ensure accountability. However, the field currently suffers from a lack of standardized, reproducible frameworks for evaluating these explanation techniques. Without a unified protocol, it is difficult to compare the efficacy of popular methods like LIME, SHAP, and DiCE, creating a methodological gap that hinders the verification of AI systems in high-stakes environments where consistency and transparency are paramount.
>
> **ExplainBench** addresses this gap by introducing an open-source, Python-based benchmarking suite equipped with a unified API and a Streamlit graphical interface. Technically, the framework utilizes integrated wrappers for distinct algorithms—specifically LIME, SHAP (including TreeSHAP and KernelSHAP), and DiCE counterfactuals—to normalize API access and configuration overhead. The architecture supports modular, end-to-end pipelines that handle everything from model training to explanation generation, allowing researchers to plug specific fairness datasets—explicitly listing COMPAS, UCI Adult Income, and LendingClub—into a standardized experimental protocol.
>
> Validation on these critical datasets employed specific metrics of fidelity, sparsity, and robustness, revealing significant method-specific variability among the algorithms. The quantitative assessment highlighted that **LIME** faces reproducibility challenges due to its reliance on random sampling, while **SHAP** maintains theoretical consistency but encounters computational constraints depending on the model type. Conversely, **DiCE** demonstrated a distinct advantage in generating actionable recourse by successfully minimizing input perturbations. These results underscore that no single method dominates across all evaluation criteria, emphasizing the necessity of such comparative analysis.
>
> ExplainBench advances the field of interpretable machine learning by establishing a rigorous standard for the comparative evaluation of local explanations. By providing a user-friendly, extensible tool that fosters reproducibility, the framework enables researchers and practitioners to conduct systematic audits of black-box models. This contribution promotes greater accountability in real-world AI systems and ensures that future research into explainability is grounded in consistent, verifiable experimental practices.
