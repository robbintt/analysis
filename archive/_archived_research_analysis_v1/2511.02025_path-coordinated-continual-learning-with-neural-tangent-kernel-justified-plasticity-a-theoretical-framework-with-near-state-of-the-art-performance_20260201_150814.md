## Executive Summary

> Continual learning systems face the fundamental challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where the acquisition of new information inadvertently degrades performance on previously learned tasks. This instability remains a primary barrier to deploying AI in dynamic, real-world environments where data arrives sequentially. Furthermore, many existing mitigation strategies lack rigorous theoretical grounding regarding when a model reaches its learning capacity, often relying on heuristic adjustments rather than principled geometric analysis of the model's evolution.
>
> This paper introduces a **"Path-Coordinated Continual Learning"** framework that integrates Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to dynamically regulate plasticity based on the model's internal geometry. The core technical advancement is **"NTK-Justified Plasticity,"** which monitors the condition number of the NTK as a primary signal for learning capacity; specifically, a threshold exceeding **10<sup>11</sup>** indicates that the model has reached its capacity limits.
>
> The framework coordinates parameter trajectories to minimize interference and employs Wilson confidence intervals for statistical path validation, successfully validating **80%** of discovered learning paths. Empirically, the framework achieved near state-of-the-art performance on the Split-CIFAR10 benchmark, recording an overall accuracy of **66.7%** with total catastrophic forgetting limited to **23.4%**. The research highlights a phenomenon of **"system stabilization,"** where the rate of forgetting decreases from 27% to 18% as learning progresses. Additionally, the method demonstrated high retention for intermediate tasks, maintaining performance between **90% and 97%**, thereby confirming the framework's ability to balance stability with plasticity effectively. The significance of this work lies in establishing a theoretical link between NTK geometry and practical learning capacity limits, providing a mathematically justified metric for regulating model training.
