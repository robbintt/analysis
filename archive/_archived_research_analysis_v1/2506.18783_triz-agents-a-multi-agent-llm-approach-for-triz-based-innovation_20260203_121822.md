## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the inherent complexity and high interdisciplinary knowledge barriers associated with applying the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ). Traditional TRIZ methodologies require significant cognitive effort to navigate structured steps—such as contradiction analysis and principle application—making them difficult for non-experts to implement effectively. This research matters because it aims to democratize access to systematic innovation, reducing the manual overhead and specialized expertise required to solve complex engineering problems which single-model Large Language Model (LLM) approaches often fail to handle due to a lack of rigorous logical structure.

The key innovation is the introduction of a **Multi-Agent TRIZ Framework** that shifts from single-prompt LLM interactions to a decentralized, collaborative architecture. Implemented using LangGraph with GPT-4o as the orchestrator, the system utilizes a graph-based topology where agents act as nodes and connections as edges. The workflow decomposes the inventive process into specialized stages handled by distinct agents equipped with domain-specific tools: Problem Analysis, Contradiction Matrix evaluation, application of the 40 Inventive Principles, and Solution Proposal. Communication relies on natural language prompts with ephemeral memory, while a specialized documentation agent manages state persistence, enabling the system to simulate the human inventive process through autonomous agent collaboration.

Evaluation of the system through a selected engineering case study confirms that the multi-agent architecture successfully generates diverse and inventive solutions. Results demonstrate that the agent-based approach navigates TRIZ steps more efficiently than single-LLM approaches while significantly reducing the complexity and interdisciplinary knowledge barriers for users. The system operated autonomously to produce valid solutions, validating the efficacy of the decentralized collaboration model in simulating the inventive process without the need for constant human intervention.

This work significantly advances the field by bridging the gap between structured innovation methodologies and generative AI. By demonstrating the viability of decentralized, agent-based collaboration in solving non-routine engineering problems, the paper establishes a viable model for simulating human invention using language agents. This approach suggests that future AI-driven innovation systems can leverage multi-agent architectures to handle complex, multi-step reasoning tasks that require both creative flexibility and strict adherence to logical frameworks, paving the way for more robust automated ideation tools.
