## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to adversarial perturbations, identifying a fundamental flaw in existing static defense mechanisms. Current approaches treat adversarial learning as a discrete event rather than a continuous interaction, lacking the theoretical basis to determine when a graph can maintain structural integrity under dynamic pressure. The authors argue that without a mathematical characterization of the "Adversarial Resilience Hypothesis," static heuristics cannot effectively defend against evolving attacks. Consequently, this research establishes the necessity of shifting the paradigm to a dynamic interaction model to mathematically prove the existence of stable states within graph regimes.

The key innovation is a control-theoretic framework that models adversarial learning as a complex multi-object dynamic system. Technically, the authors characterize graph perturbations as a time-evolution process comprising both linear and non-linear components. By applying Laplace Transforms, the analysis moves to a domain where system stability is rigorously assessable. To manage high dimensionality, the authors employ Heterogeneous Mean-Field (HMF) approximation, condensing the dynamics into a single function dependent on a global robustness coefficient. This reduction allows for the precise identification of an intrinsic, asymptotically-stable equilibrium point—the "critical adversarial resilience state"—providing a mathematically grounded foundation for defense strategies (Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.3).

The proposed defense method was empirically validated against three distinct types of adversarial attacks across five real-world datasets. While specific quantitative metrics are not detailed in the provided text, the authors report that the approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. The strategy optimizes the adjacency matrix by minimizing the deviation between the perturbed graph and the calculated equilibrium of the clean graph. The study claims this establishes a new performance benchmark, confirming the method maintains robustness where existing baselines fail across all tested scenarios.

This work significantly influences the field by providing the first generalized theoretical framework to mathematically prove the existence of an intrinsic critical resilience state. By introducing a systems-theoretic perspective, the research transitions the discipline from heuristic, static defenses to rigorous, dynamic modeling.
