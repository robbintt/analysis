## 📝 Executive Summary

### Problem
Vision models frequently learn spurious correlations and biases—such as pose, synthetic patch, or gender dependencies—that compromise fairness and reliability. While retraining models from scratch can mitigate these issues, it is computationally prohibitive and often impractical for deployed systems. This paper addresses the critical need for efficient, post-deployment mechanisms to correct biases in safety-critical vision domains without incurring the massive resource costs associated with full model retraining.

### Innovation
The authors introduce **"Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning,"** a post-hoc correction framework that utilizes controllable forgetting to selectively remove biased correlations while preserving core task knowledge. The approach optimizes across four distinct dimensions simultaneously: **Utility, Fairness, Quality, and Privacy**. Technically, the study evaluates three specific unlearning strategies to achieve this balance: **Gradient Ascent**, **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**, and **Teacher-Student distillation**, demonstrating how these methods can effectively "forget" harmful dependencies without discarding the model's learned utility.

### Results
Empirical validation across standard benchmarks—including CUB-200-2011, CIFAR-10, and CelebA—demonstrated that the framework achieves significant fairness improvements with minimal utility loss. Specifically, the methods recorded fairness scores of **94.86% on CUB-200-2011**, **97.37% on CelebA**, and **30.28% on CIFAR-10**. Additionally, the approach achieved a composite score of 0.62 across the weighted dimensions, confirming that post-hoc unlearning can maintain high model quality while successfully addressing diverse bias types.

### Impact
This research establishes machine unlearning as a practical and statistically viable alternative to retraining for correcting biases in computer vision. By providing comprehensive benchmarking of unlearning strategies against various bias types, the paper offers a scalable path for maintaining ethical standards in production environments. The findings suggest that developers can efficiently correct model biases post-deployment, significantly lowering the barrier to maintaining fairness in safety-critical applications.
