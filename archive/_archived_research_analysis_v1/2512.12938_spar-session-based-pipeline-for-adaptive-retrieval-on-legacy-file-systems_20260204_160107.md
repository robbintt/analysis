> ## 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Modern organizations face a significant computational challenge in extracting insights from vast amounts of unstructured data housed in legacy file systems. Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures typically rely on constructing massive, static global vector databases, a process that incurs prohibitive computational overhead and lacks the flexibility required for complex enterprise environments. Consequently, there is a critical need for a retrieval mechanism that can leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) on legacy infrastructure without the resource costs and performance penalties associated with full-scale vectorization of all data assets.
>
> The authors introduce **SPAR** (Session-based Pipeline for Adaptive Retrieval), a framework that optimizes RAG architectures by replacing static indexing with a dynamic, two-phase session-based model. The system first utilizes a lightweight, static "Metadata Index"—a relational database containing file tags and hierarchical structures—to perform coarse filtering. When a query is initiated, SPAR dynamically generates a "Session-based Workspace," constructing a temporary, task-specific vector database on-demand using only the files identified during the coarse filtering phase. This architecture employs high-level mechanisms to manage the caching and reuse of embeddings, ensuring that computationally expensive vector operations are strictly scoped to relevant data subsets within a specific user session.
>
> The framework was validated through theoretical complexity analysis and empirical testing on a synthesized enterprise-scale file system containing biomedical literature. The study provides specific theoretical metrics, defining efficiency based on total files ($N$), total tags ($M$), average processing time ($T_{proc}$), and the filtered workspace subset ($N_{filtered}$). The results prove that SPAR minimizes $T_{proc}$ relative to $M$ by drastically reducing the search space from $N$ to a filtered candidate set ($N_{candidates}$) and finally to $N_{filtered}$, thereby avoiding the linear processing required by static methods. Additionally, empirical testing demonstrated that the focused context provided by dynamic workspaces yields enhanced retrieval quality and improved downstream model accuracy compared to standard pipelines.
>
> SPAR represents a significant advancement in the practical deployment of RAG technologies within enterprise settings constrained by legacy systems. By shifting from static, global vectorization to dynamic, session-specific retrieval, the framework provides greater transparency and controllability over the data retrieval process. This work not only provides a rigorous theoretical complexity analysis to support efficiency claims but also outlines critical design trade-offs and open challenges for future implementation. Ultimately, SPAR enables organizations to unlock the value of historical unstructured data without requiring a complete overhaul of their underlying file system architecture.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

**Core Architecture**
*   **System:** Session-based Pipeline for Adaptive Retrieval (SPAR).
*   **Structure:** A dynamic two-phase system that replaces static global vector databases with a Metadata Index for coarse filtering and Session-based Workspaces for fine-grained retrieval.

**Workflow**
1.  **Ingestion:** Metadata and tags are ingested into a Metadata Index.
2.  **Query Trigger:** User queries trigger specific sessions.
3.  **Filtering:** Files are filtered based on the query.
4.  **Construction:** Temporary vector databases (Workspaces) are constructed for similarity search.

**Metadata Index**
*   **Type:** Relational database.
*   **Schema:** Comprises `Files` and `Tags` tables.
*   **Features:** Supports hierarchical tag structures and allows for manual or automated mapping.

**Session-based Retrieval**
*   **Scope:** Defines semantically scoped, time-bounded workspaces.
*   **Function:** Constructs lightweight, task-specific vector databases on-demand.
*   **Optimization:** Features caching and reuse of embeddings; specifically utilizes functions like `buildUpdateDtb()`.

## 📈 Results

**Theoretical Metrics**
The study defines specific variables to measure performance:
*   $N$: Total files
*   $M$: Total tags
*   $T_{proc}$: Average processing time
*   $N_{candidates}$: Files remaining after coarse filtering
*   $N_{filtered}$: Files included in the final workspace

**Performance Outcomes**
*   **Efficiency:** SPAR minimizes processing time ($T_{proc}$) relative to tags ($M$) by reducing the search scope from total files ($N$) to a filtered candidate set ($N_{candidates}$).
*   **Accuracy:** Empirical tests confirm that the focused context of dynamic workspaces improves retrieval quality over standard pipelines.
*   **Resource Management:** Successfully avoids the linear processing requirements typically associated with static indexing methods.
