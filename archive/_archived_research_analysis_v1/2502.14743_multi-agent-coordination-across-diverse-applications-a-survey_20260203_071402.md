> ## 📝 Executive Summary
>
> The field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has expanded rapidly to encompass diverse domains such as humanoid robotics, satellite constellations, and Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this expansion has created a fragmented landscape where achieving effective coordination remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of managing decentralized decision-making.
>
> The primary obstacles preventing widespread adoption and efficiency include **scalability** within exponential state and action spaces, the **heterogeneity** of agents, and the need for **robust learning mechanisms** in dynamic environments. Without a unified theoretical foundation, it is difficult to compare approaches or transfer solutions across these vastly different application areas.
>
> To unify this fragmented field, the authors introduce a conceptual framework anchored in four fundamental questions: **what, why, who, and how** to coordinate. Technically, the paper models coordination as an iterative sequential decision-making process involving three stages: evaluating system-level performance, social choice (clustering agents based on dependency graphs), and determining interaction mechanisms.
>
> The analysis reveals that **coordinated learning** demonstrates superior learning efficiency compared to independent learning by effectively solving non-stationarity problems. Furthermore, the review highlights that **event-triggered communication** provides improved efficiency, flexibility, and scalability over time-triggered methods, though often with a trade-off in raw coordination performance.
>
> This work significantly influences the field by providing a cohesive structure that bridges the gap between traditional industrial applications and cutting-edge frontiers like LLM-based agents. By systematically categorizing existing literature and identifying bottlenecks, the authors provide a strategic roadmap for future research, directing the community toward hybrid coordination architectures, human-in-the-loop systems, and the deep integration of LLMs.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Unified Framework:** Coordination research can be structured by answering *what*, *why*, *who*, and *how*.
*   **Spectrum of Applications:** MAS applications have evolved to include humanoid robots, satellite systems, and LLMs.
*   **Core Technical Challenges:** Primary challenges include scalability, heterogeneity, and robust learning mechanisms.
*   **Future Trajectories:** Promising directions include hybrid coordination, human-MAS coordination, and LLM integration.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The authors employ a structured survey methodology anchored in a conceptual framework of four coordination questions. The analysis involves three distinct phases:

1.  **Identification:** Defining general coordination problems.
2.  **Survey:** Reviewing specific MAS implementations across diverse domains.
3.  **Synthesis:** Aggregating open challenges and defining future research directions.

## 📚 Contributions

*   **Unified Conceptualization:** Provides a cohesive framework to deconstruct the multi-agent coordination landscape.
*   **Comprehensive Domain Mapping:** Bridges the gap between industrial applications and cutting-edge frontiers like LLMs.
*   **Strategic Roadmap:** Offers analysis of bottlenecks and defines future research avenues such as hybrid architectures and LLM-based agents.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The paper proposes a unified framework for multi-agent coordination structured around the questions **"Who to coordinate with"** and **"How to coordinate."**

### Coordination Model
*   **Process:** Modeled as an iterative sequential decision-making process involving:
    1.  Evaluating system-level performance.
    2.  Social choice (clustering agents based on dependencies).
    3.  Determining interaction mechanisms.
*   **Representation:** The MAS is represented as a **Coordination Graph** with agents as nodes ($V$) and dependencies as edges ($E$).

### Architectural Paradigms
*   **CTDE:** Utilizes Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution.
*   **Credit Assignment:** Implements architectures like **MADDPG** and **COMA** using a centralized critic function.
*   **Communication Protocols:** Details learned protocols such as **DIAL** and **BiCNet**, including higher-order interactions.

### Communication Architecture
*   **Topology Modeling:** Defined as $G=(V, E)$.
*   **Topology Control:** Can be static or dynamic.
*   **Triggering Mechanisms:**
    *   Time-triggered
    *   Event-triggered
    *   Learning-based
*   **Content Encoding:** Direct or stigmergy-based.

## 📈 Results

As a survey paper, results are aggregated findings from literature:

*   **Bibliometric Analysis:** MAS research spans **148 of 252** Web of Science areas. Top domains are Computer Science, Mathematics, and Engineering. An accelerating trend is observed driven by LLMs and autonomous driving.
*   **Learning Efficiency:** Coordinated learning demonstrates superior efficiency compared to independent learning by solving non-stationarity problems.
*   **Communication Efficiency:** Event-triggered communication shows improved efficiency, flexibility, and scalability over time-triggered methods, though with a potential trade-off in coordination performance.
*   **Scalability Factors:** Sparse communication and learned protocols are identified as critical for scalability.
*   **Key Challenges:** Managing exponential state/action spaces, heterogeneity among agents, and robustness in dynamic environments.
