## Executive Summary

The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into enterprise systems has outpaced current security research, creating a dangerous gap between theoretical model vulnerabilities and practical operational risks. While existing literature frequently addresses isolated model weaknesses, such as adversarial noise, it fails to capture the holistic threat landscape of real-world deployments where LLMs interact with external data sources, supply chains, and complex infrastructure.

To bridge this gap, the authors introduce the **"LLM in the Middle"** architectural model, a framework that conceptualizes the LLM as a central intermediary. This model classifies threats across two axes: the **Nature of Work** (DevOps vs. LLMOps) and the **Timeline** (Development vs. Operation). The structure maps the system lifecycle into five distinct phases and categorizes use cases strictly into Development (Foundation Model, Fine-Tuning, RAG) and Operation (Chat-bot, Integrated App, Agent). Furthermore, the authors define seven specific design dimensions for granular analysis (Data Provenance, Infrastructure, SW Libraries, Shared Infrastructure, Prompt Input Origin, Access to Resources, and Continuous Learning).

The study employed a rigorous Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology following PRISMA guidelines to synthesize findings from **198 papers**. A coverage analysis of existing surveys identified critical gaps, specifically noting a lack of focus on supply-chain security (e.g., compromised pre-trained models) and holistic attack/defense mapping. This research provides substantial value by offering a unified taxonomy that structures the chaotic domain of LLM security, equipping architects with a guide to identify and mitigate risks in probabilistic systems.

## Key Findings

*   **Missing Abstract Content**: The input data provided for analysis lacked the full abstract text; findings were derived from the methodology, results, and executive summary sections.
*   **Holistic Gap Identified**: Current research focuses too heavily on isolated model weaknesses (e.g., adversarial noise) and neglects systemic risks across the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
*   **Prevalence of Specific Risks**: The review identified frequent risks during Data Engineering (poisoning, backdoors) and Operation (prompt injection via indirect prompts, jailbreaking).
*   **Privacy Threats**: Key privacy concerns include training data extraction and model stealing.
*   **Supply Chain Vulnerability**: There is a significant deficiency in existing research regarding supply-chain integrity, particularly concerning compromised pre-trained models.

## Methodology

The research employs a **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** methodology strictly adhering to **PRISMA guidelines**.

*   **Data Sources**: ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and arXiv.
*   **Snowballing**: Used to ensure inclusion of relevant papers missed in initial searches.
*   **Proposed Framework**: The "LLM in the Middle" model classifies threats along two axes:
    1.  **Nature of Work**: DevOps vs. LLMOps.
    2.  **Timeline**: Development vs. Operation.

## Technical Details

### System Lifecycle Phases
The proposed architecture divides the lifecycle into five key phases:
1.  Planning System Development
2.  Data Engineering
3.  LLM Development
4.  System Development
5.  LLM Integration & Operation

### Use Case Classifications
*   **Development**: Foundation Model, Fine-Tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
*   **Operation**: Chat-bot, Integrated App, Agent.

### Design Dimensions
To facilitate granular analysis, systems are defined by seven design dimensions:
1.  **Data Provenance**
2.  **Infrastructure**
3.  **SW Libraries**
4.  **Shared Infrastructure**
5.  **Prompt Input Origin**
6.  **Access to Resources**
7.  **Continuous Learning**

## Results

The selection process yielded a final dataset of 198 papers through a rigorous filtration process:

*   **Initial References**: 2,217
*   **Duplicates Removed**: 214
*   **Excluded by Title**: 1,487
*   **Excluded by Abstract**: 80
*   **Full-text Assessed**: 436
*   **Exclusions**:
    *   Lack of substance: 106
    *   Tangential relevance: 93
    *   Classified as surveys: 81 *(Used for coverage analysis)*
    *   Specific studies: 156
*   **Snowballing Added**: 42 papers
*   **Final Dataset**: 198 papers

**Coverage Analysis Highlights:**
*   Significant gaps found in lifecycle coverage, supply-chain security, and holistic attack/defense mapping.
*   Market data indicates nearly **80%** of UK business leaders have deployed or plan to deploy LLMs, underscoring the urgency of these security gaps.
