## Executive Summary

Current evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, are insufficient for assessing the nuanced requirements of enterprise environments. This paper addresses the critical disconnect between general-purpose AI benchmarks and the specific cognitive complexities inherent in business tasks. The authors highlight that while general benchmarks provide a baseline, they fail to capture the judgment-based and contextual demands of enterprise applications, leaving a significant gap in understanding how these models perform in real-world business scenarios.

The researchers introduce the "Enterprise Large Language Model Evaluation Benchmark," a specialized evaluation framework grounded in Bloom’s Taxonomy to cover six cognitive levels across 14 distinct tasks. The key technical innovation is a scalable, cost-effective data pipeline designed to minimize manual annotation and ensure data quality. This architecture integrates three components: "LLM-as-a-Labeler" for automated labeling, "Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CRAG)" to handle data noise, and "LLM-as-a-Judge" for evaluation. Using this pipeline, the team curated a robust dataset of 9,700 samples to rigorously stress-test LLMs specifically for enterprise use.

The evaluation of models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 revealed distinct performance trade-offs between reasoning and judgment capabilities. DeepSeek-R1 outperformed GPT-4o in reasoning tasks, scoring higher in Software Engineering and General QA, while also achieving a lower hallucination rate and superior coherence. However, GPT-4o excelled in judgment-based tasks, achieving a higher Spearman’s r, and dominated in classification and generation tasks like Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition, and Code Generation.

This study provides a strategic blueprint for enterprises to move beyond generic benchmarks and adopt tailored evaluations that align with specific business needs. By identifying that open-source models like DeepSeek-R1 can rival proprietary models in reasoning but lag in judgment—potentially due to "overthinking"—the paper offers actionable insights for model selection and optimization.
