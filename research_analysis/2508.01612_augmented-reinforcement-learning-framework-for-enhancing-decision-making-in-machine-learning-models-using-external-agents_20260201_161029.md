## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" (GIGO) problem inherent in standard Reinforcement Learning (RL), where poor data quality severely degrades model performance and decision-making capabilities. In complex, high-stakes operational environments like the banking sector, the inability of autonomous models to handle ambiguous or noisy inputs can lead to significant operational errors. The research prioritizes this issue because existing RL paradigms typically lack mechanisms to dynamically validate the quality of inputs and actions during the learning process, resulting in brittle models that fail to meet the accuracy requirements of real-world applications.

The key innovation is an Augmented Reinforcement Learning (ARL) framework that introduces a dual-agent Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) architecture to integrate human oversight directly into the decision cycle. Technically, the system utilizes two distinct external agents: the **Real-time Evaluator** (Agent 1) and the **Selective Curator** (Agent 2). Agent 1 functions as a pre-processor during model operation, providing immediate feedback and routing suboptimal actions to a "Rejected Data Pipeline." Agent 2 processes this intercepted data, curating it based on business relevance to create a clean, approved dataset. This separation ensures real-time quality control and guarantees that only vetted, high-quality data is recycled into future training iterations.

The framework was validated through a Document Identification and Information Extraction task within the banking sector, tested on a dataset of 10,000 synthetic Indian region documents. Quantitative results demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline approaches: the ARL model achieved a final accuracy of **96.4%**, compared to **82.1%** for the standard RL model. Furthermore, the integration of the dual-agent architecture reduced the error rate in handling ambiguous document scenarios by **78%** and decreased data processing latency by filtering out **15%** of low-quality inputs prior to full processing. These metrics confirm that the system significantly enhances model robustness and precision in complex scenarios.

This research establishes the practical viability of integrating human intuition into automated machine learning pipelines at scale. By successfully mitigating the GIGO problem through a structured feedback loop, the ARL framework sets a new standard for training models in data-driven environments.
