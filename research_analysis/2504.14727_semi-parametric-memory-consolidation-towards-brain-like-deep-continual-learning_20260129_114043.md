## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical challenge of **catastrophic forgetting** in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) within Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) scenarios. In CIL, models learn new classes sequentially but typically suffer significant performance degradation on previous tasks, a phenomenon known as the stability-plasticity dilemma. This issue is particularly acute in large-scale, real-world environments like ImageNet, where the volume of data makes retaining prior knowledge while acquiring novel skills technically difficult.

The authors propose **Semi-parametric Memory Consolidation (SMC)**, a biomimetic framework inspired by the human hippocampus-neocortex system. The system utilizes a standard parametric DNN for feature representation coupled with a **non-parametric memory bank** that stores raw data or features from previous tasks **without storing their corresponding labels**.

The architecture functions through a biologically plausible **Wake-sleep mechanism**:
*   **Wake Phase:** The model learns new tasks via supervised loss while consolidating past knowledge using semi-supervised consistency loss. Pseudo-labels are generated using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) retrieval.
*   **Sleep Phase:** The model performs offline consolidation by treating the memory bank as unlabeled data to refine parametric features, stabilizing decision boundaries without ground-truth labels.

Validated on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, SMC achieved a final average accuracy of **75.8%** on ImageNet-100 (outperforming DER++ at 69.6%) and **66.4%** on the large-scale ImageNet-Full setting (surpassing DER++'s 53.1%). This work establishes a new paradigm for brain-like deep learning systems capable of sustained, cumulative learning.

## Key Findings

*   **Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting:** The proposed framework enables DNNs to achieve high performance on novel tasks while effectively maintaining prior knowledge.
*   **Real-World Robustness:** The method demonstrates robustness in challenging scenarios, specifically validated through class-incremental learning on the ImageNet dataset.
*   **Biological Validation:** The study validates the hypothesis that emulating biological intelligence mechanisms (hippocampus-neocortex) provides a viable pathway for advanced continual learning in artificial systems.

## Methodology

The researchers developed a biomimetic continual learning framework inspired by the interactive human memory and learning system. This approach integrates two key biological concepts:

1.  **Semi-parametric Memory:** Designed to handle the efficient storage and retrieval of information without retaining raw labels for all historical data.
2.  **Wake-sleep Consolidation:** A mechanism to stabilize and integrate learned knowledge over time, mimicking the biological process of memory consolidation during sleep.

## Technical Details

The proposed framework, **Semi-parametric Memory Consolidation (SMC)**, utilizes a hybrid architecture detailed below:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | A hybrid system consisting of a **standard DNN (parametric)** component for general representation learning and a **non-parametric memory bank** that stores raw data or embeddings. |
| **Biological Analogy** | Modeled after the **'Hippocampus-Neocortex'** system. |
| **Learning Paradigm** | Treats continual learning as a **Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)** problem. |
| **Loss Functions** | Novel tasks are learned via **supervised loss**, while prior knowledge is consolidated via **semi-supervised consistency loss** (e.g., FixMatch) applied to stored memory. |
| **Pseudo-Labeling** | Employs a strategy derived from **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** retrieval within the non-parametric memory to prevent catastrophic forgetting without requiring true labels for past data. |
