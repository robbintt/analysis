## Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the critical challenge of optimizing the training efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) by understanding how different compression techniques fundamentally impact pretraining dynamics. While scaling laws traditionally describe the relationship between parameter count, data, and compute for dense models, there is a lack of a unified theoretical framework to evaluate how aggressive compression—specifically sparsity and quantization—affects these laws. This matters because as model size grows, the computational and memory costs of pretraining become prohibitive; without a principled way to compare compression methods during the training phase, researchers may invest resources in techniques that offer suboptimal trade-offs between model size, speed, and final performance.

**Innovation**
The key innovation is the unification of sparsity and quantization under a single scaling law framework through the concept of "effective parameters." The authors extend established theoretical foundations for sparsity to empirically demonstrate that quantization also adheres to predictable scaling behavior. Technically, the approach builds upon the BitNet methodology, employing vanilla Straight-Through Estimator (STE) for training where forward passes utilize quantized weights. The study analyzes both Weight-Only quantization and Full Quantization (weights and activations for non-embedding layers), computing scales dynamically from weight statistics rather than treating them as learned parameters. This methodology allows for a principled, apples-to-apples comparison of diverse compression techniques based on their parameter efficiency multipliers.

**Results**
The study yields several significant empirical findings regarding the efficiency boundaries of model compression. For Weight-Only quantization, 4-bit precision was found to be relatively lossless, while reducing to 1-bit yielded approximately a 2x improvement in parameter efficiency. In contrast, Full Quantization exhibited diminishing returns at lower bitwidths; while stable training was achieved using STE, bit-widths lower than 4-bit were not Pareto optimal under linear speedup assumptions (representing realistic hardware constraints). However, under quadratic speedup assumptions (theoretical idealization), 2-bit quantization showed noticeable improvement. Although 1-bit Full Quantization remained stable during training, it was determined to be far from optimal. The authors also confirmed that scaling law fits remain reasonable for models utilizing more than 1-bit per parameter.

**Impact**
This work significantly influences the field by providing a robust theoretical lens through which to view model compression, shifting the focus from isolated optimization tricks to systemic scaling behavior. By validating that compression techniques follow unified scaling laws, the paper enables researchers to predict the performance impact of quantization and sparsity before committing to expensive pretraining runs. The findings offer practical guidance for future LLM development: they validate the efficiency of weight-only 4-bit quantization and caution against full quantization below 4-bit in realistic hardware scenarios, thereby helping to streamline the design of more efficient and scalable foundation models.
