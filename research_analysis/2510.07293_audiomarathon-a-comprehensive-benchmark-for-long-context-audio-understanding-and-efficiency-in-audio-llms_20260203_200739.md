## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have seen rapid advancements, yet they face critical limitations when processing long-form audio, a requirement for real-world applications like meeting analysis and media monitoring. Current architectures suffer from significant performance degradation as audio duration increases, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms and an inability to effectively model long-range temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the field lacks a standardized, realistic benchmark to evaluate these specific long-context capabilities, leaving a gap in understanding how these models perform on complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks over extended periods.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce **AudioMarathon**, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context audio understanding and efficiency. Constructed through a rigorous six-stage pipeline, the benchmark comprises 6,567 instances featuring audio inputs ranging from 90 to 300 seconds across diverse domains (speech, sound, and music). It covers 10 distinct tasks categorized into Speech Context Understanding, Audio Scene Understanding, and Voice Characteristic Identification. A key technical aspect of the innovation is the dual evaluation framework, which simultaneously assesses a model's semantic understanding capabilities against its inference efficiency, specifically analyzing the impact of acceleration techniques such as token pruning and KV cache eviction.

**Results**
Experimental evaluation of state-of-the-art LALMs on AudioMarathon reveals substantial performance drops as audio context length increases, particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning. The dataset is dominated by Speaker Gender Recognition (25%) and Audio Scene Classifier (17%), providing a robust testbed for classification and identification. The analysis highlights that while acceleration techniques can reduce the computational bottleneck associated with long sequences, they introduce significant trade-offs, often resulting in a loss of accuracy. Specifically, current models struggle to maintain coherence and accuracy in multi-hop inference scenarios within long audio contexts, exposing a significant capability gap in existing architectures.

**Impact**
AudioMarathon establishes a critical standardization for the audio LLM community, providing empirical evidence that current models require fundamental improvements in memory efficiency and temporal modeling. By identifying specific failure modes regarding long-range dependencies and the efficiency-accuracy trade-off, this research provides a targeted direction for future architectural advancements. The release of this benchmark serves as a vital resource for researchers, enabling the systematic evaluation of next-generation models and accelerating the development of audio LLMs capable of handling real-world, long-duration inputs.
