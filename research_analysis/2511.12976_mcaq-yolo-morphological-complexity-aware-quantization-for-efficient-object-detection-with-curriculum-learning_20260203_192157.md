## Executive Summary

Deploying real-time object detection models on resource-constrained edge devices requires aggressive model compression. Traditional uniform quantization methods often lead to significant accuracy degradation at low bit-widths (e.g., 4-bit), while existing mixed-precision approaches suffer from optimization instability and fail to account for spatial variance within feature maps.

**MCAQ-YOLO** addresses these challenges by introducing a framework that utilizes **tile-wise spatial mixed-precision quantization**. By dynamically allocating computational resources based on image region complexity, the system preserves accuracy where it matters most. The approach employs a novel multi-metric morphological complexity predictor and a 3-stage curriculum learning regimen to stabilize training.

The results demonstrate that spatial morphological complexity is a robust proxy for quantization sensitivity. MCAQ-YOLO achieves a substantial compression ratio (7.63x) and real-time speeds (151 FPS) while outperforming uniform baselines by 3.5 percentage points in mAP. This sets a new benchmark for the trade-off between compression, speed, and accuracy in edge computer vision.

## Methodology

The proposed framework operates on three core pillars to ensure efficient and accurate quantization:

*   **Tile-wise Spatial Mixed-Precision Quantization:**
    *   Divides feature maps into an 8x8 grid.
    *   Allocates bits dynamically (2–8 bits) based on the complexity of specific image regions rather than applying uniform layer-wise quantization.
*   **Morphological Complexity Assessment:**
    *   Utilizes five distinct metrics to determine spatial quantization sensitivity: Fractal Dimension, Texture Entropy, Gradient Variance, Edge Density, and Contour Complexity.
    *   Spatial bit allocation is determined during a calibration phase to ensure minimal impact on inference.
*   **Curriculum-Based Training:**
    *   Employs a progressive training scheme that gradually increases quantization difficulty.
    *   This approach stabilizes the optimization process and accelerates convergence compared to standard training methods.
