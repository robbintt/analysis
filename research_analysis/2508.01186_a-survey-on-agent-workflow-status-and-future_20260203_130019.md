## 📝 Executive Summary

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the creation of autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks. However, this capability introduces significant challenges regarding system complexity, scalability, and security. As these agents evolve from simple chatbots to sophisticated autonomous systems, the lack of structured frameworks for managing their operations leads to inefficiencies and potential safety risks. This paper addresses the critical need for "**agent workflows**"—structured frameworks designed to orchestrate LLM-based agents—to ensure these systems can operate reliably and securely in diverse environments.

The key innovation of this work is the introduction of a holistic, two-dimensional taxonomic framework for classifying agent workflow systems. Unlike previous ad-hoc reviews, this methodology systematically categorizes over 20 representative systems from both academia and industry. The taxonomy evaluates systems based on two distinct vectors: **functional capabilities** (what the agent does) and **architectural features** (how the agent is structured). This technical approach allows for a rigorous comparative analysis, isolating common design patterns and providing a standardized vocabulary for describing the orchestration of autonomous agents.

Through a comprehensive analysis of more than 20 distinct LLM-based autonomous agent systems, the authors successfully mapped the current landscape of agent workflows. The survey identified specific design patterns that are currently dominating the field while simultaneously highlighting critical deficiencies. The results pinpoint workflow optimization and security as the two most pressing challenges facing current implementations. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that significant research gaps remain in the areas of standardization and the integration of multimodal capabilities, indicating where current systems fall short of full autonomy.

This survey bridges the gap between theoretical research and industrial application, serving as a foundational resource for researchers and engineers building the next generation of AI agents. By establishing a clear taxonomy and identifying critical bottlenecks, the paper provides a necessary roadmap for future development. Its significance lies in steering the community toward prioritizing standardization and safe automation, which are essential for moving agent workflows from experimental prototypes to production-grade, secure, and scalable systems.
