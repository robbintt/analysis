## 📝 Executive Summary

### **Problem**
Existing Multi-Task Learning (MTL) systems suffer significantly from **negative transfer**, where simultaneous training degrades performance compared to single-task learning. Current solutions predominantly rely on Multi-Task Optimization (MTO) techniques that manipulate loss gradients or scales at the optimizer level. However, these optimizer-centric approaches frequently fail to deliver consistent performance gains and often require computationally expensive, complex tuning. A fundamental limitation is that these methods neglect the rich, latent information within the shared representation space, missing opportunities to facilitate true inter-task complementarity.

### **Innovation**
The paper introduces **Rep-MTL**, a novel framework that shifts the focus of conflict resolution from the optimization space to the representation space. Instead of balancing gradients post-hoc, Rep-MTL employs a **Task Saliency Decoder (TSD)** to generate task-specific attention masks. These masks filter shared features via element-wise multiplication during the forward pass, effectively creating customized, decoupled sub-networks for each task. The method optimizes these interactions using entropy-based penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment. A key outcome is that it enables the use of a simple equal-weighting loss policy, eliminating the need for complex gradient manipulation.

### **Results**
Rep-MTL demonstrates superior performance across four rigorous benchmarks, including **NYU Depth v2**, **PASCAL Context**, **GTA5**, and **Cityscapes**. It outperformed prominent baselines such as Uncertainty Weighting, GradNorm, and NASH-MTL. These accuracy gains were achieved with minimal computational overhead (an additional cost of only **0.06 GFLOPs**). Furthermore, theoretical Power Law exponent analysis confirms that Rep-MTL effectively optimizes the trade-off between task-specific learning and cross-task knowledge sharing.

### **Impact**
This research represents a theoretical pivot in MTL, arguing that representation-level management is a more effective lever for handling task interferences than gradient-based optimization. By proving that robust performance can be achieved using a basic equal-weighting strategy once representation conflicts are mitigated, the authors challenge the prevailing reliance on intricate gradient balancing algorithms. Rep-MTL offers a more efficient and stable pathway to scaling multi-task models.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The proposed approach, Rep-MTL, shifts optimization focus from the loss/gradient level to the representation level. It operates by exploiting **representation-level task saliency** to measure interactions between task-specific optimization and shared representation learning.

The framework controls these interactions using two primary mechanisms:

1.  **Entropy-based Penalization:** Used to maintain effective individual task training.
2.  **Sample-wise Cross-Task Alignment:** Used to promote complementary information sharing.

The overarching objective is to mitigate negative transfer while actively promoting complementarity.
