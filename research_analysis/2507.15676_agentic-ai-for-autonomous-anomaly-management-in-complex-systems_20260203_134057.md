## Executive Summary

> Complex system architectures face critical scalability challenges in anomaly management due to an over-reliance on manual, human-centric workflows. As system complexity increases, traditional monitoring solutions fail to provide the low latency and rapid response times required for operational continuity. The fundamental issue is that current infrastructure cannot support fully autonomous environments because it depends on constant human intervention to both detect and resolve faults, creating a bottleneck that limits system resilience.
>
> The paper proposes a framework utilizing **"Agentic AI"** to achieve full-cycle autonomy in system management. Technically, this architecture moves beyond passive monitoring by deploying intelligent agents capable of executing the entire operational lifecycle. Unlike traditional tools that merely flag anomalies for human review, this mechanism empowers AI agents to autonomously perform both the detection of faults and the execution of necessary remediation actions. This approach closes the loop between observation and resolution, allowing the system to self-correct without external input.
>
> Because the study is exploratory, it presents qualitative findings rather than quantitative benchmarks. The paper does not provide experimental metrics such as latency reduction percentages or accuracy rates. Instead, the primary result is the theoretical validation of the Agentic AI framework. The authors establish the conceptual viability of using autonomous agents to manage the full spectrum of anomaly handling, demonstrating that the architecture possesses the inherent capability to identify and react to system faults more efficiently than human-dependent processes.
>
> This work is significant because it formally defines the architectural shift from manual oversight to AI-driven autonomy. By conceptualizing Agentic AI as the driver for self-healing infrastructures, the paper provides a blueprint for future implementations that drastically reduce the reliance on human operators. This transition enables the development of more scalable and resilient complex systems, establishing a foundation for research into fully autonomous maintenance environments where stability is maintained through intelligent, closed-loop agent interactions.
