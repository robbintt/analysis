## Executive Summary

Identifying customer needs from unstructured data—such as online reviews, support forums, and social media—is a critical input for product innovation and market strategy but remains a resource-intensive bottleneck. Traditional methods rely heavily on trained professional analysts to manually parse text, a process that is slow, expensive, and difficult to scale. Furthermore, human analysis is susceptible to subjectivity and fatigue, leading to inconsistent results and potentially missed insights. This paper addresses the challenge of whether automation can reliably replicate this high-level cognitive task, specifically determining if Large Language Models (LLMs) can match the depth, accuracy, and nuance of human experts in extracting "Voice of the Customer" data.

The key innovation lies in the rigorous application of prompt engineering and structured workflows to convert LLMs into capable market research assistants. Rather than using the models as simple text generators, the authors developed a methodology that guides the LLM through a two-phase process:

1.  **Extraction:** Pulling granular customer needs from raw text.
2.  **Abstraction:** Converting specific needs into higher-level hierarchical categories.

Technically, the study compares the performance of GPT-3.5/4 against a "gold standard" baseline established by professional analysts. The researchers utilized specific prompting strategies (such as chain-of-thought prompting) to minimize hallucinations and force the model to adhere to the strict definitions of "needs" versus "solutions" or "features."

This research is highly significant as it provides empirical evidence that AI can disrupt the market research industry by democratizing access to high-quality customer insight. It shifts the perception of LLMs from novelty chatbots to viable analytical tools for qualitative business intelligence.

## Key Findings

The analysis of the research highlights several critical breakthroughs in the application of Generative AI for market research:

*   **Parity with Human Experts:** LLMs can perform at a level comparable to, and in some metrics exceeding, that of professional analysts.
*   **Novel Insights:** Beyond matching human performance, the models generated unique, valid needs that human analysts missed.
*   **Granularity:** LLMs excelled at drilling down into specific customer requirements that humans often glossed over due to time constraints or oversight.
*   **Democratization:** The study suggests a shift from periodic, expensive market studies to agile, continuous, real-time listen-and-learn loops.

## Contributions

*   **Methodological Framework:** Established a rigorous two-phase workflow for converting LLMs into market research assistants.
*   **Prompt Engineering Strategies:** Demonstrated the efficacy of chain-of-thought prompting in minimizing hallucinations and maintaining distinction between needs and features.
*   **Affiliation Validation:** Confirmed research contributions from **MIT** and the **Kellogg School of Management**.

## Methodology

The research employed a comparative experimental design to evaluate the efficacy of Large Language Models against traditional manual analysis.

*   **Baseline Establishment:** A "gold standard" was created using data processed by professional human analysts.
*   **Model Selection:** The study utilized GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as the primary test subjects.
*   **Two-Phase Process:**
    1.  **Phase 1:** Guided extraction of granular customer needs from raw unstructured text.
    2.  **Phase 2:** Abstraction of these granular needs into hierarchical categories for strategic analysis.
*   **Control Measures:** Implementation of strict prompting definitions to prevent the model from confusing "needs" with "solutions" or "features."
