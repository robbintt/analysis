## 📝 Executive Summary

The proliferation of memes as a communication medium has introduced a new challenge in the domain of mental health analysis. While traditionally associated with humor, memes have evolved into a prevalent vehicle for users to express complex depressive sentiments and distress. Detecting these signals is difficult because meaning is derived from the nuanced, multimodal interplay between text and imagery, rather than explicit statements. Existing computational methods struggle to accurately identify specific depressive symptoms within this non-traditional format, limiting the effectiveness of automated mental health monitoring on social platforms.

To address this, the authors propose **MAMAMemeia**, a novel framework that shifts from standard contrastive learning to a collaborative, Multi-Aspect Multi-Agent discussion system grounded in Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) Competencies. Technically, the framework employs multiple agents that simulate a clinical discussion to analyze memes, allowing for a more holistic interpretation of multimodal content. This approach is supported by the introduction of **RESTOREx**, a new dataset resource that combines the scalability of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the precision of human annotation. The system is designed for multi-label classification, targeting seven specific depressive symptoms derived from the PHQ-9 scale, including high-risk indicators such as self-harm and low self-esteem.

The MAMAMemeia framework demonstrably outperforms existing solutions, securing a new state-of-the-art benchmark by surpassing over 30 prior methods. The model achieved a substantial improvement in performance, recording a **7.55% increase in macro-F1 score** compared to the best current methods. These results were validated using the RESTOREx dataset, which comprises 7,096 training samples after a rigorous data curation process that involved filtering non-meme images and refining labels to address class imbalance.

This research signifies a paradigm shift in multimodal mental health detection by validating the efficacy of embedding clinical psychological frameworks directly into AI architectures. The success of the CAT-grounded multi-agent approach suggests that future AI systems can benefit significantly from structure-based clinical reasoning when analyzing unstructured social media data. Furthermore, the release of the RESTOREx dataset provides the research community with a high-quality, clinically relevant resource, facilitating more robust development of systems capable of identifying mental health crises in emerging digital communication formats.
