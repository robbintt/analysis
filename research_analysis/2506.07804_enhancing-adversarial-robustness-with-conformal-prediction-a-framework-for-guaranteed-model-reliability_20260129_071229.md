## Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the critical vulnerability of Conformal Prediction (CP) frameworks to adversarial attacks that specifically target model uncertainty rather than classification accuracy alone. In safety-critical applications, models must provide reliable uncertainty quantification; however, standard adversarial attacks often focus solely on causing misclassification, neglecting the degradation of prediction set efficiency. The authors highlight a gap where existing defenses do not adequately protect against attacks designed to manipulate the confidence mechanism of CP, thereby threatening the validity and utility of uncertainty guarantees in high-stakes environments.

**Innovation**
The paper introduces a dual-framework approach centered on the Hard Quantile Framework. The first component is OPSA (Optimized Prediction Set Attack), a novel attack strategy that diverges from traditional methods by optimizing for maximal model uncertainty to reduce prediction efficiency. OPSA utilizes a parameter $T_1$ (scaled logarithmically from 0.001 to 1000) to manipulate prediction set sizes without requiring fulfillment of coverage guarantees. The second innovation is **OPSA-AT**, a corresponding adversarial training defense strategy. By integrating OPSA-generated examples directly into the training loop, OPSA-AT teaches models to resist high-uncertainty adversarial examples while simultaneously preserving the validity guarantees inherent to conformal prediction.

**Results**
Experimental validation demonstrates a clear correlation between the attack intensity parameter $T_1$ and prediction set size, indicating OPSA’s effectiveness in inducing uncertainty. Specifically, prediction set size increased from $22.06 \pm 0.20$ at $T_1=0.001$ to $33.30 \pm 0.27$ at $T_1=1$, plateauing near $33.50$ for $T_1 \geq 10$. Despite this induced uncertainty, the OPSA-AT defense maintained robust statistical validity, with coverage rates remaining stable near the target threshold of 90% (ranging from $89.62\%$ to $89.95\%$, with a standard deviation of $\pm0.33$ to $\pm0.35$). The SSCV metric remained consistently low at $0.03 \pm 0.01$.

**Impact**
This work significantly advances the field by bridging the gap between raw accuracy and guaranteed assurance in adversarial machine learning. By demonstrating that defending against uncertainty-maximizing attacks enhances general robustness without sacrificing valid uncertainty estimates, the authors provide a viable pathway for deploying machine learning in safety-critical contexts such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics. The OPSA-AT framework establishes a new paradigm for conformal training, ensuring that models can maintain reliable performance guarantees even when facing sophisticated adversarial perturbations.
