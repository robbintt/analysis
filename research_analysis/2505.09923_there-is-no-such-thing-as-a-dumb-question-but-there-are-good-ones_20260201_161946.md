## Executive Summary

Current natural language processing systems lack a standardized, systematic framework for evaluating the quality of user inquiries. While significant progress has been made in automatic question answering, the ability to assess the *quality* of a question remains a challenge due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of human communication. The absence of a robust metric prevents AI systems from effectively distinguishing between beneficial queries and those that are vague, off-topic, or socially inappropriate, limiting the reliability of conversational agents and educational tools.

To address this, the authors propose a dual-dimensional, competence-based framework that departs from static grammatical rules. The system evaluates questions based on **"Appropriateness"** and **"Effectiveness."** Appropriateness utilizes sociolinguistic competence to analyze social norms, politeness, and context, while Effectiveness employs strategic competence to assess the utility of the inquiry and its likely outcome. The architecture integrates dynamic contextual variables, creating a semi-adaptive system that processes questions based on evolving conversation histories rather than relying solely on fixed structural scoring.

The framework was empirically validated using the CAUS and SQUARE datasets, demonstrating the capability to classify both well-formed questions and problematic inquiries, including those that are vague or poorly structured. The study confirms the system's effectiveness in handling the complexities of automatic question evaluation and managing nuanced discourse features. Standard quantitative performance metrics—such as F1-scores, accuracy, or precision—are not reported in the paper. The authors rely on qualitative validation and capability demonstration rather than statistical benchmarking against baseline models.

This research provides a theoretical foundation for quantifying qualitative questioning by grounding computational evaluation in established linguistic competencies. By defining a systematic method to assess question quality, the work bridges the gap between human/AI interaction patterns and rigorous structured analysis.

## Key Findings

*   **Dual-Dimensional Definition:** The study redefines "good questions" through two primary lenses: **Appropriateness** (sociolinguistic competence) and **Effectiveness** (strategic competence).
*   **Adaptability:** The framework incorporates dynamic contextual variables, allowing the evaluation criteria to adapt to the evolving context of a conversation.
*   **Broad Spectrum Evaluation:** Successfully validated on the CAUS and SQUARE datasets, demonstrating the capability to evaluate both well-formed questions and problematic ones (e.g., vague, off-topic, or poorly structured).
*   **Complexity Management:** Empirical tests confirmed the framework's effectiveness in handling the complexities inherent in automatic question evaluation.

## Methodology

The research utilizes a rubric-based scoring system designed to balance structural rigidity with conversational flexibility.

*   **Dual-Competence Rubric:** Scoring is based on the defined dimensions of appropriateness and effectiveness.
*   **Dynamic Integration:** The methodology integrates dynamic contextual variables to create semi-adaptive criteria. This allows the system to process questions based on conversation history rather than static rules.
*   **Validation Strategy:** The framework was empirically tested against established datasets (CAUS and SQUARE) to benchmark its ability to distinguish varying quality levels in user inquiries.

## Technical Framework

The study proposes a departure from static assessment methods in favor of a dynamic, competence-based model. The architecture is defined by the following components:

### Core Dimensions

1.  **Appropriateness (Sociolinguistic Competence)**
    *   Analyzes social norms and politeness.
    *   Evaluates the context in which the question is asked to ensure social suitability.
2.  **Effectiveness (Strategic Competence)**
    *   Assesses the utility of the inquiry.
    *   Estimates the likelihood of achieving the desired outcome or information retrieval.

### Adaptive Mechanisms

*   **Dynamic Contextual Variables:** The system processes questions based on evolving context or conversation history, allowing for a nuanced understanding that changes with the dialogue flow.
*   **Quantifying Qualitative Data:** The framework translates subjective qualitative aspects of questioning into structured, analyzable data.

## Results

*   **Validation Success:** The framework demonstrated robust performance across both the CAUS and SQUARE datasets.
*   **Problematic Question Handling:** It showed particular strength in identifying and categorizing problematic inquiries, including those that are vague, off-topic, or poorly structured.
*   **Nuance Management:** The system proved effective in managing the nuances of automatic question evaluation, moving beyond simple grammatical checking.
*   **Metric Note:** Specific quantitative metrics such as F1-scores or accuracy percentages were not provided in the text; validation focused on capability demonstration.
