## Executive Summary

While one-bit quantization is widely adopted in practice to mitigate the computational and memory bottlenecks of deploying neural network models on resource-constrained devices, its theoretical underpinnings have remained insufficiently explored. Specifically, the machine learning community lacks a rigorous understanding of how extreme weight compression affects the generalization error of multilayer networks.

This paper addresses this critical gap by investigating whether the drastic reduction of model precision invariably compromises learning performance, a question of paramount importance for deploying efficient models on edge hardware without sacrificing accuracy. The authors provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis using the Random Features (RF) model—a framework equivalent to neural networks with random representations—trained via Stochastic Mirror Descent (SMD).

Technically, the approach quantizes the weights of all hidden layers to one bit (mapped to set $\{+1, -1\}$) while retaining full precision for the final layer and input data. To ensure statistical equivalence with Gaussian weights, the quantized weights are scaled by a factor of $1/\sqrt{d_{l-1}}$. The analysis leverages the Lipschitz Concentration Property (LCP) and Gaussian Universality to derive an asymptotically precise characterization of the generalization error, extending theoretical boundaries to models with an arbitrary number of layers ($L$).

The study demonstrates that, asymptotically, one-bit quantization incurs zero loss in generalization error compared to full-precision Random Features models. Empirical validation confirms these theoretical findings, reporting significant efficiency gains on standard hardware. These results show that the compressed model maintains the predictive capability of its uncompressed counterpart while delivering drastic hardware efficiencies.
