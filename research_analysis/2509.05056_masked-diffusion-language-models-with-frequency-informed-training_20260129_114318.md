## 📋 Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the critical challenge of training language models efficiently within data-restricted environments, a central focus of the BabyLM 2025 Challenge. Standard language acquisition paradigms typically rely on massive datasets, rendering them inefficient for studying human-like learning processes or deploying in low-resource settings. The core problem is determining whether diffusion-based training—a methodology successful in computer vision—can rival traditional autoregressive or masked hybrid approaches in natural language processing.

**Innovation**
The paper introduces a novel framework combining Masked Diffusion Language Modeling (MDLM) with a theoretically grounded, frequency-informed masking strategy. Technically, the model utilizes a Transformer backbone (LTG-BERT) enhanced with Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) to condition attention mechanisms on time steps and mask rates. The key technical advancement is the **frequency-informed masking mechanism**, which optimizes learning by prioritizing rare tokens via ranking, min-max normalization, exponentiation, and scaling.

**Results**
The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the MDLM framework achieves performance on par with established hybrid autoregressive-masked baselines. The method was rigorously tested on the BabyLM 2025 Strict Track (100M words, 10 epochs) across Linguistic Competence (BLiMP), World Knowledge (EWoK, COMPS), Human-Likeness (Reading tasks), and NLU (GLUE/SuperGLUE). Despite the theoretical limitations of using a 'myopic' MLM backend, the model proved capable of matching standard hybrid architectures.

**Impact**
This work is significant as it validates diffusion-based training as a robust alternative to standard language modeling objectives, particularly in data-efficient regimes. By demonstrating that a masked diffusion model can rival hybrid architectures without compromising linguistic competence, the authors provide a strong counter-narrative to the current dominance of purely autoregressive methods. The frequency-informed masking strategy offers a valuable new theoretical tool for rare token acquisition.
