> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> This paper addresses a fundamental inefficiency in reinforcement learning (RL): effective exploration in high-dimensional tasks characterized by sparse or noisy reward landscapes. Traditional RL methods typically rely on standard exploration-exploitation heuristics that often lead to instability and suboptimal convergence. The authors argue that the core issue is not merely how an agent selects actions, but how policies are represented. Without high-quality policy representations, agents struggle to discern valuable trajectories, rendering traditional exploration strategies insufficient for solving complex tasks efficiently.
>
> The proposed solution is the **"Representation-Driven RL" (RepRL)** framework, a paradigm shift that reframes the learning challenge as a "representation-exploitation" problem. Technically, the framework operates by representing the policy as an estimate of its expected return. This representation is subsequently embedded into a linear feature space, allowing the system to treat policy selection as a contextual bandit problem where the "context" is derived from the policy's value estimate within that space. The method integrates Linear Thompson Sampling (Linear TS) and is implemented as a regularizer for policy gradient algorithms, combining standard policy gradient loss with a weighted $L_2$ norm distance metric between current policy parameters ($\theta$) and those suggested by the bandit framework ($\tilde{\theta}$).

> Empirical evaluations conducted on MuJoCo, MinAtar, and a custom GridWorld domain demonstrate that RepRL significantly outperforms traditional evolutionary and policy gradient methods. In a GridWorld experiment featuring spatially changing noisy rewards, results averaged over 100 seeds showed that RepRL exhibited superior exploration efficiency compared to Evolutionary Strategies (ES), successfully navigating the noise to locate the optimal trajectory (the upper root), whereas ES failed. Furthermore, in sparse reward versions of MuJoCo, the integration of RepRL resulted in substantially improved convergence rates by mitigating the early-phase instability commonly associated with standard policy gradient approaches.

## 🎯 Key Findings

*   **Enhanced Performance:** The proposed framework achieves significantly improved performance over traditional methods when applied to both evolutionary and policy gradient-based reinforcement learning approaches.
*   **Reframed Trade-off:** Reframing the exploration-exploitation trade-off as a **"representation-exploitation"** problem allows for more effective guidance of the learning process.
*   **Critical Enabler:** High-quality policy representations are identified as a critical enabling factor for achieving optimal exploration strategies.
*   **Bandit Adaptation:** Techniques typically reserved for contextual bandits can be successfully adapted and leveraged to solve complex reinforcement learning problems.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The research employs a structured approach to bridge contextual bandits with deep RL:

*   **Representation Framework**
    The method represents policies not as direct action mappings, but as estimates of their expected values.

*   **Contextual Bandit Integration**
    It leverages methodologies from contextual bandits to systematically guide the exploration and exploitation phases of learning.

*   **Linear Embedding**
    The core mechanism involves embedding the policy network into a linear feature space. This mathematical transformation allows the agent to treat the selection of policies as a contextual bandit problem, where the "context" is derived from the policy representation within that linear space.
