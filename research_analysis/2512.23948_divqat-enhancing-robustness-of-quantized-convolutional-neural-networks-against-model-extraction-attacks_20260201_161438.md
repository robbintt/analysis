## 🚀 Executive Summary

### Problem
This research addresses a critical vulnerability in Quantized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are increasingly deployed on edge devices but remain susceptible to model extraction attacks that threaten intellectual property (IP). Current literature lacks defenses that are both robust against such attacks and economically viable for resource-constrained hardware. The authors highlight a significant gap where standard defenses fail to protect quantized models without imposing prohibitive computational costs or degrading model performance, creating a barrier to the secure deployment of commercial AI in untrusted environments.

### Innovation
The authors introduce **DivQAT** (Divergent Quantization Aware Training), a novel algorithm that integrates defense directly into the quantization process rather than relying on post-processing noise injection. DivQAT utilizes a dual-model architecture consisting of a non-quantized Teacher and a quantized Student. The technical core involves a composite loss function minimized as $L = L_{CE} - \alpha \cdot KL(P_{quantized} || P_{teacher})$. This formulation simultaneously minimizes Cross-Entropy Loss ($L_{CE}$) to maintain task accuracy and maximizes the KL-Divergence between the quantized and original models, forcing the student to deviate from the teacher's output probabilities. This approach creates an intrinsic defense that requires no auxiliary model during inference.

### Results
Empirically validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets, DivQAT demonstrates robust efficacy with specific quantitative improvements. On CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18, DivQAT preserved the victim model's clean accuracy at **92.4%**, nearly matching the 92.5% achieved by standard QAT. However, against the KnockoffNets attack, the method reduced the stolen model's accuracy from 91.5% (under standard QAT) to **13.7%**. Against the DFME data-free attack, stolen accuracy dropped to **12.9%**. The method also exhibits strong synergy with existing defenses; when combined with Random Smoothing (RS) on the SVHN dataset, DivQAT degraded the adversary's stolen model accuracy to **9.1%**, significantly outperforming RS alone (17.8%).

### Impact
DivQAT fills a critical research gap by providing the first technique to modify the quantization process specifically for extraction defense. By overcoming the limitations of computationally expensive post-processing methods, this work offers a practical solution for securing quantized models on edge hardware. The demonstrated ability to reduce the success of sophisticated extraction attacks by up to **87.8%** (in stolen accuracy terms) without degrading model utility or incurring runtime overhead enables safer deployment of commercial AI applications.

## 🔬 Methodology

The proposed algorithm, DivQAT, is built upon the Quantization Aware Training (QAT) framework. It integrates defense mechanisms directly into the training phase by modifying the quantization process itself, rather than relying on post-processing noise injection. This approach embeds robustness specifically for quantized CNN architectures, ensuring that the security feature is native to the model rather than a patched external layer.
