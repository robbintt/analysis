# Designing LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems for Software Engineering Tasks: Quality Attributes, Design Patterns and Rationale

> ### F4C4 Executive Summary
>
> The rapid integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) into Software Engineering (SE) has created a critical engineering gap: while functional capabilities have advanced, there is a lack of structured design principles ensuring system reliability, maintainability, and safety. Currently, the field relies on ad-hoc architectures where autonomous agents collaborate through communication, often leading to unpredictable behaviors and instability. Without a unified framework to map traditional Software Engineering Quality Attributes (QAs)—specifically Reliability, Maintainability, Scalability, and Safety—to these complex designs, developers struggle to balance functional output with the robustness required for production environments.
>
> To address this, the study synthesizes a comprehensive taxonomy that maps specific MAS design patterns to targeted Quality Attributes, providing a technical rationale for their application. Rather than proposing a single new architecture, the authors categorize existing systems into concrete coordination patterns and architectures. Key patterns identified include Role-Based SDLC workflows (exemplified by ChatDev), which assign specific developer roles to agents; Role-Dedicated Architectures (such as MARE for requirements, MAAD for architecture design, and TRANSAGENT for code translation), which constrain agents to specific lifecycle phases; and Multi-Phase Workflows with self-reflective mechanisms (like CodeCoR). The technical innovation lies in linking these specific structures to quality outcomes; for instance, the analysis details how coordination mechanisms such as the Two-Stage Textual Feedback Pipeline and "thought-action-result" workflows mitigate failure modes inherent in LLM limitations to ensure specific QAs like reliability and scalability.
>
> Grounded in a broad Systematic Literature Review (SLR), the paper analyzes 175 representative papers on trustworthiness, 106 papers on SE tasks, and 68 papers on communication protocols, alongside a corpus of 120 annotated workflows. The study validates its findings through the empirical analysis of seven open-source MAS systems and over 200 agent dialogues. Key quantitative results indicate that monitoring for "trajectory smells"—deviations in reasoning paths—and implementing explicit workflow analysis are effective methods for ensuring robustness. However, the data also reveals a significant implementation gap: the majority of current MAS implementations focus heavily on functional generation, with very few designs successfully maintaining a balance of competing Quality Attributes across the full software lifecycle.
>
> This work establishes a foundational paradigm shift, moving LLM-based agent development from experimental trial-and-error to disciplined software engineering. By providing a taxonomy of specific design patterns (e.g., role-dedicated and self-reflective architectures) and a clear rationale for their application, the authors offer practitioners a roadmap for selecting appropriate coordination mechanisms for specific SE tasks. This framework enables the design of Multi-Agent Systems that are not only functionally capable but also engineered to be safe, scalable, and maintainable, serving as a critical reference for future research and production-grade system architecture.

*   **CodeCoR:** Features a multi-phase workflow incorporating a self-reflective mechanism.
*   **TRANSAGENT:** Employs four specialized agents for code translation tasks.
*   **ChatDev:** Utilizes a role-based Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) approach.

### Coordination Mechanisms
*   **Two-Stage Textual Feedback Pipeline**
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
*   **'Thought-Action-Result' Workflow Analysis**

### Targeted Quality Attributes
*   **Reliability**
*   **Maintainability**
*   **Scalability**
*   **Safety**

## F4C8 Results

### Quantitative Analysis
Results are drawn from cited empirical studies and surveys:
*   **Corpus Analysis:** Review of 7 open-source MASs and over 200 dialogues.
*   **Workflow Corpus:** 120 annotated workflows analyzed.
*   **Survey Counts:**
    *   57 sources regarding architectural challenges.
    *   106 papers covering SE tasks.
    *   125 papers in general review.
    *   68 papers on communication protocols.
    *   175 representative papers on trustworthiness.

### Qualitative Findings
*   **Failure Modes:** Identified failures stem primarily from inherent LLM limitations or MAS design flaws.
*   **Robustness:** Detecting "trajectory smells" (deviations in reasoning paths) is effective for maintaining robustness.
*   **Research Gap:** A noticeable gap exists in designing MASs for specific SE tasks that maintain a balanced profile of Quality Attributes.
