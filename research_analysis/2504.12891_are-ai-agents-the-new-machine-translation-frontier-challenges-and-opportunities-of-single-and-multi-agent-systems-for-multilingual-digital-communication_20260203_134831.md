## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical limitations of general-purpose Neural Machine Translation (NMT) in high-stakes professional domains, specifically legal translation. It identifies a performance gap where single-agent systems, while efficient for general or simpler tasks, fail to provide the domain-specific knowledge and contextual nuance required for complex scenarios. The research frames the central problem as determining whether the operational complexity of multi-agent systems can be justified by superior performance. By establishing a clear dichotomy between use cases, the study posits that single-agent systems are suitable for low-complexity translations, whereas multi-agent architectures are essential to overcome the rigidity of monolithic models in precision-sensitive environments.

The key innovation is a shift from monolithic NMT to agentic architectures defined by four core technical attributes: **Autonomy**, **Tool Use**, **Memory**, and **Workflow Customization**. The study implements a multi-agent workflow architecture validated through a pilot study utilizing a sequential pipeline of four specialized agents: Translation, Adequacy review, Fluency review, and Final editing. This system leverages three distinct dynamic workflows—Prompt Chaining (sequential), Routing (dynamic allocation), and Parallelization (concurrent execution)—enabling agents to integrate external resources like Translation Memory and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This technical setup facilitates iterative refinement, allowing the system to mimic the division of labor found in human translation teams.

The study validates that multi-agent systems deliver translation quality superior to traditional MT and single-agent systems through a qualitative evaluation anchored by four specific Research Questions. While standard quantitative metrics like BLEU or COMET were not the focus, the results provide concrete evidence of significant improvements in domain-adaptability and contextual awareness. The pilot study confirmed that the structured four-agent workflow aligns more closely with human translation processes than monolithic models. Furthermore, the investigation yielded specific findings regarding the impact of model temperature and size on performance, demonstrating that the division of labor among specialized agents yields more accurate handling of nuanced legal text.

This work establishes a foundational blueprint for integrating AI agents into professional translation workflows, with immediate significance for the legal sector and other high-precision industries. By validating that multi-agent systems align with human translation processes through specialized roles, the paper offers a practical path toward customizable, domain-specific MT solutions that reduce the burden on human post-editors. The contribution of a working system demo and the categorization of three architectural workflows (Chaining, Routing, Parallelization) provide industry leaders with a concrete framework for adopting agentic AI, signaling a shift toward more reliable, context-aware digital communication infrastructures.

## Key Findings

*   **System Suitability:** Single-agent systems are identified as well-suited for simpler translation tasks, whereas multi-agent systems offer superior solutions for complex scenarios requiring high accuracy, domain-specific knowledge, and contextual awareness.
*   **Performance Edge:** Multi-agent workflows have the potential to significantly improve domain-adaptability and contextual awareness in machine translation (MT).
*   **Quality Comparison:** Translation quality achieved through multi-agent systems appears superior to that of traditional MT or single-agent systems.
