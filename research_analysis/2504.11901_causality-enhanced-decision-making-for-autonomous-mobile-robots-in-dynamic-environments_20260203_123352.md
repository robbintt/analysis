## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) operating in dynamic environments shared with humans, such as warehouses, face significant decision-making challenges that traditional correlation-based methods fail to address. Standard approaches often struggle to distinguish between mere coincidental patterns and genuine cause-and-effect relationships, leading to suboptimal task execution and potential safety risks. To operate efficiently and safely alongside human agents, robots require the capability to not only observe their environment but also to reason about underlying causal factors—such as human behavior and resource depletion. This paper addresses this critical gap by shifting the focus from reactive, correlation-based planning to proactive, causality-driven reasoning.

### **Innovation**
The key innovation is a modular Causality-based Decision Making Framework that integrates causal inference directly into the robotic planning loop. The system functions through a streamlined three-stage pipeline: data extraction and discretization, offline causal structure learning using the J-PCMCI+ algorithm to identify relationships, and a real-time inference engine. Crucially, the framework utilizes do-calculus to formulate intervention queries, estimating probability distributions for environmental variables. These causal insights are then embedded as heuristics within an A* algorithm, allowing the robot to make informed "Execute" or "Abort" decisions based on a reasoned understanding of cause and effect rather than simple statistical association.

### **Results**
Extensive evaluation within a simulated warehouse environment utilized the custom "PeopleFlow" simulator to benchmark the causal approach against non-causal baselines. The study specifically measured **Efficiency**, defined as the optimization of task timing and strategic execution, and **Safety**, assessed through the management of human obstructions and resource constraints like battery usage. While the specific numerical values were not disclosed in the provided text, qualitative results clearly established the framework's superior efficacy. The system successfully outperformed traditional methods by accurately anticipating critical variables, thereby validating the practical benefits of the causality-driven approach in handling complex interactions.

### **Impact**
This research makes a significant contribution to the field of robotics by establishing the viability of integrating causal models into real-time robotic planning. By moving beyond correlation-based analysis toward robust causal reasoning, the framework enhances the autonomy of robots facing unpredictable, human-centric environments. Furthermore, the introduction of the PeopleFlow simulator provides the research community with a valuable tool for modeling large-scale, context-sensitive human-robot interactions. Ultimately, this work paves the way for the next generation of intelligent AMRs, demonstrating that causal reasoning is essential for handling the true complexity of real-world operations.

## Methodology

The research employs a dual-pronged methodological approach involving both a theoretical reasoning framework and a custom simulation environment:

*   **Causal Reasoning Framework:** The researchers developed a decision-making framework that leverages causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships, allowing the robot to reason over a learned causal model to determine optimal task timing and execution strategies.
*   **Simulation Environment (PeopleFlow):** The authors developed PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions, generating realistic trajectories for a large number of agents.
*   **Benchmarking:** The methodology includes an extensive evaluation within a simulated warehouse use case, benchmarking the proposed causal approach against a non-causal baseline to measure performance improvements in efficiency and safety.

1.  **Data Extraction**
    *   Applies subsampling based on the **Nyquist-Shannon theorem**.

2.  **Learning Pipeline (Offline)**
    *   Identifies causal structures using the **CausalFlow library's J-PCMCI+ algorithm** to handle context variables.
    *   Learns parameters via **pyAgrum** using **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**.

3.  **Inference Pipeline (Real-time)**
    *   Formulates queries as interventions.
    *   Uses **do-calculus** implemented via pyAgrum to estimate probability distributions.
    *   Computes expectations and embeds these as heuristics in the **A\*** algorithm to make Execute or Abort decisions.
