## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical inadequacy of existing security frameworks in protecting **"Agentic Vehicles" (AgVs)**, which fail to account for safety-critical cyber-physical dynamics and cross-layer interactions, leaving vehicles vulnerable to unsafe behaviors arising from data or logic distortions. The key innovation is the definition of Agentic Vehicles and the establishment of the first structured security framework bridging cognitive security and automotive safety, featuring a decomposed architecture with Personal and Driving Strategy Agents and a six-level agency capability taxonomy.

The paper presents qualitative foundational results, including a comprehensive **Threat Matrix** and **Attack Chain Analysis** that systematically categorize cognitive threats and analyze cross-layer propagation risks, demonstrating how specific vulnerabilities interact with vehicle subsystems. This work significantly influences the field by providing the foundational vocabulary and architecture necessary to secure next-generation intelligent vehicles, setting the stage for future security standards that address the unique, safety-critical risks of integrating agentic AI in automotive environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Inadequate Frameworks:** Existing security models are insufficient for vehicles as they overlook safety-critical cyber-physical dynamics and cross-layer interactions.
*   **Attack Chain Escalation:** Minor distortions can escalate through attack chains, ultimately resulting in unsafe vehicle behavior.
*   **Universal Impact:** Security threats affect both human-driven and autonomous vehicles that utilize agentic capabilities.
*   **Upstream Vulnerabilities:** Significant risks originate from upstream layers (e.g., perception and control) that can compromise the core agentic layer.

***

## Methodology

The authors employed a structured approach to analyze the security landscape of agentic vehicles:

*   **Architecture Definition:** Development of a role-based architecture comprising two primary components: a **Personal Agent** and a **Driving Strategy Agent**.
*   **Dual-Layer Investigation:** Utilization of a dual-layer threat investigation approach:
    *   **Agentic AI Layer Risks:** Analyzing threats inherent to the AI decision-making processes.
    *   **Cross-Layer Risks:** Analyzing threats originating from upstream components.
*   **Evaluation Tools:** Application of a severity matrix and attack-chain analysis to evaluate threats systematically.

***

## Technical Details

The paper proposes a robust security framework that integrates agentic AI with standard automotive architectures.

### Architecture & Framework
*   **Decomposed Agentic Architecture:** Defines trust boundaries using two meta-agents:
    *   **Personal Agent:** Manages user-specific interactions and preferences.
    *   **Driving Strategy Agent:** Handles driving logic and safety-critical decisions.

### Taxonomies & Classifications
*   **Agency Capability Taxonomy:** Introduces a six-level classification system (Levels 0–5) that is orthogonal to traditional SAE automation levels.
*   **Cognitive Threats:** Classifies specific threats targeting the AI's logic, including:
    *   Memory poisoning
    *   Intent interpretation attacks
*   **Cross-Layer Propagation:** Analyzes how threats move from upstream layers to the agentic layer:
    *   **Perception Layer**
    *   **Control/Network Layer**
    *   **Communication Layer**

## Contributions

*   **Definition of Agentic Vehicles (AgVs):** Establishes a specific role-based architecture for the next generation of intelligent vehicles.
*   **Structured Security Framework:** Creates the first framework to bridge the gap between cognitive security and automotive safety.
*   **Threat Taxonomy:** Develops a comprehensive taxonomy that spans both the cognitive layer and cross-layer interactions.
