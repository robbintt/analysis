## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical limitation of traditional automated evaluation systems in clinical education, which rely on rigid categorical labels that fail to capture the nuanced, non-binary nature of human clinical interaction. Legacy computational approaches struggle to assess complex competencies such as professionalism, ethics, and contextual relevance because they cannot interpret ambiguity. As medical education scales, there is a pressing need for automated tools that can mimic the interpretative reasoning of human experts, handling gradations in performance rather than relying on discrete, Boolean boundaries.

The core innovation is the **"LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge"** framework, a hybrid evaluation methodology designed to model uncertainty within clinical data. Technically, the system integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of pre-trained Transformer architectures with specialized Prompt Engineering. The model weights are adjusted using domain-specific data from the University of Cincinnati's '2-Sigma' clinical training system, comprising thousands of annotated conversation scripts.

The framework applies fuzzy logic principles by evaluating inputs against four specific spectrums:
*   Professionalism
*   Medical relevance
*   Ethical behavior
*   Contextual distraction

This mechanism allows the model to generate graded, interpretable outputs that reflect partial membership in these categories, aligning with human logic rather than discrete classifications. Validation was conducted qualitatively across a dataset of thousands of scripts. While standard statistical metrics are absent, authors report the system achieves "strong agreement with human judges" and delivers "nuanced and interpretable feedback." This framework offers a technical pathway to bridge the gap between raw computational processing and fuzzy logic required for clinical judgment, enabling the scaling of high-quality medical education evaluation without losing context.
