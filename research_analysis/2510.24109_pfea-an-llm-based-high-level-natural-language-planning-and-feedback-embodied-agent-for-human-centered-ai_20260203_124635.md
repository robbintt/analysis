## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Current Large Language Model (LLM) based embodied agents struggle to bridge the gap between high-level semantic understanding and low-level physical execution, particularly in dynamic, real-world environments. While these agents can process natural language, they often lack the capability for online planning and execution of complex control tasks. Existing approaches, such as those relying solely on LLM+CLIP architectures, frequently fail because they operate without robust feedback mechanisms, leading to a disconnect between the robot’s perception and its physical actions.

**Innovation**
The researchers introduce **PFEA (Planning and Feedback Embodied Agent)**, a novel framework designed to facilitate natural language-driven robotic control through a closed-loop architecture. The system is structured into three interconnected modules: a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent core, and an action execution module. Technically, PFEA distinguishes itself through a pipeline that includes Language Understanding, Task Planning, Task Translation, Action Execution, and critically, a **Task Performance Feedback Evaluator**. This evaluator monitors the outcomes of actions, allowing the system to self-correct and adjust plans online.

**Results**
Empirical validation in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrates that PFEA significantly outperforms baseline methods. The framework achieved a **28% higher average task success rate** compared to the LLM+CLIP baseline (SayCan), scoring 78% versus 50%. This improvement is even more pronounced in unprompted tasks, where PFEA attained a 74% execution success rate against the baseline's 35%.

**Impact**
This research represents a significant advancement in the field of Human-Centered AI by providing a concrete solution to the "lack of online planning" problem inherent in current LLM-based agents. The empirical evidence presented confirms that integrating vision-based planning with active task performance feedback is superior to standard text-and-vision-only approaches. By enabling robots to understand complex natural language instructions and execute them with high reliability in physical settings, PFEA establishes a new paradigm for embodied intelligence.

    *   A vision-based task planner
    *   A natural language instruction converter
    *   A task performance feedback evaluator
3.  **Action Execution Module:** Responsible for physical manipulation and the actual completion of tasks.
