## Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the critical absence of robust security evaluations within emerging IEEE 802.11bf (Wi-Fi Sensing) standards. As deep learning becomes the standard for interpreting Channel State Information (CSI) in human-centered applications, a significant vulnerability arises: while these models achieve high accuracy on benign data, their resilience against adversarial evasion attacks in physical deployments is largely unquantified. This knowledge gap poses severe risks to user safety and system reliability, as current literature focuses predominantly on theoretical performance rather than the security implications of real-world deployment.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce a systematic evaluation framework designed to benchmark the robustness of CSI-based deep learning models against diverse threat vectors, including white-box, black-box, and universal perturbations. Technically, the study contrasts compact temporal autoencoders with larger deep architectures to isolate the impact of model scale on security. A core innovation is the bridging of theoretical cybersecurity and physical reality; the authors map unconstrained feature-space attacks to physically realizable signal-space perturbations through a rigorous five-stage pipeline. This pipeline spans from PHY layer reception and Channel Frequency Response (CFR) calculation to pre-processing (denoising/normalization) and STFT/Doppler profile transformation, ensuring the analysis reflects the operational constraints of the complex CSI tensor ($H \in \mathbb{C}^{N_r \times N_t \times K}$) sampled at 1-10 kHz.

**Results**
Quantitative evaluation across three public datasets reveals distinct trade-offs between model size and security. Compact temporal autoencoders achieve baseline accuracy statistically comparable to larger deep architectures on clean data; however, these smaller models exhibit significantly higher vulnerability, demonstrating a substantially higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) under adversarial manipulation. The physical constraints of the signal layer play a vital defensive role: physically realizable signal-space perturbations yield a significantly lower ASR than theoretical unconstrained feature-space attacks. Finally, the implementation of adversarial training was validated as an effective defense, successfully improving Mean Robust Accuracy while incurring only a moderate, quantified decrease in clean data performance.

**Impact**
This work establishes a necessary quantitative baseline for CSI robustness, shifting the research focus from pure accuracy to the critical trade-offs between efficiency and security. By exposing the fragility of compact models and validating the efficacy of adversarial training under physical constraints, the authors provide concrete design principles for engineering trustworthy sensing systems. These insights are vital for the future development of IEEE 802.11bf-compliant devices, ensuring that commercial Wi-Fi sensing solutions are hardened against evasion attacks prior to deployment in critical security and healthcare environments.
