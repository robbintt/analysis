## Executive Summary

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is critical for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current state-of-the-art methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs and opacity. Traditional RLHF pipelines rely on training massive, specialized reward models (ranging from 27B to 70B parameters) and necessitate an offline preference-tuning phase. This creates a significant resource bottleneck, limiting accessibility for smaller actors, and often results in "black box" reward signals that lack transparency regarding why a specific output was preferred, hindering the development of interpretable AI.

This research introduces a **"plug-and-play" evaluation framework** that replaces heavy, static reward networks with a lightweight, transparent, and trainable judge model. Technically, the system augments a frozen, instruction-tuned 7B LLM with a rank-16 LoRA adapter, affecting only 0.8% of total parameters, combined with specific prompt engineering (JSON rubrics and in-context demonstrations). This architecture eliminates the offline preference-tuning requirement, allowing for immediate integration into online Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) loops. To enhance interpretability, the authors utilized the new HH-Rationales dataset—10,000 preference pairs with human justifications—to train the judge to mirror human reasoning patterns while supporting long-context evaluation up to 32K tokens.

**Performance highlights include:**
*   **96.2% accuracy** on the RewardBench benchmark, outperforming significantly larger specialized reward networks (27B–70B parameters).
*   **92% exact match accuracy** on the GSM-8K mathematical reasoning benchmark when used as a reward function for online RLHF, surpassing a top-performing 70B model trained via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
*   **High-fidelity reasoning** (9/10 similarity) compared to zero-shot baselines (5/10), while maintaining robust calibration against hallucinations and safety failures.

These findings challenge the assumption that high-performance alignment requires massive, monolithic reward models, proving instead that parameter-efficient fine-tuning of smaller judges can unlock superior results. By drastically reducing parameter overhead and removing the offline tuning bottleneck, this methodology democratizes access to state-of-the-art RLHF, making it feasible for resource-constrained environments. The release of the HH-Rationales dataset and the demonstration of high-fidelity, interpretable reasoning offer a significant advancement for AI safety, providing a pathway toward systems where reward optimization is both computationally efficient and transparent to human oversight.
