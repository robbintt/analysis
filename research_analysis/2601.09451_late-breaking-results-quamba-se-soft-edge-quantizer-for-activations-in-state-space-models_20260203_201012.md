## Executive Summary

State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers, but deploying them on hardware requires effective quantization to reduce memory and computational overhead. A primary challenge in quantizing SSM activations is the "Outlier vs. Precision Dilemma." Standard INT8 quantization relies on hard clipping to manage dynamic ranges, which inevitably discards or distorts outlier values that often carry critical semantic information. While widening the quantization range can preserve these outliers, it sacrifices precision for the majority of the data, leading to accuracy degradation. This paper addresses the need for a quantization strategy that preserves outlier information without significantly compromising the precision of normal activation values.

The researchers introduce **Quamba-SE (Soft-edge Quantizer)**, a specialized hardware quantizer design that abandons uniform quantization in favor of a dynamic three-tier adaptive scaling strategy. Quamba-SE categorizes activation data into three distinct ranges and applies a specific scaling factor to each: small values utilize a Scale/4 factor for high precision, normal values use a standard Scale factor, and large values (outliers) employ a Scale*4 factor with 6-bit precision to preserve their magnitude. This "soft-edge" approach avoids the hard clipping found in traditional methods, allowing the model to retain outlier information without distortion.

Quamba-SE was evaluated on the Mamba-130M architecture across six zero-shot datasets, consistently outperforming the baseline Quamba method. The approach achieved an average accuracy increase of +0.83% across all datasets, with a maximum improvement of +2.68% on the WinoGrande benchmark. The researchers noted that the method introduces only minor latency overhead, which is negligible compared to the computational cost of matrix operations.

## Key Findings

*   **Consistent Outperformance:** Quamba-SE consistently outperforms the baseline Quamba method across all evaluated tasks.
*   **Significant Accuracy Gains:** The method achieved a maximum improvement of **+2.68%** on individual benchmarks and an average accuracy increase of **+0.83%** across six datasets.
*   **Outlier Preservation:** By avoiding hard clipping, Quamba-SE successfully preserves outlier information, which directly correlates with the observed accuracy improvements.
*   **Proven Efficacy:** The effectiveness of the quantizer was specifically demonstrated on the Mamba-130M architecture using zero-shot benchmarks.

## Methodology

The researchers developed Quamba-SE, a soft-edge quantizer specifically designed for the activations of State Space Models (SSMs). Instead of relying on standard INT8 operations that utilize hard clipping, Quamba-SE implements a three adaptive scale mechanism:

1.  **High-Precision Scale:** Applied to small values to capture fine-grained details.
2.  **Standard Scale:** Applied to values within the normal distribution range.
3.  **Low-Precision Scale:** Applied to outliers to preserve their information without distortion.

This methodology addresses the limitation of uniform quantization by dynamically adjusting precision based on the activation value range.

## Technical Details

Quamba-SE (Soft-edge Quantizer) is a hardware quantization design for State Space Models (specifically Mamba) that addresses the 'Outlier vs. Precision Dilemma' using a variable-scale quantization strategy.

### Architecture & Data Partitioning

The architecture divides data into three distinct ranges to optimize the trade-off between precision and range:

| Data Range | Interval | Scaling Factor | Precision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Small Values** | (-64, 63) | Scale / 4 | High Precision |
| **Normal Values** | (-128, 127) | Scale | Standard Precision |
| **Large Values / Outliers** | (H+) | Scale * 4 | Low Precision (6-bit) |

### Implementation
*   **Hardware Design:** A specialized hardware quantizer was designed to support these 'soft edges'.
*   **Simulation:** Experiments were simulated in CUDA 12.8 by limiting FP32 values to specific representable data ranges.

## Results

Experiments were conducted on an NVIDIA RTX 5090 using the Mamba-130M model evaluated on 6 zero-shot datasets.

### Performance Metrics
*   **Average Accuracy Improvements:** +0.22%, +0.59%, and +0.83% across different calibration settings.
*   **Subset Benchmarks:** Improvements of +0.36%, +0.70%, and +1.48%.
*   **Official Pretrained Weights:** Quamba-SE achieved a **+1.48%** improvement over Quamba.

### Specific Benchmark Gains
*   **WinoGrande:** +2.68%
*   **LAMBADA:** +2.33%

### Overhead
The method introduces minor latency overhead, which is considered negligible compared to the computational cost of matrix operations.
