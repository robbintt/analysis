## Executive Summary

The deployment of autonomous AI coding agents is currently hindered by the inability of existing commercial security solutions to support "headless" workflows—continuous execution loops without human intervention. While tools like the Google Gemini CLI sandbox offer robust security, they rely on mandatory interactive authentication that breaks autonomous processes. Furthermore, granting AI agents direct system access poses significant risks, as destructive commands can corrupt the environment, and there is a lack of robust mechanisms to ensure system consistency following execution failures. This creates a critical bottleneck where agents cannot operate safely and continuously without human oversight or risking system stability.

This research introduces a **Fault-Tolerant Sandboxing framework** that fundamentally redefines tool execution by treating agent commands as atomic ACID transactions. The architecture employs a policy-based interception layer to analyze and filter commands before execution, coupled with a transactional filesystem snapshot mechanism that utilizes pre-execution states for immediate fault recovery. To validate the framework's efficacy in a realistic environment, the authors constructed a custom testbed based on Proxmox virtualization, secured via EVPN/VXLAN network isolation. The system is optimized for resource-constrained environments by leveraging Small Language Models (SLMs), specifically Minimind-MoE, which utilizes knowledge distillation and aggressive 4-bit/8-bit quantization served via a lightweight nano-vllm infrastructure.

In rigorous testing against a Google Gemini CLI baseline, the proposed framework demonstrated superior efficacy in autonomous environments. The system achieved a 100% interception rate for high-risk commands and a 100% success rate in rolling back failed system states, ensuring complete isolation from destructive operations. While introducing a comprehensive safety layer, the framework maintained acceptable performance metrics, incurring a total overhead of approximately 1.8 seconds per transaction (a 14.5% penalty). Additionally, the utilization of SLMs resulted in sub-second inference times and reduced operational costs by 10–30 times per token compared to traditional 70B parameter models. Conversely, the Gemini CLI sandbox was confirmed to be incompatible with headless workflows due to its authentication requirements.

This work represents a significant advancement in the operational viability of autonomous AI agents by bridging the gap between rigorous security and continuous availability. By validating a transactional approach to sandboxing within a complex Proxmox and EVPN/VXLAN environment, the paper demonstrates that atomic state management and policy-based interception can provide stronger safety guarantees than traditional containerization methods without heavy initialization overhead. The successful integration of efficient SLMs suggests a viable path for deploying secure, autonomous coding agents on resource-constrained edge hardware, potentially accelerating the adoption of AI-driven development in secure, on-premise environments.
