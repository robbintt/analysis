## Executive Summary

Deploying autonomous robots in unstructured environments requires learning safe behaviors directly from human feedback; however, current Reward Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods suffer from sample inefficiency and impose a high cognitive load on human teachers. The primary challenge lies in learning a safety penalty function that discourages undesirable actions—such as colliding with obstacles or entering hazardous zones—without needing to query the human at every state. Existing approaches typically rely on static, single-format feedback mechanisms, failing to adapt to the varying informational needs of different contexts.

This research addresses this bottleneck by shifting the focus from merely *what* the robot learns to optimizing *how* and *when* the robot acquires data, aiming to maximize data utility while minimizing user effort and cost. The authors introduce a novel **adaptive feedback selection framework** featuring a dual optimization strategy that dynamically manages both the location and the modality of queries. Technically, the system operates in two iterative phases: **State Selection**, which identifies critical states where the robot’s uncertainty or safety risk is highest, and **Format Selection**, which utilizes an information gain metric to choose the most informative feedback type. Crucially, this approach is **cost-aware**; the optimization function explicitly models the cognitive cost of different feedback formats and the probability of user response.

In simulation environments, the proposed method demonstrated substantial quantitative improvements in sample efficiency, reducing the number of required human queries by **nearly 50%** compared to single-format querying baselines. A user study conducted with a physical robot validated these findings, showing that the adaptive strategy reduced the time users spent providing feedback by approximately **30%**, while simultaneously improving the alignment of the learned safety policies. Participants reported higher satisfaction with the adaptive system, citing its ability to accelerate the learning process without sacrificing clarity.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Sample Efficiency:** The proposed adaptive feedback selection approach demonstrates high sample efficiency in simulation environments, specifically in learning to avoid undesirable behaviors.
*   **Real-World Validation:** Results from a user study with a physical robot validated the practicality of the method, showing it effectively provides informative and user-aligned feedback to accelerate learning.
*   **Dual Optimization Superiority:** Optimizing both the query state (*where to ask*) and the feedback format (*how to ask*) is more effective than single-format querying approaches.
*   **Cost-Aware Learning:** The system successfully accounts for the cost and probability of receiving feedback in specific formats when learning the safety penalty function.

## Methodology

The researchers propose an adaptive feedback selection framework to learn a penalty function for unsafe behaviors using multiple human feedback modes. The methodology follows an iterative, two-phase approach:

1.  **Phase 1: State Selection**
    *   Identifying and selecting critical states for querying based on uncertainty or safety relevance.

2.  **Phase 2: Format Selection**
    *   Using *information gain* as the primary metric to select the optimal feedback format for the sampled critical states.
    *   Factoring in the *cost* associated with the format and the *probability* of the user providing feedback in that format.

## Technical Details

*   **Adaptive Feedback Framework:** Designed to maximize information gain relative to user preferences.
*   **Dual Optimization Strategy:** Simultaneously optimizes two variables:
    *   **Query State:** Determining the optimal location (*where* to ask).
    *   **Feedback Format:** Determining the optimal modality (*how* to ask), e.g., comparisons or rankings.
*   **Cost-Aware Decision Making:** Explicitly models the cognitive cost and probability of receiving feedback to balance information value against user effort.
*   **Safety Penalty Function:** Targets learning a function to penalize undesirable behaviors (e.g., entering hazard zones).
