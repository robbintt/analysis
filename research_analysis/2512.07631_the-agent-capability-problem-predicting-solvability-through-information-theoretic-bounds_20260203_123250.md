## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental challenge of resource allocation in autonomous systems, specifically the inability to predict whether an agent can solve a problem within acceptable resource constraints before execution begins. Current approaches rely heavily on empirical heuristics or trial-and-error methods, leading to unpredictable costs and inefficient deployment. The lack of a rigorous mechanism to determine solvability hinders the reliability of autonomous systems. The authors formalize this issue as the "**Agent Capability Problem**" (ACP), emphasizing the critical need for a theoretical basis to decide when an agent should commit resources to a task.

The key innovation is the reframing of problem-solving as an information-theoretic process, allowing for the quantification of resource requirements through the lens of information acquisition. The authors derive a metric called "**effective cost**" ($C_{eff}$), calculated as $C_{eff} = (I_{total}/I_{step}) \cdot C_{step}$. In this formulation, $I_{total}$ represents the total entropy of the solution space (the uncertainty to be resolved), $I_{step}$ is the average information gained per action, and $C_{step}$ is the cost of that action. Operational implementation of this model relies on an optimal policy that selects actions to maximize economic efficiency—mathematically defined as the ratio of expected information gain to the cost of action ($\frac{E[I_s(a)]}{C_s(a)}$)—which equates to minimizing the effective cost.

The study delivers rigorous mathematical bounds on search effort, proving that the derived effective cost serves as a strict lower bound for the expected cost ($C_{eff} \le E[C]$). Additionally, the authors establish a specific probabilistic upper bound for necessary budget reserves: $E[C] \le C_s ( \frac{I_{total}}{\mu_{inf}} + \frac{M^2}{\mu_{inf}^2} )$, where $\mu_{inf}$ is the mean information gain and $M$ bounds the information gain per step. This bound is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio of information gains and utilizes Hoeffding's inequality for high-probability guarantees. Experimental validation demonstrated that ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance, consistently bounding search effort. The framework proved superior to baseline strategies, achieving higher efficiency than both greedy and random approaches across diverse architectures, specifically including LLM-based systems and various agentic workflows.

The significance of this work lies in its provision of a rigorous, theoretical foundation for resource commitment, shifting the field away from ad-hoc heuristic methods toward predictable engineering. By offering provable bounds on search effort, the ACP framework enhances the reliability and safety of deploying autonomous systems in resource-constrained environments. Its generalizability across diverse architectures suggests it will serve as a vital tool for analyzing and optimizing agentic behavior, ensuring that autonomous agents are evaluated on quantifiable solvability rather than opaque performance metrics.

## Methodology

The methodology reframes problem-solving as a process of information acquisition using an information-theoretic lens. It quantifies the resource requirements by calculating the total bits needed to identify a solution ($I_{total}$) against the information gain per action ($I_{step}$).

By incorporating the cost per action ($C_{step}$), the approach derives an **effective cost metric**:
$$C_{eff} = \left(\frac{I_{total}}{I_{step}}\right) \cdot C_{step}$$

This metric is used to predict resource requirements prior to search initiation and is validated through experimental comparison against baseline strategies (greedy and random) across different agent workflows.

## Technical Details

*   **Formalization:** The Agent Capability Problem (ACP) is formalized as an information-theoretic sequential decision-making process, modeling problem-solving as a search for information within a hypothesis space to determine solvability.
*   **Core Cost Model:** Defined as $C_{effective} = \frac{I_{total}}{\bar{I}_s} \times \bar{C}_s$.
    *   $I_{total}$: Total entropy (uncertainty) regarding the solution location.
    *   $\bar{I}_s$: Average mutual information gained per action.
*   **Optimal Policy:** Selects actions that maximize economic efficiency:
    $$\frac{E[I_s(a)]}{C_s(a)}$$
*   **Stochastic Model Assumptions:** Relies on assumptions of conditional independence of outcomes, bounded moments, and diminishing returns on information gains.

## Results

*   **Theoretical Bounds:** The paper proves theoretical bounds on the expected cost $E[C]$:
    *   **Lower Bound:** $C_{effective} \le E[C]$
    *   **Upper Bound:** $E[C] \le C_s \left( \frac{I_{total}}{\mu_{inf}} + \frac{M^2}{\mu_{inf}^2} \right)$, determined by the signal-to-noise ratio of information gains.
*   **High-Probability Bounds:** Derived using Hoeffding's inequality to determine necessary budget reserves.
*   **Qualitative Outcomes:**
    *   ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance.
    *   Search effort is consistently bounded.
    *   Higher efficiency achieved than greedy and random baselines.
    *   Generalizes effectively to LLM-based systems and agentic workflows.
