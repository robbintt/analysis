## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the engineering complexities of orchestrating Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS), a task that introduces significant friction beyond the capabilities of individual models. The core problem lies in balancing individual agent proficiency with collective system resilience; without a cohesive structural design, systems struggle to manage the dynamic interactions required for complex tasks. While the potential for collaborative intelligence is high, the engineering reality is constrained by difficulties in managing agent interdependencies, leading to operational instability in environments requiring real-time adaptation.

The authors’ key innovation is a structured technological framework that synthesizes the current landscape into **four critical pillars**: Architecture, Memory, Planning, and Technologies/Frameworks. To ensure rigor and focus, the survey employs a selective categorization methodology, analyzing 31 foundational papers specifically chosen for their influence on these four domains rather than attempting a broad but shallow sweep of the literature. This approach allows for a deep dive into specific design patterns, identifying the **Mixture of Agents (MoA)** architecture as a best practice for role assignment and the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** model for optimizing decision-making workflows. By mapping these technologies against the four pillars, the paper provides a technical blueprint for integrating information retention and strategic planning into a unified system.

The results of this analysis indicate that while frameworks like MoA and ReAct offer progress, current implementations consistently fail to adequately balance the load between individual agents and the collective system. The synthesis of the selected studies reveals that this imbalance leads to three distinct technical bottlenecks: **scalability limitations** that prevent efficient expansion, **latency issues** that disrupt real-time responsiveness, and **excessive computational overhead** incurred by complex coordination protocols. As a qualitative survey, the paper does not present experimental metrics, but its granular review of the 31 cited works confirms that these performance barriers are systemic across current architectural approaches.

The significance of this work lies in its provision of a practical roadmap for transitioning multi-agent systems from theoretical concepts to deployable engineering solutions. By clearly defining the technological constraints and offering actionable optimization guidelines, the study assists developers in designing systems that are both scalable and adaptable. This influence extends to establishing a strategic direction for future research, prioritizing the development of resilient architectures that can handle dynamic environments, and ultimately serving as a foundational reference for advancing the field toward harmonious, collaborative intelligence.
