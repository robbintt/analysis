## Executive Summary

The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents has outpaced the theoretical understanding of their generalizability—the ability to perform effectively on unseen tasks and domains. Currently, the concept of agent generalizability is underdefined and lacks systematic measurement approaches, leading to a critical ambiguity between "generalizable frameworks" (architectures that require fine-tuning) and "generalizable agents" (systems that perform robustly out-of-the-box). This lack of standardization prevents accurate performance comparisons and obscures the specific mechanisms required to translate framework capabilities into reliable, real-world agent behavior.

This paper presents the first comprehensive review focused specifically on LLM-based agent generalizability, introducing a hierarchical domain-task ontology to standardize evaluation boundaries by integrating NAICS standards with Mind2Web’s structure (Intent, Object, Condition). The authors establish a technical taxonomy categorizing generalizability improvements into three distinct layers: Backbone LLM modifications, Agent Component enhancements (Reasoning, Tool, Perception, and Memory Units), and Interaction optimizations. Crucially, the work clarifies the architectural gap between frameworks and agents, identifying how insufficient communication between components and inadequate orchestration currently limit system adaptability.

The survey proposes concrete quantitative metrics to evaluate agent reliability, including an 80% success rate threshold for booking tasks without human intervention and "Action Selection Accuracy" to measure the optimal identification of actions. It advocates for consistency metrics across User Instructions, Tasks, Environments, and Domains. The analysis reveals significant gaps in current literature, specifically the absence of standardized benchmarks and the lack of metrics based on variance and cost, while identifying Mind2Web as a prominent existing benchmark for organizing web-based tasks.

By defining the theoretical boundaries and measurement standards for agent generalizability, this paper provides a foundational roadmap for future research. It shifts the field toward rigorous, standardized evaluation frameworks and advanced metrics, moving beyond ad-hoc agent design. The distinction drawn between frameworks and agents, combined with the proposed taxonomy of improvement methods, will guide the development of more robust, autonomous systems capable of operating reliably across diverse and complex real-world environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Undefined Concept:** The concept of generalizability in LLM-based agents is currently underdefined and lacks systematic measurement approaches.
*   **Improvement Taxonomy:** Methods for improving generalizability fall into three distinct categories:
    *   Backbone LLM modifications
    *   Agent component enhancements
    *   Interaction optimizations
*   **Framework vs. Agent:** A critical distinction exists between 'generalizable frameworks' and 'generalizable agents.' Specific mechanisms are required to translate framework capabilities to the agent level.
*   **Evaluation Gaps:** Current evaluation datasets, dimensions, and metrics have significant limitations. There is a pressing need for standardized frameworks and new metrics based on variance and cost.

## Technical Details

### System Architecture
The paper defines an LLM-based agent as a modular system centered on a **Backbone LLM**, augmented by the following units:
*   **Reasoning Engine**
*   **Tool Unit**
*   **Perception and Processing Unit**
*   **Memory Unit** (divided into Short-term and Long-term)

### Generalizability Improvement Categories
*   **Backbone LLM Modifications:** Adjustments made to the core language model.
*   **Agent Component Enhancements:** Improvements to specific modules (Reasoning, Tool, Perception, Memory).
*   **Interaction Optimizations:** Refinements in how the agent interacts with the environment or users.

### Key Distinctions
*   **Generalizable Frameworks:** Adaptable architectures that require specific fine-tuning.
*   **Generalizable Agents:** Systems capable of performing well on unseen tasks or domains without immediate retraining.

### Evaluation Standards
*   **Hierarchical Domain-Task Ontology:** Proposed standard using **NAICS** standards and **Mind2Web**'s structure (Intent, Object, Condition).
*   **Architectural Limitations:** Identified issues include insufficient communication between components and inadequate orchestration.
