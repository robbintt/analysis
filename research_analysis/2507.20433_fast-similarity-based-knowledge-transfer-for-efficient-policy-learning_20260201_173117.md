## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Transfer learning in reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to sample efficiency, but it faces substantial barriers in dynamic, evolving domains where environments change over time. The core challenge is "negative transfer," where migrating knowledge degrades performance rather than improving it. In complex scenarios with evolving dynamics—such as racing tracks that vary continuously—the high computational cost of manually selecting source policies or retraining agents from scratch renders traditional approaches inefficient. This paper addresses the bottleneck of identifying appropriate source policies in non-static environments, aiming to reduce the computational overhead of continuous agent deployment.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce **FAST** (Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer), a method that utilizes multi-modal representation learning to automate policy selection. Technically, FAST processes both visual frames and textual descriptions to construct latent representations of task dynamics. These embeddings are used to calculate precise similarity scores between the current environment and a library of source environments. By using these scores to identify the most relevant source policy for initializing the agent, FAST replaces manual tuning with an automated, embedding-driven selection mechanism that ensures only semantically relevant knowledge is transferred.

**Results**
Experimental validations on complex racing track domains demonstrate that FAST achieves final performance comparable to learning-from-scratch methods, matching their asymptotic reward scores. Crucially, this performance parity was attained with a **50% reduction in required training steps**, effectively doubling the sample efficiency of the learning process. The framework's latent similarity estimations accurately gauged environmental distance, allowing the model to avoid negative transfer. Specifically, FAST enabled agents to converge to optimal performance levels **up to 2x faster** than baselines that struggled with policy selection in evolving conditions.

**Impact**
This research provides a methodological advancement for automated transfer learning by validating that multi-modal embeddings can serve as reliable proxies for task compatibility. By solving the policy selection bottleneck, FAST offers a scalable framework for continuous development, allowing agents to adapt to new scenarios without prohibitive retraining costs. This approach establishes a practical pathway for applying RL to dynamic, real-world systems where environments are not static.

## Methodology

The proposed method, **FAST** (Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer), operates by leveraging a multi-modal input strategy. It processes both visual frames and textual descriptions to construct a latent representation of task dynamics. These representations are utilized to compute similarity scores between different environments.
