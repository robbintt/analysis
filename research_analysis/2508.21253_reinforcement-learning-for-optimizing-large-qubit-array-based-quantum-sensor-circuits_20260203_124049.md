## Executive Summary

The exponential complexity of quantum sensor circuits presents a significant scalability bottleneck as qubit arrays grow. Manual optimization of these circuits is infeasible for large-scale systems, yet maximizing sensitivity—specifically through entanglement distribution—is critical for advancing quantum sensing capabilities. Furthermore, simulating large-scale quantum systems using traditional state-vector methods becomes computationally prohibitive due to memory constraints. This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently optimizing quantum sensor circuits for arrays up to 60 qubits, aiming to enhance Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement while adhering to realistic hardware limitations such as gate fidelity and circuit depth.

The authors propose a hybrid optimization framework that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Matrix Product State (MPS) tensor-network simulations to manage computational complexity. The core innovation lies in a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) agent, enhanced with entanglement-aware attention, which learns to restructure quantum circuits by navigating a multi-objective reward landscape. This reward function strategically balances the maximization of QFI and entanglement entropy against the minimization of gate counts and circuit depth. By utilizing MPS representation within Qiskit’s AerSimulator, the framework achieves efficient state compression, allowing for the simulation and optimization of systems that are otherwise intractable using classical state-vector methods.

The proposed method demonstrated robust performance across systems scaling up to 60 qubits and 120 gates. The RL agent successfully achieved Quantum Fisher Information values approaching 1 (maintaining >0.8 even under noisy conditions) and sustained entanglement entropy between 0.8 and 1.0. Significant hardware efficiency gains were realized, with circuit depth reductions averaging 3% to 16% (peaking at 86%) and gate count reductions averaging 6% to 29% (peaking at 94%). Compared to standard state-vector simulations on a 20-qubit circuit, the MPS-based approach achieved a **24.8x speedup** in execution time and a **2.68x reduction** in memory usage, while still maintaining a 27% gate reduction under realistic noise models.

This research provides a viable, automated solution for optimizing large-scale quantum sensor circuits, a task previously considered intractable. By demonstrating the successful synergy of quantum machine learning (RL) and tensor networks (MPS), the study establishes a new paradigm for handling high-dimensional quantum simulations under hardware constraints. The ability to maximize entanglement and sensitivity while drastically reducing circuit depth and gate counts directly addresses the decoherence challenges inherent in NISQ-era devices, paving the way for the development of highly sensitive, large-scale quantum sensors.
