## Executive Summary

This paper challenges the recent trend of repurposing Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series forecasting, questioning whether their reported success represents genuine advancements in temporal reasoning or merely statistical artifacts of specific testing conditions. The problem is critical because blindly applying computationally expensive LLMs to forecasting tasks diverts resources from more efficient, dedicated solutions. The authors aim to verify if LLMs truly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) specialized models, or if their apparent performance is inflated by evaluation on small-scale benchmarks where noise masks modeling deficiencies.

Rather than proposing a new architecture, the authors introduce a theoretical loss decomposition framework to analytically compare LLMs against established SOTA models like PatchTST, DLinear, and iTransformer. The core technical innovation isolates total loss into two distinct components: an irreducible Bayesian Loss and an Approximation Loss driven by the model's "effective parameter count." Based on a "piecewise linear hypothesis," the framework reveals that performance is dictated by the ratio of model parameters to dataset size ($N/D$). It demonstrates that while LLMs possess massive total parameters, they function with very low "effective parameters" when applied to numerical time series, severely limiting their ability to capture complex patterns compared to architectures optimized for temporal data.

The study validates this theory through empirical benchmarks across variable dataset sizes, revealing distinct performance regimes. On small, noisy datasets like ETTh and ETTm, LLMs perform competitively with SOTA models because high data noise causes specialized models to overfit, effectively neutralizing their complexity advantage. However, on large-scale datasets like Traffic and Electricity, the dynamic shifts significantly. Here, specialized models such as PatchTST and DLinear consistently outperform LLMs, with relative performance improvements often exceeding 15% in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These results confirm that as data volume increases, the low effective parameter count of LLMs becomes a bottleneck, preventing them from leveraging the additional information to improve accuracy.

These findings provide a necessary theoretical counter-argument to the current hype surrounding LLMs for forecasting. The paper concludes that the superiority of LLMs in prior literature is largely a result of testing on small-data regimes where their generalizability simply prevents overfitting, rather than demonstrating superior modeling capabilities. For the technical community, this implies that specialized architectures with higher effective parameter counts remain the superior choice for serious forecasting applications. Consequently, researchers are advised to prioritize domain-specific model development over generic LLM adaptation, ensuring that efforts focus on solutions that scale effectively with data volume.

## Key Findings

*   **Artifact of Small Data:** The competitive performance of LLMs in forecasting is largely a statistical artifact resulting from evaluation on small datasets where high noise levels mask the models' inability to capture complex patterns.
*   **Effective Parameter Bottleneck:** Despite having billions of parameters, LLMs exhibit very low "effective parameter counts" when applied to time series, limiting their capacity to model temporal dynamics effectively.
*   **Dataset Size Dependency:** LLM performance degrades relative to SOTA models as dataset size increases. As $D$ (dataset size) grows, the advantage of high effective parameter counts in specialized models becomes dominant.
*   **Negative Scaling:** Increasing data volume does not yield proportional accuracy gains for LLMs in forecasting tasks, unlike specialized architectures which scale effectively with data.
*   **Resource Inefficiency:** Using computationally expensive LLMs for forecasting is often suboptimal; specialized models offer superior accuracy (often >15% improvement in MSE/MAE on large datasets) with greater efficiency.

## Methodology

> **Note:** Abstract text for specific methodology was not provided. The following is derived from the technical analysis of the paper's approach.

The study utilizes a theoretical approach rather than proposing a new neural architecture. The authors developed a loss decomposition framework to analytically compare the theoretical upper bounds of LLMs against SOTA time series models.

*   **Framework:** A theoretical loss decomposition framework dividing total error into irreducible components and model-dependent components.
*   **Hypothesis:** The analysis relies on a "piecewise linear hypothesis," which assumes models divide the intrinsic space into subregions for linear predictions.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** The authors benchmark LLMs against established SOTA models (specifically PatchTST, DLinear, and iTransformer) across datasets of varying sizes to validate theoretical predictions.

## Technical Details

The paper establishes a rigorous mathematical definition of model performance in time series forecasting through the following components:

### Loss Decomposition Framework
The total loss ($L$) is decomposed into two distinct parts:
1.  **Bayesian Loss ($L_{Bayesian}$):** An irreducible loss defined by a specific formula. It is independent of both the model size and the dataset size.
2.  **Approximation Loss ($L_{approx}$):** A variable loss component that relies on the model's architecture and capacity.

### Piecewise Linear Hypothesis
The Approximation Loss is governed by the "piecewise linear hypothesis." This assumes:
*   The model divides the intrinsic space into $N$ subregions to generate linear predictions.
*   The variable $N$ corresponds to the model's parameter count (specifically, the effective parameter count).

### Dynamics of Total Loss
The interplay between model capacity and data availability is expressed through the $N/D$ ratio:
*   **Total Loss Dynamics:** The loss includes a term scaling with $N/D$ (Model Parameter Count / Dataset Size).
*   **Implication:** This relationship mathematically demonstrates why models with high effective parameters ($N$) require sufficiently large datasets ($D$) to outperform models with lower $N$.

## Results

Experimental behavior is explained through the relationship between dataset size ($D$) and model parameters ($N$):

### Regime 1: Small Datasets (e.g., ETTh, ETTm)
*   **Condition:** High $N/D$ ratio.
*   **Outcome:** The loss is dominated by data noise.
*   **Performance:** Specialized SOTA models suffer significantly from overfitting due to the noise. LLMs, due to their generalizability and lower effective parameter utilization in this context, suffer less.
*   **Conclusion:** LLMs show comparable or better performance than SOTA models, but this is attributed to noise masking rather than modeling superiority.

### Regime 2: Large Datasets (e.g., Traffic, Electricity)
*   **Condition:** As $D$ increases, the noise term diminishes (lower $N/D$ ratio).
*   **Outcome:** The effective parameter count ($N$) becomes the dominant factor in loss reduction.
*   **Performance:** LLMs, possessing fewer effective parameters for this task, show increased relative loss. Specialized SOTA models leverage their higher effective parameter counts to capture complex patterns.
*   **Conclusion:** Performance drops for LLMs relative to SOTA. Specialized models often see relative performance improvements exceeding 15% in MSE and MAE.
