## Executive Summary

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising avenue for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, yet their deployment on resource-constrained hardware is hindered by a persistent efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Traditional weight quantization methods, often necessary to reduce memory footprints, typically result in substantial accuracy degradation, creating a barrier to practical application. This paper addresses this critical challenge by seeking a method to drastically reduce model precision and energy consumption without sacrificing the high accuracy required for complex tasks.

The authors introduce **Temporal-adaptive Weight Quantization (TaWQ)**, a bio-inspired framework grounded in the concept of astrocyte-mediated synaptic modulation found in biological nervous systems. Technically, the method innovates by integrating weight quantization directly into the temporal dynamics of SNNs rather than relying on static values. It employs a 1.58-bit weight representation and utilizes addition-based operations (+1, -1) to enable the adaptive allocation of weights along the temporal dimension, optimizing resource usage while maintaining synaptic efficacy.

Experimental results verified on both static datasets (ImageNet) and neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR10-DVS) demonstrate that TaWQ effectively resolves the tension between efficiency and precision. On ImageNet, the method achieves a negligible accuracy loss of only 0.22% compared to full-precision baselines, consistently outperforming 8-bit Post-Training Quantization. Hardware implementation on a 910 NPU validated these computational gains, recording specific energy efficiency metrics of 4.12M operations/parameters and energy consumption of 0.63mJ.

This research significantly advances the state-of-the-art for low-power neuromorphic computing by providing empirical evidence that ultra-low-bit quantization is feasible for large-scale, complex classification tasks. By proving that high-performance SNNs can operate with minimal energy overhead and near-lossless accuracy, TaWQ establishes a viable pathway for deploying sophisticated neuromorphic systems on edge devices, setting a new benchmark for future hardware design.
