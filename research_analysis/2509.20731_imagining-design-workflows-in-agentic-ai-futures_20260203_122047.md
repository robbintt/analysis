> ### Executive Summary
>
> This research addresses the emerging challenge of integrating **Agentic AI**—systems capable of autonomous, goal-oriented action—into professional design workflows. As the paradigm shifts from simple prompt-driven interactions to complex collaborations with autonomous agents, a critical gap exists in understanding how to effectively communicate designer intent and divide authority. The paper highlights the risks of blurring lines between human creativity and machine autonomy, emphasizing the need for structured approaches to manage these interactions to ensure that AI augments rather than overshadows human design agency.
>
> The study introduces a novel approach using Design Fiction methodology, engaging ten professional designers to visualize collaboration with a speculative agentic AI platform named **'Idy'** within an environment called **'I-space.'** Technically, the proposed architecture transitions from prompt-based commands to goal-oriented execution, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable autonomous, context-sensitive operations. The study protocol utilized 'Flip-Flap story cards' to help participants articulate and visualize tasks during the Inspiration and Ideation phases (Discover and Define stages of the Double Diamond framework), supporting multimodal inputs beyond simple text.
>
> While the provided text does not contain quantitative metrics, the study synthesized qualitative insights into a robust conceptual framework for distributing authority between humans and AI. The primary outcomes include the identification of specific support roles AI agents can fulfill and the revelation of nuanced methods for explaining designer intent that go beyond standard prompting. Furthermore, the results delineate the complexities inherent in the division of authority, providing a categorized understanding of how control can be shared or delegated during the creative process.
>
> The significance of this work lies in its provision of a theoretical and practical roadmap for the future of human-AI co-creation in design. By establishing a framework for authority distribution, the authors offer actionable guidelines for developers and designers to implement agentic AI systems that respect human autonomy while maximizing utility. This research influences the field by moving the conversation from "how to prompt" to "how to collaborate," setting the stage for next-generation design tools that are context-aware and capable of handling high-level creative goals.
