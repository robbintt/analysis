## 📝 Executive Summary

> **Overview**
> The research addresses the critical fragmentation of scholarly information, a structural barrier that severely impedes scientific reproducibility and resource discovery. Current infrastructure relies on isolated silos housing single artifact types and unstructured formats like PDFs. This document-centric legacy approach results in the loss of dependency links between research entities—such as publications, data, software, and authors—rendering scientific outputs difficult for machines to interpret, link, and reuse effectively.

> **The Solution**
> The key innovation is the first formal conceptualization of Research Knowledge Graphs (RKGs) as a mechanism to replace isolated silos with interconnected knowledge networks. Technically, RKGs leverage graph-based databases (RDF triples and Property Graphs) combined with globally unique Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) and standardized vocabularies to ensure semantic interoperability.

> **Methodology & Analysis**
> The authors define the construction methodology for RKGs as a fundamental shift from document- to data-centric representation, utilizing interfaces like GraphQL to ensure machine-actionability. Applying a newly established 5-dimensional evaluation framework—comprising Data Quality, Schema Changes, Data Growth, Vocabulary Reuse, and Graph Inter-connectedness—the authors conducted a detailed survey of implementations including OpenAlex, Microsoft Academic Graph, OpenAIRE, and SciGraph.

> **Outcomes**
> The study corrects previous classification errors by introducing a specific 5-category taxonomy. Survey results mapped specific implementations to this taxonomy and revealed significant scale disparities; large-scale graphs like Microsoft Academic Graph and OpenAlex contain hundreds of millions of nodes, whereas domain-specific graphs prioritize semantic depth over volume. This work represents a paradigm shift toward machine-actionable research artifacts, providing the foundational framework necessary to transition from static literature to dynamic knowledge networks.
