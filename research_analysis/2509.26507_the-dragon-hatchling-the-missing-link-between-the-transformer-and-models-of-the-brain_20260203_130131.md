## Executive Summary

> This research addresses the fundamental disconnect between state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and biological models of the brain. While Transformers have achieved dominance in natural language processing, they rely on biologically implausible mechanisms, such as static weight matrices and backpropagation through time (BPTT), which renders their internal states opaque and difficult to interpret. Conversely, biologically plausible models typically fail to scale effectively or match the computational performance of modern deep learning systems. This paper aims to resolve this dichotomy by constructing an architecture that does not force a trade-off between biological fidelity and high-performance language modeling.

The authors introduce the **"Brain-Dragon Hatchling" (BDH)**, a Large Language Model architecture defined as a scale-free graph of locally interacting neuron particles, moving away from standard matrix multiplication operations. Functionally, BDH is designed as an attention-based state space sequence learner where working memory is handled entirely through synaptic plasticity and Hebbian learning via spiking neurons. The model utilizes a local edge-reweighting process to update connections dynamically, rather than relying solely on global weight updates. To bridge the gap between theoretical graph dynamics and practical application, the researchers developed BDH-GPU, a reformulation that preserves these biological properties while optimizing the system for efficient execution on GPU hardware.

Empirically, BDH demonstrates performance parity with GPT-2 on both language modeling and translation tasks across parameter scales ranging from 10 million to 1 billion. Despite its novel architecture, the model exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws when trained on identical datasets. Internal analysis of the network revealed structural properties mirroring biological brains, including high modularity and a heavy-tailed degree distribution. Furthermore, the model displayed inherent "state interpretability," characterized by monosemantic features and sparse, positive activation vectors, with specific synapses empirically strengthening in direct correlation with specific concepts during processing.

This work establishes a scalable "missing link" between high-performance AI and theoretical neuroscience, challenging the assumption that biologically plausible mechanisms cannot scale to state-of-the-art performance levels. By proving that synaptic plasticity and scale-free topology can support complex reasoning and speech, BDH provides a concrete theoretical model for how biological neural networks might achieve similar cognitive feats. The research also advances the field of explainable AI by introducing a framework for "state interpretability," demonstrating that it is possible to engineer models with transparent internal states without sacrificing computational power. Additionally, the model's ability to train without BPTT and support model merging suggests new, more efficient pathways for training future large language models.

## Key Findings

*   **Performance Parity:** BDH empirically rivals GPT-2 performance on language and translation tasks across parameter scales ranging from 10M to 1B, exhibiting Transformer-like scaling laws while using the same training data.
*   **Biological Plausibility:** The model’s working memory relies entirely on synaptic plasticity and Hebbian learning via spiking neurons, with empirical evidence showing specific synapses strengthening corresponding to specific concepts during processing.
*   **Inherent Interpretability:** BDH demonstrates monosemanticity and features sparse, positive activation vectors, allowing for the interpretation of internal states rather than just model parameters.

## Methodology

The researchers developed **"Dragon Hatchling" (BDH)**, a Large Language Model architecture constructed as a scale-free, biologically inspired graph consisting of *n* locally-interacting neuron particles. Functionally, BDH is designed as an attention-based state space sequence learning architecture.

Despite being a graph model, it is formulated to be GPU-friendly for practical execution. The methodology explicitly moves away from standard weight-only updates, utilizing **spiking neurons** and **Hebbian learning** (synaptic plasticity) to handle working memory and inference.
