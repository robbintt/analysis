## 📝 Executive Summary

> The research addresses the critical challenge of efficiently deploying massive Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically architectures containing hundreds of billions of parameters. As state-of-the-art models scale, the computational and memory resources required for inference become prohibitive. While quantization is a standard technique for reducing model size, existing Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods require expensive retraining or fine-tuning, rendering them impractical for models at the 100B+ parameter scale. Consequently, there is a pressing need for post-training compression strategies that are computationally efficient and capable of maintaining high accuracy without access to original training data or gradient updates.
>
> The paper introduces **"Radio,"** a novel technique grounded in Rate-Distortion (R-D) theory, traditionally used in signal processing to balance bit rate against signal fidelity. The authors formulate LLM quantization as a constrained optimization problem that minimizes the Rate-Distortion Lagrangian, defined as $J = D(x, \hat{x}) + \lambda \cdot R(\hat{x})$, where $D$ represents distortion (reconstruction error) and $R$ represents the bit-rate (model size). Unlike gradient-based methods, Radio operates post-training using iterative algorithms like coordinate descent, eliminating the need for backpropagation. A key technical feature is its support for bi-directional constraints, allowing users to specify either a target model size or a target accuracy level, with the optimization process automatically tuning the compression to satisfy that exact metric.

> Radio demonstrates scalability to architectures with hundreds of billions of parameters, offering significantly lower computational costs compared to Quantization-Aware Training. The method achieves aggressive compression, operating at 3-bit and 4-bit precision while maintaining perplexity (PPL) close to FP16 baselines. Benchmark testing indicates that Radio preserves performance on complex tasks such as MMLU and CommonSenseQA, outperforming prominent post-training quantization methods like GPTQ and AWQ. Furthermore, the method exhibits a monotonic Pareto frontier, proving it can strictly adhere to user-defined constraints without the instability often associated with manual compression tuning.
