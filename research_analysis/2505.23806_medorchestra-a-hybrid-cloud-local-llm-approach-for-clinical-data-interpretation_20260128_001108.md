## Executive Summary

The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in clinical environments is constrained by a critical conflict between the need for advanced reasoning and the imperative of data privacy. Cloud-hosted LLMs offer the sophistication necessary for complex diagnostic tasks requiring deep contextual understanding, but transmitting Protected Health Information (PHI) to external APIs violates strict healthcare regulations and patient confidentiality standards. Conversely, local LLMs ensure data sovereignty by keeping sensitive information on-premise but often suffer from reduced parameter scales and inferior reasoning capabilities compared to their cloud counterparts.

The authors introduce **MedOrchestra**, a Hybrid Cloud-Local architecture that utilizes a "Planner-Executor" framework to decouple logical reasoning from sensitive data inference.

*   **The Problem:** Bridging the gap between high-level reasoning and data privacy without exposing raw patient data.
*   **The Solution:** A proprietary Cloud LLM (e.g., Gemini) functions as the **Planner**, accessing clinical guidelines (such as NCCN) to decompose complex diagnostic queries without accessing patient data. A Local LLM (e.g., Gemma) acts as the **Executor**, running on-premise to process sensitive radiology reports.
*   **The Outcome:** In a pilot study on pancreatic cancer staging, the system outperformed both standalone local models and human specialists. This research provides a technical proof-of-concept for distributed clinical AI, offering empirical evidence that privacy-preserving local deployment does not require a sacrifice in diagnostic reasoning.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Performance on Unstructured Data:** MedOrchestra achieved **70.21% accuracy** on free-text radiology reports, significantly outperforming local model baselines.
*   **High Precision on Structured Data:** The framework reached **85.42% accuracy** on structured reports.
*   **Outperforming Human Experts:** In specific diagnostic tasks, the system matched or exceeded the performance of medical specialists, including gastroenterologists, surgeons, and radiologists.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Architecture:** The system successfully maintains the privacy of sensitive clinical data by processing critical information locally (on-premise) without sacrificing the reasoning capabilities of large cloud-based models.

---

## Methodology

The study utilized a **Hybrid Cloud-Local Architecture** designed to separate guideline reasoning from data inference.

*   **Architecture:** A dual-model approach involving a Cloud LLM and a Local LLM.
*   **Process Flow:**
    1.  The **Cloud LLM** acts as an *Orchestrator*. It decomposes complex tasks and generates prompts using clinical guidelines and synthetic test cases. Crucially, it performs these steps **without accessing sensitive data**.
    2.  The **Local LLM** acts as an *Executor*. It takes the strategy from the cloud and processes subtasks directly on private clinical data, synthesizing the outputs locally.
*   **Evaluation:** The system was evaluated on pancreatic cancer staging using a dataset of **100 radiology reports**, benchmarked against NCCN guidelines.

### Operational Phases

*   **Phase 1 (Cloud-Based):**
    *   Input formalization.
    *   Decomposition of complex queries into manageable subtasks.
    *   Synthetic validation of prompts.
