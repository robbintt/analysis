## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical deployment bottleneck of Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained hardware, specifically Nvidia T4 GPUs, where memory bandwidth and compute capacity are strictly limited. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces memory footprints to 4-bit, it typically incurs significant performance degradation. Conversely, 16-bit full-parameter fine-tuning preserves model accuracy but is computationally prohibitive for production environments. The paper investigates whether a hybrid approach can maintain the fidelity of full-precision models while adhering to the efficiency constraints of 4-bit quantization, specifically aiming to close the quality gap between compressed and full-parameter baselines.

The authors propose a cohesive three-stage hybrid pipeline integrating 4-bit PTQ with QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapters). The process begins with full-parameter 16-bit Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on base models, followed by 4-bit PTQ using algorithms such as bitsandbytes and GPTQ. The core technical innovation is the third stage: applying QLoRA fine-tuning directly to the quantized model, allowing low-rank adapters to recover performance lost during compression.

Empirical testing across a mix of proprietary datasets (General Instruction, Call Purpose, Call Outcome) and public benchmarks (DialogSum, Banking77, bitext_customer_support) provided concrete evidence of the method's efficacy. Notably, the PTQ-QLoRA integration consistently outperformed standard PTQ methods and achieved performance parity with 16-bit full-parameter fine-tuning. In specific scenarios, the hybrid 4-bit approach surpassed the performance of the computationally expensive 16-bit baselines, maintaining high generation quality despite aggressive compression.
