## Executive Summary

Subjectivity and inconsistency in psychiatric diagnostics create significant barriers to reliable patient care, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This research addresses these limitations by investigating automated decision support systems capable of mitigating human bias and delivering consistent, evidence-based assessments derived directly from psychiatrist-patient dialogue data.

The study introduces a hybrid, dual-layer architecture combining a consortium of fine-tuned LLM agents with a distinct reasoning layer powered by the OpenAI-gpt-oss variant. The technical implementation utilizes the Unsloth library and Tesla GPUs, employing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with QLoRA at 4-bit precision to optimize the system for consumer-grade hardware.

To address diagnostic subjectivity, the architecture implements a novel orchestration method alongside a consensus mechanism and aggregation layer, which refines initial predictions for logical consistency. Evaluations confirmed that the system achieves high diagnostic accuracy based on natural language inputs, effectively standardizing outputs through the integrated consensus mechanism. While specific percentage-based accuracy scores were not detailed in the text, the study demonstrated significant hardware efficiency by successfully running the computationally intensive pipeline on accessible hardware configurations via QLoRA. Furthermore, a functional prototype was operationally validated through collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team.

This work establishes a technical precedent as the first application of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis. By introducing a responsible AI framework through orchestrated agent workflows, the research provides a blueprint for transparency in healthcare tools. The successful validation sets the engineering foundation for next-generation eHealth systems designed to reduce diagnostic bias in both civilian and military settings.
