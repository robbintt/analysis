## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
This research addresses the critical gap between academic Natural Language Processing benchmarks and the messy reality of industrial deployment. While existing research focuses on static datasets, real-world dialogue summarization involves multi-party interactions, evolving stakeholder requirements, and subjective definitions of quality. The authors highlight that practitioners face significant hurdles, including the inability of static evaluation metrics to capture nuanced user needs, upstream data bottlenecks that constrain development, and poor prompt transferability across Large Language Models (LLMs), which leads to vendor lock-in and complicates system maintenance.

### **Innovation**
The core innovation is a decomposed, multi-agent architecture designed for a full development lifecycle, moving away from monolithic prompting strategies. Technically, the system utilizes **Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct** within a pipeline that includes ASR & Anonymization, a Drafting Stage, a Revision Loop, and a Refinement phase. Crucially, the authors employ **Parallel Evaluation Agents**—specific for Accuracy, Completeness, and Readability—to critique and refine outputs iteratively. The optimization strategy avoids expensive Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL); instead, it relies on prompt engineering with in-context examples and "component-wise optimization" using a gold dataset of only 50 summaries, allowing for granular adjustments without retraining the base model.

### **Results**
In head-to-head comparisons, the agentic system significantly outperformed monolithic baselines. Human preference metrics showed the Agentic system winning **59%** of the time compared to the Monolithic system's **23%**, with 18% ties. When measured against gold summaries, the Agentic v5 achieved a **53%** preference rate versus 36% for the Monolithic approach. An ablation study quantified the value of specific components, with the full system achieving an Accuracy score of 4.48 (±0.03), Completeness of 3.68 (±0.06), and Readability of 4.7 (±0.02). The study also revealed architectural trade-offs; for instance, removing the Readability Evaluator slightly increased Accuracy and Completeness but caused a corresponding drop in Readability. Additionally, the optimization process reduced an initial hallucination rate of approximately 10%.

### **Impact**
This paper provides a vital framework for bridging the research-practice divide by offering a "lifecycle approach" to building reliable summarization systems. Its significance lies in demonstrating that high-performance, adaptable systems can be built using prompt engineering and agentic workflows rather than resource-intensive fine-tuning. For the field, this work highlights urgent areas for future research, particularly the need for dynamic evaluation protocols that accommodate subjectivity and the importance of prompt interoperability to mitigate vendor lock-in. It serves as a practical guide for engineers aiming to deploy robust NLP solutions in dynamic production environments where requirements and data are constantly shifting.
