## Executive Summary

### Problem
This research addresses the performance gap of Large Language Models (LLMs) in low-resource languages, specifically focusing on Vietnamese Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). While LLMs have dominated high-resource language benchmarks, their efficacy in Vietnamese remains under-explored, often leading to a reliance on older, monolingual BERT-based architectures like PhoBERT. This gap is critical because it limits the accessibility of state-of-the-art NLP capabilities for Vietnamese speakers and obscures whether modern, efficient adaptation methods can successfully port the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to linguistically distinct, low-resource environments.

### Innovation
The core innovation of this paper is the application of **Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA)** to efficiently fine-tune modern open-weights LLMs—specifically Llama 3 (8B) and Gemma (7B)—for the Vietnamese MRC task. By utilizing QLoRA with 4-bit precision, the authors demonstrate that these large models can be adapted on standard hardware with significantly reduced memory footprints. This approach is contrasted against two distinct evaluation strategies: full fine-tuning of the open-source models versus zero-shot/few-shot prompting of proprietary large models (GPT-3 and GPT-3.5), providing a comprehensive comparison between specialized adaptation and general-purpose inference.

### Results
The study provides quantitative evidence that fine-tuned smaller models outperform both traditional architectures and massive proprietary models. On the ViMMRC dataset, the QLoRA-fine-tuned Llama 3 (8B) achieved state-of-the-art results:
*   **Exact Match (EM):** 86.8%
*   **F1 Score:** 94.4%

This significantly surpasses the traditional monolingual baseline, PhoBERT (EM: 80.4%), and multilingual baselines like XLM-R. Furthermore, the specialized Llama 3 model outperformed GPT-3.5, which achieved an EM of only **59.4%** under a prompt-based evaluation setting. These results confirm that efficient fine-tuning of 7B–8B parameter models yields superior comprehension compared to non-specialized, significantly larger LLMs.

### Impact
The significance of this research lies in validating a cost-effective, high-performance pathway for deploying LLMs in low-resource languages. By proving that smaller, open-weights models can be fine-tuned to exceed the performance of massive proprietary systems and established BERT-based baselines, the authors offer a practical blueprint for resource-constrained environments. The public release of these fine-tuned models lowers the barrier to entry for Vietnamese NLP applications and encourages the adoption of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFT) like QLoRA for other under-represented languages.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Performance:** Fine-tuned Llama 3 (8B) and Gemma (7B) outperformed traditional BERT-based approaches on the ViMMRC dataset.
*   **Efficiency Over Scale:** Despite having significantly fewer parameters, the fine-tuned models surpassed the performance of larger LLMs, specifically GPT-3 and GPT-3.5.
*   **QLoRA Validation:** The study validates Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) as an efficient method for adapting LLMs to low-resource languages without sacrificing performance.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Results demonstrate that modern LLMs can be optimized to offer high performance while remaining suitable for resource-constrained environments.

## Methodology

The researchers utilized a fine-tuning evaluation framework centered on the **ViMMRC** (Vietnamese Machine Reading Comprehension) dataset. The study employed the following approach:

1.  **Adaptation Technique:** Utilization of Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) to efficiently fine-tune open-source models.
2.  **Model Selection:** Two state-of-the-art open-weights models were selected: **Llama 3 (8B parameters)** and **Gemma (7B parameters)**.
3.  **Benchmarking:** Performance was rigorously benchmarked against two categories of baselines:
    *   Traditional BERT-based architectures.
    *   Larger LLMs (GPT-3 and GPT-3.5).
