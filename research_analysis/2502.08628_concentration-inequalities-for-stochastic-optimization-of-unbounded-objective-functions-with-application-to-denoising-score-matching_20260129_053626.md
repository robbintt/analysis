## Executive Summary

> This paper addresses a fundamental gap in statistical learning theory: the reliance on restrictive boundedness assumptions in classical concentration inequalities and Uniform Laws of Large Numbers (ULLN). Standard results, such as McDiarmid’s inequality, generally require objective functions to have bounded support, a condition frequently violated by modern machine learning techniques that utilize auxiliary random variables.

> **The Problem:** This limitation is particularly acute for Denoising Score Matching (DSM) and diffusion models, where the introduction of noise variables creates objective functions with unbounded support, leaving a lack of rigorous statistical guarantees for these widely used methods.
>
> **The Solution:** The author introduces a rigorous theoretical framework to handle unboundedness by establishing a generalized McDiarmid’s inequality based on sample-dependent one-component mean-difference bounds and Orlicz norms. Rather than relying on global uniform constants, the framework exploits square-integrable, sample-dependent Lipschitz properties to control function variations.
>
> **The Impact:** This approach allows for the derivation of a sample-dependent Rademacher complexity, extending the ULLN to function families satisfying specific moment conditions. The research yields specific mathematical bounds, demonstrating that standard convergence rates are maintained even when score models are unbounded, thereby removing the need for artificial truncation or projection techniques. Furthermore, by quantifying the interaction between dataset sizes in sample-reuse formulations, the work offers valuable insights into the design of algorithms that utilize auxiliary random variables.

## Key Findings

The research presents several significant advancements in the understanding of stochastic optimization for unbounded functions:

*   **Novel Concentration Inequalities:** Derivation of new concentration inequalities that effectively bound statistical errors in stochastic optimization problems specifically for unbounded objective functions.
*   **Uniform Law of Large Numbers (ULLN):** Establishment of a novel ULLN result for unbounded functions, achieved through a new form of McDiarmid's inequality based on sample-dependent one-component mean-difference bounds.
*   **Rademacher Complexity Bounds:** A new bound on Rademacher complexity for function families satisfying a sample-dependent Lipschitz property, enabling analysis of distributions with unbounded support.
*   **Application to DSM:** Application of the theoretical framework to provide statistical error bounds for Denoising Score Matching (DSM), which inherently involves unbounded supports due to auxiliary noise variables.
*   **Sample-Reuse Quantification:** Quantification of the statistical benefits associated with sample-reuse in algorithms that utilize easily-sampled auxiliary random variables alongside training data.

## Methodology

The research methodology relies on extending fundamental statistical learning theory tools to handle unboundedness through the following steps:

1.  **Modified McDiarmid’s Inequality:** The authors develop a modified version of McDiarmid’s inequality utilizing sample-dependent one-component mean-difference bounds to establish uniform convergence.
2.  **Generalized Rademacher Analysis:** They generalize Rademacher complexity analysis by introducing a sample-dependent Lipschitz property for function families, allowing the handling of distributions with unbounded support.
3.  **Application to DSM:** These two theoretical pillars are then applied to the specific mechanism of Denoising Score Matching (DSM). In this context, the introduction of auxiliary Gaussian random variables transforms the problem into one requiring unbounded analysis.

## Technical Details

The paper presents a theoretical framework for stochastic optimization involving unbounded objective functions and distributions with unbounded support. The architecture relies on three main components:

*   **Generalized McDiarmid’s Inequality**
    *   Uses non-constant, sample-dependent bounds.
    *   Utilizes Orlicz norms to analyze unbounded settings.

*   **Sample-Dependent Rademacher Complexity**
    *   Relies on square-integrable, sample-dependent Lipschitz constants.
    *   Replaces the need for global uniform bounds.

*   **Sample-Reuse Formulation**
    *   Optimizes objectives of the form `g_θ(X, Y)`.
    *   Handles unequal sample sizes (`n` for `X`, `m` for `Y`).
    *   Directly applicable to Denoising Score Matching and GANs.

These components combine to form a Uniform Law of Large Numbers bounding the deviation between empirical and true risks.

## Results

The paper provides theoretical mathematical bounds and convergence rates rather than numerical experimental results:

*   **Rademacher Complexity:** A bound of `32√(k/n)` for parameter sets that are unit balls in `ℝ^k`.
*   **Statistical Error Rate:** Scaling as `O(n^{-1/2})`.
*   **Tail Bounds:** Derivation of specific tail bounds for Sub-Gaussian and Sub-Exponential (Bernstein-type) cases.
*   **Optimization Error:** Bounds established for excess risk and `L1` error under heavy-tailed distributions.
*   **Qualitative Superiority:** The approach demonstrates superiority over prior art by handling unbounded supports directly and allowing unbounded score models in Denoising Score Matching without requiring truncation.
