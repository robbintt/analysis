## Executive Summary

**Problem**
The report addresses the fragmented global understanding of the capabilities, risks, and safety mechanisms associated with advanced AI systems. As general-purpose AI evolves rapidly—demonstrating accelerated progress in complex domains—there is a critical disconnect between the pace of technical research and the capacity of governments, industry, and civil society to process and act on it. This information gap impedes effective governance and prevents the alignment of international standards necessary to mitigate both immediate and catastrophic risks. The urgency of this problem is highlighted by a formal mandate from nations at the AI Safety Summit in **Bletchley, UK**, underscoring the need for a unified scientific evidence base to support high-stakes policy decisions.

**Innovation**
The key innovation is the establishment of a rigorous, consensus-based scientific synthesis model designed to isolate objective technical assessment from political agendas. The initiative was led by Chair Yoshua Bengio and Scientific Lead Sören Mindermann, supported by a writing group of over 30 researchers. The methodology utilized a multi-stakeholder nomination process involving 30 nations and major international bodies (UN, OECD, EU) but uniquely granted the Expert Advisory Panel full discretion over the final content, ensuring scientific independence. This structure was bolstered by a review ecosystem involving 19 civil society organizations and 13 major AI labs, effectively synthesizing diverse disciplinary perspectives into a single, coherent framework.

**Results**
The report successfully aggregated evidence from a cohort of 100 experts to produce a comprehensive seven-chapter assessment delivered across two phases: an Interim Report (May 2024) and a Full Report (February 2025). Rather than presenting raw benchmark scores, the synthesis offers qualitative conclusions regarding technical progress, finding that recently released models exhibit markedly better performance in tests of programming and scientific reasoning since late 2023. The project consolidated insights from 30 participating nations and three international bodies, establishing the first global synthesis of the current state of AI capabilities and risks.

**Impact**
This report serves as a foundational framework for the emerging field of international AI governance, establishing a viable model for large-scale scientific collaboration on high-stakes technologies. By unifying disparate technical and policy viewpoints, it aids in the alignment of global understanding regarding AI safety and sets a precedent for preserving scientific independence within politically charged environments. Its significance lies in moving the discourse from theoretical speculation to evidence-based policymaking, providing the standardized grounding required for nations and international bodies to effectively evaluate and manage the risks of advanced AI systems.

*   **High-Level Political Mandate:** The initiative is driven by a formal mandate from nations attending the AI Safety Summit in Bletchley, UK, signaling high-level political prioritization.
*   **Diverse Expert Cohort:** The report aggregates insights from a large cohort of 100 AI experts, ensuring a representation of diverse perspectives and disciplines.
*   **Scientific Independence:** Experts retained full discretion over the report's content, ensuring scientific independence despite being nominated by 30 nations and major international bodies.

---

## Methodology

The research utilized a robust collaborative synthesis framework to ensure objectivity and comprehensiveness:

*   **Leadership Structure:** The process was led by a Chair and an Expert Advisory Panel.
*   **Multi-Stakeholder Selection:** Panelists were selected through a nomination process involving 30 nations, the United Nations (UN), the OECD, and the EU.
*   **Separation of Powers:** The design explicitly separated political influence from technical assessment by granting the expert group full discretion over the final content.
