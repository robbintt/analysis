## Executive Summary

> **Overview**
> The paper addresses the fundamental challenge of understanding and replicating the mechanisms by which intelligent agents compose complex behaviors from simpler sub-policies. Specifically, it tackles the lack of a principled connection between high-level task structures, the algorithmic gating mechanisms required to select appropriate policies, and the biological neural architectures that implement them. This gap hinders the development of AI systems that can offer interpretable decision-making processes and limits the accuracy of computational models in explaining human and multi-agent collective behavior.

> **Core Innovation**
> The core innovation is the introduction of **GateMod**, a normative framework (GateFrame) that formulates policy gating as a free energy minimization problem. From this foundation, the authors derive **GateFlow**, a continuous-time, energy-based dynamic proven to achieve global and exponential convergence through contractivity analysis. To bridge the gap to biological implementation, the researchers translate these dynamics into **GateNet**, a soft-competitive recurrent neural network. This architecture leverages entropy-regularized minimization within the probability simplex and utilizes a differentiable Softmax approximation, relying on specific translation invariance properties to ensure robust optimization.

> **Evaluation & Impact**
> Evaluations using hierarchical Bayesian model selection and the PXP metric—which quantifies the probability that a model is the most frequent process generating the data—demonstrated that GateMod significantly outperformed established baselines. In multi-agent collective behavior simulations and human decision-making tasks (Experiments 1 and 2), GateMod achieved a higher PXP than the Hybrid Model and robustly surpassed standard approaches like UCB and Thompson Sampling. Furthermore, behavioral analysis of the network's weights revealed distinct, interpretable patterns across trials (recording specific values such as 0.19 and 0.81), suggesting the model successfully encodes a "mental schema" of the task structure.

> This work significantly advances the field by successfully bridging the behavioral, algorithmic, and implementational levels of analysis. It provides a mathematically rigorous account of how task structure shapes gating computations while maintaining biological feasibility.
