## Executive Summary

This research addresses the problematic conflation of AI security and safety, arguing that safety guarantees are inherently unstable without a secure underlying system. The paper emphasizes that current development approaches often treat security as an afterthought, which fundamentally compromises the integrity of model alignment and trustworthiness. By highlighting the systemic risks of this oversight, the work establishes that a rigorous separation of concerns is necessary to prevent foundational vulnerabilities from undermining higher-level safety objectives.

The core innovation is a **"Security-First" hierarchical framework** that formally delineates security from safety, positioning system security as the technical prerequisite for safety, alignment, transparency, and accountability. Rather than using ad-hoc measures, this framework mandates end-to-end security integration across the entire AI lifecycle—from data collection to deployment—categorizing threat models into white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios. To operationalize this paradigm, the authors propose a metric-driven standardization process, advocating for the use of quantifiable benchmarks to rigorously assess system robustness and defense mechanisms.

As a conceptual manuscript, the work does not present quantitative experimental results or performance metrics derived from empirical testing. Instead, its primary contribution is a comprehensive qualitative analysis grounded in a review of 36 citations, validating the framework through the categorization of specific attack vectors—such as data poisoning and model inversion—and corresponding defenses like adversarial training and differential privacy. The resulting "results" are a synthesized architectural blueprint that maps technical mitigations to distinct lifecycle phases.

The impact of this research lies in its potential to fundamentally reshape AI development roadmaps by establishing a "security-first" mindset and a metric-driven methodology for evaluating system integrity. By explicitly defining security as a requirement for achieving transparency and accountability, the paper provides the technical community with a clear standard for validating whether a system is sufficiently robust to undergo safety alignment.
