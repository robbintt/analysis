## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical theoretical challenge of characterizing the dynamics of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in high-dimensional nonlinear neural networks, specifically within the **"feature learning" regime**. While existing literature has extensively analyzed linear models and the lazy training limit of nonlinear networks, the behavior of SGD when it actively learns features in high dimensions remains poorly understood. The authors aim to bridge this gap by rigorously analyzing optimization trajectories, generalization error, and sample complexity in a setting where the model dimensionality and training data scale proportionally—a scenario highly relevant to modern deep learning practice but mathematically intractable for most architectures.

The key innovation is the precise characterization of training dynamics through a **Matrix Riccati Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)** applied to a two-layer network with a quadratic activation function (2nd Hermite polynomial) under isotropic Gaussian inputs. The authors introduce a novel **"matrix monotonicity comparison framework,"** which allows them to establish rigorous convergence guarantees for both the continuous population limit and the discrete finite-sample (online) setting. This technical machinery enables the analysis of "extensive-width" scaling regimes—where network rank scales with dimensionality ($r \asymp d^\beta$)—and accommodates power-law decaying signal structures ($\lambda_j \asymp j^{-\alpha}$), providing a granular view of the optimization process that standard kernel methods cannot capture.

The study yields explicit scaling laws for prediction risk, demonstrating that the population Mean Squared Error (MSE) follows a distinct power-law decay relative to optimization time, defined as $L \sim t^{-C(\alpha)}$, where the rate depends on the signal's spectral decay. The authors prove that this decay results from **"sequential feature recovery,"** where the network learns orthogonal signal directions one by one. Furthermore, they establish sample complexity bounds that improve upon prior work and match information-theoretic limits up to polylogarithmic factors. Empirical validation using large-scale simulations ($d=3200$, teacher width $r=2400$, decay $\alpha=1$) confirmed the theoretical predictions, showing the predicted power-law decay in loss over compute time.

This work significantly advances the theoretical understanding of high-dimensional optimization by offering one of the first rigorous analyses of feature learning for nonlinear networks beyond the kernel regime. It substantiates the implicit bias of SGD, showing how it naturally prioritizes features based on signal strength. By successfully connecting the continuous population limit with discrete online SGD dynamics, the paper provides a more complete and realistic picture of training performance. These findings lay the groundwork for future theoretical analysis of more complex architectures and offer practitioners deeper insights into how model width, optimization time, and data structure interact to govern generalization.
