## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER) is critical for extracting structured insights from unstructured clinical texts, yet it remains technically challenging due to the linguistic complexity of biomedical data. Existing methodologies struggle to simultaneously address nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual generalization. Because these issues are typically treated in isolation, current models lack the robustness required for real-world deployment across diverse, multilingual, and structurally complex corpora.

**Innovation**
The researchers propose a unified framework that reformulates BioNER as a text generation task using Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the simultaneous processing of flat and nested entities. To address boundary ambiguity, the authors introduce a **"Symbolic Tagging"** strategy that provides explicit boundary annotations within the generative paradigm. The architecture enhances multilingual versatility through **Bilingual Joint Fine-tuning** across Chinese and English datasets, facilitating cross-lingual transfer without architectural changes. Furthermore, a **Contrastive Learning-based Entity Selector** is implemented to filter predictions, utilizing boundary-sensitive samples to distinguish correct entities from noise.

**Results**
The proposed framework achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) F1 scores across four standard benchmark datasets, securing **88.86% on BC5CDR**, **75.33% on JNLPBA**, **90.82% on NCBI-disease**, and **68.69% on the multilingual CMeEE dataset**. In direct comparisons, the integration of the contrastive learning selector significantly improved result quality by filtering incorrect predictions, contributing to a performance lift of over **1%** in F1 scores on key benchmarks by effectively reducing false positives. The model also demonstrated robust zero-shot capabilities, successfully generalizing to unseen corpora and different languages with high precision, validating the efficacy of the generative approach and the bilingual fine-tuning strategy.

**Impact**
This work significantly advances biomedical NLP by demonstrating that a unified, LLM-based generative framework can effectively resolve historically persistent issues such as nested entity recognition and boundary ambiguity. By establishing a method that generalizes across languages without architectural modification while achieving quantifiable SOTA metrics, the research offers a scalable, high-precision path toward global clinical data mining. The successful application of contrastive learning for entity selection sets a new precedent for accuracy in information extraction, potentially reducing reliance on expensive, hand-crafted post-processing rules in future biomedical systems.
