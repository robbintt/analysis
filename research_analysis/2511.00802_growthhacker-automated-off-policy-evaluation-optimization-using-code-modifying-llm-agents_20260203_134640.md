## Executive Summary

Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) is a critical technique for enabling offline A/B testing in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, where deploying suboptimal policies online poses significant risks. However, optimizing OPE estimators to minimize relative estimation error remains a complex, manual, and resource-intensive challenge. This paper addresses the need to automate the optimization of OPE systems, aiming to enhance performance without the financial and safety costs associated with live online experimentation. The authors specifically tackle the difficulty of optimizing standard estimators within a contextual bandit setting using historical data.

The key innovation is "**GrowthHacker**," a novel framework that utilizes Large Language Model (LLM) agents to perform automated code modification for OPE optimization. The authors formulate the optimization task as minimizing relative estimation error, formulating it as a code optimization task $(C, \theta_0, D)$ over Direct Method (DM), Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW), and Doubly Robust (DR) estimators. To reduce system complexity while preserving optimization effectiveness, the researchers developed a specialized two-agent architecture: a Prompter/Analyzer Agent identifies code weaknesses and generates modification instructions, while a Coder Agent implements these changes to ensure functional correctness. This iterative loop leverages the Open Bandit Pipeline (OBP) and Scope-RL libraries and is validated using large-scale real-world datasets, distinguishing it from more generalized approaches.

The proposed two-agent framework demonstrated significant robustness and effectiveness compared to established multi-agent baselines like CrewAI and AutoGen. It achieved a **100% reliability rate** with zero compilation failures and an average optimization improvement of **106.7%**. In terms of success rates—the frequency of achieving performance gains—the two-agent framework and CrewAI both reached 45%, substantially outperforming the AutoGen baseline at 34%. The study highlighted the instability of general-purpose frameworks, noting that baselines experienced compilation errors exceeding 20% due to deprecated syntax, incorrect API usage, and context degradation, whereas GrowthHacker maintained consistent execution based on relative estimation error and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

This research is the first to investigate and validate the use of code-modifying LLM agents specifically for optimizing OPE results, establishing a new intersection between agentic AI and causal inference. By introducing "The GrowthHacker Benchmark," the authors provide a standardized resource utilizing large-scale real-world data for the community to evaluate automated OPE methods. This work provides a pathway for organizations to adopt rigorous offline A/B testing pipelines, significantly reducing the costs and risks of online deployment while leveraging autonomous agents to systematically enhance system performance.
