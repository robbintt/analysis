## 📋 Executive Summary

Deploying deep learning inference on edge devices is often constrained by the heterogeneity of hardware and strict limitations in memory, power, and computational capacity. Traditional approaches frequently rely on fixed pre-trained models or static partitioning strategies, which fail to dynamically adapt to varying device capabilities and network conditions. This rigidity leads to inefficient resource utilization, resulting in high latency, energy consumption, and operational costs. This paper addresses the critical need for a system that can significantly reduce computational overhead while maintaining high inference accuracy across diverse and unpredictable edge environments.

The core innovation is **QPART**, an accuracy-aware and workload-balanced inference system that introduces a joint optimization framework for model quantization and inference partitioning. Utilizing a collaborative server-edge approach, the system dynamically generates request-specific models tailored to the current device capacity and available bandwidth. QPART employs Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) with a Uniform Asymmetric Quantizer, allowing for the edge segment of the model to undergo layer-wise quantization. Notably, this work represents the first quantization strategy within an inference serving system to optimize layer-wise bit-width based on theoretical accuracy degradation measurements, ensuring strict adherence to accuracy constraints while minimizing execution time and cost.

Evaluations of QPART demonstrate substantial performance improvements over traditional and non-optimized baselines. The system achieved a reduction in computation payloads of over 80% and decreased parameter sizes by an average of 77% (ranging from 62% to 84%). Crucially, these efficiency gains were realized with minimal impact on model performance, maintaining accuracy degradation below 1%. Furthermore, QPART outperformed Autoencoder-based and Pruning-based methods by achieving the lowest overall cost, while also delivering significant reductions in energy consumption and total inference time.

The significance of this research lies in its demonstration that dynamic, collaborative resource management can effectively overcome the limitations of static edge inference. By proving more cost-efficient and robust than fixed pre-trained models, QPART establishes a new paradigm for accuracy-aware edge computing. This work paves the way for deploying sophisticated deep learning models on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing performance, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for the increasingly complex landscape of edge AI applications.
