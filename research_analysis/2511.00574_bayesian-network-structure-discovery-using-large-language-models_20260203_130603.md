> ###  Executive Summary
>
> Traditional Bayesian network (BN) structure learning faces a critical bottleneck in data-scarce domains, as statistical methods like Hill Climbing or the PC algorithm require large volumes of observational data to accurately infer causal relationships. While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive semantic reasoning capabilities that could theoretically bridge this gap, existing approaches relegate them to auxiliary roles, such as feature engineering, rather than leveraging them as central discovery agents. This paper addresses the significant limitation of purely statistical methods in low-data or no-data environments, proposing a shift toward frameworks that utilize LLMs not just for semantic support, but as the primary drivers of causal discovery.
>
> The authors introduce **Prompt2BN**, a unified framework that positions the LLM as the central, active agent throughout the discovery loop. The methodology operates in two distinct phases: **PromptBN** and **ReActBN**. PromptBN is a data-free mechanism that utilizes meta-prompting on variable metadata to generate initial Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), ensuring structural consistency and acyclicity through dual representation validation (node-centric and edge-centric). ReActBN serves as a data-aware refinement mechanism that integrates the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) paradigm with statistical structure scores, specifically the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This agentic workflow allows the LLM to iteratively refine the graph by reasoning over statistical feedback and selecting optimal structural modifications from top-k candidate actions, effectively combining linguistic reasoning with mathematical validation.
>
> Quantitative evaluation on standard benchmarks (e.g., Alarm, Asia, Child) demonstrates that Prompt2BN significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art LLM-based algorithms and traditional data-driven methods in low-data regimes. Specifically, in scenarios with limited observational data (e.g., N=50 samples), the framework achieves higher F1-scores and lower Structural Hamming Distances (SHD) compared to Hill Climbing, GES, and the PC algorithm, which often fail to converge accurately without more data. In data-free settings, PromptBN successfully recovers graph structures with accuracy substantially exceeding random baselines. The authors further clarify the framework's efficiency, noting that it operates with a constant number of LLM inference queries (O(1)), decoupling the computational overhead of the LLM from the complexity of the variable search space.
>
> This research represents a paradigm shift in neuro-symbolic systems, moving LLMs from auxiliary support to central orchestration in probabilistic graphical modeling. By successfully unifying data-free semantic estimation with data-aware statistical refinement, Prompt2BN provides a viable solution for causal discovery in fields where data is expensive, scarce, or privacy-sensitive, such as medicine and social sciences. The establishment of a cohesive framework that generalizes across domains without requiring fine-tuning sets a new standard for hybrid AI systems, effectively bridging the gap between semantic knowledge and statistical validation.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Performance:** The proposed framework significantly outperforms existing LLM-based and traditional data-driven algorithms (e.g., Hill Climbing, PC algorithm) in Bayesian network structure discovery.
*   **Low-Data Resilience:** The method demonstrates particular strength in low-data or no-data scenarios, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional statistical methods that require large sample sizes.
*   **Active Agency:** Maintaining the LLM "actively in the loop" throughout the discovery process yields better results than using LLMs merely as auxiliary tools.
*   **Hybrid Validation:** Effectively combines LLM reasoning capabilities (ReAct paradigm) with statistical structure scores (Bayesian Information Criterion) for precise iterative refinement.

## Methodology

The authors propose a unified framework that centralizes Large Language Models (LLMs) in the structure learning process. The framework is designed to keep the LLM engaged throughout the entire discovery and refinement loop, supporting two distinct modes of operation:

1.  **Data-Free Setting (PromptBN):** This mode queries LLMs using metadata to uncover relationships without requiring observational data.
2.  **Data-Aware Setting (ReActBN):** This mode integrates the ReAct reasoning paradigm with Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) scores for iterative refinement based on actual data.

## Contributions

*   **Paradigm Shift:** Challenges the conventional use of LLMs as auxiliary tools by placing the LLM at the center of the discovery process.
*   **Novel Methods:** Introduces two specific methods:
    *   **PromptBN:** For data-free structure learning.
    *   **ReActBN:** For data-aware refinement.
*   **Scarcity Solution:** Provides a viable solution for Bayesian network structure learning in situations where observational data is scarce or absent.
*   **Unified Framework:** Establishes a single, cohesive framework capable of handling both data-free and data-aware scenarios.

## Technical Details

The paper proposes **Prompt2BN**, a two-phase framework designed to keep the LLM "actively in the loop" for discovering Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

### Phase 1: PromptBN (Data-Free Estimation)
*   **Mechanism:** A data-free estimation mechanism using Meta-Prompting on variable metadata.
*   **Representations:** Generates graphs in dual representations (node-centric and edge-centric).
*   **Validation:** Validates generated graphs for structural consistency and acyclicity.

### Phase 2: ReActBN (Score-Aware Refinement)
*   **Workflow:** Utilizes a ReAct-inspired agentic workflow.
*   **Integration:** Combines LLM reasoning with statistical structure scores (specifically Bayesian Information Criterion - BIC).
*   **Optimization:** Iteratively refines the graph by selecting optimal actions from top-k candidates.
*   **Role:** Positions the LLM as the central agent supervising the search, unifying data-free estimation and score-based refinement.

## Results

*   **Benchmark Performance:** The framework significantly outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) LLM-based algorithms and traditional data-driven algorithms (e.g., Hill Climbing, GES, PC algorithm).
*   **Data Scarcity:** Demonstrates particular strength in low-data or no-data scenarios.
*   **Efficiency:** The method claims **O(1) complexity** in LLM queries, making it computationally efficient.
*   **Evaluation:** Utilizes the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for structure evaluation.
*   **Generalization:** Generalizes well without requiring retraining or fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
*   **Qualitative Insight:** Findings suggest that maintaining the LLM "actively in the loop" yields better results than using it as an auxiliary tool.
