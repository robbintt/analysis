## 📝 Executive Summary

> Extracting reliable Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from unstructured text remains a critical challenge for semantic search and reasoning, yet current approaches relying on Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally flawed. Standard LLMs suffer from prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and a propensity for "hallucinated" relations, generating non-factual information that lacks provenance. This paper addresses the need for a scalable, interpretable method to distill high-fidelity, domain-specific KGs—such as medical data from PubMed—without the reliability risks and computational overhead associated with generative LLMs.
>
> The researchers introduce **GraphMERT**, a lightweight neurosymbolic model containing only 80 million parameters, utilizing a graph encoder-only architecture to distill knowledge effectively. Unlike monolithic LLMs, GraphMERT employs a modular stack where the neural component handles abstraction learning while the derived KGs manage symbolic reasoning for verification. The system is designed around strict criteria for **Factuality** (ensuring data provenance) and **Validity** (consistency with domain ontologies), utilizing multi-hop KG paths to capture complex semantic relations that generative models often miss.

> In a benchmark evaluation extracting diabetes knowledge from PubMed papers, GraphMERT significantly outperformed a massive 32B-parameter LLM baseline across all key metrics. It achieved an **FActScore of 69.8%** compared to the baseline's 40.2%, demonstrating superior factuality. Furthermore, GraphMERT attained a Semantic Relation Validity score of 68.8% versus the baseline's 43.0%. Notably, this represents a 400x reduction in model size while simultaneously delivering substantial gains in both the accuracy and validity of the extracted relations. This work establishes a new efficiency standard for neurosymbolic AI, demonstrating that high parameter counts are not a prerequisite for state-of-the-art performance in knowledge extraction.
