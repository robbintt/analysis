## Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of classifying short, unstructured text strings—specifically product names—within a commercial e-commerce context. The core technical hurdle involves converting variable-length descriptions that are often sparse, noisy, and prone to typographical errors into numeric vector representations suitable for machine learning. Accurate categorization is essential for optimizing downstream workflows such as search functionality and inventory management, necessitating robust feature extraction methods capable of capturing semantic meaning from limited textual data where traditional methods often fail.

The study introduces a rigorous comparative framework evaluating five distinct word embedding techniques—Count Vectorization, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe—to map raw text into vector space. The technical approach isolates the vectorization method as the primary variable, feeding these embeddings into a suite of supervised machine learning classifiers including Linear models (Logistic Regression), Probabilistic models (Multinomial Naive Bayes), Instance-based learners (kNN), Tree-based methods (Decision Trees), and Non-linear models (Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines). This methodology allows for a direct analysis of how different feature extraction strategies, particularly FastText’s reliance on sub-word information to handle morphological variations, impact classification performance.

Empirical results established a distinct performance hierarchy among the tested embeddings: **FastText > Word2Vec ≈ GloVe ≈ TF-IDF ≈ Count Vectorization**. FastText yielded superior results due to its ability to generate vectors for out-of-vocabulary words via sub-word n-grams. Regarding classifiers, the study identified Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forests as the top-performing architectures, demonstrating impressive accuracy. In contrast, kNN, Naive Bayes, and single Decision Trees showed lower efficacy, with Random Forests correcting previous misconceptions to rank among the elite performers in this specific context.

This paper provides data scientists and engineers with a critical benchmark for implementing text classification systems, offering validated performance hierarchies rather than general recommendations. By confirming FastText as the optimal embedding technique when paired with SVM, Logistic Regression, or Random Forests, the study directs the field toward a high-accuracy framework capable of handling the linguistic complexities inherent in real-world product data. These findings enable technical teams to optimize NLP pipelines with confidence, ensuring robust handling of sparse and noisy textual inputs.
