## Executive Summary

This research addresses the limitations of standard Word Error Rate (WER) metrics in evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, particularly regarding their ability to handle low-frequency vocabulary. Standard WER often fails to accurately reflect model performance on rare words, such as proper nouns, technical terms, and uncommon expressions. This issue is significant because errors in rare word recognition can severely limit the utility of ASR applications in specialized or technical domains.

The key innovation presented involves the utilization of an encoder-decoder architecture that integrates a speech encoder directly with a Large Language Model (LLM) decoder. By coupling LLMs into the ASR pipeline, the approach aims to decouple and analyze the distinct contributions of the speech encoder versus the LLM decoder. The models are trained on a large-scale dataset of **190,000 hours** of diverse speech data, with a specific optimization focus on handling rare words. However, it is important to note that detailed methodological specifics were not available, as the provided source text indicates the Abstract section was empty, and these details are drawn from limited technical descriptions.

The study establishes **Rare Word Error Rate (RWER)** as the primary metric for evaluating low-frequency vocabulary, while continuing to use standard WER for overall performance. The experimental goals include demonstrating that LLM integration reduces RWER, investigating the distinct roles of the encoder and decoder in affecting WER versus RWER, and assessing the impact of data quality on rare word recognition. Despite these defined objectives and the mention of comprehensive ablation studies, the provided text does not contain specific quantitative experimental data, results, or figures to validate the proposed method's performance.

By introducing RWER and integrating LLMs into the ASR pipeline, this research encourages the field to move beyond aggregate error metrics and focus on the specific challenges of rare word recognition. This shift is vital for advancing the state of the art, as it directs research efforts toward improving model performance on proper nouns and technical terminology.
