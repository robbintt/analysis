## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical lack of systematic, longitudinal analysis regarding how data privacy practices evolve within the Large Language Model (LLM) industry. As LLMs become increasingly integrated into sensitive workflows, the terms governing data usage are in constant flux, creating a challenge for regulators and developers who rely on static snapshots of privacy policies. The study identifies a significant gap in accountability, highlighting that without a robust method to track temporal changes, stakeholders cannot effectively monitor how providers adjust their governance in response to regulatory and technological shifts.

The key innovation is a **fault-tolerant longitudinal data pipeline** designed to retrieve and process historical versions of privacy documents. Technically, the system leverages the Wayback Machine combined with 'Waybackpack' and a sitemap-based URL resolution strategy to maximize data retrieval. The methodology utilizes sentence similarity algorithms to extract precise document changes over time and extends the standard OPP-115 privacy taxonomy with nine new categories tailored to LLMs (e.g., "Prompt," "Model Output," and "Inferred information"). Furthermore, the framework evaluates these texts using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) for readability and quantifies vagueness by counting obfuscating words.

The study analyzed 11 major LLM providers, identifying and manually annotating 3,463 specific policy edits. Results revealed significant disparities in documentation volume: OpenAI led in the frequency of document updates, while xAI exhibited the highest word count. This research establishes a foundational methodology for the automated auditing of AI governance, offering regulators and auditors critical tools to assess transparency in a rapidly evolving landscape.

## Key Insights

*   **Dynamic Governance:** LLM privacy policies are highly volatile, with providers frequently updating terms. This renders static analysis insufficient for long-term compliance.
*   **Accountability Gap:** There is a recognized lack of tools for tracking temporal changes in privacy policies, hindering effective monitoring by regulators and developers.
*   **Transparency Issues:** The study introduces metrics for readability and vagueness (obfuscating words), highlighting the need for clearer communication in AI governance.
*   **Methodological Breakthrough:** The use of a fault-tolerant crawler and sentence similarity algorithms allows for precise tracking of policy evolution over time.

## Technical Implementation

The research employs a robust technical architecture to gather, process, and analyze privacy policy data.

### Data Acquisition Pipeline
*   **Source:** Utilizes the **Wayback Machine** and the `Waybackpack` tool.
*   **Crawling Strategy:** Implements a fault-tolerant crawler with:
    *   Maximum of 3 retries.
    *   5-second intervals between attempts.
    *   URL resolution based on sitemap analysis to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### Data Processing
*   **Filtering:** HTML parsing to remove boilerplate content.
*   **Change Extraction:** Utilizes sentence similarity algorithms to detect and extract document changes between versions.
*   **Annotation:** Manual annotation of identified changes for validation.

### Evaluation Metrics & Taxonomy
*   **Readability:** Assessed via the **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL)**.
*   **Vagueness:** Quantified by counting obfuscating words.
*   **Taxonomy Design:** Extends the **OPP-115** standard with LLM-specific additions:
    *   **13 Standard Categories:** e.g., Financial, Health.
    *   **9 New LLM Categories:** e.g., Prompt, Model Output, Inferred Information.
