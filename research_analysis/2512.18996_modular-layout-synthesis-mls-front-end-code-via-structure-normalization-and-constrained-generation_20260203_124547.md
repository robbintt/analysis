## Executive Summary

Current generative AI models for front-end engineering suffer from a fundamental technical incompatibility with modern development ecosystems. By producing monolithic, unstructured scripts, these models fail to generate code that adheres to the component-based architectures required by frameworks such as React, Vue, and Angular. This results in outputs lacking modularity, strict typing, and well-defined properties, necessitating extensive manual refactoring to meet production standards and creating a significant bottleneck in the development workflow.

The paper presents **Modular Layout Synthesis (MLS)**, a three-stage factorization framework designed to synthesize modular code. The process begins with **Visual-Semantic Encoding**, which maps visual designs into a serialized tree topology to capture layout hierarchy. This is followed by **Structural Normalization**, which applies heuristic deduplication to identify recurring design patterns and construct a framework-agnostic blueprint. Finally, **Constraint-Based Generation** utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) guided by hard constraints—such as admissible-token filtering based on grammar and type enforcement—to synthesize strictly typed, production-ready code.

The system was evaluated across three major frameworks—React, Vue, and Angular—demonstrating the ability to generate strictly typed code with well-defined component props. The results confirm that MLS resolves the structural quality issues inherent in baseline solutions by delivering outputs that maintain the specific architectural requirements and modularity demanded by modern front-end ecosystems. The system successfully synthesized code that compiled and functioned within these environments, addressing the specific failure points of previous monolithic generation approaches.

This work establishes a formal technical protocol for bridging the gap between visual design tools and industrial software development. By integrating structural normalization and constraint-based generation, MLS provides a reproducible method for automating the synthesis of component-based architectures. This contribution advances the field by moving beyond single-file script generation toward a rigorous, engineering-standard approach to automated front-end code generation.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Performance:** MLS significantly outperforms existing baseline solutions in the domain of automated front-end engineering.
*   **Ecosystem Compatibility:** The framework effectively addresses the limitation of current Generative AI solutions, which typically produce monolithic scripts that are incompatible with modern ecosystems like React, Vue, or Angular.
*   **Code Quality:** The approach ensures superior code reusability and structural integrity across multiple frameworks.
*   **Production Readiness:** The system successfully synthesizes production-ready code characterized by strict typing and well-defined component props, reducing the manual coding overhead.

## Methodology

The MLS framework utilizes a three-stage hierarchical process designed to translate visual inputs into modular code:

1.  **Visual-Semantic Encoding**
    *   Maps screen captures into a serialized tree topology.
    *   Accurately captures the essential layout hierarchy.

2.  **Structural Normalization**
    *   Applies heuristic deduplication and pattern recognition algorithms.
    *   Isolates reusable blocks to create a framework-agnostic schema.

3.  **Constraint-Based Generation**
    *   Guides the Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize code based on the normalized schema.
    *   Enforces strict typing and component properties to ensure production readiness.

## Technical Details

The paper proposes Modular Layout Synthesis (MLS), a three-stage factorization framework for converting screenshots to framework-specific code.

*   **Module A: Screen-to-Arborescence Transduction**
    *   Converts visual inputs into a DOM-like tree structure.
    *   Utilizes a composite loss function covering topology, geometry, and noise regularization.

*   **Module B: Blueprint Compression with Motif Harvesting**
    *   Transforms the tree into a Portable Blueprint.
    *   **Canonicalization:** Standardizes structure and content.
    *   **Motif Mining:** Uses recursive digests and near-match unification.
    *   **Conflict Resolution:** Performs set packing to resolve discrepancies.

*   **Module C: Constraint-Driven Multi-Framework Realization**
    *   Uses an LLM with a realization map and hard constraints.
    *   **Admissible-Token Filtering:** Based on grammar, binding, and type.
    *   **Output:** Generates strictly typed production-ready code for React, Vue, and Angular.

## Contributions

*   **Introduction of the MLS Framework:** A novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap between visual design and modern modular front-end development.
*   **Advancement in Modularity:** A shift away from monolithic script generation towards a methodology that natively supports component-based architectures (React, Vue, Angular) through structural normalization.
*   **Innovation in Generation Protocols:** The development of a constraint-based generation strategy that enforces technical rigor (strict typing, props) on LLM outputs, ensuring the resulting code is maintainable and production-ready.
