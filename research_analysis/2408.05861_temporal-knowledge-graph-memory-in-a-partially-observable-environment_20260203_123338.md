## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical challenge of memory management and reasoning within partially observable environments (POEs) where the underlying state is structured as a graph. Standard neural architectures often struggle to maintain long-term dependencies and effectively utilize symbolic data in such settings, leading to poor performance when faced with dynamic, hidden states. This problem is significant because real-world AI systems frequently operate with incomplete information and evolving relationships; without a robust mechanism to track temporal changes in structured data, agents cannot reliably generalize or answer queries about their environment.

The authors introduce **"Room Environment v3,"** a deterministic grid benchmark designed specifically to evaluate graph-shaped POEs, where the hidden state is represented as an RDF Knowledge Graph. The key technical innovation is a lightweight Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) memory mechanism that employs RDF-star-style qualifiers to annotate triples with temporal metadata (e.g., `:time_added`). This allows the agent to track the evolution of facts over time explicitly. The memory is managed using heuristic strategies—such as Recency, Frequency, FIFO, LRU, and LFU—to handle strict capacity constraints, offering a structured alternative to the "black box" latent states typical of neural sequence models.

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed **Symbolic TKG Memory** achieved approximately **fourfold higher Question Answering (QA) accuracy** compared to neural sequence baselines (LSTM and Transformer). The study highlights that the use of RDF-star temporal qualifiers provided significantly more stable performance under memory capacity constraints. Furthermore, evaluation on a held-out layout with a state space magnitude greater than $6.6 \times 10^{33}$ revealed a substantial generalization gap: while symbolic approaches remained robust, standard neural sequence models failed to perform effectively when the layout or query order changed during testing.

This work significantly influences the field by providing empirical evidence that explicit symbolic structures can outperform standard neural architectures in complex reasoning tasks involving partial observability. By releasing the "Room Environment v3" benchmark alongside open-source agent implementations and experimental scripts, the authors establish a rigorous new standard for testing temporal reasoning and memory capabilities. The findings challenge the prevailing reliance on purely neural approaches for memory, suggesting that integrating structured knowledge representations is essential for improving interpretability, stability, and generalization in AI agents.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Accuracy:** Symbolic TKG Memory achieved approximately **fourfold higher QA accuracy** compared to neural sequence baselines.
*   **Stability:** The use of RDF-star-style temporal qualifiers resulted in significantly **more stable performance** under memory capacity constraints.
*   **Generalization Gap:** Significant gaps in train-test generalization were revealed when agents were evaluated on a held-out layout.
*   **Neural Limitations:** Neural sequence models lacking explicit KG structures struggled to perform effectively compared to symbolic approaches.

## Methodology

The study utilized a controlled experimental setup to compare symbolic and neural reasoning approaches:

*   **Environment:** The **'Room Environment v3'** benchmark, where the hidden state is an RDF Knowledge Graph and observations are RDF triples.
*   **Agent Architecture:** Agents employed a lightweight temporal KG memory based on RDF-star-style qualifiers.
*   **Baselines:** Symbolic agents were compared against neural sequence models, specifically **LSTM** and **Transformer** architectures.
*   **Protocol:** The evaluation protocol involved training on a specific layout and testing on a held-out layout with different query orders.

## Technical Details

The proposed approach relies on rigorous mathematical modeling and specific configuration parameters:

**Environment Dynamics**
*   **Grid:** A deterministic, partially observable $g \times g$ grid.
*   **Hidden State:** An RDF Knowledge Graph modeling rooms, objects, and explicit wall triples.
*   **Evolution:** Dynamics include periodic inner walls and moving objects with ordered preference lists, creating a global periodic orbit.
*   **State Space Bound:** Defined by $|S| \le R^M \prod |p_i|$.

**Memory Mechanism**
*   **Syntax:** Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) using RDF-star syntax for temporal annotations (e.g., `<<s p o>> :time_added`).
*   **Management:** Managed by heuristic strategies including Recency, Frequency, FIFO, LRU, and LFU.

**Standard Configuration**
*   **Grid ($g$):** $7 \times 7$
*   **Rooms ($R$):** $49$
*   **Moving Objects ($M$):** $18$
*   **Inner Walls ($W$):** $36$
*   **Total States:** Exceeds $6.6 \times 10^{33}$
