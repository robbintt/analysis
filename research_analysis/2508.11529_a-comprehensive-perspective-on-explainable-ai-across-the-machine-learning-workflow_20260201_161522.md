## Executive Summary

Current Explainable AI (XAI) research suffers from a narrow, model-centric focus that limits its practical utility. Existing methods predominantly target the interpretation of individual model predictions while neglecting the broader "upstream" decisions in data preparation and the "downstream" requirements of quality assurance and communication. This creates a critical disconnect, described by the authors as an **"asymmetry of skills,"** where technical outputs fail to meet the cognitive and actionable needs of diverse stakeholders such as domain experts, data analysts, and data scientists. Without addressing these workflow-wide gaps, organizations struggle to deploy AI systems that are truly transparent and trustworthy across the entire data-analysis lifecycle.

The paper introduces the **Holistic Explainable AI (HXAI)** framework, a user-centric paradigm that integrates computer science with principles from cognitive science and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Technically, HXAI proposes a unified taxonomy comprising six distinct stages of the machine learning workflow: Data, Analysis Setup, Learning Process, Model Output, Model Quality, and Communication Channel. To operationalize this framework, the authors architect a solution utilizing LLM-augmented agents. These agents possess planning and contextual augmentation capabilities, allowing them to dynamically orchestrate diverse explanation techniques. Instead of raw technical outputs, these agents translate complex artifacts into tailored narratives that align with the specific requirements of different user roles.

As a foundational and conceptual study, the paper does not present experimental performance metrics for a deployed system. Instead, the primary results derive from a rigorous gap analysis utilizing a newly developed **112-item question bank** designed to evaluate tool coverage against stakeholder needs. This evaluation of contemporary toolchains revealed significant deficiencies, specifically identifying that current literature and tools heavily bias toward model prediction explanations while largely ignoring data explainability and result communication. The survey quantitatively highlighted that existing tooling fails to provide the clear, actionable, and cognitively manageable insights required by non-technical stakeholders.

This work significantly advances the field by establishing a standardized vocabulary and a comprehensive benchmark for assessing XAI systems. By defining a unified workflow taxonomy and distinguishing between **"interpretability"** (how a decision was made) and **"explainability"** (why a decision matters to the human), the paper reduces the terminological ambiguity that currently hinders interdisciplinary collaboration. The introduction of the 112-item evaluation metric provides a concrete tool for future researchers to assess the completeness of their solutions. Furthermore, the proposal to use LLM agents to bridge the gap between developers and domain experts sets a new architectural direction for creating responsible AI systems that genuinely support human decision-making.
