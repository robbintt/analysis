## Executive Summary

This research addresses fragmentation in traditional reinforcement learning and control theory by introducing **Dynamical System Optimization (DSO)**, a framework that removes the rigid separation between actions and system parameters. By reformulating policies as autonomous dynamical systems, the authors derive a simplified Bellman equation and establish theoretical equivalence with standard Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The study provides rigorous proofs and gradient theorems that enable algorithm derivation at the autonomous system level, showing mathematical consistency with established methods. DSO creates a unified lens for various optimization tasks, including system identification and generative AI, offering a rigorous foundation for future cross-disciplinary research.

## Key Findings

*   **Autonomous System Formulation:** Specifying a parametric policy transfers control authority to the policy, transforming the problem into an autonomous dynamical system where policy parameters can be optimized without referencing specific controls or actions.
*   **Equivalence to Standard RL Metrics:** Algorithms derived at the autonomous system level compute the same mathematical quantities as complex reinforcement learning methods, including policy gradients, Hessians, natural gradients, and proximal methods.
*   **Broad Applicability:** Because the framework treats policy parameters uniformly with other system parameters, the same optimization algorithms apply to behavioral cloning, mechanism design, system identification, and state estimator learning.
*   **Generative AI Relevance:** Tuning generative AI models is not only possible within this framework but is conceptually closer to dynamical system optimization than to traditional Reinforcement Learning.
*   **Methodological Extensions:** The framework supports analogs to approximate policy iteration and off-policy learning without relying on approximate Dynamic Programming.

## Methodology

The proposed methodology abandons the traditional machinery of approximate Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. Instead, it derives optimization algorithms directly at the **"autonomous system level."**

By treating the policy-specified system as an autonomous dynamical system, the approach optimizes parameters uniformly. This method avoids the need to explicitly handle actions or controls during the optimization process, effectively bypassing the complexities associated with standard control-theoretic approaches.

## Contributions

*   **A Unified Optimization Framework:** Establishment of a new paradigm that simplifies the optimization of parametric policies by framing them as autonomous dynamical systems.
*   **Derivation of Simplified Algorithms:** Development of mathematically rigorous yet simpler algorithms that replicate the results of established but complex optimization techniques (e.g., natural gradients, proximal methods).
*   **Cross-Disciplinary Generalization:** Expansion of the scope of optimization theory beyond control tasks to include system identification, estimator learning, and generative AI, demonstrating a universal application for tuning system parameters.
