## Executive Summary

Dataset distillation aims to synthesize small, synthetic datasets that allow neural networks to achieve performance comparable to training on full, large-scale datasets. This paper addresses the critical limitations of existing distillation methods, which largely rely on heuristic approaches that lack theoretical rigor and suffer from prohibitive computational costs. Specifically, prior methods struggle to balance the extraction of intrinsic sample information with global data utility, leading to suboptimal performance on complex benchmarks like ImageNet-1K. The research highlights the need for a theoretically grounded framework that can efficiently generate high-fidelity distilled datasets without the extensive computational overhead associated with bi-level optimization.

The authors introduce **InfoUtil**, a novel theoretical framework that mathematically formalizes dataset distillation through the dual objectives of "Informativeness" and "Utility." The framework operates as a training-free method that leverages pretrained networks for synthesis. The first component, Informativeness Maximization, employs a game-theoretic approach using Shapley Values to generate binary masks, isolating and retaining critical features from individual samples while minimizing output divergence from the original data. The second component, Utility Maximization, utilizes Gradient Flow to measure the worst-case impact of removing a data point; it employs Gradient Norms as a utility metric to select samples that exert the most significant influence on model convergence. By mathematically combining these two optimization strategies, InfoUtil generates distilled datasets that are both information-rich and globally utility-optimized.

InfoUtil establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming previous methods like RDED across multiple benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K using ResNet-18 (IPC=1), the framework achieved a 6.1% performance improvement. Similarly, it recorded substantial gains on CIFAR-10 (+16.7% with ResNet-18, IPC=10) and ImageNet-100 (+16.0% with ResNet-101, IPC=10). The method also demonstrated superior cross-architecture generalization, achieving 17.8% accuracy when transferring from VGG-11 to Swin-V2-Tiny, compared to RDED's 7.8%. Beyond accuracy, InfoUtil offers drastic efficiency improvements as a training-free method: it is approximately 50x faster and 100x more memory-efficient (~1.75 GB vs >241 GB) than the training-based TESLA method.

This research represents a paradigm shift in dataset distillation, moving the field from heuristic, trial-and-error approaches to a mathematically rigorous optimization standard. By defining the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, the authors provide the community with quantifiable metrics to evaluate and guide the distillation process. The practical implications are significant; the drastic reduction in computational cost and memory usage democratizes access to high-quality dataset distillation for large-scale applications. Consequently, InfoUtil sets a new benchmark for the field, offering a robust, theoretically sound foundation for future research in efficient machine learning and data synthesis.

## Methodology

The authors propose **InfoUtil**, a theoretical framework designed to balance two specific metrics during dataset synthesis:

1.  **Informativeness Maximization**
    *   Uses a **game-theoretic approach** (Shapley Value) to extract key information from individual samples.
    *   Aims to capture the intrinsic value of each data point.

2.  **Utility Maximization**
    *   Utilizes **Gradient Norm** to select globally influential samples.
    *   Ensures the selected data points have a high impact on the model's global convergence.

The framework mathematically combines these components to generate a distilled dataset that is both information-rich and utility-optimized.

*   **Goal:** Select samples with high utility—those that influence model convergence the most.

### Implementation Notes
*   The framework uses **pretrained networks** for synthesis.
*   It extracts training-stage soft labels for small IPC (Images Per Class).
