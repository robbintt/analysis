## ⚡ Executive Summary

Current evaluations of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) suffer from an **English-centric bias** and an over-reliance on short captions, which significantly limits the assessment of complex, multilingual reasoning capabilities. This narrow focus fails to capture model performance on long-form textual contexts and creates a blind spot regarding how well these systems function in low-resource languages.

Addressing this is essential for developing truly global multimodal systems that can handle the nuances of diverse languages and deeper semantic comprehension beyond simple image-label associations. The authors introduce **VLURes**, a robust benchmark comprising 4,126 high-relevance image-text pairs sourced from Wikinews, Wikipedia, and web logs across 10 distinct image categories.

Unlike existing datasets, VLURes focuses on article-level context, utilizing a technical construction method that employs **CLIP ViT-L/14** to solve a bipartite assignment problem based on pairwise cosine similarity, filtering scores below 0.15. The benchmark is structured around eight vision-and-language tasks—spanning Image-Only Reasoning (e.g., Object Recognition, Scene Understanding) and Image-Text Reasoning (e.g., Image-Text Matching, Visual Question Answering)—along with a pioneering **'unrelatedness' task** designed to detect irrelevant image-text pairings.

Evaluations of ten proprietary and open-source VLMs assessed via both automatic metrics and native speaker evaluations revealed that while **GPT-4o** achieved the top score, it still lagged behind human performance by **6.7%**. The findings highlight a significant capability gap between proprietary and open-source models, as well as uneven performance across fine-grained tasks, with models demonstrating better proficiency in object recognition than in scene understanding. Furthermore, there was a marked performance degradation in low-resource languages (Swahili, Urdu) compared to high-resource languages (English, Japanese), underscoring the challenges of multilingual generalization.

VLURes establishes a critical new standard for multilingual, long-context visual reasoning by providing a rigorous, multi-task framework that extends beyond English-centric evaluations. By releasing high-quality resources for low-resource languages such as Swahili and Urdu, this work provides the research community with essential tools to diagnose and address the limitations of current VLMs. This benchmark will guide the development of more inclusive multimodal systems, pushing the field toward bridging the performance gap between high- and low-resource language processing.

## 🧪 Methodology

The researchers employed a rigorous process to create and utilize the VLURes benchmark:

1.  **Data Curation:** The VLURes benchmark was curated using web resources (Wikinews, Wikipedia, web logs) covering 10 image categories and featuring long-form text, contrasting with typical short-caption datasets.
2.  **Task Design:** The benchmark includes eight distinct vision-and-language tasks and a specific 'unrelatedness' task to detect irrelevant image-text pairings.
3.  **Evaluation:** Ten VLMs were evaluated by prompting for responses.
4.  **Assessment:** Responses were assessed using a combination of automatic metrics and evaluations by native speakers across four languages: English, Japanese, Swahili, and Urdu.
