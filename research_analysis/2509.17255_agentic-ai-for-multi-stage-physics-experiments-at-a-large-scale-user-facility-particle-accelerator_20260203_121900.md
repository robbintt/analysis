## Executive Summary

Managing multi-stage physics experiments at large-scale user facilities, such as synchrotron light sources, presents a significant operational bottleneck due to the complexity of manual scripting and the specialized knowledge required to interface with accelerator hardware. The challenge lies in translating high-level scientific intent into precise, executable control sequences without compromising the strict safety standards essential for high-energy environments.

This research addresses the critical need for automation that bridges the gap between natural language objectives and complex technical execution, thereby accelerating scientific throughput while maintaining operational integrity. The paper introduces a language-model-driven agentic AI system, the **"ALS Agent,"** which employs a novel "plan-first" orchestration strategy to decompose natural language prompts into structured execution plans.

Technically, the system utilizes a containerized environment—leveraging Podman and H100 GPUs for local or cloud inference—to manage a chain of operations that includes archive data retrieval, control-system channel resolution, and automated script generation. The architecture features bounded tool access and dynamic capability selection via few-shot binary classification, ensuring safe interaction with accelerator hardware through EPICS and the Process Variable database.

In its deployment on a production synchrotron light source, the system achieved a **two-order-of-magnitude (100x) reduction** in experiment preparation time compared to traditional manual scripting methods. This represents the first successful deployment of a language-model-driven agentic AI for multi-stage physics experiments in a live production environment. The system operated strictly within safety constraints, producing fully reproducible artifacts and maintaining transparent, auditable execution logs.
