## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the challenge of adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) in low-resource languages, specifically focusing on Vietnamese. While recent advancements in NLP have significantly improved MRC for high-resource languages, low-resource languages often struggle to achieve comparable performance due to data scarcity and the linguistic complexity of local dialects. Furthermore, reliance on large proprietary models like GPT-3 presents barriers regarding cost and adaptability, while traditional approaches, such as BERT-based architectures, may lack the reasoning capabilities required for complex comprehension tasks. The authors investigate whether modern, open-weight LLMs can effectively bridge this performance gap without requiring prohibitive computational resources.

The key innovation of this work is the application of **Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA)** to efficiently fine-tune compact, open-weight models—specifically Llama 3 (8B) and Gemma (7B)—on the Vietnamese ViMMRC dataset. Unlike full fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive, or standard prompting of proprietary models, which offers no parameter updates, QLoRA allows for high-performance adaptation by freezing the base model weights and training low-rank adapters in 4-bit precision. This methodology significantly reduces memory usage, enabling the fine-tuning of 7B and 8B parameter models on a single consumer-grade GPU (requiring approximately 12-16GB of VRAM) rather than the 48GB+ typically needed for full 16-bit fine-tuning.

The study provides compelling empirical evidence that fine-tuned smaller models can surpass larger, general-purpose proprietary systems. On the ViMMRC benchmark, the fine-tuned Llama 3 8B model achieved an Exact Match (EM) score of **68.9%** and an F1 score of **86.4%**, while the Gemma 7B model achieved an EM of **67.5%** and an F1 of **85.2%**. In contrast, the traditional BERT-based baseline lagged significantly with an EM of 55.1% and an F1 of 72.0%, while larger proprietary models like GPT-3.5 (EM: 60.3%, F1: 78.5%) and GPT-3 failed to match the specialized performance of the fine-tuned open models. These results highlight that for specific tasks like MRC, linguistic specificity gained through efficient fine-tuning is more critical than sheer model scale.

This research significantly influences the field by demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance for low-resource languages is attainable without relying on expensive, closed-source ecosystems or massive computational infrastructure. By validating the efficacy of QLoRA and smaller parameter models, the authors present a viable, cost-effective pathway for organizations and researchers to deploy high-quality NLP solutions in resource-constrained environments. The public release of the fine-tuned models on Hugging Face lowers the barrier to entry for future development, encouraging further innovation and accessibility in Vietnamese language processing.
