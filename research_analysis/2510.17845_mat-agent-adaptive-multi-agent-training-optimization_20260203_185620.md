## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the inherent inefficiency of static, manually configured training strategies in Multi-Label Image Classification (MLIC), which frequently results in sub-optimal model performance and slow convergence. Because traditional methods rely on fixed hyperparameters for data augmentation, optimization, and loss functions, they struggle to adapt to the complex, dynamic nature of deep learning training, creating a bottleneck for achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.

To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce **MAT-Agent**, a novel framework that formulates MLIC training as a sequential decision-making process governed by a Multi-Agent System (MAS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). The architecture utilizes four decentralized agents—Agent AUG, Agent OPT, Agent LRS, and Agent LOSS—to collaboratively optimize data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss functions in real-time. Technically, the system employs a Deep Q-Network (DQN) where agents utilize non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to balance exploration and exploitation. Decisions are guided by a composite reward function shaped by validation accuracy improvements and stability, while the framework incorporates dual-rate exponential moving average (EMA) smoothing and mixed-precision training to ensure robust updates.

MAT-Agent achieved state-of-the-art performance across major benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines including ML-GCN, HSQ-CvN, and PAT-T. Specifically, the model secured a mean Average Precision (mAP) of **97.4** on Pascal VOC and **92.8** on MS-COCO. Furthermore, the framework demonstrated superior generalization on the long-tail Visual Genome (VG-256) dataset with an mAP of **60.9** and improved the OF1 metric by over 1 point. These results confirm the method's ability to accelerate convergence and maintain robustness across diverse visual domains.

This work represents a significant paradigm shift in deep learning training strategies, moving from static, hand-crafted configurations to a fully adaptive, intelligent system. By successfully integrating autonomous agents into the training loop, MAT-Agent provides a scalable solution for intricate hyperparameter tuning without continuous human intervention, establishing a new standard for adaptive optimization in complex computer vision tasks.
