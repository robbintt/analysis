> ### 💡 Executive Summary
>
> This paper addresses the critical usability bottleneck in **Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME)**, specifically regarding the execution of electronic-structure simulations like Density Functional Theory (DFT). Traditionally, running these simulations on codes such as Quantum ESPRESSO requires deep expertise in both computational physics and computer science to manually generate and debug complex input files. This technical barrier prevents non-specialists from leveraging state-of-the-art simulation tools and significantly slows down the material design process in both academia and industry.
>
> To bridge this gap, the authors introduce **GENIUS**, an agentic AI framework designed to translate free-form natural language prompts into validated simulation input files. Technically, the system integrates three distinct components: a smart knowledge graph for Quantum ESPRESSO to provide domain-specific context; a tiered hierarchy of Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and generate simulation protocols; and a finite-state error-recovery machine. This error-recovery machine acts as a supervisor, autonomously validating outputs, detecting execution failures, and initiating repair loops without human intervention, effectively controlling hallucinations and ensuring computational fidelity.
>
> In a benchmark evaluation of 295 diverse simulation tasks, GENIUS achieved an approximately **80% overall success rate** in converting natural language into executable, validated inputs. The autonomous repair mechanism proved critical, successfully resolving issues in **76% of the cases**; in contrast, the baseline success rate decayed exponentially to **7%** when the system's intervention was disabled. Furthermore, compared to standard LLM-only approaches, GENIUS **halved inference costs** and virtually eliminated hallucinations by utilizing a validation layer to filter invalid generations before execution.
>
> The significance of this work lies in the democratization of high-performance computational tools, enabling non-experts to execute complex electronic-structure simulations without specialized computer science knowledge. By automating the generation, validation, and repair of DFT protocols, GENIUS facilitates reliable, hands-off simulation setups that are essential for large-scale material screening. This acceleration of the design loop has the potential to significantly speed up materials discovery and streamline engineering workflows across various scientific and industrial domains.
