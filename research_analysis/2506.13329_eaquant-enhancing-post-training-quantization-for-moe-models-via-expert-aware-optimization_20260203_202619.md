## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
Deploying Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models at scale is challenging due to their massive computational footprint and memory requirements. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a pathway to improve efficiency without the prohibitive cost of retraining, existing PTQ methods fail when applied to MoE architectures. These failures stem from treating the model as a uniform block, ignoring the unique structural dynamics of MoEs. Consequently, standard PTQ struggles with activation outliers and the sparse, conditional nature of expert activation, leading to significant accuracy degradation in low-bit environments.

### **Innovation**
The researchers propose **EAQuant**, a PTQ framework designed specifically for MoE architectures that utilizes an "expert-aware" optimization strategy rather than a uniform approach. Technically, EAQuant addresses MoE-specific failure points through three core innovations:

*   **Smoothing Aggregation:** Smooths activation distributions across experts to suppress outliers caused by expert heterogeneity.
*   **Routing Consistency Alignment:** Ensures that the quantization process does not disrupt the stable selection of experts.
*   **Calibration Data Balance:** Guarantees that sparsely activated experts receive adequate calibration data.

This tailored approach enables extreme quantization—supporting weight bit-widths as low as 2-bit—while preserving the model's routing logic and operational integrity.

### **Results**
EAQuant establishes a new state-of-the-art for MoE model quantization, demonstrating superior robustness across extreme quantization settings. In tests involving diverse architectures, including **Mixtral 8x7B**, the framework achieved average accuracy improvements ranging from **1.15% to 13.81%** compared to existing PTQ baselines across W4A4, W3A4, W3A3, and W2A4 configurations. Notably, the method maintains high performance retention even under the severe constraints of 2-bit weight quantization (W2A4) and demonstrates particularly pronounced gains in reasoning tasks.

### **Impact**
This research significantly advances the field of efficient deep learning by demonstrating that **ultra-low-bit quantization** of large-scale MoE models is feasible without retraining. By resolving critical bottlenecks such as routing instability and outlier suppression, EAQuant provides a practical solution for deploying massive MoE models on resource-constrained hardware. This contribution enhances the scalability and accessibility of state-of-the-art MoE architectures, paving the way for more efficient inference in real-world applications.

## Methodology

The researchers propose **EAQuant**, a Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) framework tailored specifically for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Unlike traditional methods that apply a uniform strategy, EAQuant utilizes an **'expert-aware' optimization strategy**.

This strategy consists of three core innovations designed to handle the unique properties of MoEs:

1.  **Smoothing Aggregation:** Used to suppress activation outliers that typically degrade quantization accuracy.
2.  **Routing Consistency Alignment:** Ensures that the quantization process maintains stable expert selection, preventing the routing logic from breaking during compression.
3.  **Calibration Data Balance:** Optimizes the quantization process for sparsely activated experts by ensuring sufficient calibration data is available for all relevant experts.

## Contributions

The research addresses critical failure points of existing PTQ methods in MoE models, specifically targeting:

*   **Activation Outliers:** Mitigating the impact of extreme values in activation distributions.
*   **Routing Instability:** Ensuring the model's decision-making path (routing) remains consistent post-quantization.
*   **Sparse Expert Calibration:** Solving the data scarcity issue for experts that are activated infrequently.

By integrating expert-aware smoothing, routing alignment, and data balancing, the study provides a comprehensive solution that advances the efficiency and scalability of large-scale deep learning models without the computational cost of retraining.
