## Executive Summary

Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face critical limitations in performing fine-grained visual spatial reasoning within embodied AI environments. These models struggle to disentangle intricate spatial relationships and maintain reasoning coherence over long-horizon tasks that require iterative interaction with the physical world. Existing approaches frequently fail to align internal reasoning steps with dynamic environmental states, leading to errors in complex scenarios that demand precise understanding of object relations, such as "stuck inside" or "leaning against." This creates a gap between abstract language models and the concrete demands of embodied interaction, where current solutions often rely on inefficient task-specific fine-tuning.

The authors introduce **EmbodiedVSR**, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating Dynamic Scene Graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Technically, the system constructs explicit structured knowledge representations by generating dynamic scene graphs that capture objects and scaleless spatial relations using vector notation. This graph serves as a guide for the CoT reasoning process, ensuring that every reasoning step is grounded in actionable environmental dynamics.

Evaluated on the newly introduced **eSpatial-Benchmark**, EmbodiedVSR demonstrated quantitatively superior performance compared to existing MLLM-based methods. In terms of Accuracy (success rate), the framework achieved **84.6%**, significantly outperforming GPT-4V (58.8%) and LLaVA (45.3%). In Reasoning Coherence, EmbodiedVSR attained **82.4%**, substantially exceeding GPT-4V's 55.3%. The significance of this work lies in its validation that structured representations can effectively replace the need for task-specific fine-tuning in embodied spatial reasoning.
