## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical lack of linguistic resources for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Kurdish Sorani, a significantly underrepresented, low-resource language. The absence of standardized annotated corpora and processing tools has historically hindered the development of effective NLP applications for this language, preventing the integration of Kurdish Sorani into modern information extraction workflows. By tackling this data scarcity, the study aims to bridge the digital divide for Sorani speakers, a task complicated by the language's complex morphology and the limited availability of pre-trained language models.

The key innovation of this work is the creation of the first dedicated NER dataset for Kurdish Sorani, named **AgaCKNER**, comprising 64,563 annotated tokens sourced from 160+ articles across five domains within the Rudaw Media Network. Technically, the preprocessing pipeline utilizes the **Kurdish Language Processing Toolkit (KLPT)** for text cleaning, numeral transliteration, and tokenization, adhering to the CoNLL format and BIO tagging scheme. To facilitate this corpus generation, the authors also developed the **AGA NER Annotation Tool**, a custom software solution featuring keyboard shortcuts and batch processing capabilities to streamline the manual annotation process.

In a direct benchmark comparing classical and neural architectures, the study found that **Conditional Random Fields (CRF)** significantly outperformed BiLSTM-based neural models. The CRF model achieved an F1-score of 0.825, surpassing the neural model's score of 0.706 by a substantial delta of 11.9%. These results indicate that for this specific low-resource language, the statistical modeling efficiency of CRFs provides better generalization than deep learning approaches, which often struggle to learn effective representations without the massive datasets typically available for high-resource languages like English.

The significance of this paper lies in its challenge to the prevailing assumption that neural approaches universally hold an advantage over classical machine learning methods in NLP. By demonstrating that computationally efficient frameworks can deliver superior performance for languages with limited annotated data, the authors advocate for a re-evaluation of resource allocation strategies in low-resource NLP. This work provides a vital open-source benchmark for the Kurdish Sorani language and establishes empirical evidence supporting the use of simpler, more efficient classical models to promote linguistic inclusivity without requiring access to high-end computational infrastructure.

## Methodology

The researchers undertook a comparative analysis involving both classic machine learning models and neural systems. This was facilitated by the creation of a dedicated dataset and the development of a specific tool to handle annotation and processing tasks. The study specifically benchmarked the performance of a **BiLSTM-based neural architecture** against a conventional **CRF (Conditional Random Fields)** model using the newly created corpus.
