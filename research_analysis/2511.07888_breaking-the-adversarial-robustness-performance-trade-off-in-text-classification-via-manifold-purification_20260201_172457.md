## Executive Summary

A fundamental challenge in text classification is the "robustness-performance trade-off," where improving a model's resilience against adversarial attacks typically results in degraded accuracy on clean, unperturbed data. This poses a significant barrier to deploying secure NLP systems, as practitioners must often choose between high standard performance and reliability against malicious inputs. This paper addresses this dilemma directly, proposing a solution that aims to enhance adversarial robustness without the customary penalty to clean data classification capabilities.

The authors introduce **MC²F**, a novel dual-module architecture that operates on sentence embeddings rather than raw text inputs. The core hypothesis is that adversarial perturbations displace embeddings from the intrinsic "clean" data manifold into a separable out-of-distribution (OOD) space. The system employs two distinct mechanisms: first, a **Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF)** learns the density and geometry of the clean data manifold to identify OOD embeddings; second, a **Geodesic Purification Solver** corrects these adversarial points by projecting them back onto the clean manifold via the shortest path (geodesics), effectively restoring their true representations before classification.

Empirical validation across three datasets and multiple attack types demonstrated that MC²F establishes a new state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness. While preliminary geometric analyses (UMAP, LID) showed clear separability between clean and attacked embeddings, the primary performance metrics confirm the model's efficacy. Crucially, the model achieved these robustness gains while fully preserving performance on clean data with zero accuracy loss (0% delta), and in some instances, yielded modest gains in standard classification accuracy. This success against strong attacks like TextFooler validates the model's ability to maintain utility without sacrificing security.

This research is significant because it empirically demonstrates that the robustness-accuracy trade-off is not an inherent limitation but a solvable architectural problem. By modeling the clean data distribution in the encoder embedding manifold using Riemannian geometry and causal purification, MC²F provides a theoretical and practical framework for building secure NLP models.

## Methodology

The researchers propose **Manifold-Correcting Causal Flow (MC²F)**, a dual-module system designed to operate on sentence embeddings rather than raw text. The architecture relies on the hypothesis that adversarial perturbations displace embeddings from the 'clean' data manifold to a distinct, separable adversarial manifold.

The system consists of two primary components:

1.  **Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF):**
    This module learns the density of the clean data manifold. By understanding the true geometry of the latent space, it effectively identifies out-of-distribution (OOD) embeddings that result from adversarial attacks.

2.  **Geodesic Purification Solver:**
    Once an adversarial point is identified as OOD, this module corrects it by projecting the point back onto the learned clean manifold. It utilizes the shortest path (geodesics) to restore the clean representation before the data is passed to the classifier.
