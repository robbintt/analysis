## 📝 Executive Summary

Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices requires aggressive low-bit quantization, which traditionally forces a difficult trade-off between the significant accuracy degradation of Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and the prohibitive computational costs of Quantization-Aware Training (QAT). Additionally, existing methods are frequently hindered by dequantization bottlenecks and excessive hardware requirements that limit practical application.

This paper addresses these challenges by establishing a framework that maintains high model fidelity in low-bit regimes while eliminating the need for expensive retraining or specialized enterprise hardware. The authors introduce **ELUTQ**, a framework anchored by **Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ)** and a **Bit-serial Look-Up Table (LUT)** inference engine.

*   **HLQ** is a non-uniform quantization scheme formulated as $\hat{W} = \sum_{j=0}^{q-1} s_j \cdot b_j + z$, designed to better capture weight statistical characteristics than uniform methods.
*   **LUT-based GEMM** replaces multiply-accumulate operations with table lookups to bypass dequantization overhead.

In experimental evaluations, ELUTQ achieved a **100x reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE)** compared to uniform quantization, resulting in accuracy comparable to QAT without retraining. It also successfully quantized the massive LLaMA 3.1-70B model using only consumer-grade hardware (64 GB CPU RAM), whereas competitors like Quip# required over 1,000 GB.
