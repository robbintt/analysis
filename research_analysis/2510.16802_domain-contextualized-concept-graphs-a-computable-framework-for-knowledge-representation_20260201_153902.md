## Executive Summary

> **Critical Insight:** Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) treat domains as implicit background, leading to rigid, context-independent definitions that bottleneck advanced AI.

This research introduces the **Domain-Contextualized Concept Graph (CDC)** framework, solving the "context problem" by elevating domains to first-class structural elements. Replacing static triples with a **C-D-C format** (`<Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'>`), the framework utilizes an `@` operator for granular, nested domain scoping (e.g., `HighSchool@Math@Calculus`).

Implemented natively in **Prolog**, the system transforms relations into executable predicates capable of automated logical inference. While quantitative benchmarks are absent, qualitative validation through case studies in personalized education and enterprise knowledge management confirms that CDC successfully enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and semantic continuity over time—capabilities structurally impossible in traditional ontology frameworks.

## Key Findings

*   **Architectural Limitation Identified:** Traditional knowledge graphs are fundamentally limited because they treat domains as implicit context rather than explicit components, restricting dynamic classification and flexible modeling.
*   **The C-D-C Advantage:** Treating domains as first-class elements allows for the modeling of how relationships shift across different environments and contexts.
*   **Computability Verified:** Implementation in Prolog confirms the C-D-C structure is fully computable and supports logical inference without performance degradation.
*   **Advanced Capabilities:** Case studies demonstrate that CDC facilitates:
    *   Context-aware reasoning.
    *   Cross-domain analogy.
    *   Personalized modeling unattainable with traditional systems.

## Methodology

The research is grounded in a **'cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle'**. The authors propose a novel triple format and a standardized set of interaction rules:

*   **C-D-C Triple Format:** `<Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'>`
*   **Dynamic Classification:** Domain specifications are treated as dynamic classification dimensions rather than fixed backgrounds.
*   **Standardized Predicates:** The methodology formalizes over twenty standardized relation predicates to govern concept interactions.
*   **Implementation:** The system is implemented in Prolog to achieve full inference capability and consistency checking.

## Technical Details

The proposed framework introduces specific structural and syntactic innovations to enable computable context:

**Core Architecture**
*   **Domain-Contextualized Concept Graph (CDC):** Elevates 'domains' to first-class structural elements.
*   **Fundamental Unit:** The C-D-C triple: `(Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept')`.

**Syntax & Operators**
*   **@ Symbol:** Used for appending domains (e.g., `HighSchool@Math@Calculus`) to allow nesting and granular scoping.

**Relation Predicates**
*   **Core Library:** Utilizes a standardized set of over twenty core relation predicates (e.g., `is_a`, `part_of`).
*   **Dimensions:** Covers structural, logical, and temporal dimensions.
*   **Cross-Domain Operators:** Introduces operators like `analogous_to` and `fuses_with` for connecting concepts across different scopes.

**Logic Implementation**
*   **Prolog Base:** Every CDC relation is a predicate with explicit inference rules.
*   **Capabilities:** Supports automated reasoning and consistency checking.
