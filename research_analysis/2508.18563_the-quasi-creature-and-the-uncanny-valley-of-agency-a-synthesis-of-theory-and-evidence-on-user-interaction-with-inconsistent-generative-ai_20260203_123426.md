## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical user experience (UX) challenges arising from the inconsistency of generative AI systems that exhibit high linguistic fluency but lack logical reliability. The authors highlight a specific phenomenon where users feel profound discomfort and frustration—termed the **"Quasi-Creature Paradox"**—when interacting with AI that mimics human intelligence without physical embodiment or consistent agency.

The paper argues that these negative user reactions are not merely technical bugs or usability friction points, but rather **"ontological problems"** rooted in cognitive dissonance. As AI systems become more integrated into collaborative workflows, understanding why users experience a breakdown in trust when facing "jarring" failures is essential for the development of sustainable human-computer interaction models.

The study introduces two key theoretical frameworks: the **"Uncanny Valley of Agency"** and the concept of the **"Quasi-Creature."** The Uncanny Valley of Agency posits that user comfort decreases precipitously when an AI demonstrates high agency—acting autonomously and competently—while simultaneously behaving erratically.

Technically, the research employed a modified Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture within a text-only conversational interface. The system was engineered to specifically induce **"The Three U's"**—Unexplainable, Unpredictable, and Uncontrollable responses—to simulate realistic friction points. This technical manipulation allowed the researchers to observe the psychological impact of cognitive breaches during a collaborative creative task, isolating the variable of AI reliability from its linguistic capability.

The empirical study, titled "Move 78," utilized a mixed-methods approach with a total sample size of N=37 participants divided into unbalanced groups of 5, 12, and 20. It is important to note that the study failed to meet standard statistical power thresholds for HCI research; thus, the findings are not statistically generalizable and serve as an illustrative case study.

Despite the limited sample size, the results identified a strong negative correlation between perceived AI efficiency and user frustration. Qualitative data derived from NASA Task Load Index (TLX) scores and interaction transcripts revealed that users experienced **"jarring and persistent dissonance."** The data confirmed that AI failures are perceived as significant cognitive breaches, leading to a unique form of frustration that persists even when the AI displays superhuman fluency.

This research significantly influences the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by shifting the focus of AI evaluation from purely functional metrics to psychological and ontological considerations. By establishing the "Uncanny Valley of Agency" model, the authors provide designers with a new heuristic for predicting user discomfort when balancing autonomy with reliability. The "Quasi-Creature" framework offers a theoretical foundation for understanding the emotional volatility of users collaborating with generative models. Ultimately, this work contributes essential ethical and design guidelines, suggesting that future AI integration must manage user expectations of agency and transparency to bridge the gap between machine efficiency and human cognitive comfort.

## Key Findings

*   **The Uncanny Valley of Agency:** User comfort decreases significantly when interacting with AI that is highly agentic but behaves erratically.
*   **Cognitive Breaches and Dissonance:** AI failures are perceived not merely as errors, but as cognitive breaches caused by a lack of understanding of the system's logic.
*   **The Quasi-Creature Paradox:** User frustration stems from the mental conflict between the AI's superhuman linguistic fluency and its lack of physical embodiment or consistent agency.
*   **Efficiency-Frustration Correlation:** The study identified a strong negative correlation between perceived AI efficiency and user frustration levels.
*   **Ontological Root:** User experience issues with generative AI are identified as ontological problems (related to the nature of being) rather than purely technical glitches.

## Methodology

The research employs a mixed-methods approach combining theoretical synthesis with empirical observation.

*   **Theoretical Synthesis:** Integrates disciplines including Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), cognitive science, and the philosophy of technology.
*   **Empirical Study:** Conducted as a mixed-methods study titled 'Move 78'.
*   **Participants:** N=37.
*   **Task Design:** Users were observed during a collaborative creative task. This setup was designed to measure both performance output and user sentiment simultaneously.

*   **Type:** Text-only conversational application.
*   **Backend:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.
*   **Modifications:** The system was altered to control information access and response patterns.
*   **Reproducibility:** The system is not fully reproducible due to insufficient technical documentation in the paper.

To simulate friction, the AI was engineered to be:
1.  **Unexplainable**
2.  **Unpredictable**
3.  **Uncontrollable**

## Results

*   **Design:** Between-subjects design.
*   **Grouping:** Participants divided into unbalanced groups (5, 12, and 20).
*   **Statistical Power:** The study failed to meet statistical power thresholds typical for HCI studies. Consequently, findings are **not statistically generalizable** and should be viewed as an illustrative case study.
*   **Performance Profile:** The AI displayed an erratic performance, mixing high-level fluency with distinct logic failures.
*   **User Sentiment:** Qualitative analysis revealed a specific type of user frustration described as **"jarring and persistent dissonance."**

## Contributions

*   **Conceptual Framework of the 'Quasi-Creature':** Defines AI entities that simulate intelligence without possessing physical embodiment.
*   **The 'Uncanny Valley of Agency' Model:** Offers a new model to explain user dynamics specifically regarding the intersection of high agency and low reliability.
*   **Explanation of User Frustration:** Provides a theoretical and empirical basis for the specific frustration users feel when using generative AI.
*   **Design and Ethical Implications:** Delivers guidelines for the future design and integration of AI systems based on observed psychological responses.
