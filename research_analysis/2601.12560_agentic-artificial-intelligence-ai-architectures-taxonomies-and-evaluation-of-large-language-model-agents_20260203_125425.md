> ## 💡 Executive Summary
>
> This paper addresses the critical evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive information processors to autonomous "agentic" systems capable of complex reasoning and environmental interaction. As these systems integrate memory, tool use, and feedback loops, the field has become fragmented, lacking a standardized architectural framework. Furthermore, the transition to autonomy introduces severe reliability and security risks, including "hallucination in action," infinite loops, and prompt injection attacks. This research is essential because it tackles the structural confusion in current Agentic AI design and highlights the operational failures that prevent these systems from being deployed safely in high-stakes environments.
>
> The authors introduce a unified taxonomy and formal architecture derived from a comprehensive review of 40 citations, utilizing a taxonomical lens to deconstruct systems by function and environment. A key contribution is the explicit categorization of agent designs into six core components: **Perception, Brain, Planning, Action, Tool Use, and Collaboration**. Technically, the paper proposes a standard architecture defined as a dynamic control system within a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), denoted by the tuple $A = <S, O, M, T, \pi>$. This framework operates via a continuous control loop where Perception maps states to observations, Memory Update manages internal state using mechanisms such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Cognitive Planning performs reasoning, and Action Policy executes decisions. A key innovation highlighted is the architectural shift from linear reasoning to native inference time reasoning, alongside a transition from fixed APIs to open interoperability standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
>
> The paper synthesizes comparative data and reviews current evaluation practices to identify specific performance bottlenecks in state-of-the-art systems. The analysis reveals that **WebVoyager** is hindered by high token costs and visual clutter; **AppAgent** fails when facing dynamic user interfaces; **SeeAct** exhibits a grounding gap regarding coordinate-based actions; **Magma** suffers from latency in video processing; **AudioGPT** struggles with turn-taking mechanics; and **3D LLMs** are limited by low spatial resolution. Despite these specific technical deficits, the review concludes that contemporary LLM-based agents significantly outperform classical symbolic or reinforcement learning agents in open-ended domains, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

> This work provides a foundational roadmap for the future of Agentic AI by establishing a common language and structural framework for researchers and engineers. By categorizing operational environments into digital operating systems, web navigation, embodied robotics, and scientific domains, the authors clarify the distinct requirements for successful agent deployment. The paper’s identification of open challenges—specifically action-based hallucinations and security vulnerabilities—directs future research toward developing robust, secure, and reliable autonomous systems. This synthesis is pivotal for guiding the industry from theoretical prototypes toward production-grade, intelligent agents capable of operating across diverse physical and digital landscapes.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The paper proposes a unified architecture for Agentic AI formalized as a dynamic control system within a **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)**.

### Formal Definition
The system is defined by the tuple:
A = <S, O, M, T, pi>

### Control Loop Functions
The system operates via a control loop with four linked functions:

1.  **Perception:** Maps environment states to observations using multimodal encoders.
2.  **Memory Update:** Maintains a mutable internal state using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
3.  **Cognitive Planning:** Performs latent reasoning steps ranging from Chain of Thought to hierarchical tree search.
4.  **Action Policy:** Selects actions grounded in reasoning traces.

### Architectural Components
*   **Memory:** Vector DBs for persistent storage.
*   **Interfaces:** Action interfaces for tool use.
*   **Cognitive Structures:** Hierarchical structures including Tree of Thoughts and Reflexion.
*   **Topologies:** Multi-agent arrangements (sequential, star, mesh) orchestrated via graph-based frameworks.
