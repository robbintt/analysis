## Executive Summary

> This research addresses the fragmentation and limited generalization of traditional task-specific audio models by investigating whether Large Language Model (LLM)-centric training paradigms can establish a unified audio foundation model. By validating that NLP scaling principles apply to the audio domain, the paper aims to overcome the reliance on isolated, task-specific architectures and move toward generalized, intelligent audio systems capable of complex reasoning and generation.
>
> The core innovation is the empirical validation of "next-token prediction" scaling laws for audio, achieved through a modular architecture featuring a MiMo-Audio-Tokenizer, Patch Encoder, a 7B parameter LLM, and Patch Decoder. The model is trained on a dataset exceeding 100 million hours using a two-stage strategy: Understanding Training followed by Understanding-Generation Joint Training, scaling from 0.0T to 2.0T tokens. Crucially, the methodology incorporates specific "thinking mechanisms" into both audio understanding and generation processes to enhance reasoning and includes an instruction-tuned variant (MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct) curated on a diverse corpus to improve task adherence.
>
> At the 2.0T token checkpoint, the model demonstrates significant scaling and emergent capabilities, achieving approximately 60% accuracy on 5-shot SpeechMMLU (T2S), 35% on 5-shot SpeechMMLU (S2S), and 70% similarity on 16-shot Voice Conversion. The instruction-tuned variant establishes a new open-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) standard, securing COMET scores of ~71.0 on Big Bench Audio (S2S) and ~70.2 (S2T), performance that approaches closed-source models like GPT-4o. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong generalization to unseen tasks absent from its training data, including style transfer, speech editing, and realistic long-form speech continuation.
>
> This work bridges the gap between NLP and audio processing, proving that massive scaling of next-token prediction facilitates the emergence of few-shot learning in audio. By achieving a new performance ceiling for open-source models and releasing both Base and Instruct checkpoints alongside a comprehensive evaluation suite, the authors provide a robust infrastructure for the community, accelerating the development of advanced, reasoning-capable audio foundation models.

## Key Findings

*   **Emergence of Few-Shot Learning**: Scaling pretraining data to over 100 million hours enables the model to develop few-shot learning capabilities, allowing generalization to new tasks with minimal examples.
*   **Open-Source Benchmark Dominance**: The base model (MiMo-Audio-7B-Base) achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance among open-source models on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks.
*   **Generalization to Unseen Tasks**: The model demonstrates the ability to perform tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, speech editing, and realistic long-form speech continuation.
*   **Superior Instruction Following**: The instruction-tuned variant (MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct) achieves open-source SOTA on audio understanding and spoken dialogue benchmarks, approaching or surpassing closed-source models.

## Methodology

*   **Pretraining Paradigm**: Adopted a "next-token prediction" pretraining approach mirroring large language models rather than task-specific fine-tuning.
*   **Massive Data Scaling**: Scaled the pretraining dataset to exceed one hundred million hours of audio to facilitate emergent capabilities.
*   **Post-Training and Reasoning**: Curated a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduced "thinking mechanisms" into both the audio understanding and generation processes to enhance reasoning.

## Results
