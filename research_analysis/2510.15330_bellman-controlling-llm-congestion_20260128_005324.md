## Executive Summary

This research addresses the "**Blindfolded**" LLM Problem, a critical infrastructure inefficiency where first-party applications generate tokens autoregressively without awareness of underlying load. Because current systems lack a feedback loop between server status and the application layer, traffic spikes overwhelm GPU clusters, causing severe latency inflation. Unlike traditional web services that might drop packets to manage load reactively, existing LLM systems typically continue processing every request to completion regardless of stress, leading to unstable user experiences and significant energy waste.

The authors introduce **beLLMan 1**, a novel control framework that establishes an *Active infrastructure-to-application signaling* mechanism to manage congestion explicitly. Moving away from Reactive request dropping, beLLMan 1 dynamically adapts the output length of the LLM generation based on real-time system metrics. Technically, the system interfaces with vLLM to monitor the Time Between Tokens (TBT); when congestion is detected, a linear controller triggers and appends word count constraints to the prompt. This effectively reduces generation length by 5% to 20%, decoupling the application's output from the system's physical load constraints and allowing for graceful degradation of quantity rather than quality of service.

Validated on a testbed of 8x NVIDIA H100 GPUs running a 27B parameter model, beLLMan 1 demonstrated significant improvements over baselines during a summarization workload of 100 ACM IMC papers. Under high-load conditions (specifically at request rates exceeding 2.4), the system achieved an **8× reduction in end-to-end inferencing latency** and a **25% reduction in energy consumption**. Furthermore, the controller successfully served 19% more requests compared to standard approaches. Semantic quality was maintained throughout the process, as verified by an "LLM-as-a-judge" evaluation, confirming that the system preserved utility despite the dynamic truncation.

beLLMan 1 represents a paradigm shift in LLM serving systems by moving from passive request handling to active, cross-layer congestion control. By proving that output length is a viable control lever, this work provides a multi-dimensional optimization strategy that simultaneously addresses latency, energy efficiency, and throughput. This approach is likely to influence the design of future inference infrastructure, encouraging tighter integration between application logic and hardware resource management to ensure robust performance at scale.

## Key Findings

*   **Latency Stability:** Achieved up to an **8× reduction** in end-to-end inferencing latency during congestion periods on H100 GPUs.
*   **Energy Efficiency:** Reduced energy consumption by approximately **25%** while operating under congested conditions.
*   **Increased Throughput:** Served **19% more requests** compared to the baseline during periods of high load.
*   **Workload Validation:** Performance metrics were specifically validated using a summarization workload (100 ACM IMC papers).
*   **User Experience:** The controller successfully prevented latency inflation, maintaining a stable user experience despite changing system loads.

## Technical Details

BeLLMan controls congestion by dynamically reducing LLM output length rather than dropping requests. The system architecture is built around the following components:

### Core Mechanism
*   **Prompt Appending:** Adds word count constraints to the user prompt to enforce shorter outputs during high load.
*   **Word-Based Granularity:** Uses word-based granularity rather than tokens for better model adherence to constraints.

### Control Loop
*   **Interface:** Operates within the 1P LLM serving system interfacing with **vLLM**.
*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitors **Time Between Tokens (TBT)** as the primary congestion signal.
*   **Controller:** Utilizes a linear controller to adjust the word reduction rate (**r**).
*   **Adjustment Range:** Dynamically sets the reduction rate between **5% and 20%** based on real-time metrics.

### Quality Assurance
*   **Semantic Evaluation:** Uses an **'LLM-as-a-judge'** approach (OpenAI o3) to evaluate and ensure semantic quality is preserved despite truncation.

## Methodology & Contributions

### Methodology
The researchers introduced **'beLLMan 1,'** a controller designed to allow LLM infrastructure to actively signal current system load to the first-party application. This approach establishes an **infrastructure-to-application feedback loop** to progressively communicate and make real-time adjustments. The primary control lever used to manage load is adjusting the output length of the LLM generation in response to infrastructure signals.

### Core Contributions
1.  **Solving the "Blindfolded" Problem:** Identified and solved the issue where applications generate tokens autoregressively without awareness of underlying infrastructure load.
2.  **Novel Framework:** Proposed the beLLMan control framework, which decouples the application's output generation from the system's load constraints via active signaling.
3.  **Multi-Dimensional Optimization:** Demonstrated that adapting output length based on system signals provides a multi-dimensional benefit, simultaneously optimizing **latency**, **energy consumption**, and **request throughput**.
