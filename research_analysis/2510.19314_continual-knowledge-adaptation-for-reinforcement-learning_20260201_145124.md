## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents operating in dynamic, non-stationary environments face the critical challenge of **catastrophic forgetting**, where the acquisition of new skills overwrites or degrades previously learned knowledge. This "stability-plasticity dilemma" complicates the development of lifelong learning agents capable of accumulating expertise over time without retaining extensive historical data. Furthermore, many existing continual learning solutions rely on expanding network architectures or maintaining large experience replay buffers, which introduces prohibitive memory costs and scalability issues.

**Innovation**
The authors propose **Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL)**, a framework built on a decomposed parameter architecture that freezes a base set of parameters while maintaining a separate pool of task-specific knowledge vectors. Technically, CKA-RL constructs policy parameters for the current task by combining the frozen base parameters with a weighted sum of relevant historical vectors and a newly initialized vector. Crucially, during training, only the adaptation factors and the current task vector are optimized. To ensure scalability, the framework introduces an **Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism** that clusters and combines similar task vectors, enforcing a fixed memory bound.

**Results**
Empirical validation demonstrates that CKA-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance in continual RL settings. The framework realized a **4.20% improvement in overall performance** compared to baseline methods and an **8.02% increase in forward transfer efficiency**. The method successfully mitigated catastrophic forgetting, and the Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism proved effective in resource management, significantly reducing memory requirements while preventing appreciable degradation in knowledge retention.

**Impact**
This research significantly advances the field of continual reinforcement learning by providing a scalable solution that balances plasticity and stability without relying on memory-intensive replay buffers. By decoupling base knowledge from task-specific adaptations, CKA-RL offers a parameter-efficient pathway toward building lifelong learning agents capable of operating in complex, real-world environments.

## Methodology

The research introduces the **Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL)** framework, which addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma through two primary components:

1.  **Continual Knowledge Adaptation Strategy**
    This strategy maintains a **task-specific knowledge vector pool** designed to dynamically apply historical knowledge to current tasks. By separating task-specific information from the base model, the system can selectively recall relevant skills without interference.

2.  **Adaptive Knowledge Merging Mechanism**
    To resolve scalability issues associated with storing an ever-growing number of task vectors, this mechanism combines similar vectors. This process reduces memory usage while preserving essential information, ensuring the system remains efficient as the number of tasks increases.

## Technical Details

The implementation of CKA-RL relies on a decomposed parameter architecture designed for stability and efficiency:

*   **Architecture Composition**
    *   **Frozen Base Parameters:** A static set of parameters that serve as the foundational knowledge for the agent.
    *   **Task-Specific Knowledge Vectors:** A dynamic pool of vectors where each vector corresponds to specific task knowledge.

*   **Policy Construction**
    Policy parameters for the current task are constructed by combining the frozen base parameters with:
    *   A weighted sum of historical vectors.
    *   A new vector initialized for the current task.
    *   **Weighting Factors:** Learnable parameters derived via softmax operations to control the influence of historical knowledge.

*   **Optimization Process**
    *   **Updated Components:** Only the adaptation factors (weights) and the current task vector are optimized during training.
    *   **Frozen Components:** The base model and all previous task vectors remain frozen to prevent interference and catastrophic forgetting.

*   **Scalability Management**
    The adaptive knowledge merging mechanism monitors vector similarity and combines vectors that exceed a similarity threshold. This allows the system to maintain a **fixed memory limit** regardless of the number of tasks encountered.
