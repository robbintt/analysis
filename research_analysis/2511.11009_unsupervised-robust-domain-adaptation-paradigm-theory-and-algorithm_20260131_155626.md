## Executive Summary

This research formulates the problem of Unsupervised Robust Domain Adaptation (URDA), addressing the inherent conflict between adapting models to unlabeled target domains and maintaining robustness against adversarial attacks. The authors identify an "entanglement challenge" in which standard adversarial robustness methods, specifically Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT), fail when applied to domain adaptation. VAT enforces local smoothness on features, which disrupts the feature alignments essential for transferability, leading to significant performance degradation in the target domain. This creates a critical barrier for deploying machine learning in dynamic environments where models must generalize across domains while remaining secure adversarial inputs.

The core innovation is the Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART) algorithm, underpinned by a novel theoretical generalization bound that simultaneously accounts for domain discrepancy and adversarial noise. Unlike post-hoc approaches, DART employs a simultaneous training strategy that decouples the conflicting objectives of robustness and transferability. By disentangling the optimization process, the algorithm prevents the adversarial smoothing component from interfering with the domain alignment component.

This technical distinction allows the model to learn robust features that are invariant to adversarial perturbations while preserving the transferable representations necessary for high accuracy on target domains. The methodology was rigorously evaluated across four benchmark datasets: **Office-31**, **Office-Home**, **VisDA-2017**, and **ImageNet-VID**. Experimental results demonstrate that DART maintains accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art non-robust UDA methods under standard clean conditions, confirming that adaptability is not sacrificed. In adversarial settings, DART significantly outperforms standard VAT baselines.
