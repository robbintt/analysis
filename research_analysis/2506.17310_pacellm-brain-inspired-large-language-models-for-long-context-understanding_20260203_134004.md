## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical limitations in Large Language Models (LLMs) regarding long-context understanding, specifically focusing on the issues of information decay and semantic fragmentation. As LLMs process longer sequences, they often suffer from transient neural activations that cause earlier information to fade, as well as unstructured feed-forward network (FFN) weights that fail to maintain semantic coherence across distant tokens. These deficiencies restrict the effective context window of current models, hindering performance on complex tasks requiring multi-document analysis or the retrieval of specific details from massive datasets.

The authors propose **PaceLLM**, a brain-inspired framework that integrates biological principles of working memory and cortical modularity into LLM architectures. The solution introduces two specific, non-invasive components: the **Persistent Activity (PA) Mechanism** and the **Cortical Expert (CE) Clustering**. The PA mechanism utilizes an Activation Memory Bank (AMB) to dynamically store, retrieve, and update critical FFN states—mimicking the persistent firing of prefrontal cortex neurons to mitigate information decay through strategies like reuse, mix, and replace. Simultaneously, CE clustering reorganizes unstructured FFN weights into semantic modules (experts), establishing cross-token dependencies to resolve semantic fragmentation.

This architecture is designed to be compatible with existing models, such as Qwen-2-7B, without requiring fundamental structural overhauls. PaceLLM demonstrated significant performance improvements across standard long-context benchmarks. On the LongBench Multi-document QA task, the model achieved a 6% improvement over baselines, while Infinite-Bench tasks showed substantial gains ranging from 12.5% to 17.5%. Furthermore, during Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) tests, the framework successfully extended the model's measurable context length to 200,000 tokens while maintaining high retrieval accuracy.

These results confirm that the approach effectively mitigates information decay and reduces semantic fragmentation without degrading the model's general capabilities. The significance of PaceLLM lies in its ability to enhance long-context capabilities and interpretability through a biologically grounded, complementary enhancement path.

## Methodology

The research proposes a brain-inspired framework named PaceLLM, drawing from the brain's working memory and cortical modularity. It introduces two specific architectural innovations:

*   **Persistent Activity (PA) Mechanism**
    Mimicking the persistent firing of prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons, this component introduces an activation-level memory bank. It dynamically retrieves, reuses, and updates critical Feed-Forward Network (FFN) states to address contextual decay.

*   **Cortical Expert (CE) Clustering**
    Emulating task-adaptive neural specialization, this mechanism reorganizes unstructured FFN weights into semantic modules. This establishes cross-token dependencies to mitigate semantic fragmentation.

## Technical Details

PaceLLM introduces a neuroscience-inspired architecture targeting Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) to mitigate information decay and semantic fragmentation in long-context LLMs.

### Core Components

| Component | Biological Inspiration | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Activation Memory Bank (AMB)** | Prefrontal Cortex | Stores and retrieves intermediate activations using similarity-based strategies (reuse, mix, or replace) with noise injection. |
| **Cortical Expert (CE)** | Cortical Modularity | Clusters FFN weights into expert groups and reorders matrices to improve semantic coherence. |

### Architecture Design
*   **Target:** Specifically targets Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs).
*   **Compatibility:** Non-invasive design compatible with existing models like Qwen-2-7B.
*   **Strategy:** Focuses on structural limitations of transient activations and unstructured weights.
