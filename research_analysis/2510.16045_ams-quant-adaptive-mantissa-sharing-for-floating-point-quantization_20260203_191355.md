## 📋 Executive Summary

This research addresses the inherent inefficiency of standard floating-point quantization, which is conventionally restricted to integer bit-widths (e.g., FP4, FP8, FP16). As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale, memory bandwidth and storage capacity become primary bottlenecks for inference deployment. While reducing precision improves speed, the discrete jumps between standard integer formats often force a harsh trade-off: aggressive compression leads to significant accuracy degradation, while conservative formats fail to maximize hardware efficiency. The paper highlights the need for more flexible quantization strategies that can exploit "sweet spots" between traditional integer formats to optimize resource utilization without sacrificing model reliability.

The core innovation, **AMS-Quant (Adaptive Mantissa Sharing)**, introduces a mechanism for non-integer floating-point quantization through a technique called "Mantissa-bit Sharing". By grouping $k$ quantized weights to share the least significant bit (LSB) of their mantissas, the method achieves non-standard formats such as FP-5.33-e2m3 and FP-4.25-e2m2. To manage the complexity of this grouping, the authors employ an "Adaptive Searching" strategy, an offline optimization process that identifies optimal configurations to minimize accuracy loss. The approach is practically realized through custom CUDA Linear kernels designed for weight-only quantization (activations remain FP16), optimizing memory access patterns to convert theoretical compression into tangible wall-clock latency reductions.

AMS-Quant demonstrates substantial performance improvements while preserving accuracy across large-scale models. Compared to standard FP16 inference, the method achieves up to a **2.77x speedup** and a **66.7% reduction in memory usage** with the FP-5.33-e2m3 format, while the FP-4.25-e2m2 format yields up to a **3.2x speedup**. In accuracy benchmarks on Llama-3.2-3B and Qwen3-4B using the GSM8k dataset, the FP6-e2m3 configuration maintained near-parity with FP16 baselines (e.g., 77.10 vs. 77.41 for Llama). Conversely, lower standard integer formats like FP4-e2m1 suffered significant accuracy drops, validating the efficacy of non-integer intermediate formats.

This work is significant as the first exploration of non-integer bit-width floating-point quantization for LLMs, effectively expanding the design space for model compression. By introducing Mantissa-bit Sharing as a novel compression technique and validating it with functional CUDA kernels, the authors bridge the gap between theoretical efficiency and practical system implementation. This research challenges the status quo of integer-restricted quantization, suggesting that future hardware and software co-design could benefit significantly from fine-grained, non-standard precision formats to deploy massive models more efficiently.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The core methodology, **AMS-Quant**, advances floating-point quantization by moving beyond integer bit-widths to non-integer "sweet spots." It is implemented through two primary components:

1.  **Mantissa-bit Sharing:** This technique groups $k$ quantized weights together to share the least significant bit of their mantissas.
2.  **Adaptive Searching:** An offline optimization strategy employed to identify optimal configurations and minimize accuracy degradation.

The approach is realized via efficient **CUDA Linear kernels** designed to reduce memory access and translate compression ratios into real-world speed.
