> ### Executive Summary
>
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed for complex reasoning tasks but struggle with hallucinations and factual inaccuracies. Integrating structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offers a solution, yet this requires transforming graph data into text—a process whose specific impact on reasoning capabilities remains poorly defined. This paper addresses the lack of rigorous evaluation regarding how different textual representations of KGs affect model performance, introducing **KG-LLM-Bench**, a standardized benchmarking framework designed to isolate and compare the effects of textualization strategies.
>
> The methodology systematically evaluates five distinct textualization strategies across seven different LLMs and five specific core tasks. Technically, the framework employs pseudonymization—mapping entity labels to generic tokens—to ensure models rely on context-based reasoning rather than pre-trained memory. Experimental results demonstrate that the textualization strategy is a statistically significant performance factor, with optimal methods yielding absolute improvements of up to **17.5%**. Crucially, the study concludes that there is no single universally optimal textualization approach; success depends on the specific interaction between model architecture and encoding strategy. This research establishes textualization configuration as a primary determinant of reasoning success in KG-augmented LLMs, shifting the paradigm away from one-size-fits-all encoding approaches.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Impact:** The textualization process significantly impacts LLM performance, with variations notably dependent on the encoding strategy used.
*   **No Universal Optimal:** Extensive testing across seven language models shows no single approach is universally optimal; performance depends on the interplay between the specific model and the strategy.
*   **Actionable Insights:** The study provides data-driven insights for optimizing LLM performance on knowledge graph reasoning tasks.

## Methodology

The research introduced **KG-LLM-Bench**, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating knowledge graph understanding tasks. The study's experimental design was comprehensive, involving:

*   **Models:** Experiments conducted using seven different language models.
*   **Strategies:** Evaluation of five distinct textualization strategies.
*   **Objective:** To assess how different encoding strategies affect performance across various base models.

## Contributions

The primary contributions of this paper to the field of Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graphs include:

1.  **Standardized Benchmarking:** The introduction of **KG-LLM-Bench**, a standard for evaluating knowledge graph understanding in LLMs.
2.  **Empirical Evaluation:** A large-scale empirical evaluation analyzing the impact of textualization on model performance.
3.  **Optimization Framework:** A set of optimization guidelines and a framework for improving LLM performance on KG reasoning tasks.

## Technical Details

The paper proposes **KG-LLM-Bench**, a framework designed to evaluate how LLMs process Knowledge Graphs (KGs) presented in-context.

### Architecture Definition
*   **Knowledge Graph:** Defined as $K = (E, R, T)$
*   **Subgraphs:** Operates on subgraphs $G = (G_E, G_R, G_T)$

### Pipeline Stages
1.  **Pseudonymization:**
    *   Maps entity labels to generic pseudonyms.
    *   **Purpose:** Ensures reliance on context rather than pre-training bias.
2.  **Textualization:**
    *   Function: $f(G)$ converting subgraphs to text.
    *   **Strategies Tested:** List of Edges, JSON, and others.
3.  **LLM Generation:**
    *   Function: $c, q$ producing a response.
    *   Queries and answers generated via stochastic functions with fixed seeds to ensure reproducibility.

### Evaluation Scope
*   **Strategies:** 5 Distinct textualization strategies.
*   **Models:** 7 Different LLMs.
*   **Tasks:** 5 Specific tasks (e.g., triple retrieval, shortest path).

## Results

*   **Statistical Significance:** The textualization strategy has a statistically significant impact on LLM performance. The optimal strategy yielded an absolute performance improvement of up to **17.5%**.
*   **Variability:** No single textualization approach is universally optimal across the seven tested LLMs. Performance is highly dependent on the interaction between model architecture and encoding strategy.
*   **Qualitative Example:**
    *   *JSON Format:* Produced the correct answer ('France') for a G7 border query.
    *   *List of Edges Format:* Produced an incorrect answer ('Switzerland') for the same query.
*   **Memorization Analysis:** Analysis using pseudonyms confirmed that LLMs rely on reasoning from the provided context rather than pre-trained memorization.
