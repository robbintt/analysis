> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) is often constrained by the substantial memory and computational resources required for inference. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is the standard method for compressing models without costly retraining, pushing compression to the extreme—specifically **1-bit weight binarization** combined with **6-bit activation quantization**—typically results in severe performance degradation.
>
> This degradation arises from weight distributions that are inherently non-quantization-friendly and the presence of activation outliers, which traditional PTQ methods fail to address effectively at such low precisions.
>
> The authors introduce **DBellQuant**, a novel PTQ framework centered on the **Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB) algorithm**. The core technical innovation is a transformation strategy that reshapes the standard single-bell (Gaussian-like) weight distribution into a "dual-bell" distribution. This specific reshaping makes the weights significantly more amenable to binarization, thereby minimizing quantization error. To maintain model equilibrium, the framework simultaneously applies an inverse transformation to smooth activations, effectively neutralizing the negative impact of activation outliers without requiring expensive model retraining.
>
> In evaluations on the LLaMA2-13B model using the Wikitext2 dataset, the framework achieved a **perplexity (PPL) of 14.39** while utilizing near 1-bit weights and 6-bit activations. This represents a significant performance improvement over existing baselines, notably outperforming the BiLLM method (PPL 21.35). These results demonstrate that extreme compression can be achieved with minimal loss in model accuracy, paving the way for deploying massive models on resource-constrained edge devices.
