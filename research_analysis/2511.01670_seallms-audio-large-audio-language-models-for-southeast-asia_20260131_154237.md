## 📋 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical performance disparity in **Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs)** for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages, which have historically lagged behind high-resource languages. Existing models often fail to capture the linguistic nuances and acoustic diversity of SEA languages such as Indonesian, Thai, and Vietnamese, hindering the deployment of effective voice-enabled AI in the region.

The core innovation is the introduction of **SeaLLMs-Audio**, the first LALM specifically tailored for the Southeast Asian linguistic landscape. Technically, the model utilizes a unified architecture integrating a Qwen2-Audio-7B Audio Encoder with a Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct LLM. The researchers employed full-parameter fine-tuning on a curated dataset of 1.58M multilingual conversations. This architecture supports flexible processing modes—audio-only, text-only, and combined—enabling the system to handle tasks ranging from ASR to complex voice-based chat.

To validate the model’s capabilities, the authors introduced **SeaBench-Audio**, a rigorous benchmark comprising 580 human-annotated questions across 14 distinct tasks. The evaluation covered English, Indonesian, Thai, and Vietnamese, graded by professional linguists using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach. Benchmarking against strong baselines like Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct and MERaLiON-AudioLLM, SeaLLMs-Audio demonstrated competitive regional performance.

The significance of this work lies in establishing a critical foundation for audio AI research in low-resource SEA languages, setting a new standard for regional model development. By releasing both a high-performance model and a rigorous open benchmark, the authors provide the community with tools to drive innovation, lowering the barrier to entry for AI accessibility throughout Southeast Asia.
