## Executive Summary

Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments requires aggressive quantization, often targeting extremely low bit-widths (e.g., 2-bit). However, existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods typically suffer from significant accuracy degradation at these extreme compression levels. While Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) can recover accuracy, it is computationally prohibitive and prone to optimization instability. Conversely, heuristic-based PTQ approaches (such as those used in llama.cpp) often fail to accurately identify layer sensitivities, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper addresses the critical challenge of minimizing the accuracy gap in extreme low-bit quantization without the high resource costs of retraining.

SignRoundV2 introduces a novel PTQ framework that replaces heuristic sensitivity estimation with a mathematically rigorous, gradient-based approach. The core innovation is the **"DeltaLoss" sensitivity metric**, which utilizes a first-order Taylor expansion to estimate the change in loss based primarily on activation distortion. This metric drives a Dynamic Programming algorithm that optimizes layer-wise bit allocation to minimize total DeltaLoss subject to a target bit-width. Furthermore, the method employs a lightweight pre-tuning scale search strategy, which optimizes initial scale parameters by minimizing a search function over candidates generated via controlled perturbations.

SignRoundV2 successfully minimizes the accuracy gap between quantized and full-precision models in extreme compression scenarios. At 4-5 bit quantization, the method achieves production-ready performance with an accuracy gap of approximately 1% compared to the full-precision baseline. Remarkably, it maintains robust results at 2-bit quantization for large-scale models like Llama 2/3 70B without requiring manual mixed-precision schemes. Benchmarks demonstrate that SignRoundV2 captures layer sensitivities more accurately than heuristic methods like llama.cpp, particularly for critical layers such as `down_proj`, thereby avoiding the significant accuracy pitfalls of traditional low-bit PTQ.

This research significantly advances the field of model compression by proving that LLMs can sustain competitive accuracy at 2-bit widths without resorting to Quantization-Aware Training. By providing a PTQ solution that avoids the high resource demands and optimization instability associated with QAT, SignRoundV2 offers a practical path for deploying massive models on edge devices with limited memory and compute.

## Methodology

SignRoundV2 utilizes a comprehensive Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) framework designed to optimize model compression while preserving accuracy.

*   **Gradient-Based Sensitivity Metric:** Unlike heuristic methods, SignRoundV2 employs a gradient-based metric to dynamically assess the sensitivity of each layer.
