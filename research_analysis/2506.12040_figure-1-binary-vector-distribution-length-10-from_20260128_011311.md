## Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the critical challenge of sub-1-bit quantization for Large Language Models (LLMs), a frontier in model compression necessary for deploying massive models on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing sub-1-bit methods typically face a triad of debilitating limitations: severe performance deterioration (often resulting in "**performance collapse**" where the model loses most of its accuracy), high computational complexity during inference, and poor hardware compatibility. This incompatibility largely stems from a reliance on sparse mask management, which fails to run efficiently on standard hardware accelerators designed for dense matrix operations. The paper targets the disconnect between theoretical compression limits and practical deployment feasibility, seeking a method that achieves extreme memory reduction without sacrificing accuracy or requiring specialized hardware support.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce **BTC-LLM** (Binary Codebook-LLM), a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that innovates by replacing traditional sparse mask reliance with a clustering-based compression scheme. The framework operates on two technical pillars:
1.  **Learnable Transformation**, which optimizes an invertible diagonal scaling matrix ($\Lambda$) and an orthogonal rotation matrix ($R$) using Cayley SGD. This mechanism aligns the distribution of binarized weights with their full-precision counterparts to enhance layer-wise representation quality.
2.  **Flash and Accurate Binary Codebook**, which identifies and clusters recurring binary vectors ($\pm 1$) using tailored distance metrics (Hamming distance via XOR/POPCNT) and sign-based centroid updates.

Crucially, the transformation matrices are merged into the weight matrix during inference, ensuring that the optimization process adds **zero computational overhead** at run time.

**Results**
Experimental results on LLaMA-2-7B demonstrate that BTC-LLM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in both stability and efficiency. The framework achieved exceptional activation outlier suppression, reaching a maximum absolute value of **0.4** compared to **8** for FP16, **15** for BiLLM, and **10** for ARB-LLM. In direct comparison to the STBLLM baseline, which suffered "Performance Collapse" (retaining only 51%–65% accuracy) and incurred a computational penalty of 2.5x slower speed alongside 3x higher memory usage, BTC-LLM maintained superior accuracy while operating efficiently on standard hardware. Furthermore, the approach validates the standard promise of binary quantization, reducing memory requirements by **over 32x** compared to FP16 baselines.

**Impact**
The significance of this research lies in its removal of the primary barriers to deploying extreme compression models in real-world environments. By eliminating the need for sparse mask management, BTC-LLM enables efficient sub-1-bit inference on standard, commercially available hardware rather than requiring custom, sparsity-aware accelerators. This lowers the barrier to entry for deploying highly efficient LLMs across a wider range of devices. By successfully combining adaptive weight transformation with binary pattern clustering, the paper establishes a new paradigm for post-training quantization that bridges the gap between theoretical compression limits and practical, high-performance deployment.
