## Executive Summary

Current data annotation systems primarily focus on the isolated act of labeling, lacking the infrastructure to manage the complex, end-to-end lifecycle of data production. This creates a critical gap where the optimization of task assignment, the synergistic integration of diverse workforces, and the management of cost-quality trade-offs are treated as separate or manual processes. As reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs) alongside human annotators grows, the field lacks a unified mechanism to orchestrate these heterogeneous resources efficiently. This paper addresses this limitation by identifying the need for **holistic process control**—a system that moves beyond simple labeling to manage the entire "virtual annotation" workflow, ensuring that diverse agents collaborate rationally rather than operating in silos.

The core innovation is **CrowdAgent**, a multi-agent system designed to function as a "virtual annotation company" utilizing ReAct-style reasoning for end-to-end process control. Unlike traditional pipelines, CrowdAgent introduces a hierarchical agent structure comprising a Scheduling Agent (central decision-maker), a QA Agent (performing iterative Bayesian inference with confusion matrices), a Financing Agent (analyzing cost-effectiveness), and diverse Annotation Agents (LLMs, SLMs, and Humans). Technically, the system employs a sophisticated workflow where LLMs generate initial labels using diverse prompts and In-Context Learning (ICL), followed by SLMs that perform denoising via noisy-label learning and Gaussian Mixture Models. The Scheduling Agent uses reflection mechanisms to dynamically assign tasks based on real-time feedback from the QA and Financing agents, ensuring that difficult samples are routed to human experts while routine tasks are handled efficiently by models.

CrowdAgent was rigorously evaluated against strong baselines, including GPT-4o mini, FreeAL, and Active Learning methods, across six diverse multimodal classification tasks. The system achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on all datasets, with specific scores of 89.25% on Human Cri-Info, 89.37% on Cri-Hum, 65.79% on Cri-Dam, 85.66% on MM-IMDb, 98.21% on COV-CTR, and 88.45% on V-SNLI. Notably, CrowdAgent demonstrated significant performance gains on challenging benchmarks, improving accuracy by +8.65% on Cri-Dam and +5.92% on V-SNLI compared to baselines. Furthermore, the system outperformed pure LLM baselines by a substantial margin of 10 to 25 percentage points, validating the efficacy of its collaborative, multi-source approach.

The significance of CrowdAgent lies in its paradigm shift from isolated labeling algorithms to holistic, management-oriented annotation systems. By successfully integrating LLMs, SLMs, and human experts into a synergistic workflow, the research establishes a new standard for process control in data-centric AI. This approach provides a practical framework for researchers and industry practitioners to optimize both the quality and cost of data annotation, moving beyond the limitations of fully automated or purely manual methods. The release of the source code and video demo further amplifies this impact, offering a reproducible and extensible foundation for future research into multi-agent orchestration and resource-aware machine learning pipelines.
