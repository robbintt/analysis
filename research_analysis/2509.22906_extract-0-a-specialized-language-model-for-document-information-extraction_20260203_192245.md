## Executive Summary

The research addresses the inefficiency and suboptimal performance of massive, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) when applied to Document Information Extraction (DIE). While state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 and o3 are frequently used for parsing unstructured text into structured data, they incur high computational costs and often struggle with the inherent ambiguity of extraction tasks. The paper highlights a critical gap: the pursuit of ever-larger general-purpose models overlooks the potential for smaller, specialized architectures to achieve superior accuracy on specific vertical tasks. Consequently, the industry lacks a cost-effective, high-precision solution for DIE that can handle diverse document types without the resource overhead of frontier models.

The core innovation is **Extract-0**, a 7-billion parameter model derived from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, trained via a specialized three-stage pipeline designed for high parameter efficiency and disambiguation. The methodology begins with a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that creates 280,128 diverse examples from sources like arXiv and PubMed. The model undergoes Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), freezing the majority of weights and modifying only 0.53% (40.4 million parameters) to reduce resource strain. Crucially, the pipeline concludes with a reinforcement learning phase employing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This stage utilizes a novel reward function based on field-level semantic similarity—using techniques like bipartite matching for lists and MiniLM cosine similarity for embeddings—to explicitly handle the nuances and ambiguities of extraction, ensuring the model outputs semantically accurate structured data.

Extract-0 demonstrated significant performance advantages over leading general-purpose frontier models on a benchmark of 1,000 held-out extraction tasks. With a Mean Reward of 0.573, Extract-0 outperformed GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). These results were achieved with remarkable resource efficiency; the total training cost was approximately $196, and the model reached state-of-the-art performance by updating only 40.4 million parameters. The reinforcement learning phase proved particularly effective, resolving extraction ambiguities that typically hinder general-purpose models, while the use of LoRA with a rank of 16 and alpha of 32 validated that high performance does not require modifying the full parameter set of the base model.

This research challenges the prevailing industry narrative that scale is the primary driver of performance, establishing a new paradigm where task-specific optimization outperforms massive generalization. By demonstrating that a 7-billion parameter model can surpass GPT-4 class models in a complex domain like information extraction, the authors provide empirical evidence that specialized, smaller models are a viable and superior alternative for enterprise applications.
