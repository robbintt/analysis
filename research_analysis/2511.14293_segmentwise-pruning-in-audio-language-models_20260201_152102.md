## Executive Summary

Audio-language models (ALMs) face a critical computational bottleneck because their processing costs scale linearly with the duration of the input sequence. Since audio data is inherently dense and lengthy compared to text or static images, the need to process extensive token sequences results in prohibitive latency and resource consumption. This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing computational efficiency in ALMs, specifically focusing on how to reduce the sequence length without sacrificing the semantic understanding required for downstream tasks.

The authors introduce **"segmentwise pruning,"** a lightweight token selection strategy adapted from the vision-language domain but specifically tailored for audio inputs. The core technical innovation is the explicit integration of the time dimension into the selection mechanism. By operating on a segmentwise basis, the method identifies and retains only the most relevant acoustic tokens while discarding redundant or non-informative segments. This time-aware approach allows for aggressive compression of the input sequence before it reaches the computationally expensive transformer layers, optimizing the architecture specifically for the temporal nature of audio.

Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves a 4x reduction in token count, compressing input sequences to just 25% of their original length. Despite this aggressive pruning, the model maintains high performance with minimal degradation. On the Clotho v2 dataset for audio captioning, the maximum relative decrease in CIDEr score was only 2%. Similarly, on the MMAU dataset for audio classification, the maximum relative drop in accuracy was 4%. These results indicate that significant compression can be achieved while keeping performance loss within a negligible margin (under 5%).

This research is significant as it validates the transferability of token pruning techniques from vision-language to audio-language models, establishing a new efficiency paradigm for processing long-form audio. By demonstrating that a 75% reduction in tokens is feasible with minimal accuracy loss, the authors provide a viable pathway for deploying complex audio-language models in resource-constrained environments. This work paves the way for faster inference and lower computational costs, potentially enabling real-time applications of audio understanding systems that were previously too computationally expensive.

*   **Cross-Domain Efficacy:** Token selection strategies proven effective in the vision-language domain are relevant and highly effective when applied to audio-language models.
*   **Aggressive Compression:** A lightweight pruning strategy that accounts for the time dimension can reduce the token count to **25%** of the initial sequence.
*   **Robust Performance:** Despite retaining only a quarter of the tokens, the proposed approach maintains strong performance, with a maximum relative decrease of only **2% in CIDEr** (Clotho v2) and **4% in accuracy** (MMAU).

## Methodology

The study investigates the transferability of vision-language token pruning methods to audio-language models. Based on this investigation, the authors propose a specific lightweight token selection strategy designed for audio data. This approach explicitly integrates the time dimension (**segmentwise pruning**) to identify and retain relevant tokens while discarding redundant ones, thereby optimizing the input sequence for the model.
