## Executive Summary

As the Requirements Engineering (RE) field increasingly adopts Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks like requirements classification, organizations face significant trade-offs regarding computational cost, data privacy, and the latency of cloud-based APIs. While LLMs offer advanced reasoning capabilities, their necessity for specific classification tasks—categorizing requirements into functional or non-functional buckets—remains questioned in light of their resource intensity.

This paper addresses the critical problem of whether the substantial overhead of LLMs is justified for classification, or if smaller, more efficient models can achieve comparable results without the associated operational and security risks. To resolve this uncertainty, the authors conducted a rigorous comparative study evaluating eight top-ranked language models against three specific public datasets: **PROMISE**, **PROMISE Reclass**, and **SecReq**.

The study contrasts three Large Language Models against five Small Language Models (SLMs) ranging from 7 to 8 billion parameters. The findings reveal a negligible performance gap, with LLMs achieving an average F1 score only 2% higher than SLMs—a difference deemed statistically insignificant. Crucially, the study identified **Dataset Sensitivity** as a decisive factor, demonstrating that dataset characteristics influenced performance outcomes more than model size alone. SLMs delivered this competitive performance while being 100 to 300 times smaller in parameter size.

## Key Findings

*   **Negligible Performance Gap:** LLMs achieved an average F1 score only 2% higher than SLMs. This difference was determined to be statistically insignificant.
*   **Superior Recall:** SLMs matched LLM performance across most datasets and notably outperformed LLMs in recall metrics on the PROMISE Reclass dataset.
*   **Efficiency:** SLMs delivered comparable accuracy while being up to 300 times smaller in parameter size.
*   **Dataset Sensitivity:** Dataset characteristics (such as domain and structure) influenced performance more significantly than model size alone.

## Methodology

The study was designed as a preliminary comparative analysis focusing on Requirements Engineering tasks. The research design included the following components:

1.  **Model Selection:** Evaluated eight distinct language models, divided into two categories:
    *   **3 Large Language Models (LLMs):** Top-tier models in the 1–2 trillion parameter range.
    *   **5 Small Language Models (SLMs):** Efficient models in the 7–8 billion parameter range.
2.  **Datasets:** Utilized three specific public datasets to ensure broad applicability:
    *   PROMISE
    *   PROMISE Reclass
    *   SecReq
3.  **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance was measured primarily using **F1 scores** and **Recall** metrics to determine statistical significance and accuracy differences.

## Results

The analysis revealed that the best-performing LLM was **Claude-4**, while the best-performing SLM was **Llama-3-8B**.

### Head-to-Head Comparison (F1 Scores)

| Dataset | Claude-4 (LLM) | Llama-3-8B (SLM) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **PROMISE** | 0.81 | 0.76 |
| **PROMISE Reclass** | 0.80 | 0.78 |
| **SecReq** | 0.89 | 0.88 |

### Key Takeaways
*   **Statistical Insignificance:** The marginal gap in F1 scores does not justify the computational overhead of LLMs for this specific task.
*   **Recall Performance:** SLMs matched or outperformed LLMs in recall, specifically excelling on the PROMISE Reclass dataset.
*   **Parameter Efficiency:** SLMs delivered comparable accuracy with parameter sizes 100 to 300 times smaller than their LLM counterparts.
