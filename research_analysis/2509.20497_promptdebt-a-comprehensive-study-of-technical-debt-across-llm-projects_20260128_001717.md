## 📑 Executive Summary

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to software engineering, they introduce unique maintenance challenges that differ fundamentally from traditional coding issues. This paper addresses the critical empirical gap regarding **"LLM-specific" technical debt**, specifically Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) arising from prompt engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and framework integration. This issue is significant because LLM-based systems are inherently non-deterministic and complex; without quantifying how and where debt accrues, engineering teams cannot effectively manage maintenance costs or ensure long-term system stability.

The key innovation is a structured, **four-layer empirical pipeline** designed to automatically classify and analyze SATD within LLM-integrated codebases at scale. Technically, the researchers leveraged the PromptSet dataset (January 2024) to analyze **93,142** Python files interacting with major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere) and orchestration frameworks like LangChain. Their approach differentiates LLM-specific debt from traditional software debt by utilizing a manual taxonomy to identify SATD markers—such as "TODO" comments regarding model accuracy—and associating them directly with LLM constructs, allowing for a granular analysis of debt origins in prompt configuration and API integration.

The study reveals that LLM-integrated systems accumulate significantly more debt than traditional systems, with ML systems registering **2.1 times more SATD** than their non-ML counterparts. In terms of specific categories, prompt configuration and optimization is the leading source of debt (6.61% of issues). Furthermore, library choices heavily influence debt accumulation: OpenAI integrations are the primary contributor to LLM-specific SATD at 54.49%. This work provides a foundational resource, shifting the field from experimental prompt engineering to disciplined, maintainable software development.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Primary Sources of Debt:** OpenAI integrations account for the majority of LLM-specific Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) at **54.49%**, followed by LangChain usage at **12.35%**.
*   **Prompt Design as a Critical Factor:** Prompt design is the leading source of debt, with **6.61%** of issues specifically attributed to prompt configuration and optimization, followed by hyperparameter tuning and framework integration.
*   **Vulnerability of Specific Techniques:** Instruction-based prompts (**38.60%**) and few-shot prompts (**18.13%**) are the most susceptible to technical debt due to their high dependency on instruction clarity and example quality.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The research employs a structured, multi-stage pipeline to classify Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in LLM-integrated codebases.

### Data Source & Scope
*   **Dataset:** PromptSet (January 2024).
*   **Scope:** 37,944 GitHub repositories, focusing strictly on Python files.
*   **Targets:** Major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere) and orchestration frameworks (LangChain).

### 4-Layer Architecture
| Layer | Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Collection Layer** | Aggregation | Gathers relevant Python files from repositories. |
| **2. Extraction & Detection** | Cleaning & ID | Identifies SATD via specific markers (e.g., "TODO", "FIXME") in code comments. |
| **3. Classification Layer** | Taxonomy | Establishes a manual taxonomy to categorize the type of debt. |
| **4. Association Layer** | Mapping | Maps specific prompts and constructs to the detected SATD. |

### Definition
The study defines SATD as developer-acknowledged deficiencies in code comments, specifically differentiating **LLM debt** (prompts, hyperparameters, framework integration) from traditional technical debt.

## 🔬 Methodology

This study is a large-scale empirical study focusing on LLM-specific Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). The researchers analyzed **93,142 Python files** utilizing major LLM APIs to identify the origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies of technical debt.

1.  **Filtering:** Isolated Python files referencing specific LLM libraries.
2.  **Detection:** Scanned for comments indicating debt (e.g., // TODO: fix this prompt).
3.  **Classification:** Categorized comments into LLM-specific vs. Traditional debt.
