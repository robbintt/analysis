## Executive Summary

The paper addresses the critical barrier to adopting autonomous AI agents: **user hesitation** stemming from a lack of trust in delegating complex, real-world workflows. As agentic systems become more capable, users struggle to align autonomous behaviors with their specific values and manage the inherent uncertainty of execution. This reluctance creates a significant gap between the potential efficiency of agentic workflows and the human need for control, transparency, and reliability. Without effective mechanisms to bridge this gap, users are prevented from leveraging these systems for high-stakes or sensitive tasks.

The authors introduce **DoubleAgents**, a planning tool built on the ReAct framework that integrates **interactive simulation** to enable iterative alignment. The system utilizes a multi-agent architecture that separates "Core ReAct Agents" for execution from "System Orchestration Modules" for management. Key technical components include a central Coordination Agent, Simulated Respondents (background agents that emulate human behavior to generate realistic scenarios), and a Context Management Module that maintains dynamic state via JSON structures. The user interface features a Policy Panel for editing coordination rules, approval mechanisms for plan/action pop-ups, and an Assignment Tracker, allowing users to rehearse scenarios and define executable stop hooks within a safe environment before live deployment.

The system was evaluated through a mixed-method approach comprising a two-day controlled lab study (n=10), three real-world deployment studies, and a specific technical evaluation. While the study primarily yielded qualitative findings—showing a distinct behavioral shift where users moved from initial hesitation to increased delegation after using the simulation for calibration—the paper supports the fidelity of this approach with quantitative context from related literature, noting that LLM-based simulations replicate behaviors observed in over 80% of psychology experiments. The deployment studies confirmed the system's utility for high-complexity tasks, defined in this context as multi-step workflows requiring multi-agent coordination and the management of uncertainty. Results demonstrated that rehearsing and refining policies within the simulation proved effective for calibrating agentic behavior before live execution.

This research validates interactive simulation as a practical pathway for aligning agentic AI with human expectations, effectively bridging the gap between system efficiency and user values. By embedding specific mechanisms for transparency, control, and uncertainty management, DoubleAgents provides a blueprint for designing agentic systems that users can confidently rely on.
