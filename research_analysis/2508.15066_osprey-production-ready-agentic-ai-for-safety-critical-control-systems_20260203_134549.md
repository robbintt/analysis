## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical challenge of deploying experimental Large Language Model (LLM) agents into production-grade, safety-critical control systems. Traditional AI agents typically lack the necessary safeguards, precision, and scalability to manage the immense complexity of facilities like scientific laboratories, where errors can have significant physical and operational consequences. Specifically, the research targets the gap between prototype agents and the rigorous requirements of control room environments, which involve managing hundreds of thousands of diverse control channels and translating vague operator intent into precise hardware commands without compromising safety.

The core innovation is the **Osprey framework**, a specialized architecture built around a "plan-first" orchestration model that mandates human review before any physical action is executed. Technically, Osprey utilizes a five-stage pipeline—Task Extraction, Classification, Planning, Execution, and Response—that decouples AI logic from hardware via connector abstractions. To manage scale, the framework employs a Coordination Layer for data consistency and automatic downsampling of large datasets, alongside a classifier for Dynamic Tool Selection to optimize prompt engineering and reduce computational overhead. Furthermore, the system implements pattern-based safety checks to strictly distinguish between safe read-only operations and risky write commands, ensuring that hazardous actions require explicit operator approval.

The framework was successfully validated through a production deployment at the Advanced Light Source, where it managed real-time operations across hundreds of thousands of control channels. In specific case studies, Osprey demonstrated the ability to resolve complex natural language queries—such as analyzing horizontal Beam Position Monitor (BPM) positions and generating correlation matrices—within a single orchestration cycle. The system effectively processed historical data, resolved Process Variable (PV) lists, and generated Python plotting code, while correctly identifying read-only scripts for automatic execution and accurately flagging write operations for manual safety review.

The significance of this work lies in providing the first comprehensive, production-ready blueprint for integrating agentic AI into safety-critical infrastructures. By bridging the divide between experimental AI models and facility-grade reliability, Osprey establishes a new standard for human-centric safety architecture in automated control systems. Its generalizable design, facilitated through connector abstractions and scalable data management solutions, offers a replicable pattern for diverse facility infrastructures, potentially accelerating the broader adoption of AI assistants in high-stakes operational environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Achievement of Production Readiness:** The Osprey framework successfully bridges the gap between experimental language model agents and production-grade systems, proving reliable enough for safety-critical facility operations.
*   **Effective Safety Mechanisms:** By implementing a 'plan-first' strategy that requires human review before hardware interaction, the framework maintains strict safety oversight while translating operator intent into precise actions.
*   **Scalability in Real-World Environments:** Osprey demonstrated the capability to manage real-time operations across hundreds of thousands of control channels during a production deployment at the Advanced Light Source.
*   **Efficiency in Data and Prompt Management:** The framework effectively handles large-scale data through automatic downsampling and maintains computational efficiency by using a classifier to dynamically select only the necessary tools for specific tasks.

## Methodology

The researchers designed and implemented a framework called **Osprey**, structured around four specific architectural components to address the complexities of control room operations:

1.  **Plan-First Orchestrator:** Generates complete execution plans with dependencies before any action is taken.
2.  **Coordination Layer:** Ensures consistent data types and handles automatic downsampling.
3.  **Dynamic Tool Selection:** Utilizes a classifier to select only the relevant tools for the task.
4.  **Connector Abstractions:** Provides cross-system compatibility.

The methodology was validated through two distinct case studies:
*   **Control-Assistant Tutorial:** Demonstrated semantic channel mapping and historical data integration.
*   **Full Production Deployment:** Conducted at the Advanced Light Source scientific facility.

## Technical Details

### System Architecture
The system utilizes a **5-stage pipeline** to process requests:
1.  **Task Extraction**
2.  **Classification**
3.  **Planning**
4.  **Execution**
5.  **Response**

### Core Mechanisms
*   **Plan-First Strategy:** An orchestrator breaks down queries and manages dependencies before execution begins.
*   **Safety Checks:** Pattern-based checks identify write operations (e.g., `EPICScaput`) to flag them for review.
*   **Dual-Mode Execution:**
    *   *Automatic:* Read-only operations in isolated Jupyter containers.
    *   *Manual:* Operator-approved write-enabled mode.

### Optimization & Integration
*   **Token Efficiency:** Data is stored in structured objects rather than text serialization.
*   **Tool Selection:** A classifier dynamically selects tools, reducing prompt complexity.
*   **Data Handling:** Automatic downsampling is employed for large datasets.
*   **Capabilities:** Integrates features from MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.
