## 📝 Executive Summary

Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents suffer from "operational amnesia," a critical limitation where they lack the ability to systematically learn from their own interactions. While existing agents are proficient at tool use, they operate largely in a stateless manner, executing tasks without retaining or refining strategies based on past successes or failures. This deficiency prevents the accumulation of long-term competence, severely restricting agent effectiveness in complex, multi-step environments where adaptive behavior and continuous improvement are essential.

The paper introduces **EvolveR**, a framework that enables self-evolution through a closed-loop experience lifecycle comprising Offline Self-Distillation and Online Interaction. The core innovation lies in the distillation process: rather than simply storing raw interaction logs, the system synthesizes these trajectories into abstract, reusable strategic principles stored in an Experience Base (*ExpBase*). During Online Interaction, the agent utilizes a distinct action space to guide decision-making: `<search knowledge>` retrieves external factual information (e.g., from Wikipedia), while `<search experience>` retrieves relevant strategic principles from the *ExpBase* to guide the agent's approach, alongside a standard `<answer>` action.

A policy reinforcement mechanism closes the loop by employing LLM Semantic Match to retrieve relevant principles, updating their efficacy scores based on performance outcomes, and distilling new principles from unmatched trajectories, thereby ensuring the agent evolves its policy based on the consequences of its actions. Evaluated on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, EvolveR demonstrated superior performance compared to strong agentic baselines. The paper specifically contrasts EvolveR against the ReAct baseline, which serves as the standard for stateless reasoning and tool use, highlighting the performance gap that self-evolution bridges.

On the **HotpotQA** dataset, EvolveR achieved an accuracy of **46.0%**, significantly outperforming ReAct's 33.6%. This trend continued on **2WikiMultiHopQA**, where EvolveR reached **30.6%** accuracy compared to ReAct's 11.6%, and on **FeTaQA**, where EvolveR attained **35.5%** versus ReAct's 30.0%. These metrics validate the framework's success in enabling self-improvement and strategic knowledge synthesis, proving that the agent actively updates its behavior based on performance feedback rather than relying on stateless execution or raw trajectory learning alone. EvolveR establishes a significant blueprint for autonomous agent development, bridging the gap between static tool proficiency and the capacity for systematic experiential learning.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Deficiency in Current Agents:** Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents lack the fundamental ability to systematically learn from their own experiences and iteratively refine their problem-solving strategies.
*   **Effectiveness of the Lifecycle:** The EvolveR framework, utilizing a closed-loop experience lifecycle, demonstrates superior performance on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks compared to strong agentic baselines.
*   **Self-Improvement Capability:** By employing a policy reinforcement mechanism, the agent can successfully update its behavior based on performance, enabling active learning from action consequences.
*   **Strategic Knowledge Synthesis:** The framework successfully converts raw interaction trajectories into abstract, reusable strategic principles that guide future decision-making.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The proposed framework, **EvolveR**, implements a closed-loop experience lifecycle consisting of two distinct stages:

1.  **Offline Self-Distillation:**
    The agent processes interaction trajectories to synthesize them into a structured repository of strategic principles.
2.  **Online Interaction:**
    The agent retrieves these principles to guide real-time decision-making while simultaneously accumulating new behavioral trajectories.

To drive continuous improvement, the loop utilizes a **policy reinforcement mechanism** that iteratively updates the agent's policies based on its performance during online interactions.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

EvolveR introduces a closed-loop experience lifecycle to overcome operational amnesia in LLM agents. The architecture consists of three main components:

### Architecture Components
*   **Offline Experience Self-Distillation Phase:** Focuses on summarizing and curating trajectories into reusable strategic principles.
*   **Online Interaction Phase:** Retrieves principles to guide actions in real-time.
*   **Policy Evolution Mechanism:** Uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to update policy parameters based on performance feedback.

### Action Space
The agent operates within a specific Action Space comprising three distinct actions:
*   `<search experience>`: Retrieves strategic guidance.
*   `<search knowledge>`: Retrieves external factual information.
*   `<answer>`: Provides the final solution.

### Experience Base (ExpBase) Management
The system manages the Experience Base through the following workflow:
*   **Retrieval:** Uses LLM Semantic Match to find relevant principles.
*   **Scoring:** Updates efficacy scores for matching principles based on success/failure.
*   **Distillation:** Distills new principles from trajectories that yielded no matches.
*   **Filtering:** Removes low-score trajectories to maintain database quality.
