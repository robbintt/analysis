## Executive Summary

Spike-driven Language Models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward energy-efficient natural language processing by leveraging spiking neural networks (SNNs). However, deploying these models on resource-constrained embedded devices remains a significant challenge due to their substantial memory footprints. While manual quantization can reduce memory usage, it is an unscalable and labor-intensive process that fails to account for the complex trade-offs between energy efficiency, memory constraints, and model accuracy. This paper addresses the critical need for an automated optimization framework capable of bridging the gap between the theoretical energy efficiency of SLMs and the practical hardware limitations of edge devices.

The authors introduce **QSLM**, the first performance- and memory-aware quantization framework specifically designed for spike-driven language models. The core innovation is a **tiered search strategy** that performs architecture and sensitivity analysis to identify network hierarchies, then applies quantization at global, block, and module levels. This automated process utilizes a multi-objective optimization function governed by user-defined constraints for performance (`constA`) and memory (`constM`). By manipulating a hyperparameter `alpha`, the framework dynamically adjusts the priority between accuracy and memory savings, automatically selecting optimal weight precision reductions without the need for manual intervention.

QSLM demonstrates substantial efficiency gains while maintaining competitive task performance. The framework achieved a memory footprint reduction of up to **86.5%** and reduced power consumption by up to **20%**. On the SST-2 sentiment classification task, the quantized model retained high accuracy at **84.4%**, while achieving a perplexity score of **23.2** on the WikiText-2 text generation task. Experiments further validated the framework's flexibility, showing that varying the `alpha` parameter successfully navigated the trade-off landscape to select specific model candidates (e.g., Candidate 7 vs. Candidate 8) that met strict memory caps, such as 400MB or 420MB.

This work significantly advances the field of neuromorphic computing by providing a scalable solution for deploying SLMs on edge hardware. By automating the quantization process, QSLM eliminates the bottleneck of manual tuning and enables the practical use of spike-driven architectures in power-sensitive environments. The framework establishes a new standard for optimizing SLMs, paving the way for broader adoption of energy-efficient language models in mobile and embedded systems where both memory and energy budgets are strictly limited.

2.  **Tiered Quantization Strategy**
    *   Employs a hierarchical approach using three levels:
        *   **Global-level:** Broad quantization settings.
        *   **Block-level:** Intermediate grouping adjustments.
        *   **Module-level:** Fine-grained component optimization.

3.  **Multi-objective Optimization**
    *   Utilizes a performance-and-memory trade-off function.
    *   Automatically selects optimal quantization settings based on the analysis.
