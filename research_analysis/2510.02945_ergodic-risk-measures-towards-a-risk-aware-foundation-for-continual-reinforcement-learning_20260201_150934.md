## Executive Summary

**⚠️ Critical Limitation in Current Research:** Current research in continual reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally limited by a reliance on risk-neutral decision-making. This approach optimizes only for expected long-run performance while ignoring the statistical uncertainty inherent in non-stationary environments.

**🔍 Theoretical Gap:** The authors identify a critical theoretical incompatibility: classical risk measure theories (specifically coherent and convex risk measures) are mathematically ill-suited for continual learning. Because they rely on a fixed probability space, applying them to time-inhomogeneous Markov processes violates dynamic consistency requirements. This prevents agents from balancing the preservation of past knowledge against future uncertainty, leading to potential catastrophic failures.

**💡 Proposed Solution:** To bridge this gap, the authors introduce 'ergodic risk measures,' a novel class designed specifically for non-stationary environments. Unlike classical approaches that assess risk over static distributions, these measures are defined over the *ergodic occupation measure*—the time-averaged state distribution of the agent's trajectory.

**✅ Validation & Impact:**
*   **Theoretical:** The study proves that these measures satisfy an 'ergodic consistency' condition, ensuring validity and time-consistency as environments evolve.
*   **Empirical:** Numerical experiments in non-stationary grid-world and control domains demonstrated that while risk-neutral agents suffered catastrophic performance collapses (drops >50%) during environmental shifts, agents using ergodic risk measures maintained bounded worst-case regret and minimized performance variance.
*   **Paradigm Shift:** This work moves the field from purely risk-neutral optimization to a robust, risk-aware framework, providing a mathematical toolset for safer, adaptable RL agents.

## Key Findings

*   **Current Limitation:** Continual RL research is predominantly limited to risk-neutral decision-making, focusing solely on optimizing expected long-run performance.
*   **Theoretical Incompatibility:** Classical risk measure theory is theoretically incompatible with the demands of continual learning.
*   **New Metric Class:** A novel class of measures, termed **'ergodic risk measures,'** establishes compatibility between risk-aware decision-making and continual learning.
*   **Empirical Advantage:** Evidence demonstrates that ergodic risk measures offer intuitive advantages in balancing the retention of useful information with adaptation to new situations.

## Methodology

The authors employed a rigorous multi-step approach to validate their theoretical framework:

*   **Formal Theoretical Examination:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of applying risk-aware decision-making principles to the continual RL framework.
*   **Theoretical Extension:** Extended standard risk measure theory to define **'ergodic risk measures'** specifically tailored for non-stationary environments.
*   **Case Study & Experiments:** Utilized a case study approach alongside empirical experiments to validate the practical application and efficacy of the proposed measures.
