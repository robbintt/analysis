## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of deploying high-fidelity Neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems on resource-constrained edge devices. Standard neural TTS models rely on 32-bit floating-point parameters, resulting in large memory footprints that are often infeasible for on-device hardware. The authors aim to solve this by achieving extreme model compression without incurring the significant degradation in speech synthesis quality typically associated with low-bit quantization, thereby enabling advanced voice assistants on consumer electronics.

The core innovation is the **BitTTS framework**, which couples Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with a novel "weight indexing" storage mechanism. During training, the model utilizes QAT to reduce 32-bit parameters to a precision of 1.58 bits, constraining the majority of weights to specific ternary values of $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. To bridge the gap between this sub-8-bit representation and standard 8-bit hardware, the authors introduce a weight indexing method; this technique aggregates groups of the quantized weights and stores them as a single `int8` index. This allows the model to maintain the mathematical benefits of ternary quantization while ensuring efficient memory usage on hardware architectures designed for 8-bit units.

The proposed BitTTS model demonstrates substantial efficiency gains and superior synthesis quality on the LJSpeech dataset. The framework achieves an **83% reduction in model size** compared to standard 32-bit implementations. Crucially, the 1.58-bit quantized model achieved a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of approximately 4.20, significantly outperforming a non-quantized baseline model of equivalent size (which suffers from quality degradation due to reduced capacity) and approaching the performance of much larger full-precision models.

This work challenges the conventional assumption that low-bit representations inevitably degrade audio quality, demonstrating that extreme quantization is viable for high-performance TTS. By successfully integrating 1.58-bit weights with 8-bit hardware storage constraints, BitTTS establishes a new precedent for lightweight neural networks. This research paves the way for the widespread deployment of sophisticated, high-quality voice interaction capabilities on edge devices, overcoming previous limitations regarding memory and power consumption.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Model Compression:** The proposed BitTTS model achieved an **83% reduction** in model size compared to standard implementations.
*   **Superior Synthesis Quality:** Despite aggressive compression, the model outperformed baselines of similar model size (that did not use quantization) in terms of speech synthesis quality.
*   **Effective Ternary Quantization:** The study validates that converting 32-bit parameters to ternary values $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ via quantization-aware training (QAT) is a viable strategy for maintaining TTS performance.

## Methodology

The proposed BitTTS model utilizes a dual-technique approach to achieve high compactness for on-device deployment:

*   **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT):**
    The model employs QAT to reduce parameter precision during the training process. Specifically, 32-bit parameters are quantized down to **1.58 bits**, where the majority of weights are constrained to ternary values of $\{-1, 0, 1\}$.

*   **Weight Indexing:**
    To address hardware storage constraints, the authors introduce a weight indexing method. This technique aggregates groups of the 1.58-bit quantized weights and stores them as a single `int8` index, ensuring efficient memory usage on hardware that processes data in 8-bit units.
