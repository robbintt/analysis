## Executive Summary

Neural network quantization is critical for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained hardware, yet reducing precision to low-bit formats (e.g., 4-bit integers) typically imposes a significant accuracy penalty compared to full-precision (FP) models. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a deployment-friendly alternative to quantization-aware training, existing state-of-the-art PTQ methods frequently rely on specific calibration sets or computationally intensive fine-tuning processes to recover accuracy. This dependency creates a practical bottleneck, as access to representative data is often restricted by privacy concerns or storage limitations, preventing the immediate deployment of highly compressed models.

This paper introduces **"FP=xINT,"** a novel framework that re-conceptualizes neural network quantization as a series expansion problem. Instead of directly rounding weights and activations, the method decomposes a full-precision model into a sum of multiple low-bit basis models using a deep model series expansion framework. The approach employs **Multi-Granularity Expansion** across tensor, layer, and model levels and utilizes **Algebraic Structuring** to define operations (AbelianAdd/Mul) within an Abelian group, ensuring efficient parallelism and commutativity. A differential expansion strategy is applied where activations undergo more expansions than weights, utilizing a Laplace clipping function to handle saturation and asymmetric quantization until the maximum differential falls below $10^{-4}$.

The proposed framework establishes a new state-of-the-art for low-bit quantization, specifically achieving **77.03%** top-1 accuracy on ResNet-50 with 4-bit (INT4) precision, a figure that actually surpasses the accuracy of the original full-precision baseline. Ablation studies validate the methodology’s design choices, demonstrating that expanding activations contributes significantly more to accuracy than expanding weights (75.12% vs. 72.87%), with peak performance achieved at 4 expansions. Furthermore, the method demonstrated strong generalization capabilities in Large Language Model (LLM) scenarios, performing effectively in W4A16 settings on the MMLU benchmark.

The significance of this work lies in its delivery of a theoretically grounded, **Calibration-Free PTQ** method that eliminates the need for calibration sets or fine-tuning, enabling "one-shot" deployment without data availability. By mathematically proving that the series expansion converges to the dense model, the authors provide the first application of series expansion techniques to neural network quantization. This breakthrough offers a practical path for high-fidelity model compression in data-scarce environments and sets a new performance standard for low-bit inference.
