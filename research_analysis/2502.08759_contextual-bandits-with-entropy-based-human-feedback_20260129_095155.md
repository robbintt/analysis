## Executive Summary

Current preference-based reinforcement learning systems, particularly within contextual bandit settings, suffer from inefficient human-in-the-loop workflows. Existing methodologies typically rely on static querying schedules or assume perfect expert guidance, leading to suboptimal exploration-exploitation balances and fragility when facing low-quality inputs. This inefficiency results in wasted resources and high cognitive load, as agents often query human experts even when they are sufficiently confident in their current policy.

The authors propose a model-agnostic, entropy-based framework that dynamically regulates human intervention. The core technical innovation involves monitoring the entropy of a stochastic policy in real-time to quantify model uncertainty. The system solicits expert feedback exclusively when this entropy exceeds a user-defined threshold. This mechanism acts as an active filter, allowing the agent to operate autonomously in states where it is confident and requesting guidance only during high-uncertainty events. The framework integrates seamlessly with various contextual bandit architectures—specifically REINFORCE, PPO, and PPO-LSTM—and was validated using two feedback modalities: Action Recommendation and Reward Manipulation.

Experimental evaluation using Mean Cumulative Reward demonstrates that the entropy-based approach substantially outperforms existing static methods. The study rigorously tested robustness across varying feedback qualities, including low-expert-accuracy scenarios (ranging from 0.05 to 0.45). Results indicate the system maintains efficacy even with suboptimal feedback; notably, on the MediaMill dataset (PPO-LSTM), the model achieved a peak reward of 0.78 under high expert accuracy. Crucially, the system exhibited high stability across a wide range of entropy thresholds, confirming that agents can drastically reduce reliance on human oversight without degrading overall reward accumulation.

This research shifts the paradigm of human-in-the-loop learning from static, time-based interventions to dynamic, uncertainty-driven active querying. By demonstrating that robust learning can occur with significantly reduced human input—even in the presence of imperfect feedback—the paper offers a practical path toward deploying autonomous agents in noisy, real-world environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Substantial Performance Gains:** The proposed entropy-based framework yields significant improvements in contextual bandit settings compared to existing approaches.
*   **Minimal Feedback Requirements:** The method achieves high performance while requiring a drastically reduced amount of human feedback.
*   **Robustness to Noise:** The approach demonstrates robust efficacy even when subjected to suboptimal or low-quality feedback, maintaining stability across varying expert accuracy levels.
*   **Superior Uncertainty Management:** By using entropy as a trigger, the system successfully manages model uncertainty, balancing exploration and exploitation superiorly to methods that neglect these factors.

## Methodology

The authors introduce an entropy-based human feedback framework designed for contextual bandit agents. The core mechanism operates as follows:

1.  **Real-Time Entropy Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors the model's entropy (acting as a measure of uncertainty) during operation.
2.  **Dynamic Querying:** Expert feedback is solicited dynamically only when the model entropy exceeds a predefined threshold.
3.  **Threshold Filtering:** This threshold acts as a filter to distinguish between states where the model is confident (autonomous operation) and states where it is uncertain (human intervention).
4.  **Model-Agnostic Integration:** The method is designed to be model-agnostic, allowing integration into any contextual bandit agent that employs stochastic policies.

## Results

The primary evaluation metric used was **Mean Cumulative Reward**. Experiments varied entropy thresholds (0.3 – 0.9) and expert accuracy levels.

*   **Entropy Thresholds:** Stable performance was observed across a wide range of thresholds (0.3 to 0.9).
*   **Expert Accuracy:**
    *   *Low Accuracy:* 0.05–0.45 (System remained robust).
    *   *High Accuracy:* 0.76+ (Optimal performance).
*   **Dataset Performance:**
    *   **MediaMill (PPO-LSTM):** Achieved the highest performance with max rewards up to **0.7800** at high expert accuracy.
    *   **Delicious (REINFORCE):** Showed moderate performance with max rewards ranging from **0.30–0.45**.
    *   **Action Recommendation (PPO):** Showed lower performance with max rewards up to **0.25**.

**Conclusion:** Results suggest that high rewards depend on both high expert accuracy and the specific model architecture used.
