## Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of developing a unified foundation model capable of excelling simultaneously in **Agentic** behavior, complex **Reasoning**, and **Coding** (ARC). As AI systems evolve toward autonomous agents, they must effectively manage tool use, multi-step logic, and code generation. The core problem this paper tackles is balancing high-level competence across these diverse domains with significant parameter and inference efficiency. The authors aim to make such advanced models practical for deployment by overcoming the typical requirement for massive computational resources and dense parameter architectures associated with state-of-the-art performance.

GLM-4.5 introduces a highly efficient **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture comprising 355 billion total parameters while activating only 32 billion per inference. A critical methodological advancement is the implementation of a **multi-stage training regimen** on a massive scale of 23 trillion tokens, which establishes a robust foundation for the model's capabilities. The design prioritizes depth over width to enhance reasoning, utilizing a **hybrid reasoning mechanism** that allows the model to switch between a "thinking" mode for complex tasks requiring internal monologue and a "direct response" mode for faster execution. This is further bolstered by a post-training strategy that incorporates **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** alongside expert model iteration and unified self-distillation to optimize for agentic objectives.

The GLM-4.5 model demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking **3rd overall** among competing models across 12 ARC benchmarks and **2nd specifically on agentic tasks**. It achieves state-of-the-art scores of 70.1% on TAU-Bench (agentic), 91.0% on AIME 24 (reasoning), and 64.2% on SWE-bench Verified (coding). The efficiency gains are substantial, as the model delivers this performance by activating only approximately 9% of its total parameters. The smaller GLM-4.5-Air variant also performed well, ranking 6th overall while utilizing only 12B active parameters, validating the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

This work significantly advances the field of Agentic AI by providing a robust, open-weight model capable of autonomous task execution and complex tool use. The integration of a massive 23-trillion-token training pipeline with reinforcement learning establishes a new standard for aligning foundation models with agentic requirements. By releasing both the flagship MoE model and the efficient GLM-4.5-Air variant as open-source, the authors democratize access to high-level reasoning and coding capabilities. This contribution fosters further research into efficient large-scale architectures and accelerates the development of agent-based systems that balance performance with resource constraints.

    *   **Pre-training:** 15T tokens at 4K sequence length.
    *   **Mid-training:** 7T tokens up to 128K sequence length, incorporating repo-level code, synthetic reasoning, and agent-specific data.
*   **Post-Training:** Involves specialized expert model iteration followed by unified self-distillation. This phase aligns the model for specific ARC tasks.
*   **Inference Mechanism:** Features a **hybrid reasoning method** that dynamically switches between:
    *   **'Thinking' Mode:** Used for complex tasks requiring internal monologue and step-by-step logic.
    *   **'Direct Response' Mode:** Optimized for efficiency and faster execution on simpler tasks.
