## Executive Summary

### Problem
This research tackles the fundamental scalability limitations of Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PBRL), primarily the prohibitive cost and inconsistency associated with acquiring human supervision. As PBRL relies on comparative feedback rather than dense reward signals, methods often depend on crowd-sourced annotations, which introduce significant noise due to unreliable or conflicting inputs. The authors identify that in the absence of efficient mechanisms to filter low-quality data and query informative actions, PBRL agents struggle to converge within complex environments. This bottleneck restricts the applicability of RL in real-world scenarios where expert supervision is scarce, expensive, or prone to error.

### Innovation
To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a novel framework integrating Probabilistic Crowd Modelling with Active Learning to optimize the feedback loop. Technically, the approach extends the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers by employing a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) and Variational Inference (VI). This architecture is designed to estimate the distribution of each annotator's consistency level ($C_l$), correlating positive and negative feedback counts ($h$) with action optimality flags ($O$) through a fully connected clique structure. This design allows for online, real-time reliability estimation. Simultaneously, an entropy-based query selection mechanism directs the agent toward high-uncertainty trajectories, ensuring that feedback requests are strictly prioritized for the most informative actions to maximize policy learning efficiency.

### Results
The proposed framework was rigorously validated across synthetic 2D games and the high-stakes Simglucose environment for Type 1 Diabetes blood glucose control. Experimental outcomes demonstrated that agents trained with feedback targeting uncertain trajectories achieved significantly faster learning rates in the majority of tasks compared to passive querying methods. In the physiological simulation, the framework consistently achieved performance superior to established baselines; it effectively managed noisy crowd-sourced input to maintain safer and more stable blood glucose regulation, whereas baseline models struggled to filter inconsistent data. By evaluating metrics such as convergence speed and physiological stability, the study confirmed that active query strategies reduce the feedback burden while improving overall system performance.

### Impact
This research significantly advances the field by enhancing the robustness and scalability of PBRL, effectively mitigating the burden of human supervision while successfully managing noise in crowd-sourced datasets. By demonstrating efficacy in a complex physiological simulation—moving beyond standard game-based benchmarks—the paper establishes a viable pathway for applying deep reinforcement learning to safety-critical domains such as healthcare. The successful integration of real-time reliability estimation and entropy-based active query strategies provides a scalable template for future systems requiring efficient data utilization and high reliability in high-stakes environments.

## Methodology

The researchers propose a novel framework for Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PBRL) that addresses two specific challenges: noisy feedback from multiple annotators and the high cost of human input.

The framework integrates:
1.  **Probabilistic Crowd Modelling:** To handle noise inherent in crowd-sourced feedback.
2.  **Active Learning:** To prioritize informative actions and reduce the total number of queries required.

*   Multiple trainers simultaneously.
*   Online estimation of annotator reliability.
*   **Entropy-based query selection:** A mechanism to direct feedback requests specifically toward high-uncertainty trajectories.

## Technical Details

The proposed approach utilizes a **Variational Inference (VI)** method to estimate the distribution of a trainer's consistency level.

#### Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) Variables
*   **$C_l$ (Consistency Level):** The estimated distribution of a trainer's reliability.
*   **$h$ (Feedback Counts):** Variables representing positive and negative feedback counts.
*   **$O$ (Optimality Flags):** Indicators of action optimality.

#### Clique Structure
*   Feedback is modeled as dependent on both action optimality ($O$) and trainer consistency ($C_l$).
*   The model features a clique structure where optimality flags for a given state are fully connected.

#### Design Objectives
*   **Uncertainty Quantification:** Accurately measuring model confidence.
*   **Sparse Data Handling:** Maintaining performance even with limited feedback.
*   **Prior Information Incorporation:** Leveraging existing knowledge to improve estimation.
