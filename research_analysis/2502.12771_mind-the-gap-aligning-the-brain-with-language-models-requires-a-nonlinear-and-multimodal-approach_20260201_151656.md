## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental limitation of current brain-language alignment strategies, which predominantly rely on **linear, unimodal mapping techniques**. While standard encoding models assume a direct linear relationship between linguistic stimuli and neural activity, the brain processes naturalistic speech through a complex, nonlinear integration of auditory and semantic information. This discrepancy creates a "gap" that hampers the accurate prediction of brain responses and limits the understanding of how multisensory information is synthesized in the cortex, ultimately stalling the development of precise neural decoding models.

The authors introduce a novel nonlinear, multimodal prediction model designed to replace traditional linear regression methods. Technically, the architecture employs a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** to capture complex non-linear relationships between stimuli and brain activity. The system extracts and fuses semantic features using **LLAMA-7B** and auditory features via **Whisper**, arguing that performance plateaus beyond 7B parameters. Additionally, the study implements a simplified voxel selection mechanism—a "mask" strategy that retains any voxel demonstrating validation set improvement—rather than relying on arbitrary significance thresholds, thereby optimizing for predictive power across the brain.

The proposed approach demonstrated substantial performance gains over existing baselines. Compared to traditional linear models, the nonlinear multimodal architecture achieved a prediction performance improvement of **17.2% and 17.9%**. More significantly, it outperformed the previous state-of-the-art Stacked Regression (SR) model, recording a **14.4%** improvement in normalized correlation (CCnorm) and a **7.7%** improvement in average $R^2$. The model achieved an absolute CCnorm of 34.32% without masking and successfully validated neurolinguistic theories by identifying the integration of auditory and semantic information within motor, somatosensory, and higher-level semantic brain regions.

This work signifies a critical methodological advancement in cognitive neuroscience, challenging the prevailing status quo of linear unimodal mappings. By validating the necessity of nonlinear and multimodal approaches, the paper accelerates the field toward robust in-silico testing and significantly improves neural decoding performance.
