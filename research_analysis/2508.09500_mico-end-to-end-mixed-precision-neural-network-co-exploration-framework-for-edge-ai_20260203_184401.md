## Executive Summary

The deployment of Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) models on edge devices is currently hindered by inefficient algorithms and a fragmented development workflow that separates model optimization from hardware deployment. Existing methods struggle to accurately balance the trade-offs between Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) across varying bitwidths. Furthermore, current approaches rely heavily on Bit Operations (BOPs) as a primary optimization metric, which fails to correlate with actual hardware latency, memory usage, or variable performance gains across different architectures. While cycle-accurate simulators offer precision, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead—often requiring seconds to minutes per evaluation—making them unsuitable for exploring the exponential search space of MPQ configurations.

**MiCo** introduces the first holistic end-to-end framework designed to co-explore and deploy MPQ models for edge AI. The core innovation lies in a hardware-aware optimization algorithm that replaces slow cycle-accurate simulation with rapid latency models tailored to specific hardware targets, allowing the search to strictly adhere to latency constraints without execution on the physical device. Technically, MiCo differentiates its search strategy based on bitwidth: it utilizes PTQ for high bitwidths (>4-bit) where accuracy loss is negligible, and switches to QAT for low bitwidths (<4-bit) to recover significant accuracy drops. The framework further bridges the research-to-application gap by integrating a deployment pipeline that automatically converts optimized PyTorch models into efficient bare-metal C code.

Experimental evaluations on ARM Cortex-M7 (STM32F746) and Cortex-A53 processors demonstrate MiCo’s superiority over state-of-the-art baselines such as HAQ and ReLeQ. On ImageNet using ResNet-18, MiCo achieved a Top-1 accuracy of **69.7%**, outperforming HAQ by 2.1% and ReLeQ by 1.5% under strict latency constraints. The framework’s hardware-aware modeling reduced search time by **100x to 1000x** compared to cycle-accurate simulation methods, compressing the optimization process from hours to minutes. Additionally, the generated bare-metal C code delivered an end-to-end inference speedup of up to **2.3x** over standard implementations, maintaining accuracy loss within 1% of the full-precision baseline.

MiCo represents a significant advancement in edge AI by establishing the first comprehensive framework that addresses both the algorithmic exploration and practical deployment of MPQ models within a single system. By eliminating the reliance on inaccurate mathematical proxies like BOPs and automating the translation of research models to bare-metal C code, MiCo drastically reduces the engineering friction typically involved in moving from optimization to implementation.

## Technical Details

**Architecture & Integration**
MiCo is an end-to-end framework for Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) that integrates optimization and deployment phases, bridging the gap between PyTorch and bare-metal C.

**Optimization Strategy**
The search strategy differentiates between two distinct regimes to manage accuracy loss:
*   **High Bitwidth (> 4-bit):** Uses Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), as the accuracy difference between QAT and PTQ is minimal.
*   **Low Bitwidth (< 4-bit):** Uses Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), as the accuracy gap between QAT and PTQ becomes significant.

**Formulation**
*   The optimization is formulated as maximizing accuracy subject to a Bit Operation Constraint ($BOPs_{constr}$).
*   The quantization scheme is represented as a vector of bit-width pairs.

**Critique of Standard Metrics**
The framework critiques the use of Bit Operations (BOPs) as a standard metric, noting that:
*   BOPs ignore memory usage.
*   Performance gains vary significantly across hardware architectures when relying solely on BOPs.
*   MiCo instead relies on hardware-aware latency models rather than mathematical proxies.

## Results

*   **Bitwidth Analysis:** Experimental observations indicate that for bitwidths above 4 (e.g., W4A8, W4A4), the accuracy difference between QAT and PTQ is minimal, whereas for bitwidths below 4, the gap becomes significant.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** Computational analysis shows that cycle-accurate simulators have high overhead (seconds to minutes per evaluation) and that search space complexity grows exponentially ($B^L$).
*   **Performance Outcomes:** Performance outcomes demonstrate that the framework achieves end-to-end speedup compared to standard methods while maintaining minimal accuracy loss under specific latency constraints.
*   **Benchmarking:** On ImageNet using ResNet-18, MiCo achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 69.7%, outperforming HAQ by 2.1% and ReLeQ by 1.5%.
