## Executive Summary

Spiking Vision Transformers (SViTs) represent a significant advancement in bio-inspired computer vision architectures. However, their deployment is severely hindered by high memory and energy consumption. As the AI landscape shifts toward edge computing, the ability to run complex models on resource-constrained, battery-powered, or energy-harvesting devices has become critical. This analysis highlights the inefficiency of standard full-precision SViTs and establishes that without substantial optimization, these models are unsuitable for hardware-limited environments with strict power and memory budgets.

The authors introduce **QSViT**, a four-step Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) framework designed to optimize SViTs without the prohibitive computational costs associated with retraining. The methodology utilizes integer quantization to convert full-precision weights to lower bit-precisions (16, 12, 8, and 4 bits), employing a guided strategy for parameter selection. The framework performs a layer-wise investigation to identify sensitivity to precision changes across specific components—including convolutional, linear, and SDSa attention matrices—specifically targeting layers where accuracy degrades by more than 5%. This results in a non-uniform, layer-specific compression strategy that proves superior to generic compression methods.

Evaluations on the ImageNet dataset confirm that QSViT successfully balances hardware efficiency with model performance. The methodology achieved a **22.75% reduction in memory footprint** and a **21.33% reduction in power consumption**, all while maintaining accuracy within a 2.1% margin of the original non-quantized SViT. Notably, when configured with T=4 timesteps, the quantized model achieved an accuracy of **74.8%**, compared to the baseline SViT's 66.34%. This work validates that systematic, non-uniform quantization is more effective than generic compression, enabling the deployment of high-capability AI models on embedded systems reliant on batteries or energy harvesting.
