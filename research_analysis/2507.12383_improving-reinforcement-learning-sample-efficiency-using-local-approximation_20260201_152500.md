## 📝 Executive Summary

Reinforcement learning (RL) in infinite-horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck regarding sample efficiency. Current algorithms are constrained by suboptimal Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bounds that exhibit a logarithmic dependency on the size of the state space ($\log S$). This dependency imposes computational and sample costs that become prohibitive as the state space scales, limiting the practical deployment of model-free RL in large-scale or sparse-reward environments.

This research introduces **Probabilistic Delayed Q-Learning (PDQL)**, a novel model-free PAC-MDP algorithm designed to overcome these limitations through local approximation. The core mechanism relies on the **"Locality of Value Learning,"** a principle defining an inverse relationship between transition distance and value relevance: learning effort for distant states is independent, while proximate states exhibit high dependency.

By operating in discrete metric environments where transitions are restricted to states within a one-unit distance ($|S'_s| \le A$), PDQL approximates large MDPs by decomposing them into smaller, localized MDPs constructed from subsets of the state-space. The study derives a new asymptotic sample-complexity bound:

$$
O\left( \frac{SA}{\epsilon^3(1-\gamma)^3} \log\left(\frac{A}{\delta(1-\gamma)}\right) \log\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log\frac{1}{\delta} \right)
$$

This result sharpens existing analysis by eliminating the extraneous $\log S$ factor, shifting the dependency to $\log A$ and confidence parameters. Empirical benchmarks against baselines confirm that PDQL generalizes $\epsilon$-optimal solutions faster, demonstrating improved convergence rates that align with the theoretical removal of the $\log S$ penalty.

## 🧪 Methodology

The core technical strategy utilizes **local approximation** to approximate the original MDP with smaller MDPs constructed from subsets of the state-space. This approach exploits the independence of learning effort for distant states and the dependency of values and sample requirements for vicinal states.

The authors constructed a specific PAC-MDP algorithm designed to function in a **model-free environment** while maintaining the derived sample-complexity bounds. This allows for practical application without requiring a model of the environment dynamics.
