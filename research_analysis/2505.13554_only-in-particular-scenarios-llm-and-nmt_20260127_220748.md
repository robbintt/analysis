## Executive Summary

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated translation capabilities comparable to traditional Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems, their widespread industrial adoption is hindered by prohibitive computational costs and high latency. This research addresses the inefficiency of using resource-intensive LLMs for all translation tasks, challenging the binary approach of choosing either NMT or LLMs. The problem is significant because neither architecture is universally superior; NMT often excels in technical domains with lower resource overhead, whereas LLMs may handle complex linguistic nuances better. Consequently, a rigid deployment strategy results in either suboptimal quality or unsustainable computational expenses.

The paper introduces a hybrid architecture that defaults to a lightweight NMT system (Deep Transformer-Big) and conditionally invokes a larger LLM (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) only when necessary. The core technical innovation is a lightweight **"decider"** module that analyzes source sentence features to dynamically route tasks. The authors propose and evaluate two routing mechanisms: **PPL Threshold (PPLT)**, which calculates source perplexity using a small language model, and **Joint Decision-making (JDM)**, a binary classifier (*xlm-roberta-base*) trained to predict specifically when the LLM will outperform the NMT baseline. This framework allows the system to exploit the speed of NMT while reserving the high capacity of LLMs for scenarios where the value added justifies the cost.

Evaluation across WMT22, Flores, and custom Technical/Literary datasets using COMET-DA and BLEURT metrics demonstrated that the **JDM method achieved the highest performance** while significantly limiting LLM usage. Notably, the system exhibited intelligent domain adaptation, minimizing LLM resource usage to ~7-10% in the Technical domain where NMT dominates, and allocating ~54-80% in the Literary domain. Overall, JDM achieved quality better than the LLM-only baseline while reducing computational cost to approximately 23–30% of full LLM inference.

This research shifts the paradigm from model selection to intelligent model orchestration, offering a practical solution to the cost-quality trade-off in machine translation.

## Key Findings

*   **Performance Parity:** LLMs generally offer translation quality comparable to NMT but are hindered by high computational costs and latency.
*   **No Universal Superiority:** Neither LLMs nor NMTs are universally superior; their advantages are highly scenario-specific.
*   **Hybrid Efficiency:** A hybrid integration strategy that defaults to NMT and invokes LLMs only when necessary effectively balances quality and efficiency.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Through the proposed method, optimal translation performance is achievable while minimizing expensive LLM resource usage.

## Methodology

The research team adopted a comparative and experimental approach to bridge the gap between efficiency and quality:

1.  **Comparative Evaluation:** The researchers first conducted a comparative evaluation of LLM and NMT translation outputs to identify performance gaps and specific scenarios where one outperformed the other.
2.  **Policy Investigation:** They investigated scheduling policies to optimize the trade-off between translation quality and computational cost.
3.  **Core Innovation:** The team developed a lightweight **"decider"** that analyzes source sentence features to dynamically determine whether to use LLM or NMT.
4.  **Validation:** The proposed system was validated through extensive experiments on multilingual test sets (WMT22, Flores, and domain-specific sets).

## Technical Details

The proposed framework integrates two distinct translation architectures using intelligent routing mechanisms.

### Architecture Components
*   **Default System:** Deep Transformer-Big (Neural Machine Translation).
*   **Conditional System:** Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Large Language Model).
*   **Routing Mechanism:** A dynamic decider module tasked with minimizing cost without sacrificing quality.

### Proposed Routing Approaches
Two primary methods were introduced to route tasks between the NMT and LLM:

| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PPL Threshold (PPLT)** | Uses a small Language Model to calculate the perplexity of the source sentence. If the complexity exceeds a defined threshold, the task is routed to the LLM. |
| **Joint Decision-making (JDM)** | A binary classifier built on *xlm-roberta-base*. It is trained specifically to predict when the LLM is likely to outperform the NMT system. |

### Calibration
To ensure fair comparison across different methods (QET, PPLT, JDM), all models were calibrated to invoke the LLM for approximately **25% of the total data**.

## Results

The Joint Decision-making (JDM) method yielded the highest performance across the board, demonstrating superior adaptation to different linguistic domains.

### Translation Performance (COMET-DA)

| Language Direction | NMT Baseline | LLM Baseline | **JDM Method** | LLM Usage (JDM) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Chinese → English** | 77.29 | 77.80 | **78.81** | 29.52% |
| **English → Chinese** | 83.01 | 81.63 | **83.62** | 23.37% |

### Domain Adaptation
JDM exhibited intelligent resource allocation based on domain difficulty:
*   **Tech Domain:** Used low LLM resources (**~7–10%**), recognizing that NMT is superior here.
*   **Literary Domain:** Used high LLM resources (**~54–80%**), leveraging the LLM's strength in complex nuances.

### Overall Efficiency
JDM consistently outperformed Quality Estimation Thresholds (QET) and achieved quality better than the **LLM-only baseline** with only **~23–30% of the computational cost**.
