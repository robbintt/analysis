## 📄 Executive Summary

Current large language model (LLM)-based agents face critical limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. Traditional approaches relying on end-to-end training demand substantial parameter updates and high computational costs, making continuous learning prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, existing methods often fail to bridge the gap between static tool-use capabilities and the need for adaptable systems, particularly in complex, multi-modal environments where agents must integrate new information without retraining.

The researchers introduce **EHC (Efficiently Enhancing General Agents)**, a framework designed to operate via a parameter-free learning paradigm that eliminates the need for backpropagation. The architecture relies on Hierarchical-categorical Memory, implemented through two core modules: **Hierarchical Memory Retrieval (HMR)** and **Task-Category Oriented Experience Learning (TOEL)**. HMR facilitates rapid retrieval of relevant memories and enables continuous information storage without capacity constraints, while TOEL processes interaction history by classifying experiences and extracting cross-category patterns. This structural organization allows the agent to comprehend task characteristics and learn dynamically without modifying its underlying parameters.

The EHC agent achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks, validating its capabilities on complex tasks. In the **ALFWorld embodied decision-making benchmark**, EHC achieved a **94.5% success rate**, significantly outperforming strong baselines like ReAct and Reflexion. On the **HotpotQA multi-hop reasoning dataset**, the framework demonstrated superior performance by effectively synthesizing dispersed information. Crucially, these results were achieved with a parameter-free approach, reducing training-related computational costs to zero. The experiments confirm that EHC can rapidly retrieve relevant information and store new data without being constrained by memory capacity limits, rivaling traditional training-based approaches in accuracy while vastly surpassing them in efficiency.

This research establishes that non-parametric learning methods can effectively compete with training-based approaches, signaling a potential shift toward more efficient agent architectures. By successfully addressing memory scalability issues through HMR and improving generalization via TOEL, the EHC framework provides a robust blueprint for bridging the gap between static tool-use methods and fully adaptable agents.

### 1. Hierarchical Memory Retrieval (HMR)
This module manages the agent's knowledge base by:
*   Facilitating **rapid retrieval** of relevant memories.
*   Enabling **continuous storage** of new information.
*   Operating without capacity constraints, solving memory scalability issues.

### 2. Task-Category Oriented Experience Learning (TOEL)
