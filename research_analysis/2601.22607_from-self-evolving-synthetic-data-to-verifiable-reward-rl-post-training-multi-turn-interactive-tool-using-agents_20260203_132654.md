> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as effective multi-turn, tool-using agents faces a dual bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality training data and the instability of reinforcement learning (RL) signals. Creating complex, multi-step tool-use dialogues requires expensive human annotation that does not scale, while applying RL to interactive agents is challenging because "user simulators" generate noisy training signals that degrade model performance. This paper addresses the critical need for a scalable post-training framework that can bootstrap complex agent behaviors without relying on human-annotated data while mitigating the reward noise inherent in simulated environments.
>
> The authors introduce **EigenData**, a unified framework combining Self-Evolving Data Synthesis and Verifiable-Reward RL. The core innovation is a hierarchical multi-agent data synthesis engine that employs a closed-loop, self-evolving mechanism to iteratively refine its output. In this process, the system generates tool-grounded dialogues paired with executable checkers; validation agents then assess the quality, and their feedback is used to automatically update the generation prompts and workflows, progressively enhancing data reliability. For the RL component, the framework implements a comprehensive pipeline that begins by fine-tuning the user model to ensure high-fidelity simulation signals. It then applies a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-style algorithm, blending Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with trajectory-level group-relative advantages and dynamic filtering to stabilize training against simulation inconsistencies.

> The proposed framework achieved **state-of-the-art performance** on the tau^2-bench, with the best model scoring 73.0% pass@1 on the Airline domain and 98.3% pass@1 on the Telecom domain. In component ablation studies isolating the data generation process, the full synthetic pipeline (56.0%) outperformed models trained on human expert data (52.0%), while removing the self-evolving loop caused a significant drop to 44.0%, demonstrating the mechanism's necessity. Further ablations highlighted the critical role of simulator quality: RL training using a fine-tuned user model achieved 95.6% performance, whereas using a base user model resulted in a sharp decline to 75.6%, illustrating how low-quality simulators zero out rewards and hinder learning.

> This research signifies a major shift toward automated, scalable post-training for interactive agents, proving that synthetic data can surpass human-annotated data in complex tool-use scenarios. By demonstrating that high-quality multi-turn reasoning can be bootstrapped without human labeling, the EigenData framework offers a cost-effective pathway for developing advanced AI agents. Additionally, the verifier-based RL recipe provides a robust solution to the long-standing challenge of noisy rewards in interactive environments, establishing a new standard for training reliable tool-using systems capable of handling intricate, real-world workflows.
