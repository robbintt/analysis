> ## 📝 Executive Summary
>
> The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents prohibitive barriers to entry due to extreme hardware demands and energy consumption. As models scale in size, the memory and computational requirements for inference become inaccessible to most end-users, restricting the utility of advanced AI to well-funded organizations. This review addresses the critical disconnect between theoretical quantization principles and their practical implementation, arguing that bridging this gap is essential for broader accessibility.
>
> The technical innovation centers on a high-level synthesis of **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)** as a pragmatic alternative to Quantization-Aware Training (QAT). The work details Linear Quantization frameworks, recommending **Asymmetric Quantization**—utilizing scale and zero-point—for activations to handle dynamic ranges, and **Symmetric Quantization** for weights. Crucially, the paper defines specific quantization granularities, contrasting **Per-Tensor** quantization with **Per-Channel** quantization, which applies separate scales per output channel to better capture weight variance.
>
> The research underscores the massive scale of resource inefficiency in current architectures. A standard 70 billion parameter model operating in FP32 precision requires approximately **280 GB of memory** and hardware costs exceeding **$100,000**. The analysis reveals that matrix multiplications account for 95% of model parameters and 85% of compute operations in dense models. By bridging the gap between theoretical quantization frameworks and practical application, this review provides a vital roadmap for making LLM inference faster and more accessible, potentially democratizing access to state-of-the-art AI.

## ⚙️ Technical Analysis

### Core Concepts
The text reviews the following fundamental quantization techniques:
*   **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ):** The primary focus for optimizing inference without retraining.
*   **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT):** Training the model with quantization in mind.
*   **Linear (Uniform) Quantization:** The foundational mathematical framework used.

### Quantization Schemes
*   **Asymmetric Quantization (Preferred for Activations):**
    *   Utilizes both **scale** and **zero-point** parameters.
    *   Better suited for handling dynamic ranges of activations.
*   **Symmetric Quantization (Preferred for Weights):**
    *   Utilizes a scale parameter centered around zero.
    *   More efficient for weight storage.

### Granularities
*   **Per-Tensor Quantization:** Applies a single scale factor across an entire tensor.
*   **Per-Channel Quantization:** Applies separate scales per output channel to better capture weight variance.

### Key Challenges
*   **Outliers:** Handling high-magnitude activation outliers in Transformers.
*   **Dequantization:** The necessity of dequantizing integer values back to floating-point for layer inputs.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Activation smoothing and calibration-based clipping are requisite for maintaining accuracy.
