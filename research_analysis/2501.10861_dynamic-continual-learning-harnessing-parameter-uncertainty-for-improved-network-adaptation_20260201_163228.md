## Executive Summary

Continual Learning (CL) faces the critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where fine-tuning neural networks on new data streams overwrites parameters essential for previously learned tasks. This "plasticity-stability dilemma" causes significant performance degradation on earlier tasks, preventing the deployment of robust, long-lifetime AI systems in non-stationary environments.

This paper addresses this fundamental instability, aiming to enable neural networks to adapt dynamically to new data distributions without eroding accumulated knowledge. The authors propose a novel regularization strategy leveraging **Bayesian Moment Propagation (BMP)** to quantify parameter uncertainty dynamically. Unlike computationally intensive sampling-based methods such as Variational Inference, BMP utilizes a closed-form approximation to assess parameter relevance efficiently.

The core technical innovation is a **"Dual Strategy"** that utilizes this uncertainty to distinguish between critical and non-critical weights:
1.  **Dynamic Learning Rate Control:** Assigns lower learning rates to critical parameters (those with low uncertainty).
2.  **Weighted Regularization:** Imposes higher regularization penalties on these same parameters to prevent drastic updates.

Evaluated on standard sequential benchmarks (**Permuted MNIST**, **Rotated MNIST**, and **Split CIFAR-10**), the method significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baselines. The study indicates that leveraging uncertainty for regularization is more effective than alternative sampling-based or non-uncertainty-based methods, providing a deployable solution to the plasticity-stability trade-off.

## Methodology

The research methodology is built upon a probabilistic framework designed to balance stability and plasticity efficiently.

*   **Core Framework:** The research leverages a **Bayesian Moment Propagation (BMP)** framework. This allows for the concurrent learning of network parameters and their associated uncertainties without the computational pitfalls of sampling-based methods.
*   **Uncertainty Quantification:** Parameter-based uncertainty is calculated to determine which parameters are relevant to a network's learned function.
*   **Regularization Techniques:** The approach applies two distinct techniques:
    *   **Dynamic Learning Rates:** Assigning lower rates to critical parameters.
    *   **Weighted Regularization:** Restricting important parameters via higher weights to protect critical information.
*   **Evaluation:** The methodology is evaluated using standard sequential benchmark datasets against existing state-of-the-art methods.
