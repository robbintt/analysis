## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Structural drawing generation in civil and mechanical engineering remains a predominantly manual, labor-intensive process that creates a bottleneck between conceptual design and final documentation. Engineers must translate high-level design intent into rigid, standardized technical drawings within environments like AutoCAD, a task that is repetitive and prone to human error. This paper addresses the critical need to automate this translation, aiming to reduce the substantial time and effort required for drafting while enabling a more seamless iterative design process.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce a specialized LLM agent that utilizes a multi-stage generative architecture (LLM1 through LLM6) based on ReAct prompt engineering to decompose the drawing process into specific sub-tasks: classification, information extraction, missing data identification, workspace settings, JSON structuring, and Python code generation. A key technical innovation is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which queries external databases to inject domain-specific facts, such as standardized steel beam sections, directly into the generation process. The system executes this generated code using Python libraries `pyautocad` and `win32com` to interface directly with AutoCAD, ensuring that natural language inputs are converted into precise, executable technical drawings while managing output constraints through logic that splits complex tasks into sequential sub-steps.

**Results**
Validation through case studies demonstrated the system's ability to accurately translate varied natural language descriptions into executable Python code without manual drafting. The agent successfully handled complex geometric calculations, including determining vertices for concrete beam hooks and radii, and accurately retrieved standardized sections such as 'HP360x174' from external databases. The integration of RAG was shown to significantly enhance reliability by mitigating hallucinations compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, the system proved robust against technical constraints, effectively navigating GPT-4 Turbo’s 4096-token output limit by implementing task fragmentation to ensure the generation of complete drawings.

**Impact**
This research bridges the gap between conceptual natural language descriptions and standardized technical documentation, setting a precedent for hybrid AI in safety-critical engineering domains. By demonstrating that LLM agents can reliably generate code for engineering applications when augmented with external knowledge, the paper validates a novel approach to automating technical workflows. This shift toward intent-based modeling promises substantial reductions in manual workload and facilitates rapid design iteration, marking a significant evolution in how engineers interact with design software by freeing professionals to focus on higher-level decision-making.
