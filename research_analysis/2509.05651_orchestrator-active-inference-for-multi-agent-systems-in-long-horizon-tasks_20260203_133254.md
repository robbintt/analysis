## Executive Summary

LLM-enhanced Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) often struggle in complex, non-linear environments due to **partial observability** and **suboptimal coordination**. Without a mechanism to synchronize agent perspectives and optimize decisions over extended durations, agents frequently fail to approximate global solutions, leading to system failures in long-horizon tasks.

This research introduces **"Orchestrator,"** a directed-graph framework comprising Planning, Execution (LLM-powered), and Orchestration nodes. The system leverages **active inference** to dynamically monitor agent interactions and optimize behavior by minimizing Variational Free Energy (VFE). Technically, the VFE objective function balances the need for new information (epistemic value) against an accuracy cost function comprising five risk components.

Evaluations in the AMaze environment compared solo agents against those using the Free Energy (FE) benchmark and FE + Orchestration.
*   **Easy Mazes:** Adding the FE benchmark boosted GPT-4's success rate from **32.35% to 100%**.
*   **Medium Mazes:** Adding Orchestration achieved **100% success**.
*   **Hard Mazes:** Results were mixed; GPT-5-nano improved (63.89% → 76.67%), while GPT-4.1-nano degraded (84.62% → 71.88%) due to reasoning overhead.

This work advances the field by providing a mechanistic solution to the partial observability problem, establishing a precedent for using VFE optimization to manage complex agent dynamics in dynamic, high-stakes environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Mitigation of MAS Limitations:** The Orchestrator framework effectively addresses the limitations of LLM-enhanced multi-agent systems in complex, non-linear tasks by mitigating partial observability and suboptimal coordination.
*   **Global Approximation:** By tracking agent-to-agent and agent-to-environment interactions, the system enables agents to approximate global task solutions with greater efficiency.
*   **Dynamic Optimization:** The implementation of active inference benchmarks successfully optimizes system behavior within dynamic environments.
*   **Long-Horizon Superiority:** Evaluations on maze puzzles of increasing complexity demonstrated the framework's superior capability in handling long-horizon objectives compared to solo agents.

## Technical Details

### System Architecture
The system is defined as a directed graph $G(N, E, F)$ with three distinct node types:
1.  **Planning ($N_{plan}$):** 1 Node
2.  **Execution ($N_{exec}$):** 2 Nodes (LLM-powered)
3.  **Orchestration ($N_{orch}$):** 1 Node

### Objective Function
The system aims to optimize **Variational Free Energy (VFE)**, formulated as:

$$F_n(t, k) = U_{epistemic}(n, t, k) - C_{accuracy}(n, t, k)$$

*   **$U_{epistemic}$:** Measures information gain via normalized Shannon entropy.
*   **$C_{accuracy}$:** A weighted sum of five risk components designed to guide agent behavior:
    1.  Movement Efficiency
    2.  Exploration Efficiency
    3.  Backtracking Patterns
    4.  Dead-End Recognition
    5.  Oscillation Avoidance

### Experimental Setup
*   **Models:** GPT-4.1-nano and GPT-5-nano.
*   **Environment:** AMaze.
*   **Constraints:** Step budget ($2.5 \times \text{tiles}$) or a 7200s time limit.
