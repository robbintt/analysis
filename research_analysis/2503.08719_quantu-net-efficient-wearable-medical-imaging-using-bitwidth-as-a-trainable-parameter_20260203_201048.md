## Executive Summary

The integration of deep learning into wearable medical devices is currently hindered by the significant computational and memory requirements of high-precision models. Standard architectures like U-Net, while effective for biomedical image segmentation, typically rely on 32-bit floating-point arithmetic, making them too resource-intensive for deployment on edge hardware such as wearables and FPGAs. This paper addresses the critical challenge of enabling real-time, high-performance medical imaging on resource-constrained devices. Bridging this gap is essential for advancing Edge AI in healthcare, as it allows for continuous, low-power diagnostic capabilities directly on the patient rather than relying on cloud-based processing.

The core innovation is **QuantU-Net**, a quantized iteration of the U-Net architecture that leverages Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) via the Brevitas PyTorch library. Unlike traditional quantization methods that require manual tuning or extensive search spaces to determine the optimal bitwidth, this approach treats bitwidth as a trainable parameter. Technically, the authors engineered a composite custom loss function that integrates Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss, Dice Loss, and a novel Bitwidth Loss. This mechanism allows the model to simultaneously optimize for segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency during a single training session, dynamically adjusting the precision of network weights to balance performance against hardware constraints.

Experimental results using the Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset (780 grayscale images across three classes) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial compression without sacrificing clinical utility. QuantU-Net reduced the model size by approximately 8x by lowering precision to an average of 4.24 bits. Despite this aggressive compression, the model maintained a validation accuracy of 94.25%, representing a marginal drop of only 1.89% compared to the floating-point baseline. Furthermore, the optimized training workflow successfully identified the ideal balance of bitwidth and accuracy within a single training run, eliminating the need for iterative, time-consuming hyperparameter searches.

This research represents a significant step forward for the deployment of AI in clinical settings, proving that integer-based quantized models can retain the accuracy required for medical tasks. By validating the suitability of these models for specialized hardware like FPGAs and AI accelerators, the authors facilitate the development of real-time, low-power diagnostic tools.
