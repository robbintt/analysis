## Executive Summary

> Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) suffer from "shortcut learning," where they rely on spurious correlations or language priors rather than grounding their reasoning in actual visual evidence. This lack of robustness limits their reliability in high-stakes environments, as models often arrive at correct conclusions through biased logic or hallucinated details. Addressing this requires a shift away from monolithic, end-to-end training toward architectures that enforce strict adherence to visual facts and mitigate the influence of cognitive biases.

The authors propose **VISTA** (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis), a modular framework that explicitly decouples perception from cognitive reasoning. The architecture treats a frozen VLM strictly as a "stateless sensor" restricted to six low-level visual categories, creating an information bottleneck that forces objectivity and prevents the leakage of semantic bias. A separate text-only LLM acts as the "reasoner," decomposing questions and aggregating the sensor's output. This loop is optimized using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning approach that achieves high performance with remarkable data efficiency, requiring only 641 curated multi-step questions for training.

VISTA demonstrates substantial improvements in robustness, achieving a **+16.29% improvement** over baseline models on the SpuriVerse benchmark, a dataset specifically designed to evaluate resistance to spurious correlations. Despite its strict modularity, the framework maintains competitive general performance on standard benchmarks such as MMVP and SeedBench. Qualitative findings indicate that the system generates reasoning traces that are more neutral and grounded in visual reality, with the sensor’s rejection policy achieving 86% agreement with human judgment.

This work offers a fundamental solution to the pervasive issue of bias in multimodal AI by enforcing a causal separation between the "eye" (perception) and the "brain" (reasoning). By proving that complex visual reasoning can be learned efficiently through reinforcement learning on minimal data, the authors challenge current assumptions about data requirements. The framework's interpretability and theoretical generalization bounds suggest a new standard for developing trustworthy visual agents capable of recovering from perception errors and transferring knowledge across different sensors.

## Methodology

The research introduces **VISTA (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis)**, a novel approach designed to decouple perception from cognitive reasoning to mitigate shortcut learning.

*   **Architecture:** The framework utilizes a modular design consisting of a frozen Vision-Language Model (VLM) and a separate text-only Large Language Model (LLM).
    *   **The "Sensor":** The frozen VLM is restricted to objective perception queries, acting strictly as a stateless "eye."
    *   **The "Reasoner":** The text-only LLM functions as the "brain," responsible for decomposing complex questions and aggregating visual facts provided by the sensor.
*   **Information Bottleneck:** By restricting the VLM to specific "sensor" tasks, the system creates an information bottleneck that prevents semantic bias from leaking into the reasoning process.
*   **Training Optimization:** The system is trained using **Reinforcement Learning**, specifically **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**.
*   **Data Efficiency:** Remarkably, the framework achieves high performance using a controlled, reward-aligned environment with only **641 curated multi-step questions**.
