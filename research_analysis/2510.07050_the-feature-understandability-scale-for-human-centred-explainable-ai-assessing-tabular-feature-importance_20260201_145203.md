## 📝 Executive Summary

Current Explainable AI (XAI) efforts predominantly focus on elucidating model outputs, often overlooking a fundamental prerequisite for user trust: the user's comprehension of the input features themselves. This paper addresses a critical gap in human-centred XAI by recognizing that if end-users do not understand the underlying tabular data features, they cannot effectively interpret explanations or audit model decisions. The lack of standardized, quantitative metrics to evaluate how well humans understand specific input variables in supervised classification contexts has hindered the development of truly interpretable systems.

The authors introduce a novel psychometric framework featuring two validated measurement scales—specific for numerical (8 items) and categorical data (9 items)—designed to quantify "feature understandability." Technically, the study utilizes Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to validate a robust two-factor structure for both scales: **"Understanding & Measurement"** (assessing definitions, units, and interpretation) and **"Feature-Outcome Relation"** (assessing relevance and utility). This structure enables the assignment of quantitative scores to input features, establishing a protocol to rank and prioritize features based on user comprehension prior to the model training phase.

The validation process demonstrated strong psychometric properties, with CFA confirming a good model fit and high factor reliability. The study reported high-performing item metrics, including "I know what this feature measures" and "In my opinion, the feature should be used to predict the outcome." Crucially, experiments revealed that pre-selecting features based on these high understandability scores resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the quality of global explanations for supervised machine learning models.

This research significantly advances the domain of human-centred AI by introducing the first quantitative instrument for assessing the understandability of input features, shifting the diagnostic focus from model logic to user cognition.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Validation of Assessment Tools:** The research successfully developed and validated two distinct psychometric scales—one for numerical data (8 items) and one for categorical data (9 items)—designed to assess user understanding of tabular input features.
*   **Structural Integrity:** Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed a robust two-factor structure for both scales, demonstrating a strong relationship between the items and a good model fit.
*   **Quantification of Understandability:** The study established a method to assign quantitative scores to input features, enabling the ranking and prioritization of features based on how well users understand them.
*   **Correlation with Feature Selection:** The findings suggest that pre-selecting features based on these understandability scores can significantly improve the quality of global explanations for supervised machine learning models.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The researchers employed a psychometric approach to construct measurement instruments specifically for supervised classification problems involving tabular data. They differentiated between data types by creating separate scales for numerical and categorical inputs. To ensure the reliability and validity of these instruments, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was utilized to verify the two-factor structure of the scales and evaluate the goodness of fit between the survey items and the underlying constructs of user understanding.
