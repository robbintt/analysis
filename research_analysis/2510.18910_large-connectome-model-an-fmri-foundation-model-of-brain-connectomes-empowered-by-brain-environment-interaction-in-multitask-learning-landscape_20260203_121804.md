## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical bottleneck of limited sample sizes in clinical neuroimaging AI, which restricts the performance of traditional deep learning models in diagnostic tasks. A further complication is that standard self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often suffer from misalignment between the learned latent representations of brain function and specific real-world clinical outcomes. This lack of alignment reduces the efficacy of foundation models when applied to downstream tasks such as disease diagnosis or behavior recognition, creating a barrier to deploying these tools in practical medical settings where data is scarce and precise diagnostic accuracy is paramount.

The paper introduces the **Large Connectome Model (LCM)**, a novel foundation model built on a "Brain-Environment Interaction" (BEI) framework that explicitly integrates functional connectivity (FC) matrices with rich non-imaging data (demographics and environmental variables). Technically, LCM utilizes a Decoder-Only Transformer architecture that tokenizes BEIs, employing self-attention on tokens and cross-attention between tokens and the FC matrix to capture complex relationships. The training strategy is distinct, consisting of a **supervised multitask pretraining phase on non-imaging variables** to learn comprehensive brain representations relative to external factors, followed by a semi-supervised fine-tuning phase. This second phase leverages pseudo-labels derived from pretrained BEI representations, enabling effective model adaptation to specific downstream tasks even with limited labeled data.

The LCM architecture scales from 147M to 1.2B parameters, demonstrating exceptional parameter efficiency; the 147M variant achieved performance comparable to the 650M-parameter BrainLM while utilizing significantly fewer GPU hours. Larger variants (735M and 1.175B) consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models such as BrainMass and BrainJEPA across multiple benchmarks. In rigorous clinical evaluations validated on over 10,000 scans from eight major datasets, the model achieved high diagnostic metrics for Alzheimer’s disease (86.30% Accuracy, 85.33% F1), Parkinson’s disease (81.30% Accuracy, 84.18% F1), and Autism (71.46% Accuracy, 72.50% F1). Additionally, the evaluation scope explicitly included performance assessments for **Schizophrenia** and **Sex prediction**, covering a wide spectrum of behavior recognition, disease diagnosis, and demographic tasks.

By formulating brain modeling as a multitask learning problem, this work establishes a versatile tool that significantly enhances the applicability of foundation models to diverse neurological and psychiatric conditions. The successful integration of environmental and demographic variables resolves alignment issues inherent in previous SSL approaches, paving the way for neuroimaging AI to transition from theoretical research to clinical integration. The model's ability to maintain high performance with limited labeled data suggests it can effectively address the performance bottlenecks currently faced in medical AI, offering a robust scalable solution for early diagnosis and personalized medicine in routine clinical practice.

## Methodology

The researchers developed a scalable model architecture based on a multitask learning framework, utilizing a combination of functional neuroimages, environmental variables, and demographic data. The methodology consists of two distinct phases:

1.  **Multitask Pretraining**
    *   The model tokenizes multiple Brain-Environment Interactions (BEI).
    *   It learns comprehensive representations of brain function relative to external factors.

2.  **Semi-supervised Finetuning**
    *   The model undergoes finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels derived from the pretrained BEI representations.
    *   This allows for effective adaptation to specific downstream tasks with limited labeled data.
