## 📋 Executive Summary

The discovery of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is currently hindered by a critical "synthetizability bottleneck." While computational methods can propose vast numbers of hypothetical structures, the vast majority are chemically unstable or impossible to physically synthesize, creating a significant "reality gap" between theoretical design and practical application. This paper addresses this limitation by developing a system that does not merely generate structures but ensures they are theoretically stable and feasible candidates for real-world material science applications, such as carbon capture and water harvesting.

The researchers introduce **MOFGen**, a novel "System of Agentic AI" that utilizes a multi-agent architecture to close the reality gap between generative design and physical reality. Unlike single-model approaches, MOFGen integrates seven interconnected modules: a central manager (**MOFMaster**) orchestrating agents that include a Composition Agent (**LinkerGen**) using in-context LLM prompting to generate SMILES strings, a Structure Agent (**CrystalGen**) employing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for 3D crystal generation, and an Optimization Agent (**QForge/QHarden**) that applies physics-based simulations (PBE-D4 to r2SCAN-D4) and Monte Carlo sampling.

Crucially, the system incorporates a Feasibility Agent (**SynthABLE**) that utilizes machine learning and expert rules to assess synthetic potential directly within the generative loop, ensuring only viable candidates proceed. The system demonstrated high efficacy, generating hundreds of thousands of novel MOF structures and analyzing 80,968 unique organic linkers.

Most importantly, the study achieved end-to-end experimental validation, successfully synthesizing and characterizing five specific "AI-dreamt" MOFs. These physical samples exhibited favorable properties, including formation energies between -0.25 and -0.77 eV/atom, thermal stability up to 345.3 °C, and CO2 pore volumes ranging from 1359.88 Å³ to 2226.77 Å³ across novel topologies such as *pts*, *bnn*, *sql*, and *pcu*. This research represents a significant paradigm shift in automated materials science by moving beyond theoretical generation to demonstrable physical realization.
