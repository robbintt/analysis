## Executive Summary

> This paper investigates the viability of Large Language Models (LLMs) as "universal predictors" for structured tabular data in small-scale environments (≤500 instances). In scenarios where traditional machine learning models struggle with data scarcity or resource intensity, the authors evaluate whether the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs can generalize to structured analytics without task-specific fine-tuning.

The study introduces a **zero-training evaluation framework** leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) with few-shot prompting. Technically, it utilizes a distinct data serialization strategy where tabular features undergo z-score normalization and are converted into text-based representations (text tables for supervised tasks, raw vectors for clustering). The study benchmarks state-of-the-art models (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash, DeepSeek-R1) against traditional ML baselines and Tabular Foundation Models (TabPFN).

**Empirical results reveal a distinct performance divergence:**
*   **Classification:** LLMs achieved competitive performance on datasets like *Iris*, *Lupus*, and *Bankrupt*, yielding accuracy and F1 scores comparable to specialized models.
*   **Regression:** Significant underperformance was observed on datasets like *Diabetes* and *Friedman*, with high RMSE due to difficulties in mapping predictions to continuous spaces.
*   **Clustering:** Utility was negligible (e.g., *Mall*, *Wholesale*) due to the absence of genuine ICL mechanisms for unsupervised tasks.

This research demarcates the operational boundaries of LLMs in tabular analytics, validating their efficacy for rapid classification on small datasets while exposing limitations in regression and clustering. It establishes a pathway for low-overhead data exploration, cautioning practitioners against using LLMs as a panacea and advocating for their integration as targeted tools.

## Key Findings

*   **Strong Classification Capabilities:** LLMs demonstrate robust predictive performance on small-scale classification tasks when utilizing few-shot prompting.
*   **Regression Limitations:** LLMs significantly underperform compared to traditional ML models in regression tasks, primarily due to difficulty predicting outputs in continuous spaces.
*   **Clustering Constraints:** The utility of LLMs for clustering is limited by the absence of genuine In-Context Learning mechanisms for unsupervised tasks.
*   **Sensitivity to Engineering:** Function approximation quality is highly sensitive to prompt engineering, specifically regarding context size and prompt structure.
*   **Task-Specific Divergence:** Performance is strictly correlated with task type; effective for discrete classification labels, inadequate for continuous numerical prediction.
