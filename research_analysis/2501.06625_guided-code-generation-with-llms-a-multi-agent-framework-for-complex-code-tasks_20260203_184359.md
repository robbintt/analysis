## Executive Summary

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant proficiency in code generation, yet they struggle to reliably solve complex software engineering tasks that require deep compositional reasoning and the management of long-context dependencies. Standard one-shot generation methods often fail in these scenarios because they lack the structured architecture necessary to maintain logical coherence over extended sequences.

This paper addresses this critical limitation, highlighting that while LLMs possess the knowledge required for coding, they lack the inherent mechanism to effectively organize and apply it to intricate, multi-step programming challenges without external guidance.

The authors introduce a novel **"agentic framework"** for guided code generation that shifts the paradigm from direct output to a structured, multi-step process. This architecture decomposes complex tasks into fine-grained segments, deliberately avoiding the pitfalls of long sequential reasoning by managing context windows efficiently. Technically, the framework repositions LLMs as **fuzzy searchers and approximate information retrievers**—tasks where they excel—while insulating them from the burden of long-context understanding. By incorporating intermediate planning phases and iterative refinement, the system guides the model through the solution lifecycle, ensuring that each step builds logically upon the last.

The proposed framework was validated on the OpenAI HumanEval benchmark using Meta's Llama 3.1 8B model running at int4 precision, a resource-constrained configuration. The experiments yielded a **23.79% relative improvement** in solution accuracy compared to direct one-shot generation baselines. These quantitative results demonstrate that the structured, agentic approach not only mitigates the weaknesses associated with context handling but also substantially boosts the model's ability to generate correct, functional code for complex problems.

This research has significant implications for the field of AI-assisted software development, suggesting that architectural sophistication can often outperform raw parameter scaling. By effectively separating the strengths of LLMs (retrieval and pattern matching) from their weaknesses (long sequential reasoning), the study provides a blueprint for building more reliable coding assistants.
