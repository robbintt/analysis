## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to generate syntactically correct and semantically faithful structured outputs, such as code, data formats, and visual layouts. While LLMs have demonstrated proficiency in natural language tasks, ensuring **structural fidelity**—the accuracy and validity of outputs like JSON, HTML, or React components—remains a significant hurdle. This capability is essential for real-world applications including automated software engineering, data parsing, and dynamic frontend generation, where minor syntax errors or structural deviations can render outputs unusable.

The authors introduce **StructEval**, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess structural fidelity across 18 diverse formats, categorized into text-only structures (e.g., JSON, YAML, XML) and renderable visual structures (e.g., HTML, React, SVG). Technically, the framework employs a rigorous evaluation pipeline that combines three distinct validation methods: Syntactic Validity Checking, Path-based Keyword Matching utilizing six rule types to verify text elements, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) using Vision Language Models (VLMs) to assess visual correctness.

The dataset, constructed via a three-stage annotation pipeline involving LLM-based synthesis and expert review, comprises 2,035 examples formally represented as triplets $(q, K, Q_v)$ covering 44 task types across both Generation (natural language to structure) and Conversion (structure to structure) tasks.

Empirical analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle significantly with structural consistency. The top-performing model, **o1-mini**, achieved a modest average score of **75.58**, with open-source alternatives trailing by approximately 10 points. The study highlights distinct performance disparities: Generation tasks are notably more difficult for LLMs than Conversion tasks, and generating correct visual content (StructEval-V) proves more challenging than generating text-only structures (StructEval-T). Furthermore, the evaluation framework itself demonstrated high reliability, with VQA quality control indicating 88.92% fairness and a VLM judge accuracy of 88.66%.

StructEval provides a standardized, holistic framework for evaluating LLMs beyond traditional natural language metrics, filling a vital gap in the assessment of structured and code generation capabilities. By establishing clear baselines and identifying specific failure modes in current SOTA models—particularly regarding visual fidelity and generative tasks—this benchmark offers a roadmap for future model development.
