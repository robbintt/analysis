## Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of real-time API retrieval for context-aware code generation, a critical requirement for modern development tools like auto-completion and agentic AI. Existing approaches often rely on massive Large Language Models (LLMs) or standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which frequently suffer from high latency and computational overhead, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. Furthermore, current training datasets often suffer from "API leaks"—where the answer is inadvertently contained in the input context—and fail to capture the ambiguity and unclear intent typical of real-world enterprise code.

The core innovation is **DeepCodeSeek**, a framework that introduces a specialized retrieval technique enabling direct API prediction, surpassing standard RAG capabilities. To ensure robust data quality, the authors constructed a novel benchmark dataset based on ServiceNow Script Includes, specifically designed to eliminate API leaks and model real-world ambiguity. Technically, the system utilizes a compact 0.6 billion parameter reranker optimized via a sophisticated post-training pipeline. This pipeline employs synthetic data generation, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL) to tune the model specifically for enterprise code nuances.

The results demonstrate that the 0.6B parameter reranker achieved a **Top-40 retrieval accuracy of 87.86%**, while reducing inference latency by **2.5 times** compared to an 8B parameter baseline. These findings challenge the "bigger is better" paradigm, establishing a new standard for efficient, high-performance AI deployment in enterprise environments where low latency and cost-effectiveness are paramount.

## Methodology

The researchers developed a framework centered on expanding code and indexing structures to predict required APIs. The methodology focused on three main pillars:

1.  **Data Quality:** To address the issue of "API leaks" (where answers are hidden in input context), the team constructed a new dataset using **ServiceNow Script Includes**. This dataset specifically captures unclear API intent and reflects real-world ambiguity.
2.  **Framework Design:** The system expands on standard code and indexing structures to facilitate direct API prediction.
3.  **Optimization Pipeline:** A post-training pipeline was implemented for a 0.6B reranker. This process utilized:
    *   Synthetic data generation
    *   Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
    *   Reinforcement learning (RL)
