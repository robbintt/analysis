## Executive Summary

Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents lack the psychological depth and consistency required to replicate human thinking in high-fidelity social simulations. These agents often fail to capture the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and complex motivations that drive human interactions. This limitation presents a significant barrier to developing realistic agent-based models for social science research, as the agents cannot maintain the persona consistency necessary for authentic dialogue simulation.

To address this, the authors propose a Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture grounded in Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. The system structures each agent into three distinct ego states—Parent, Adult, and Child—functioning as separate knowledge structures with unique perspectives and reasoning styles. Technically, the architecture augments these internal states with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. This allows agents to dynamically access and retrieve relevant contextual data, such as historical interaction patterns and specific psychological traits, from vector stores, thereby enriching the generation process with deep, agent-specific context.

The efficacy of this design was evaluated through rigorous ablation tests comparing agents utilizing the retrieval mechanism against those relying solely on internal prompting. The study employed specific quantitative metrics, including BLEU and ROUGE, to assess response coherence and semantic relevance. The experimental data demonstrated that agents equipped with the contextual retrieval mechanism achieved higher scores in these metrics compared to the baseline, providing measurable evidence that the enriched context leads to superior coherence and context-awareness in dialogue generation.

This research provides a blueprint for enhancing realism in social simulations by integrating psychologically grounded structures with advanced LLM capabilities. By validating the use of Transactional Analysis and contextual retrieval, the authors establish a viable new direction for creating agents capable of simulating complex human motivations. This work bridges the gap between computational linguistics and psychological modeling, offering a robust framework for future research into emotionally intelligent and consistent AI agents.

## Key Findings

*   **Lack of Depth:** Current LLM agents lack the psychological depth and consistency required to model real human thinking, often missing the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive interactions.
*   **Promising MAS Architecture:** The proposed Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture, evaluated through ablation tests in simulated dialogue scenarios, yielded promising results.
*   **Value of Context:** Comparisons between agents utilizing information retrieval mechanisms and those without them demonstrated the value of enriching the response process with contextual information.
*   **New Direction:** The integration of psychologically grounded structures offers a viable new direction for enhancing the realism of agent behavior in social simulations.

## Methodology

The research methodology centers on the development and evaluation of a specialized Multi-Agent System (MAS):

*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The system is inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory.
*   **Agent Structure:** Each agent is structured into three distinct ego states (**Parent, Adult, and Child**). These are treated as separate knowledge structures possessing unique perspectives and reasoning styles.
*   **Contextual Augmentation:** To augment response generation, the system incorporates an information retrieval mechanism enabling agents to access relevant contextual data from vector stores.
*   **Evaluation:** Efficacy was evaluated using ablation tests within a simulated dialogue environment to specifically assess the impact of the information retrieval component.
