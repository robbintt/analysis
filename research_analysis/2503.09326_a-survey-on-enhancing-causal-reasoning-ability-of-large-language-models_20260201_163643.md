## 📑 Executive Summary

> Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve exceptional performance in general linguistic tasks but are fundamentally limited by an inability to perform inherent causal reasoning, a deficiency that creates critical bottlenecks in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and scientific discovery where distinguishing correlation from causation is mandatory. Compounding this technical issue is a fragmented research landscape lacking standardization; currently, no cohesive categorization framework exists for enhancement methods, and generic language evaluation metrics fail to capture causal inference capabilities.
>
> To address this gap with rigor, the authors conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) analyzing 40 core citations to contextualize the motivations, identify specific technical challenges, and define the scope of existing methodologies. The paper’s primary technical contribution is a novel taxonomy that classifies enhancement strategies into two distinct categories: **"Domain Knowledge Driven"** and **"Model Driven"** approaches.
>
> Domain Knowledge Driven methods are defined as techniques that integrate external causal information, such as causal graphs, structural causal models (SCMs), and domain-specific counterfactual data, into the LLM's reasoning pipeline to compensate for statistical limitations. Conversely, Model Driven approaches focus on intrinsic modifications to the model architecture or training algorithms, enabling the system to internalize causal logic directly.
>
> The review’s qualitative analysis identifies three core challenges impeding progress: **Prompt Engineering Difficulty**, resulting from the complexity of eliciting causal logic through text prompts; **Stale Knowledge**, referring to the model's inability to update causal facts post-training; and **Causal Hallucination**, where models generate confident yet factually incorrect causal assertions. Furthermore, the survey synthesizes a centralized landscape of existing benchmarks, including specific datasets designed to test causal capabilities such as **CLUTRR** (causal link tracking) and **COPA** (choice of plausible alternatives).
>
> This consolidation provides critical insights that standard language tests are inadequate for assessment, revealing a need for specialized evaluation protocols that can effectively distinguish between statistical association and true causal inference. By defining the first comprehensive taxonomy and consolidating evaluation resources, this work resolves current research fragmentation and provides a clear roadmap for future development.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Fundamental Limitation:** Despite strong general performance, LLMs possess limited inherent causal reasoning abilities, creating significant bottlenecks in high-stakes domains.
*   **Research Fragmentation:** The field currently lacks a comprehensive review and suffers from fragmentation; existing methods require a systematic taxonomy for categorization and comparison.
*   **Evaluation Gaps:** Assessing causal reasoning necessitates specific benchmarks and evaluation metrics that are distinct from general language tasks.
*   **Evolving Landscape:** The field is active and rapidly evolving, requiring clearly defined future directions to guide advancement.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The authors employed a **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** framework, adhering to the following structured process:

1.  **Contextualization:** Establishing the background and motivations for causal reasoning in LLMs.
2.  **Challenge Identification:** isolating key technical hurdles within the current landscape.
3.  **Taxonomy Development:** Creating a novel taxonomy to systematically categorize existing literature.
4.  **Comparative Analysis:** conducting detailed comparisons of different enhancement methods.
5.  **Synthesis:** Consolidating existing benchmarks and metrics.
6.  **Roadmapping:** Outlining open problems and defining future research directions.

## 🧠 Technical Details

### Proposed Taxonomy
The paper introduces a taxonomy categorizing enhancement methods based on the source of reasoning logic:

| Approach | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Domain Knowledge Driven** | Focuses on integrating external information (e.g., causal graphs, SCMs, counterfactual data) into the reasoning pipeline. |
| **Model Driven** | Focuses on intrinsic reasoning capabilities, modifying architecture or training to internalize causal logic. |

### Architectural Analysis
*   **Standard Transformers:** The paper analyzes how standard architectures predict next tokens based on **statistical correlations** and **inter-token distance**.
*   **The Core Failure Mode:** These models fail to distinguish correlation from causation due to their "black-box" opacity and reliance on statistical associations rather than logical causality.

## 📈 Results & Core Challenges

### Experimental Insights
*   **Quantitative Data:** Specific quantitative experimental results and detailed evaluation metrics were not present in the provided analyzed sections.
*   **Qualitative Findings:** The analysis identified three primary challenges hindering the progress of causal reasoning in LLMs:

1.  **Prompt Engineering Difficulty:** The inherent complexity of eliciting accurate causal logic solely through text-based prompts.
2.  **Stale Knowledge:** The inability of models to update or acquire new causal facts after the training phase has concluded.
3.  **Causal Hallucination:** A phenomenon where models generate causal assertions that are confident yet factually incorrect.

### Benchmark Landscape
The survey highlights specific datasets essential for testing causal capabilities, noting that standard language tests are inadequate. Mentioned benchmarks include:
*   **CLUTRR** (Causal Link Tracking)
*   **COPA** (Choice of Plausible Alternatives)
*   Various specific causal inference datasets
