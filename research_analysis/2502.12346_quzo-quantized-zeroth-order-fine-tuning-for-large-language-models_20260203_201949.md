## 📝 Executive Summary

Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally prohibitive for most applications due to the substantial memory footprint required for storing full-precision weights and computing gradients via backpropagation. While quantization offers a path to reduce memory, existing low-precision fine-tuning methods face critical accuracy degradation. This is primarily caused by the reliance on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE), which introduces significant estimator errors and bias when approximating gradients for discrete weights. Consequently, traditional first-order optimization often fails under extreme low-precision constraints (INT4/INT8), creating a barrier for memory-efficient model adaptation.

The authors introduce **QuZO (Quantized Zeroth-Order Optimization)**, the first framework designed for memory-efficient, full-weight fine-tuning of LLMs in extreme low-precision environments. QuZO eliminates the need for backpropagation and the problematic STE by operating directly on low-bit weights using only forward passes. The core technical contribution is a Quantized Randomized Gradient Estimator utilizing "Dual-Seed Stochastic Quantization." This method generates perturbation vectors using two independent seeds with optimized stochastic rounding. Because stochastic rounding is unbiased ($E[Q(x)] = x$), using two independent seeds ensures that the statistical expectation of the difference between perturbed points aligns with the true gradient, effectively canceling out the quantization bias inherent in STE methods.

Empirically, QuZO achieves superior accuracy compared to first-order methods in INT8 and INT4 settings while delivering comparable results in FP8 configurations. Crucially, the framework demonstrates performance parity with the MeZO baseline across a comprehensive range of tasks, including GLUE, Multi-Choice, and Generation tasks. On the LLaMA2-7B model, QuZO recovers FP16-level accuracy in INT4 settings, maintaining within 1% of full-precision performance (e.g., achieving ~92.6% on GLUE SST-2 compared to ~93.1% for full precision). In terms of hardware efficiency, fine-tuning LLaMA2-7B with QuZO reduces memory costs by **2.94x** compared to standard full-finetuning methods, a reduction attributed to the elimination of backward passes and the storage of high-precision gradients.

This research significantly broadens the feasibility of deploying and adapting LLMs on resource-constrained hardware. By proving that zeroth-order optimization can match or exceed the accuracy of first-order methods in low-bit regimes while maintaining parity with existing zeroth-order baselines like MeZO, QuZO challenges the conventional reliance on backpropagation for LLM fine-tuning. The successful removal of STE-related errors resolves a major bottleneck in quantized training. Consequently, QuZO establishes a new standard for memory-efficient full-weight fine-tuning, potentially enabling on-device customization of massive models without the need for enterprise-grade GPU clusters.
