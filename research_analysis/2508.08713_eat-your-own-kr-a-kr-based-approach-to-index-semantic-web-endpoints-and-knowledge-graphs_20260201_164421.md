## Executive Summary

The exponential growth of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud has resulted in a highly decentralized landscape of heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and SPARQL endpoints. This paper addresses the critical lack of a unified mechanism to monitor, index, and evaluate the quality and capabilities of these diverse resources. The absence of systematic oversight creates a barrier to understanding the ecosystem's state, preventing the community from tracking standard adoption, assessing real-world data quality, and verifying how theoretical Knowledge Representation (KR) advancements translate into practice.

The key innovation is the **IndeGx framework**, which employs a reflexive Knowledge Representation approach—effectively "using KR to index KR." By treating the index of KGs as a KG itself, the system utilizes a fully ontology-oriented modeling approach based on declarative procedural knowledge. Technically, the architecture implements a stratified reasoning workflow comprising three sequential steps:
1.  **Extraction:** Uses "Test & Action Rules" based on SPARQL ASK and UPDATE queries with dynamic substitution.
2.  **Augmentation:** Applies local SPARQL rules to optimize the intermediate KG.
3.  **Inference:** Employs an OWL RL reasoner to enrich the data with inferred types and properties.

This design is supported by Git-based management to ensure agility and maintainability. The researchers applied IndeGx to conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of **over 300 open knowledge graph endpoints**, covering a scope that includes the broader LOD cloud (>1,300 KGs, >16,300 links). The study yielded specific insights into SPARQL endpoint capabilities, identifying adoption gaps and detecting specific features like the **VALUES** and **SERVICE** clauses. The framework executed quality evaluations "in the wild," distinguishing between active and dormant services and mapping the distribution of ontology vocabularies.

This research significantly influences the field by providing a robust, extensible tool for community monitoring and the empirical assessment of the Semantic Web. It bridges the gap between academia and industry by revealing which specific KR research results are actively utilized in practical deployments.

## Methodology

The research utilizes the **IndeGx framework**, an extensible, rule-based framework designed to index Knowledge Graph (KG) content and SPARQL endpoint capacities. The methodology is distinguished by:

*   **Ontology-Oriented Modeling:** It employs a fully ontology-oriented approach using reflexive Knowledge Representation and reasoning techniques (effectively using KR to analyze KR usage).
*   **Technical Stack:** The implementation relies on SPARQL rules combined with an OWL RL ontology of the indexing domain.
*   **Declarative Knowledge:** The framework relies on the declarative representation of procedural knowledge.
*   **Agile Maintenance:** It leverages GitHub to ensure agility, customization, and easy maintenance of the rule sets.

## Technical Details

The IndeGx framework treats an index of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as a KG itself, using a **reflexive Knowledge Representation approach** to index SPARQL endpoints.

### System Architecture
The architecture is a **stratified reasoning workflow** consisting of three sequential steps:

1.  **Step 1: Extraction**
    *   Uses **"Test & Action Rules"** based on SPARQL ASK and UPDATE queries.
    *   Characterizes datasets and updates descriptions with dynamic substitution.
2.  **Step 2: Augmentation**
    *   Applies SPARQL rules locally to the KG created in Step 1.
    *   Optimizes reasoning for the subsequent step.
3.  **Step 3: Inference**
    *   Employs an **OWL RL reasoner** to augment the graph with inferred types and properties.

### Tooling & Features
*   **Traceability:** Supports full traceability of executed rules.
*   **Agile Development:** Facilitates agile development via Git-based management.
*   **Auxiliary Tools:**
    *   **"KartoGraphI"**: Used for visualization.
    *   **"Metadatamatic"**: Used for metadata creation.
