## 📝 Executive Summary

The traditional **Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework** is fundamentally limited in real-world applications because it relies on the assumption of static data distributions. In dynamic environments where data distributions and objectives evolve over time, PAC learning fails to adapt, rendering it ineffective for complex, non-stationary systems. This paper addresses this critical gap by demonstrating the specific failures of classical methods and establishing the necessity of a new mathematical approach capable of handling stochastic processes with shifting distributions. The authors argue that without a framework capable of minimizing future loss rather than historical error, AI systems cannot reliably operate in real-world scenarios where non-stationarity is the norm.

The authors propose **"Prospective Learning"** as a rigorous replacement for the PAC framework, shifting the objective from minimizing historical error to minimizing integrated future loss, defined as Prospective Risk ($R_t$). Technically, the solution augments input data with temporal indices $(x_t, y_t, t)$ and defines hypotheses as time-varying functions rather than static mappings. The proposed solution utilizes the **Prospective Empirical Risk Minimizer (Prospective ERM)** and a specialized **Prospective-MLP** architecture. Addressing architectural nuance, the Prospective-MLP is distinct from standard Transformer models; while it processes concatenated inputs $(\hat{s}, x_s)$, it employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron structure that utilizes Transformer-style sine/cosine position encodings for temporal processing rather than full attention mechanisms. The work further extends this foundation to sequential decision-making through **"Prospective Foraging,"** generalizing the approach beyond static classification.

The framework was rigorously validated against benchmarks including **Periodic Processes**, **Linear (Infinite Task) Processes**, and **Dependent Structured Task Processes (Hierarchical Hidden Markov)**. Evaluations using specific technical metrics—Prospective Risk ($R_t$) and Bayes Risk ($R^*_t$)—demonstrated that the Prospective-MLP successfully converges to the theoretical optimal Bayes Risk. This stands in sharp contrast to standard task-agnostic online continual learning methods, which failed to improve upon chance-level risk in periodic scenarios. In sequential decision-making tests, the prospective learning framework applied to foraging tasks performed competitively against Reinforcement Learning, while specific algorithmic refinements yielded measurable enhancements in computational efficiency compared to prior iterations.

This research significantly advances the field by providing a mathematically sound alternative to the PAC learning paradigm that effectively resolves the challenges of non-stationarity. By demonstrating convergence to optimal Bayes Risk where classical methods stagnate at chance levels, the authors establish Prospective Learning as a critical tool for the future of robust, real-world AI. The successful generalization of the framework to complex sequential decision-making tasks further broadens its applicability. To facilitate adoption and further validation, the authors have released their implementation code, reinforcing a commitment to open science and enabling the broader research community to build upon these prospective methodologies.
