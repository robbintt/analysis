## Executive Summary

Current autonomous agents struggle to master complex, multi-step reasoning tasks primarily because traditional training paradigms rely on sparse outcome-based rewards. These systems typically receive feedback only upon the final success or failure of a task, which fails to provide the granular guidance necessary for agents to correct intermediate errors or refine their decision-making processes. This lack of dense, informative feedback creates a significant bottleneck in developing agents capable of robust tool use and long-horizon planning in dynamic environments.

The authors introduce the **Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM)**, a framework designed to move beyond binary rewards by generating structured, multi-faceted feedback. Technically, Agent-RRM leverages the **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)** framework to provide agents with three distinct components of guidance: internal reasoning traces, targeted critiques, and holistic quality scores. The paper systematically investigates three integration strategies—**Reagent-C** (text-augmented refinement), **Reagent-R** (reward-augmented guidance), and **Reagent-U** (unified feedback integration)—utilizing a toolkit of six distinct capabilities (e.g., Web Browse, Python Interpreter) to optimize policy learning.

Empirical evaluation across 12 diverse benchmarks identifies the unified feedback integration strategy (**Reagent-U**) as the superior approach, yielding substantial performance gains over baseline methods. Specifically, the Agent-RRM framework achieved a score of **43.7%** on the challenging GAIA Benchmark and **46.2%** on the WebWalkerQA Benchmark. Qualitative analysis further demonstrated the model’s ability to pinpoint specific intermediate failures, such as missing navigation steps, over-reliance on text snippets, and tool inefficiencies, confirming the efficacy of granular feedback in improving complex reasoning behaviors.

This research significantly advances the field of agent learning by validating that dense, structured feedback is far more effective than sparse rewards for training complex autonomous systems. By successfully demonstrating that explicit reasoning traces and critiques can be integrated into the reinforcement learning pipeline, the authors establish a new performance ceiling for agent capabilities. To ensure reproducibility and accelerate future research, the team has released their code, models, and curated datasets.

## Methodology

The authors introduced the **Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM)**, designed to move beyond sparse outcome-based rewards through structured feedback. The methodology comprises two main components:

### Multi-Faceted Feedback Generation
The model produces three distinct types of output to guide agent learning:
1.  **Explicit Reasoning Traces**
2.  **Focused Critiques**
3.  **Overall Scores**

### Integration Strategies
The study investigated three distinct methods for incorporating reasoning rewards:
*   **Reagent-C:** Text-augmented refinement.
*   **Reagent-R:** Reward-augmented guidance.
*   **Reagent-U:** Unified feedback integration.

These strategies were evaluated across **12 diverse benchmarks** to assess their effectiveness in complex scenarios.
