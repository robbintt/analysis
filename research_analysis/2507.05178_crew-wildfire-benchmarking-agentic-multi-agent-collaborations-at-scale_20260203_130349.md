> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM-based multi-agent frameworks are theoretically designed for complex collaboration, yet their ability to function in real-world scenarios remains largely untested due to a lack of adequate evaluation tools. Existing benchmarks are frequently inadequate, typically focusing on small-scale, deterministic environments that fail to capture the intricacies of real-world operations.
>
> This paper addresses the critical need for rigorous testing environments that introduce **partial observability**, **stochastic dynamics**, and **heterogeneous agent requirements**. The authors highlight that without such benchmarks, it is impossible to accurately assess system robustness or the true viability of these models in handling long-horizon planning and large-scale coordination under uncertainty.
>
> The researchers introduce **CREW-Wildfire**, an open-source benchmark built on the Unity-based CREW simulation platform. Empirical testing revealed substantial performance deficiencies in current SOTA models, specifically in complex coordination, communication, and spatial reasoning. By open-sourcing all code and data, this work establishes a reproducible standard and identifies the critical technical barriers that must be overcome to advance multi-agent systems from theory to practice.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Performance Deficiencies:** Evaluations of SOTA LLM-based multi-agent frameworks revealed substantial deficiencies in the new benchmark, indicating current models cannot handle complex, real-world scale coordination.
*   **Unsolved Challenges:** The study highlighted critical gaps in large-scale coordination, communication, spatial reasoning, and long-horizon planning under uncertainty.
*   **Inadequacy of Existing Benchmarks:** Current benchmarks were found lacking, typically focusing on small-scale or low-complexity domains that do not stress-test system robustness.
*   **Necessity of Complexity:** Introducing **partial observability**, **stochastic dynamics**, and **heterogeneous agents** is essential for accurately testing and validating system performance.
