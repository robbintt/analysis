## Executive Summary

Current security research in Large Language Models (LLMs) predominantly focuses on model-level threats, such as prompt injection and adversarial attacks, while largely neglecting the security of the underlying software supply chain. This gap is critical because LLM repositories rely heavily on complex, third-party dependency ecosystems (primarily Python) to function. If these foundational packages contain vulnerabilities, the integrity of the entire LLM system is compromised.

This paper addresses this oversight by investigating the prevalence and management of vulnerable package dependencies within open-source LLM repositories. The study introduces a novel three-step empirical framework designed specifically to analyze the LLM supply chain. By parsing source code and configuration files, aggregating vulnerability data from Snyk.io and Libraries.io, and analyzing maintenance practices via Pull Requests, the authors reveal a precarious security posture.

The empirical analysis indicates severe latency in vulnerability remediation: **50%** of the identified vulnerabilities remain undisclosed for more than **56.2 months**, a duration significantly longer than observed in the broader Python ecosystem. This research bridges a major research gap by providing the first large-scale empirical evidence of supply chain risks specific to LLMs, offering actionable insights for practitioners and establishing a vital baseline for future hardening of the LLM supply chain.

## Key Findings

*   **High Prevalence of Vulnerabilities:** 75.8% of the analyzed open-source LLM repositories include vulnerable dependencies within their configuration files.
*   **Extended Disclosure Delays:** 50% of the vulnerabilities identified in the LLM ecosystem remain undisclosed for more than 56.2 months.
*   **Ecosystem Comparison:** The duration of undisclosed vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem is significantly longer than that observed in the broader Python ecosystem.

## Methodology

The researchers conducted an empirical analysis on **52 open-source LLM repositories**, specifically examining their third-party dependencies and associated security vulnerabilities.

The methodology consisted of three primary activities:
1.  **Repository Analysis:** Examining activities within the repositories to understand how maintainers manage third-party vulnerabilities.
2.  **Benchmarking:** Comparing findings against the general Python ecosystem to highlight security timeline discrepancies.
3.  **Data Collection:** A hybrid search strategy combining an academic corpus (Hou et al.) and a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was used to construct the dataset.

---

## Technical Details

The study employs a rigorous empirical analysis framework and a specific vulnerability lifecycle model to assess risk.

### 1. Empirical Analysis Framework
*   **Step 1: Dependency Identification** — Parsing source code and configuration files of the 52 identified open-source LLM projects.
*   **Step 2: Vulnerability Data Aggregation** — Collecting known vulnerability data from Snyk.io and Libraries.io.
*   **Step 3: Patching Practice Analysis** — Investigating maintenance behaviors specifically through Pull Requests.

### 2. Lifecycle Model
To accurately measure disclosure delays, the study utilizes a **four-stage vulnerability lifecycle model**:
1.  Introduction
2.  Discovery
3.  Fix
4.  Disclosure

### 3. Supply Chain Definition
The study defines the supply chain to include standard Python libraries (e.g., `os`, `json`) in addition to third-party packages.

## Results

The analysis covered a diverse dataset with the following specific outcomes:

*   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** 75.8% of analyzed repositories contain vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Disclosure Timelines:** 50% of identified vulnerabilities remain undisclosed for > 56.2 months.

### Dataset Breakdown
*   **Architecture Split:**
    *   Decoder-Only: ~57.7% (30 repos)
    *   Encoder-Decoder: ~23.1% (12 repos)
    *   Encoder-Only: ~19.2% (10 repos)
*   **Repository Metrics:**
    *   Median GitHub Stars: 5,188
    *   Average Creation Year: 2021
*   **Dependency Usage:**
    *   30 out of 52 repositories contain dependency files.
    *   Average of 11.9 dependency entries per file.
    *   39 unique packages identified across the architectures (with significant overlap; architecture-specific totals sum to 112).
