## Executive Summary

Characterizing causal molecular networks in biology remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of biological systems, the prevalence of latent variables, and the dependence on cellular context. Traditional data-driven methods often struggle to capture these nuanced relationships, while existing text-based approaches fail to validate inferences against physical reality. This paper addresses the critical gap between computational causal learning theory and practical biological discovery by investigating whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can reliably infer causal structures from scientific literature to map biological interactions, moving beyond simple textual coherence to establish genuine causal claims.

The authors introduce a novel framework for **Zero-Shot Causal Inference using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, positioning LLMs as "orchestration tools" that distill vast collections of scientific articles into structured causal graphs. Technically, the system models relationships as directed graphs utilizing ancestral semantics and transitive closure to ensure logical consistency. A key innovation is the evaluation methodology: rather than relying solely on text consistency, the authors validate LLM-generated causal claims against real-world interventional data. Ground truth is constructed from **Perturb-seq single-cell perturbation screens** that combine CRISPR-based gene editing with scRNA-seq, providing a rigorous gold standard for benchmarking against existing resources like the STRING database and other data-driven causal structure learning methods.

In experiments covering over one hundred biological variables and testing thousands of causal hypotheses, the study demonstrated that the proposed RAG-enhanced framework significantly outperforms established baselines. Quantitatively, the optimized LLM system achieved an **Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.68**, a substantial improvement over the STRING database baseline, which recorded an AUPRC of only 0.24. Standard causal structure learning algorithms performed at near-random levels, with AUPRCs around 0.10. While the study found that larger models yielded the highest performance, results showed that smaller models could achieve competitive accuracy when configured with tailored retrieval-augmentation and specific prompting strategies, proving that configuration is more critical than the scaling of model parameters.

This research significantly advances the intersection of AI and science by establishing a rigorous, quantitative standard for assessing LLMs against experimental biological data. It validates the concept of using LLMs not merely as text generators, but as high-level reasoning engines capable of complex causal discovery and hypothesis generation. By bridging the gap between literature-based knowledge and experimental validation with concrete performance metrics, this approach provides a scalable blueprint for mapping molecular networks and offers a new, practical methodology for researchers leveraging AI to navigate the rapidly expanding volume of biological literature.
