## 📋 Executive Summary

Current multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems are frequently hindered by rigid architectures that rely on static communication structures and predefined role design spaces. This lack of flexibility limits a system's ability to adapt to complex, evolving tasks, as the agents cannot dynamically adjust their collaboration patterns or reasoning trajectories based on specific problem requirements. Consequently, existing frameworks struggle to optimize reasoning paths effectively, often failing to leverage the full potential of multi-agent collaboration for tasks requiring high levels of generalization and adaptability.

The paper introduces **HALO** (Hierarchical Autonomous Logic-Oriented Orchestration), a dynamic framework that utilizes a three-tier hierarchical architecture to manage agent coordination. The system consists of a **High-Level Planning Agent** for task decomposition, **Mid-Level Role-Design Agents** for dynamic agent instantiation, and **Low-Level Inference Agents** for subtask execution. Crucially, HALO reformulates subtask execution as a structured workflow search problem, utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore the agentic action space and identify optimal reasoning paths. Additionally, an Adaptive Prompt Refinement module—comprising a Task Parser, Template Agent, Optimization Agent, and Generator Agent—automates the transformation of raw user queries into structured prompts, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for non-expert users.

In empirical evaluations, HALO demonstrated superior performance across a diverse range of benchmarks, achieving a **14.4% average improvement** over state-of-the-art baselines in Code Generation, General Reasoning, and Arithmetic Reasoning. The framework exhibited particular strength in specialized domains, securing a 13.3% gain on Moral Scenarios and a 19.6% gain on Algebra tasks. These results were validated against a comprehensive suite of competitor models, including ScoreFlow, CAMEL, AgentVerse, MetaGPT, and DyLAN, confirming HALO's efficacy in enhancing reasoning trajectory construction and adaptability.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Overall Performance:** HALO achieves a **14.4% average improvement** over state-of-the-art baselines across Code Generation, General Reasoning, and Arithmetic Reasoning benchmarks.
*   **Specialized Task Proficiency:** Demonstrates exceptional gains in specific domains, including a **13.3% improvement** on Moral Scenarios and a **19.6% improvement** on Algebra tasks.
*   **Adaptability:** Offers superior adaptability by effectively addressing the limitations of predefined agent roles and static structures.
*   **Reasoning Enhancement:** Successfully enhances reasoning trajectory construction by reformulating subtask execution as a structured workflow search problem.

## 🧠 Methodology

The HALO framework is built upon a **hierarchical reasoning architecture** composed of three distinct levels:

1.  **High-Level Planning Agent:** Responsible for macro-level task decomposition.
2.  **Mid-Level Role-Design Agents:** Focused on instantiating specific agents with dynamic roles.
3.  **Low-Level Inference Agents:** Tasked with the execution of specific subtasks.

**Core Innovations:**
*   **Workflow Search:** The system reformulates subtask execution as a structured workflow search problem, employing **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** to explore the agentic action space efficiently.
*   **Adaptive Prompt Refinement:** A dedicated module transforms raw user queries into task-specific prompts, ensuring the system understands user intent accurately regardless of input quality.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Workflow Optimization
HALO reformulates subtask execution as a search process over a workflow space **$S$**. The primary objective is to maximize a value function **$Value(Q, W)$** to identify the optimal reasoning workflow **$W^*$**.

### Adaptive Prompt Refinement Module
This module consists of a four-stage pipeline designed to lower the barrier to entry for non-expert users:
1.  **Task Parser:** Initial analysis of the raw query.
2.  **Template Agent:** Selects appropriate prompt structures.
3.  **Optimization Agent:** Refines the prompt for clarity and effectiveness.
4.  **Generator Agent:** Produces the final structured prompt.

### Hierarchical Planning & Search
*   **High-Level Planning Agent:** Handles the breakdown of complex tasks.
*   **Mid-Level Role-Design Agent:** Manages dynamic role assignment based on current needs.
*   **Optimization via MCTS:** Utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search which backpropagates **status labels** and **quality scores** to inform future planning steps.

**Architectural Distinction:** Unlike centralized or static Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)-guided frameworks, HALO combines a Hierarchical Structure directly with MCTS for optimized action space navigation.
