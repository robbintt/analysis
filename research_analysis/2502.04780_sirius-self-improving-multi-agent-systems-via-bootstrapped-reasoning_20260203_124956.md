## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Current multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from an over-reliance on fragile, manually designed prompts and heuristics. A critical bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality training data required to develop specialized agents capable of complex reasoning. Without specialized datasets, agents cannot effectively learn from interactions or adapt to dynamic, high-stakes environments.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce **SiriuS**, a self-improving optimization framework utilizing a "Bootstrapped Reasoning" pipeline to generate its own training data. The system constructs an "experience library" that retains reasoning steps leading to success. Crucially, it employs a library augmentation procedure to identify and repair unsuccessful trajectories, converting failures into viable training examples. This data fine-tunes base LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o-mini), enabling continuous self-correction and self-play.

**Results**
SiriuS demonstrated substantial gains across reasoning and competitive negotiation tasks.
*   **QA Benchmarks:** 2.86% to 21.88% improvement in Reasoning & Biomedical QA.
*   **Buyer-Seller Game:** SiriuS agents consistently negotiated the optimal price of 50, whereas base models sold below this threshold.
*   **Ultimatum & Resource Games:** SiriuS secured higher win rates, payoffs, and utility shares.
*   **Robustness:** The system maintained performance during distribution shifts (e.g., resources increasing from 100 to 1000).

**Impact**
This work significantly reduces reliance on static prompt engineering and human-curated data. By validating a mechanism where agents bootstrap improvement from both success and repaired failure, SiriuS establishes a scalable pathway for developing specialized AI agents. This approach has broad implications for deploying autonomous, adaptive multi-agent systems in environments where training data is traditionally scarce or expensive.

## Key Findings

*   **Performance Boost:** Achieved a performance improvement ranging from **2.86% to 21.88%** on reasoning and biomedical Question Answering (QA) tasks.
*   **Enhanced Negotiation:** Successfully enhanced agent negotiation capabilities in competitive settings, securing higher utility and win rates.
*   **Data Scarcity Solution:** Effectively addressed the challenge of acquiring suitable training data for specialized agents by generating high-quality reasoning trajectories.
*   **Reusability:** Produces reusable data that can be utilized for future self-correction and self-play enhancement.

## Methodology

The authors propose **SiriuS**, a self-improving, reasoning-driven optimization framework designed for multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The methodology centers on two core processes:

1.  **Experience Library Construction:** The system builds a library of high-quality reasoning trajectories by selectively retaining specific reasoning steps that lead to successful outcomes.
2.  **Library Augmentation:** A refinement procedure is utilized to analyze and repair unsuccessful trajectories. By converting these failures into useful training examples, the system maximizes the utility of every interaction.

## Technical Details

*   **Pipeline:** Utilizes a **'Bootstrapped Reasoning'** pipeline to generate high-quality reasoning trajectories for training data.
*   **Base Models:** Employs fine-tuning on base Large Language Models, specifically **GPT-3.5** and **GPT-4o-mini**, to create specialized agents.
*   **Architecture:** Features a **self-improvement loop** that produces reusable data designed for self-correction and self-play enhancement.
*   **Generalization:** The pipeline is designed to generalize across varying resource configurations. It trains on specific settings and tests on **out-of-distribution (OOD)** configurations to verify robustness.
