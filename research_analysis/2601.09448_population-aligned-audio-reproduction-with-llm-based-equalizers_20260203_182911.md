> ### 📑 Executive Summary
>
> Conventional audio reproduction systems rely on static presets or require manual expert tuning, failing to capture the diverse and context-dependent nature of human listening preferences. Users often struggle to articulate their sonic needs or adjust complex equalization settings based on changing environments, moods, or social settings. This paper addresses the critical need for a dynamic, accessible interface that can align audio output with specific population-level preferences, moving beyond rigid, manufacturer-defined curves to offer a more personalized and intuitive listening experience.
>
> The core innovation is the repurposing of Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as "artificial equalizers" that translate natural language prompts directly into audio processing parameters. The authors utilize a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) framework—incorporating techniques such as LoRA, Adapters, Prefix Tuning, and Prompt Tuning—to adapt pre-trained LLMs to the audio domain without the computational cost of full retraining. Crucially, the methodology employs Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically Sinkhorn Divergences and the Monge-Kantorovich problem formulation. This approach optimizes for distributional alignment, allowing the model to learn the full spectrum of population preferences derived from controlled listening experiments rather than merely optimizing for point-estimate accuracy.
>
> Evaluations based on controlled listening experiments demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach achieves statistically significant improvements in distributional alignment compared to baseline methods. The model successfully outperformed both random sampling and static preset baselines in its ability to reproduce population-preferred equalization settings. While the source text does not disclose specific quantitative accuracy percentages, the validation confirms the model's capability to reliably perform context-aware tuning and deliver expert-level audio quality using in-context learning and instruction tuning.

## Key Findings

*   **Conversational Audio Control:** LLMs can effectively map natural language text prompts to audio equalization settings, enabling a user-friendly conversational interface for sound system control.
*   **Statistical Significance:** The proposed model achieves statistically significant improvements in distributional alignment with population preferences compared to random sampling and static preset baselines.
*   **Efficient Adaptation:** The use of in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning allows models to reliably learn and reproduce population-preferred equalization settings derived from controlled listening experiments without full retraining.
*   **Artificial Equalizers:** The study validates the potential of LLMs to function as "artificial equalizers," capable of providing context-aware and expert-level audio tuning.

## Methodology

The research approach relies on a robust framework designed to bridge natural language with audio signal processing:

*   **Data Foundation:** Models were trained and evaluated using data collected from controlled listening experiments to establish ground-truth population preferences.
*   **Architecture:** The solution utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture acting as a translation layer between natural language inputs and audio processing parameters.
*   **Training Strategy:** The approach employs both in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to adapt the LLM to the specific domain of audio equalization without requiring full model retraining.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance was assessed using distributional metrics designed to capture the varied and diverse nature of user preferences, rather than relying solely on point-estimate accuracy.

## Technical Details

The implementation leverages advanced machine learning techniques to optimize audio reproduction:

*   **PEFT Framework:** Utilizes a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) framework adapting LLMs as audio equalizers.
    *   **Techniques:** LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), Adapters, Prefix Tuning, and Prompt Tuning.
*   **Optimal Transport (OT) Theory:** Employs OT theory to achieve distributional alignment with population preferences.
    *   **Specifics:** Uses Sinkhorn Divergences and the Monge-Kantorovich problem formulation.
*   **Data Processing:** Data synthesis and instruction tuning are used to map natural language to audio parameters.

## Contributions

This research offers several advancements to the field of audio engineering and human-computer interaction:

*   **Dynamic Alternative:** Provides a viable alternative to conventional static equalization by introducing a dynamic, text-based system that adapts to changing contexts such as mood, location, or social setting.
*   **Population Alignment:** Demonstrates a method for aligning audio reproduction systems with the collective preferences of a specific population, moving beyond individual or manufacturer-defined presets.
*   **Accessibility:** Contributes to the development of more accessible audio tools by leveraging LLMs to democratize expert-level tuning capabilities for general users.

## Results

The proposed system was rigorously tested against standard baselines:
