## Executive Summary

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is increasingly pivotal in safety-critical autonomous systems, yet these models remain highly susceptible to adversarial attacks that can induce catastrophic failures. This paper addresses the urgent vulnerability of DRL policies to evasion attacks, specifically the **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)**, within the context of autonomous driving. While individual defense techniques exist, there is a significant research gap regarding their integration; current reliance on single-point defenses often results in insufficient robustness. The problem is compounded by the high stakes of autonomous driving, where an attacked policy results not just in performance degradation, but in dangerous physical collisions.

To solve this, the authors introduce a novel **Ensemble Defense Architecture** that functions as a non-intrusive inference wrapper, requiring no modifications to the underlying policy or retraining. The core technical innovation is a filtering consensus mechanism that processes raw inputs through three parallel pathways: Random Noise injection to induce stochasticity, an Autoencoder for feature reconstruction, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. By aggregating the outputs of these heterogeneous filters into a single consensus, the architecture effectively neutralizes adversarial perturbations while preserving the integrity of the original observation signal, effectively "filtering out" the attack before the data reaches the agent.

Empirical validation in highway and merge simulation scenarios demonstrates the method's superiority over standalone techniques. Under FGSM attacks, the undefended baseline model suffered a severe performance collapse, achieving a mean reward of only 5.87 with a collision rate of 0.50. The ensemble defense dramatically improved resilience, boosting the mean reward to 18.38—a **213% increase**—and reducing the collision rate by **82% to 0.09**. Furthermore, the integrated approach recovered over 60% of the original performance observed in non-attack conditions (Mean Reward 30.63), whereas individual defense components (Autoencoder, PCA, Random Noise) yielded only marginal improvements, with mean rewards stagnating between 6.57 and 7.15.

This research substantially advances the field of robust DRL by providing concrete quantitative evidence that multi-defense integration strategies offer superior protection over single-mechanism approaches. By demonstrating that consensus filtering can significantly mitigate adversarial risks without the overhead of policy retraining, the study establishes a practical, scalable blueprint for deploying secure agents in open-world systems. These findings shift the paradigm from relying on isolated defenses to cooperative, ensemble architectures, setting a new standard for safety and reliability in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving.

## Technical Details: The Ensemble Architecture

The proposed solution is an **Ensemble Defense Architecture** designed as a filtering consensus mechanism. It functions as a defensive wrapper that sits outside the policy, requiring no retraining.

**Core Mechanism:**
The architecture processes raw input through three distinct filtering mechanisms in parallel. It aggregates the results to create a consensus that mitigates adversarial perturbations.

*   **Pathway 1: Random Noise**
    *   *Function:* Injects stochasticity into the input.
    *   *Purpose:* Breaks the consistency of adversarial perturbations.
*   **Pathway 2: Autoencoder**
    *   *Function:* Reconstructs clean features from the input.
    *   *Purpose:* Learns to ignore noise and reconstruct the underlying legitimate data structure.
*   **Pathway 3: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
    *   *Function:* Performs dimensionality reduction.
    *   *Purpose:* Projects inputs into a lower-dimensional space, potentially discarding minor perturbations that do not align with principal components.

**Consensus Layer:**
The outputs from these three parallel pathways are aggregated to form a final, "clean" input that is passed to the DRL agent.

### Performance Comparison

| Metric / Condition | Baseline (No Attack) | Under Attack (No Defense) | Ensemble Defense |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **Mean Collision Rate** | 0.03 | 0.50 | **0.09** |

### Analysis

*   **Ensemble Defense:** Achieved a Mean Reward of 18.38 (a 213% improvement over the undefended attack) and recovered over 60% of original performance.
*   **Collision Safety:** Reduced the Collision Rate to 0.09 (an 82% reduction compared to the undefended attack).
*   **Standalone Defenses:** Techniques such as Autoencoder, PCA, and Random Noise acting alone provided only marginal improvements, with Mean Rewards stagnating between 6.57 and 7.15.
