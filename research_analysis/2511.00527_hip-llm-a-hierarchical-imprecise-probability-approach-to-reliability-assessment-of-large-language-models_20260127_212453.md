## 1. Executive Summary

Current evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) rely heavily on static benchmarks and descriptive statistics, failing to capture the probabilistic nature of model reliability required for safety-critical deployments. This gap creates a significant challenge for systems where the probability of failure-free operation is paramount. Existing methods lack rigorous mechanisms to incorporate specific usage contexts and fail to account for epistemic uncertainty—the unknowns arising from limited data or knowledge about model behavior in distinct domains. Consequently, there is a critical need for a standardized framework that bridges theoretical benchmark performance and real-world operational reliability.

**HIP-LLM addresses this by integrating Software Reliability Engineering with Hierarchical Imprecise Probability.** The framework utilizes a three-level hierarchical structure (**System, Domain, Subdomain**) that incorporates Operational Profiles—weights representing how frequently specific features are used—to aggregate reliability from granular tasks up to the system level. Technically, the model employs a Binomial likelihood with Beta-Binomial conjugate priors for subdomain parameters, while higher levels use hyperpriors to govern mean and precision. Distinctively, HIP-LLM manages epistemic uncertainty by using an "admissible set" of hyperparameters rather than single-point estimates. This approach generates posterior reliability envelopes—mathematical bounds that quantify uncertainty—calculated via closed-form analysis at the base level and Monte Carlo sampling for complex, weighted sums at higher levels.

As the paper is primarily theoretical, its results are presented through six formal theorems rather than empirical experimental metrics. These mathematical proofs establish the properties of the hierarchical model and validate the calculation of reliability envelopes. The derivations demonstrate that the framework successfully bounds epistemic uncertainty and correctly models reliability for consecutive sequential operations. By providing exact solutions for conjugate analysis and validating the convergence of its Monte Carlo components, the authors mathematically guarantee that HIP-LLM performs exact multi-level inference, effectively propagating uncertainty from specific subdomains to the holistic system view.

HIP-LLM represents a pivotal shift from static, descriptive evaluations to rigorous, probabilistic modeling under uncertainty. By formally integrating usage contexts through Operational Profiles and quantifying confidence intervals via reliability envelopes, this research lays the groundwork for the formal certification of LLMs in high-risk environments. The release of a publicly accessible repository ensures reproducibility and invites the broader community to apply and extend these methods. Ultimately, this framework provides the necessary statistical foundation for future work focused on the trustworthiness and operational safety of generative AI systems.

## 4. Technical Details

HIP-LLM is a hierarchical Bayesian framework using Imprecise Probabilities to quantify LLM reliability.

### Structural Hierarchy
The system organizes reliability across three levels:
1.  **System**
2.  **Domain**
3.  **Subdomain**

It uses **Operational Profiles (local and global weights)** for aggregation across these levels.

### Statistical Model
*   **Likelihood:** Binomial likelihood.
*   **Subdomain Parameters:** Uses a Beta-Binomial conjugate prior.
*   **Hyperpriors:** Beta and Gamma hyperpriors are applied for mean and precision at higher levels.

### Uncertainty Management
To handle epistemic uncertainty, the model utilizes an **'admissible set' of hyperparameters**. This generates **reliability envelopes (intervals)** rather than simple point estimates.

### Computational Approach
*   **Subdomain Level:** Uses closed-form conjugate analysis.
*   **Domain & System Levels:** Relies on calculating Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) via **Monte Carlo sampling** of independent Betas to handle the complexity of weighted sums.
*   **Sequential Operations:** Defines reliability for consecutive operations via power transformations of the probability parameter.
