## Executive Summary

Current Multi-Task Learning (MTL) frameworks utilizing standard Prompt Tuning face a critical bottleneck: they struggle to effectively model task heterogeneity, leading to the phenomenon of "knowledge mixing" where task-specific nuances are overshadowed by shared information. This is particularly challenging because standard prompt tuning relies on keeping Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) parameters frozen to maintain parameter efficiency. Consequently, existing methods often fail to balance the retention of shared knowledge with the need for task-specific adaptation, limiting performance when dealing with highly diverse tasks.

The authors propose **Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation (TA-LoRA)**, a novel framework built upon the Qwen architecture that decouples shared knowledge from task-specific features using a fast-slow weights mechanism. TA-LoRA utilizes low-rank representations to manage task heterogeneity, designating "slow weights" to encode cross-task shared knowledge while employing "fast weights" to capture task-specific nuances, thereby preventing interference. Additionally, the method introduces a zero-initialized attention mechanism to ensure training stability during the warm-up phase and employs a hierarchical learning structure where general features are processed in early layers and task-specific features are prioritized in deeper layers (specifically layers 14, 21, and 28).

TA-LoRA achieved **State-of-the-Art (SOTA)** performance across 16 diverse tasks, demonstrating robustness in both full-data and few-shot learning scenarios. The model was trained on 8 source tasks with dataset sizes ranging from 11.9K to 4.1M samples and was successfully evaluated on 5 unseen tasks. Ablation studies utilizing cosine similarity analysis on the AFQMC dataset provided empirical evidence for the framework's design; results showed negligible initial similarity in base models (Layer 14: -0.0015%) that increased significantly in deeper layers during training, confirming that task-specific adaptation is effectively isolated to the network's later stages.

This research significantly advances the field of efficient MTL by demonstrating that superior performance can be achieved without the computational overhead of fine-tuning entire PLMs. By successfully overcoming the limitations of standard Prompt Tuning through the decoupling of fast and slow weights, TA-LoRA provides a scalable blueprint for handling task heterogeneity in resource-constrained environments.
