## Executive Summary

**Problem**
As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into agentic AI workflows, the computational cost and latency associated with long-context prompts have emerged as critical scalability bottlenecks. Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often struggle with context window limits and the financial burden of processing extensive source material. This paper addresses the urgent need for compute optimization by proposing a method to drastically reduce the token footprint of input data without compromising the semantic integrity required for high-quality model inference.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce "Hypernym Mercury," a novel text representation scheme founded on Semantic Field Constriction and Reconstruction from Hypernyms. This approach utilizes a proprietary five-stage pipeline that transforms standard text into an intermediate structure called a "dart," consisting of a "Tip" (the core abstracted statement using hypernyms) and a "Tail" (structured key-value details). Technically, the system differentiates itself through the application of game-theoretic metrics; it uses Shapley value calculations to evaluate the importance of specific details within a paragraph. These scores drive a "Field Constrictor" mechanism that performs word-level semantic compression via abstraction, swapping, and removal, followed by a multi-model verification loop to ensure fidelity.

**Results**
Benchmarking conducted using open-source data (specifically the text of Bram Stoker's *Dracula*) indicates that the method achieves over 90% reduction in LLM prompt tokens while retaining high semantic similarity to the original source. The authors confirm the technique is effective at the paragraph level and maintains consistent performance across multiple genres and AI models. However, while the qualitative findings suggest high efficacy, it is notable that the current documentation lacks specific quantitative metrics—such as ROUGE, BERTScore, exact token counts, and latency figures—in the Abstract and Introduction, leaving granular validation of these claims pending a deeper review of the full technical specifications.

**Impact**
This research offers a significant contribution to the field of agentic AI by establishing a patent-pending framework designed specifically for compute optimization. By enabling controllable detail granularity and the potential for "lossless" semantic reconstruction, Hypernym Mercury could fundamentally alter how prompts are engineered, moving away from manual truncation toward automated, semantically aware compression. If subsequent data confirms the initial benchmarks, this method could substantially reduce operational costs for LLM deployments and enhance the efficiency of knowledge retrieval systems.

## Technical Details

The core of the paper is a 5-stage pipeline designed for semantic text compression:

1.  **Parsing and Dart Structuring**
    Initial processing of raw text into the proprietary "dart" format.
2.  **Detail Importance Evaluation**
    Utilization of **Shapley value calculations** (game-theoretic metrics) to evaluate the relative importance of specific details.
3.  **Compression Optimization (Field Constrictor)**
    The active compression phase involving:
    *   Swapping
    *   Abstracting
    *   Removal
    *(Actions are based on the importance scores derived in stage 2)*.
4.  **Multi-model Verification**
    A verification loop using independent AI models to ensure semantic fidelity is maintained.
5.  **Output Generation**
    Final production of the compressed text suitable for LLM input.

**Differentiation:** The method is distinct in its use of game-theoretic metrics for importance evaluation and its closed-loop verification system.
