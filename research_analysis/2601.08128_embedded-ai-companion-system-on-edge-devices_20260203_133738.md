## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Current AI companion systems face a critical trade-off between computational performance and deployment environment. Existing solutions typically rely on large, cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which introduce significant latency, privacy concerns, and dependency on internet connectivity. Conversely, deploying these systems on edge devices is hindered by hardware constraints; running raw LLMs locally often results in an inability to maintain long-term context or memory due to limited RAM and processing power. This paper addresses the challenge of creating a responsive, personalized AI companion capable of operating within the stringent resource limits of embedded hardware without sacrificing the depth of interaction found in cloud-based alternatives.

**Innovation**
The core innovation is a **Dual-Phase "Active–Inactive" architecture** designed to decouple real-time interaction from computationally intensive memory processing. The "Active Phase" handles low-latency dialogue retrieval and generation, while the "Inactive Phase" executes during periods of user inactivity to perform background tasks such as memory extraction, summarization, and user profiling (using traits like Meyers Briggs and Big Five). Technically, the system was implemented on a NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super 8GB using a quantized Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (int4 GGUF) via llama.cpp and `gte-base-en-v1.5` embeddings. Memory management utilizes a dual-store approach (Short-term and Long-term) with cosine similarity retrieval, top-$k$ selection, and a sliding window mechanism to manage context input size effectively.

**Results**
The proposed system demonstrated a significant performance advantage over a raw Qwen2.5-7B-int4 baseline and achieved **performance parity with GPT-3.5** (featuring a 16k context window) on the newly introduced AI Companion benchmark. Latency analysis revealed strict boundaries for edge deployment: approximately 2 seconds of latency allows for a context limit of ~1000 tokens, while ~5 seconds Time to First Token (TTFT) permits ~2500 tokens. Attempts to process contexts exceeding 10k tokens resulted in Out of Memory (OOM) errors. Furthermore, the system successfully validated its psychometric profiling capabilities, accurately tracking user personality metrics alongside standard conversational benchmarks.

**Impact**
This research represents a pivotal shift in edge AI, demonstrating that small, quantized models can effectively compete with large, cloud-based models when paired with an optimized memory architecture. By proving that long-term personalization can be maintained on resource-constrained devices, this work establishes a viable path for private, responsive, and intelligent AI companions that do not require cloud connectivity. Additionally, the introduction of a specific "AI Companion benchmark" provides the field with a standardized framework for evaluating future systems, emphasizing the importance of memory and personality retention alongside raw generation capabilities.
