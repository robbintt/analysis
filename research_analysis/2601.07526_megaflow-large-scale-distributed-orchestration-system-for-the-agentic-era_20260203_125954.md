## 📋 Executive Summary

The transition to autonomous agents requires infrastructure capable of handling massive concurrency, yet current open-source systems struggle with stability and resource efficiency during large-scale training and evaluation. Existing tools fail to orchestrate the complex, multi-step interactions between agents and environments at the necessary scale. This paper addresses this infrastructure gap by proposing a distributed orchestration system capable of managing the high-volume workloads required for deploying and evaluating foundation models in real-world automation tasks.

MegaFlow introduces a decoupled three-service architecture that abstracts infrastructure into independent components: a **Model Service** for computation, an **Agent Service** for logic, and an **Environment Service** for execution. These services interact via unified interfaces, allowing for independent scaling and flexible resource allocation across diverse frameworks. The system utilizes a high-performance asynchronous Task Scheduler with FIFO policies and a Resource Manager employing a "many-small-instances" approach with three-tier concurrency control, enabling event-driven coordination and dual-layer isolation for secure, distributed state management.

Empirical validation demonstrates that MegaFlow successfully orchestrates tens of thousands of concurrent agent tasks while maintaining high system stability and efficient resource utilization. Tested on complex software engineering and computer use automation tasks, the system proved capable of managing vast agent-environment interactions through elastic scaling and hybrid execution models. The results confirm that the architecture effectively handles the computational and logical demands of large-scale deployments without performance degradation. MegaFlow establishes a foundational open-source framework for the agentic era, bridging the gap between theoretical agent designs and practical deployment.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Scalability & Stability:** MegaFlow successfully orchestrates tens of thousands of concurrent agent tasks while maintaining high system stability and resource efficiency.
*   **Infrastructure Gap:** Addresses the critical lack of open-source infrastructure available for the large-scale training and evaluation of complex agentic tasks.
*   **Architectural Flexibility:** Enables architectural flexibility by decoupling infrastructure into independent services, allowing for the independent scaling of models, agents, and environments.

## 🧪 Methodology

The authors designed MegaFlow as a large-scale distributed orchestration system specifically tailored for agent-environment workloads. The core methodology abstracts the infrastructure into three distinct, independent services that interact via unified interfaces:

1.  **Model Service:** Handles all computation/inference requirements.
2.  **Agent Service:** Manages the logic and decision-making processes.
3.  **Environment Service:** Manages interactions and execution states.

This separation of concerns facilitates efficient scheduling, fine-grained task management, and independent resource scaling across the entire system.
