## 📑 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the recent decline in the popularity of meta-learning for few-shot classification, a trend driven by the rise of simpler "whole-class training" (WCT) strategies that often match or exceed meta-learning performance in standard supervised settings. The authors identify a critical gap in theoretical understanding: while meta-learning has been empirically sidelined, its statistical advantages in scenarios with limited information—specifically unsupervised learning or environments with low annotation entropy—remain underexplored. The study challenges the emerging consensus that meta-learning is obsolete, aiming to determine if specific theoretical conditions exist where meta-learning inherently outperforms simpler baselines in terms of generalization and robustness.

The key innovation is the introduction of **MINO** (Meta-learning with Limited Entropy), a framework grounded in a novel theoretical analysis based on Uniform Stability. The authors define an "entropy-limited supervised setting," proving mathematically that meta-learning possesses a tighter generalization bound than WCT when annotation entropy is low. Technically, MINO implements an unsupervised task construction mechanism that utilizes an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm paired with a dynamic classification head to generate pseudo-labels. It further introduces a "**stability-based meta-scaler**" designed to filter label noise, thereby providing robustness against the heterogeneity and noise inherent in unsupervised task distributions.

Empirical validation on ShapeNet-Core, Omniglot, and Mini-ImageNet demonstrates that MINO achieves superior performance in unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks compared to whole-class training strategies. On the standard Mini-ImageNet 5-way 5-shot benchmark, MINO achieved **48.27%** accuracy, significantly outperforming the WCT baseline (**44.58%**) and the DeepCluster baseline (**41.34%**). Similarly, on ShapeNet-Core 5-way 5-shot, MINO reached **77.61%** compared to the WCT baseline of **73.01%**, and on Omniglot, it attained **99.08%**.

This research significantly influences the field by re-establishing meta-learning as a vital paradigm for unsupervised and data-constrained environments. It provides a rigorous theoretical counter-argument to the "meta-learning is out" narrative, demonstrating that the efficiency and robustness of meta-learning are statistically unmatched in low-entropy scenarios.
