## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Temperature is a fundamental hyperparameter in Large Language Models (LLMs) that controls the randomness of text generation. However, the industry standard relies on static, "one-size-fits-all" values that fail to account for task-specific nuances and model scales. This paper addresses the critical gap in understanding how temperature interacts with semantic capabilities, highlighting that a static approach obscures the relationship between sampling randomness and model capacity. The authors argue that without a dynamic approach to inference optimization, the effective deployment of models across diverse applications is significantly limited.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce two key innovations: a novel **BERT-based temperature selector** and the formal concept of **"Mutation Temperature."** The BERT-based selector is designed to dynamically optimize inference by classifying input prompts and applying tailored sampling parameters in real-time, eliminating the need for manual tuning. Complementing this tool, the study formally defines Mutation Temperature as a specific threshold where performance characteristics shift. This concept provides a theoretical framework for analyzing how temperature sensitivity correlates with parameter scale, moving beyond empirical observation to a structured understanding of model stability.

**Results**
The study employed a rigorous methodology, categorizing open-source models into three tiers. Researchers evaluated temperature impacts across a range of 0 to 2 (extended to 4.0 for quantization comparisons) on datasets assessing six distinct semantic capabilities. Experimental results demonstrated that optimal temperature is highly non-linear; the proposed BERT-based selector significantly improved performance on SuperGLUE datasets for smaller models. Key findings reveal that Mutation Temperature scales with model size: while creativity in large models peaks at T=1.3 and In-Context Learning remains robust, Instruction Following requires T < 1.0 to avoid degradation. Furthermore, temperature effects remain consistent between FP16 and 4-bit quantized models despite a 10–20% absolute performance gap.

**Impact**
This research provides a new theoretical lens for model stability by decoupling randomness from model capacity, offering critical insights into how parameter scale influences temperature sensitivity. By validating the feasibility of deploying efficient 4-bit quantized models without necessitating changes to sampling strategies, the study presents a significant advantage for resource-constrained environments. Ultimately, this work enables the development of intelligent, adaptive inference systems that maximize performance through dynamic parameter selection, shifting the industry away from static configurations toward precision-tuned deployment.
