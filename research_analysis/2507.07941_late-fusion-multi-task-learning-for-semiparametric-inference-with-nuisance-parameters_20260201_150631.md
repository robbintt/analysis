> **### 📝 Executive Summary**
>
> This research addresses the complex challenge of improving parameter estimation efficiency in semiparametric models characterized by infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters across heterogeneous, distributed tasks. In fields such as healthcare and social sciences, data is often siloed across distinct institutions (e.g., hospitals or clinical trials), restricting analysis due to privacy regulations. Standard approaches typically analyze tasks in isolation, failing to leverage shared underlying structures, or require raw data pooling, which violates privacy constraints. The core problem lies in borrowing statistical strength across related tasks to enhance inference without compromising data privacy or suffering from negative transfer—a degradation in performance caused by significant heterogeneity between tasks.
>
> The key innovation is the "Late Fusion Multi-task Learning" (Lf-MTL) framework, specifically tailored for semiparametric inference in privacy-preserving environments. The method rigorously distinguishes between finite-dimensional structural parameters ($\theta_k$) and infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters ($\eta_k$). It operates in two stages:
> 1.  Obtaining initial Double Machine Learning (DML) estimators for each task independently.
> 2.  Adaptively aggregating these estimators via convex optimization.
>
> This optimization minimizes a quadratic loss function derived from a one-step Taylor expansion of the empirical moment condition, augmented by an $L_2$ regularization term ($\lambda \|u_k - u_0\|_2^2$). This regularization mechanism explicitly exploits cross-task similarities by penalizing the deviation of task-specific parameters from a shared centroid ($u_0$), thereby balancing fidelity to individual task data with the exploitation of global structure.
>
> The study establishes theoretical findings proving that the Lf-MTL framework achieves faster convergence rates for parameter estimation compared to standard individual task learning when tasks share similar parametric components. The method demonstrates high effectiveness in data-scarce environments, maintaining strong performance with datasets containing fewer than 80 examples. By enforcing the Neyman near-orthogonality condition, the framework ensures semiparametric efficiency is preserved or improved following aggregation. Furthermore, the adaptive aggregation mechanism provides robustness against outliers and significant task heterogeneity, showing enhanced estimation accuracy for nuisance parameters when they exhibit structural similarities across tasks.

## Methodology

The research proposes a **two-step 'late fusion' multi-task learning framework** designed for semiparametric models involving infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters.

1.  **Step 1: Independent Estimation**
    *   Initial "double machine-learning" (DML) estimators are obtained separately for each task.
    *   This step handles the infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters locally.

2.  **Step 2: Adaptive Aggregation**
    *   The initial estimators are adaptively aggregated to leverage information from related tasks.
    *   The process remains robust to heterogeneity between tasks.
    *   Uses a convex optimization approach to balance shared information and task-specific fidelity.

**Privacy-Preserving Architecture**
The framework is designed to avoid individual-level data sharing. Instead of pooling raw patient-level data, it integrates information while ensuring privacy, making it suitable for sensitive environments like healthcare.
