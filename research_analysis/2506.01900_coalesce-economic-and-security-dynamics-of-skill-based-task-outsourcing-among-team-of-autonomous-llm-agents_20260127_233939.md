## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical vulnerability inherent in multi-agent systems where autonomous LLM agents must decide whether to execute tasks locally (incurring high computational costs) or outsource them to external providers to maximize economic efficiency. The research highlights a dangerous trade-off: as agents optimize for cost reduction, they inadvertently increase their exposure to security threats. This matters because, without strict oversight, rational economic incentives drive benign agents to outsource tasks to malicious actors, exposing sensitive data to attack vectors. The study establishes that when agents are purely motivated by minimizing expenditure, they naturally gravitate toward insecure market practices.

The authors introduce **COALESCE**, a novel simulation framework and decision engine designed to evaluate economic incentives in multi-agent marketplaces. Technically, the system utilizes Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) combined with game theory and reinforcement learning to guide outsourcing decisions. Rather than selecting the lowest bidder, the framework employs the TOPSIS algorithm to rank candidates based on their proximity to an "ideal solution" across four metrics: Cost, Reliability, Latency, and Security. To determine who is qualified to perform a task, COALESCE uses a hybrid semantic similarity approach to assess skill compatibility, while simultaneously calculating Nash Equilibrium strategies to prevent market manipulation. An epsilon-greedy exploration strategy is further integrated to allow agents to discover new providers without getting locked into insecure monopolies.

The study quantifies the security-economic trade-off, revealing specific thresholds where systems remain resilient. Validation identified a Market Responsiveness Factor ($\beta$) of 0.7 and an Exploration Rate ($\epsilon$) of 0.1 as optimal configurations for balancing cost management with risk. Results demonstrate a clear inverse correlation between cost optimization and security exposure; specifically, a minimum Skill Threshold of $\ge$ 0.7 is necessary to mitigate risk. The research identified "skill spoofing"—where attackers deceive the system regarding their actual capabilities—as a critical failure mode. Furthermore, the authors differentiate additional threats such as "Prompt Leeching" (theft of proprietary prompt logic) and "Result Fabrication," showing that without these specific verification protocols, agent teams inevitably devolve into insecure outsourcing practices.

This research significantly advances the field by providing a taxonomy of outsourcing threats and establishing COALESCE as a benchmark for evaluating multi-agent interactions. Its primary influence lies in shifting the focus of autonomous system security from static defenses to economic architecture. By offering guidelines that enforce "security budgets" and verification mechanisms, the work demonstrates that security must be treated as a tangible economic constraint rather than an optional feature. Ultimately, this paper underscores the necessity of architectural safeguards that prioritize security over pure cost efficiency, shaping how future teams of autonomous agents will be managed in open marketplaces.

## Key Findings

*   **Cost-Security Trade-off:** There is a demonstrable inverse correlation where autonomous LLM agents optimizing for economic efficiency inadvertently increase their exposure to vulnerabilities.
*   **Skill Spoofing Vulnerabilities:** Significant security gaps exist in skill-matching protocols, allowing malicious actors to spoof skills to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **Devolution of Oversight:** In the absence of strict oversight and "security budgets," teams of rational agents inevitably devolve into insecure outsourcing practices to minimize costs.
*   **Economic Manipulation:** Benign agents can be driven to outsource tasks to attackers due to economic incentives that favor lower costs over security vetting.

---

## Methodology

The research employs a multifaceted approach to simulate and analyze agent interactions:

*   **Simulation Framework:** The authors developed the **COALESCE** framework to model a multi-agent marketplace where agents buy and sell skills.
*   **Economic Modeling:** The approach utilizes utility functions to balance computation costs against the value of tasks.
*   **Adversarial Testing:** The system introduces "rogue agents" into the simulation to measure how economic incentives drive benign agents to outsource tasks to potential attackers.
*   **Decision Logic:** The framework models the decision-making process using a combination of game theory and reinforcement learning to predict agent behavior.

## Technical Details

### Core Architecture
The COALESCE framework acts as a decision engine for autonomous LLM agents, determining whether to execute tasks locally or outsource them based on a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach.

### Decision Algorithms & Strategy
*   **Selection Logic (TOPSIS):** Utilizes the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. Candidates are evaluated based on Euclidean distance to "ideal" and "anti-ideal" solutions.
*   **Game Theory integration:** Calculates **Nash Equilibrium** strategies to understand stable states in the marketplace.
*   **Exploration Strategy:** An **epsilon-greedy** approach ($\epsilon=0.1$) is employed to prevent market lockout, ensuring agents explore new providers to maximize learning value while managing risk.

### Evaluation Metrics
The algorithm dynamically evaluates candidates on four weighted metrics:
1.  **Cost**
2.  **Reliability**
3.  **Latency**
4.  **Security**

### Skill Verification
*   **Hybrid Semantic Similarity:** Skill compatibility is assessed using a blend of:
    *   **Jaccard Similarity**
    *   **Cosine Similarity**
    *   **Historical Performance Data**
*   **Market-Adaptive Formula:** Uses dynamic weights based on a Market Responsiveness Factor ($\beta=0.7$).
