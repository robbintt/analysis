## Executive Summary

> This research addresses the computational bottleneck in Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents specifically designed for complex web navigation. The core issue lies in the inefficient trade-off between internal reasoning ("thinking") and environmental interaction ("doing"). Existing agents frequently suffer from resource misallocation, either "overthinking" by generating excessive, inefficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sequences without taking action, or failing to sufficiently explore the environment.
>
> The authors propose **Test-Time Interaction (TTI)**, a framework that scales agent performance by systematically increasing interactions with the environment during the inference phase. Technically, the architecture utilizes a multiplicative curriculum schedule during training to adjust the interaction horizon, scaling up to a maximum of **$h=30$ steps**. Unlike static models, TTI learns a dynamic trade-off, reducing the number of reasoning tokens per step ("Short CoT") in favor of increased physical trajectory length.
>
> Experiments conducted on the **WebVoyager benchmark validation set** demonstrate that during the high-horizon phase ($h=30$), the agent significantly increases trajectory length and utilizes exploration actions (*'GoBack'*, *'Bing'*) with much higher frequency. Compared to fixed-horizon baselines, TTI achieves superior task success rates while maintaining significantly shorter Chain-of-Thought outputs. The significance of this work lies in its challenge to the assumption that increased internal reasoning invariably leads to better intelligence; instead, reallocating compute from token generation to environment interaction yields measurable gains in complex navigation tasks.

## Technical Details

The paper proposes **TTI (Test-Time Interaction)**, a framework designed to scale performance by increasing interactions during the test phase.

*   **Curriculum Learning Schedule**:
    *   Utilizes a **multiplicative schedule** to adjust the interaction horizon.
    *   Scales the interaction horizon ($h$) up to a maximum of **30 steps**.

*   **Action Space**:
    *   The agent operates using **discrete actions**.
    *   **'GoBack'**: Used specifically for retries and error recovery.
    *   **'Bing'**: Used for external searches to retrieve missing information.

*   **Compute Tradeoff**:
    *   The architecture learns to balance **trajectory length** against **per-step compute**.
    *   **Strategy**: Increases the number of steps while reducing the number of tokens generated per step.
    *   **Objective**: To prevent "overthinking" and avoid excessive internal monologue.

## Results

Experiments were performed on the **WebVoyager benchmark validation set** (specifically on Amazon, Allrecipes, Cambridge Dictionary, and Huggingface).

*   **High-Horizon Performance**:
    *   TTI increases trajectory length during the high-horizon phase ($h=30$).
    *   There is a marked increase in the utilization of exploration actions (`GoBack`, `Bing`).
    *   This increased exploration correlates directly with **improved task success rates**.

*   **Comparison with Fixed Horizon**:
    *   **TTI vs. Fixed Horizon**: TTI achieves significantly **shorter Chain-of-Thought** outputs (fewer tokens per step).
    *   **Curriculum Necessity**: Results indicate that simply allowing a long horizon without a curriculum structure is counterproductive.
    *   **Performance**: TTI demonstrates better performance than fixed horizon runs, validating the "doing over thinking" approach in complex navigation.
