## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient quantization, particularly to 4-bit precision, for practical deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, the field currently lacks standardized evaluation protocols, resulting in incomparable performance metrics across studies due to varying calibration datasets and evaluation benchmarks. Furthermore, the rapid emergence of new floating-point data formats, such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, creates significant uncertainty regarding whether existing quantization strategies designed for integer formats (INT4) remain effective.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce a novel **decoupling framework** that systematically deconstructs state-of-the-art PTQ methods into two distinct components: pre-quantization transformation and quantization error mitigation. By isolating these variables, the study allows for a granular analysis of how specific techniques—such as activation rotation, weight scaling, and GPTQ—contribute to model fidelity. Additionally, the researchers implemented standardized benchmarking across identical conditions to rigorously compare methods, extending the evaluation to emerging floating-point formats.

**Results**
The evaluation yields several critical quantitative insights. On LLaMA-2 models, optimized rotation and scaling techniques were identified as the most effective pre-quantization transformations. Specifically, applying rotation-based PTQ to LLaMA-2-7B achieved a WikiText-2 perplexity of **5.68**, nearly matching the FP16 baseline of **5.60**, whereas non-rotated baselines often degraded to perplexity scores above **6.0**. The study also revealed that while finer granularity improves performance, it proportionally increases storage overhead. Crucially, rotation-based strategies highly effective for INT4 offer diminishing returns for MXFP4 and NVFP4; instead, FP4 performance relies heavily on scaling factor precision.

**Impact**
This research establishes a standardized baseline for quantization research, resolving inconsistencies in prior literature. The decoupling framework offers researchers a clearer understanding of internal mechanics, enabling the design of more efficient algorithms. By demonstrating that effective INT4 strategies do not fully translate to new floating-point formats, the paper guides the development of future hardware and software solutions, directing focus toward scaling factor optimization for FP4 formats rather than merely transferring rotation-based methods.

## Key Findings

*   **Optimized Transformation:** Optimized rotation and scaling techniques yield the best performance for the pre-quantization transformation step by effectively reducing outlier impact.
*   **Error Mitigation:** Combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ can occasionally outperform the standalone GPTQ method in quantization error mitigation.
*   **Granularity Trade-off:** Finer granularity improves quantization performance but comes with the trade-off of increased storage overhead.
*   **Scaling Factor Sensitivity:** The format and precision of scaling factors significantly influence the performance of FP4 quantization.
*   **Format Limitations:** Rotation-based strategies, which are effective for INT4 quantization, offer limited performance gains when applied to the MXFP4 and NVFP4 data formats.

## Methodology

The researchers conducted an extensive review and comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art post-training quantization (PTQ) methods under identical conditions. To achieve this, they implemented a **decoupling framework** designed to analyze internal mechanics. This framework breaks quantization methods down into two primary components:

1.  **Pre-quantization transformation**
2.  **Quantization error mitigation**

Additionally, the study analyzed the impact of specific configuration settings, such as granularity and symmetry. The evaluation also assessed the performance of emerging data formats, specifically **MXFP4** and **NVFP4**, comparing them against traditional integer formats.

    *   **Optimization:** Employs GPTQ (Gradient-based Post-Training Quantization) enhanced with Low-rank Compensation.

*   **Configuration Variables**
    *   **Granularity:** Analyzes per-tensor, per-channel, and group-wise quantization.
    *   **Symmetry:** Investigates symmetric vs. asymmetric quantization impacts.

*   **Data Formats Analyzed**
    *   **Integer:** INT4
    *   **Floating Point:** FP4 (specifically **MXFP4** and **NVFP4**)
    *   **Critical Factor:** Highlighted the importance of scaling factor format and precision for floating-point formats.

*   **Strategy Assessment**
    *   Applied rotation-based strategies across data types to assess efficacy transferability.

## Contributions

*   **Standardized Benchmarking:** Provided a fair and extensive investigation of state-of-the-art quantization techniques, addressing incomparable results in existing literature.
*   **Decoupling Framework:** Introduced a conceptual framework to understand quantization methods by separating them into pre-quantization transformation and error mitigation components.
*   **Emerging Format Analysis:** Delivered one of the first analyses of MXFP4 and NVFP4 data formats, specifically highlighting how the efficacy of INT4 strategies does not fully transfer to these new floating-point formats.

## Performance Results

The study quantified the performance of various quantization strategies on LLaMA-2 models:

*   **Perplexity Reduction:** Optimized rotation-based PTQ on **LLaMA-2-7B** achieved a WikiText-2 perplexity of **5.68** (vs FP16 baseline of **5.60**).
*   **Baseline Degradation:** Non-rotated baselines frequently saw perplexity degrade above **6.0**.
*   **Granularity Impact:** Moving from per-tensor to group-wise quantization (e.g., 128 groups) improved accuracy but strictly increased storage requirements.
*   **Strategy Transferability:** Data indicates that while rotation is critical for INT4, it yields diminishing returns for MXFP4/NVFP4. For these floating-point formats, higher-precision scaling factors proved essential for maintaining accuracy.
