## 📝 Executive Summary

### 🚨 Problem
Current development of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents faces significant bottlenecks rooted in traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies. Key issues include the high cost of manually constructing task datasets, inefficient exploration strategies, and poor sample utilization. Existing agents rely heavily on external human intervention for data curation and often struggle with redundant rollouts, resulting in low data efficiency that hampers scalability and continual improvement.

### 💡 Innovation
AgentEvolver introduces a unified, self-evolving framework that bypasses standard reward functions, relying instead on semantic understanding to create an open-ended learning loop. The system is built on three synergistic mechanisms:
*   **Self-questioning:** Autonomously generates tasks via curiosity-driven synthesis and curation.
*   **Self-navigating:** Optimizes exploration by reusing experience and employing a two-phase strategy (Breadth-First for coverage followed by Myopic targeting) guided by Environment Profiles.
*   **Self-attributing:** A credit assignment mechanism that enhances sample efficiency by evaluating and assigning differentiated rewards based on the specific contribution of states and actions.

### 🏆 Results
Evaluated on AppWorld and BFCL-v3 benchmarks, AgentEvolver demonstrated substantial performance gains over the Qwen3-14B baseline:
*   **AppWorld:** AgentEvolver-14B achieved a **55.8%** success rate vs. Baseline **45.2%** (+10.6% absolute improvement).
*   **BFCL-v3:** Achieved an executable rate of **74.2%** vs. Baseline **67.5%**.
*   **Efficiency:** The smaller AgentEvolver-7B model (**53.1%** on AppWorld) surpassed the larger 14B parameter baseline.
*   **RL Comparison:** Outperformed PPO/GRPO in adaptation speed and sample utilization, avoiding redundant rollouts.

### 🌍 Impact
This research represents a paradigm shift toward autonomous agent development by decoupling capability improvement from expensive, manually constructed datasets. By establishing a scalable, cost-effective framework for continual self-evolution without external human intervention, AgentEvolver provides a robust foundation for future systems capable of adapting to complex, open-ended environments with minimal resource overhead.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Reduced Data Dependency:** Significantly reduces reliance on expensive, manually constructed task datasets through autonomous, curiosity-driven task generation.
*   **Enhanced Exploration Efficiency:** Improves upon traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods by reusing experience and employing hybrid policy guidance.
*   **Superior Sample Utilization:** Achieves higher sample efficiency compared to standard RL pipelines by assigning differentiated rewards based on the contribution of states and actions.
*   **Performance Validation:** Enables faster adaptation and more efficient exploration than traditional RL-based baselines according to preliminary experiments.

## ⚙️ Methodology

AgentEvolver utilizes a unified, self-evolving framework leveraging the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The methodology is built upon three synergistic mechanisms:

1.  **Self-questioning:** Autonomous task generation driven by curiosity.
2.  **Self-navigating:** Exploration optimization via experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance.
3.  **Self-attributing:** A credit assignment mechanism that enhances sample efficiency by evaluating and assigning differentiated rewards.

### Core Contributions

*   **Addressing RL Bottlenecks:** Directly addresses the limitations of current LLM-agent development, specifically high data construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization.
*   **Novel Framework for Self-Evolution:** Introduces a comprehensive system that enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities without external human intervention for data construction.
*   **Synergistic Mechanism Design:** Proposes and integrates three distinct "self-" mechanisms (questioning, navigating, attributing) to create a fully autonomous learning loop capable of adapting to diverse environments.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### System Definition
*   **Interaction Sandbox:** Defined as $E = (S, A, P)$.
*   **Open-Ended Setting:** Excludes standard reward functions and discount factors to allow agents to generate their own learning signals.
*   **Objective:** Assumes an unknown target task distribution of "golden" tasks and uses a proxy objective for task synthesis.

### Self-Questioning Module
Manages task generation and synthetic rewards via a specific pipeline:
1.  **Exploration**
2.  **Task Synthesis**
3.  **Task Curation:** Includes feasibility verification and filtering.

### Curiosity-Guided Exploration
*   **Environment Profiles:** Utilizes profiles containing Entities, Attributes, and Operations to guide the LLM.
*   **Stochastic Policy:** Employs a high-temperature policy based on state history.
*   **Two-Phase Strategy:**
    *   **Phase 1:** Breadth-First strategy for semantic understanding and coverage.
    *   **Phase 2:** Myopic/Targeted strategy for specific goal achievement.

## 📈 Performance Results

The system was evaluated on AppWorld and BFCL-v3 benchmarks using the **Task Goal Completion (%)** metric. AgentEvolver models (14B and 7B) were compared against the Qwen3-14B baseline and traditional RL methods (PPO/GRPO).

### Benchmark Comparison

| Benchmark | Model | Success Rate | Executable Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AppWorld** | **AgentEvolver-14B** | **55.8%** | - |
| | Qwen3-14B (Baseline) | 45.2% | - |
| | **AgentEvolver-7B** | **53.1%** | - |
| **BFCL-v3** | **AgentEvolver-14B** | - | **74.2%** |
| | Qwen3-14B (Baseline) | - | 67.5% |

### Key Takeaways
*   **Superior Goal Completion:** AgentEvolver achieved higher goal completion rates on both benchmarks.
*   **High Parameter Efficiency:** The 7B model outperformed the baseline 14B model, demonstrating efficient parameter use.
*   **RL Advantages:** Compared to traditional RL baselines, the system showed faster adaptation, more efficient exploration (avoiding redundant rollouts), and higher sample utilization through differentiated rewards.
