## 📄 Executive Summary

Qualitative data analysis, particularly structured deductive coding, traditionally relies on human coders to apply complex classification schemes—a process that is labor-intensive and prone to intra-coder inconsistency. This paper addresses the critical gap in research regarding the viability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for performing these rigorous deductive tasks. While LLMs have shown general prowess in text generation, their reliability in strictly adhering to established human-coded schemes, such as the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) Master Codebook, remains unproven. Establishing whether LLMs can serve as reliable inter-coders is essential for scaling social science research and automating qualitative workflows without sacrificing methodological rigor.

The study’s key innovation is the introduction and empirical validation of a **"Step-by-Step Task Decomposition"** strategy, designed to enhance LLM performance on deductive classification tasks. Technically, the authors evaluated four distinct scaffolding interventions applied to ChatGPT: Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Definition-based, and the novel Step-by-Step method. The study utilized a dataset of 9,330 U.S. Supreme Court case summaries to classify text into **21 major policy domains**, preprocessed to convert integer labels into categorical labels to optimize model comprehension. By employing a rigorous validation framework that combines standard classification metrics with robust statistical tests for inter-coder reliability, the researchers isolated the impact of prompt engineering on the model's ability to navigate complex policy domain taxonomies.

The study demonstrates that specific architectural interventions significantly elevate LLM reliability to levels suitable for rigorous research. The Step-by-Step Task Decomposition method achieved the highest performance metrics, recording an accuracy of **0.775**, a Cohen’s Kappa of **0.744**, and a Krippendorff’s Alpha of **0.746**. The evaluation utilized a comprehensive suite of metrics, including F1-score and Chi-squared tests, which confirmed that these interventions caused moderate to strong shifts in classification patterns compared to baseline approaches, with effect sizes (Cramér’s V) ranging from **0.359 to 0.613**. Furthermore, the results highlighted that using categorical textual labels consistently outperformed integer representations, and the model exhibited stable agreement across repeated samples, even amidst ambiguous text inputs.

This research significantly influences the field of computational social science by providing concrete evidence that LLMs can achieve sufficient reliability for deductive coding workflows when guided by tailored interventions. The validation of the Step-by-Step Task Decomposition strategy offers researchers a replicable, cost-effective method to automate the coding of large text corpora while maintaining the high standards of validity required for academic publication. By bridging the gap between AI language generation and strict scientific classification schemes, this study paves the way for broader adoption of LLMs as "research assistants" in qualitative analysis, potentially transforming the scale and speed at which policy and legal texts can be analyzed.
