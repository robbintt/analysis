## Executive Summary

The deployment of modern deep learning models is often constrained by the high computational and memory costs associated with large parameter sets. While structured sparsity (specifically N:M patterns) and low-bit quantization are established methods for reducing model size and accelerating inference, combining them naively leads to compounding errors that severely degrade model performance. This research addresses the critical challenge of achieving extreme model compression by integrating these two techniques without sacrificing the accuracy required for practical application in vision tasks.

The authors introduce **SLOPE** (Structured Sparsity at Low Precision), a unified training framework that simultaneously applies 2:4 structured sparsity and 4-bit quantization. The core technical innovation is a novel regularization strategy that optimizes the angular alignment between full-precision floating-point weights and their compressed, sparse-quantized counterparts. Unlike traditional methods that minimize direct L2 value differences—which can be unstable in high-dimensional, constrained spaces—SLOPE’s angular alignment approach stabilizes the training process, ensuring that the direction of the weight vectors remains consistent even as their magnitude and representation are aggressively altered.

SLOPE was validated across diverse architectures, including ResNet-18, ViT-Small, and Mask R-CNN, covering tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. On ResNet-18, the framework achieved an approximate 20× reduction in model size while retaining roughly 99% of the original baseline accuracy. The method consistently outperformed current state-of-the-art compression techniques, delivering significantly higher compression ratios than standard 4-bit quantization (which typically offers an 8× reduction) without the performance penalties usually associated with such aggressive sparsity.

This research establishes a new benchmark for extreme model compression, demonstrating that it is possible to achieve substantial memory savings and hardware-friendly acceleration without compromising model efficacy. By bridging the gap between structured sparsity and quantization, SLOPE provides a viable pathway for deploying state-of-the-art vision models on resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, the utilization of hardware-optimized 2:4 sparsity patterns suggests that these theoretical compression gains can translate into tangible inference speedups on modern hardware, such as NVIDIA A100 GPUs, influencing future approaches to hardware-software co-design in AI systems.

## Methodology

The authors propose **SLOPE** (Structured Sparsity at Low Precision), a unified framework designed to integrate structured sparsity and low-bit quantization during the training phase. To address the typical accuracy loss associated with aggressive compression, the methodology employs a specific training-time regularization strategy.

This strategy promotes **angular alignment** between full-precision weights and their sparse, quantized counterparts. By focusing on the directional consistency of weight vectors rather than just their magnitude, the framework maintains model stability despite the heavy constraints applied to the parameters.
