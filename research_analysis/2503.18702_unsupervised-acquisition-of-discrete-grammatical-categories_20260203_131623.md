## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental challenge of **unsupervised grammar acquisition**: how a learner can derive abstract, discrete grammatical categories and rules from raw linguistic data without access to explicit labels or the speaker’s internal cognitive states. This problem is critical to cognitive science and computational linguistics as it simulates the intergenerational transmission of language, where the "daughter" generation must reconstruct the full complexity of a grammar based solely on the observable utterances of the "mother" generation. The paper specifically investigates whether non-trivial grammatical knowledge can be acquired purely through statistical analysis of surface-level input.

The key innovation is the **MODOMA framework**, a computational laboratory environment that establishes a controlled "mother-daughter" linguistic transmission loop. The Mother Agent (**DELILAH**) utilizes a Combinatory List Grammar with graph-based feature-value pairs to generate and parse sentences. The Daughter Agent is strictly restricted from accessing DELILAH’s internal knowledge; instead, it employs **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)** using the complete-link method alongside distributional analysis. By processing consecutive utterance patterns within a defined context window, the Daughter Agent autonomously identifies statistical regularities and converts them into discrete, rule-based grammatical representations.

In experiments utilizing 10,000 training sentences and a separate 10,000-sentence test set, the system demonstrated robust acquisition of grammatical structures. Using a context window of two words and a minimum frequency threshold of 10, the model identified **14 distinct clusters**. These clusters corresponded accurately to standard linguistic parts of speech, including functional categories, noun specifiers, nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and perfect participles, alongside a smaller number of mixed clusters. Validation testing confirmed that the Daughter Agent acquired a grammar that achieved **weak equivalence** relative to the Mother Agent, proving the consistency of the acquired parameters.

The significance of this work lies in its provision of empirical evidence that complex, discrete grammatical categories can emerge from unsupervised statistical learning without supervision. By demonstrating that computational clustering methods can yield structures aligning with formal linguistic categories, the paper bridges the gap between distributional learning and symbolic grammar theories. The MODOMA framework offers the field a rigorous tool for simulating and studying the evolution of language across generations, suggesting that the structural properties of natural languages may naturally arise from the constraints of iterative learning and transmission.

## Key Findings

*   **Unsupervised Acquisition:** The daughter language model successfully acquires abstract grammatical knowledge without access to the mother agent's internal states, relying solely on generated language exemplars.
*   **Cluster-Driven Rules:** Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis of utterance patterns enables the derivation of discrete grammatical rules from input data.
*   **Linguistic Alignment:** The system successfully acquires structures that closely resemble grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages.
*   **Robust Validation:** Parameter configurations derived from training data are validated through a second experiment using a separate test set, confirming the robust acquisition of non-trivial categories.

## Methodology

The research employed a controlled, two-phase experimental design within a computational laboratory environment:

1.  **Agent Setup:**
    *   **Mother Agent (DELILAH):** Generates language exemplars.
    *   **Daughter Agent:** Restricted from accessing the mother's internal knowledge; learns exclusively based on utterances.

2.  **Pattern Recognition:**
    *   Application of hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis to consecutively generated utterances.
    *   Identification of statistical patterns corresponding to grammatical categories.

3.  **Rule Extraction:**
    *   Discrete grammatical rules are extracted from identified statistical patterns.
    *   Integration of these rules into the daughter agent's grammatical knowledge base.

4.  **Validation:**
    *   A two-phase experimental design where parameters determined via training data are tested against a separate test set to verify consistency.
