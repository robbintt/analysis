## Executive Summary

The central issue addressed in this paper is the controversial debate regarding whether Large Language Models (LLMs) possess "true understanding" of language or merely replicate human-like patterns through statistical mimicry. This distinction matters profoundly because a binary classification of understanding often fails to capture the complex, granular linguistic capabilities of modern architectures. The problem is further complicated by the lack of rigorous frameworks to analyze semantics within the "black box" of neural networks beyond surface-level performance metrics. The author argues that moving the conversation from a philosophical binary to a technical analysis of specific linguistic levels—specifically word and sentence semantics—is necessary to accurately assess the potential and limitations of current AI systems.

The key innovation is a novel interdisciplinary framework that bridges classical philosophy of language with modern deep learning architecture. Specifically, the paper applies the semantic theories of Frege and Russell to the internal representations of LLMs, interpreting the model's embedding vectors ($x \in \mathbb{R}^d$) through these established philosophical lenses. Technically, the methodology dissects the Transformer architecture by focusing on four components: autoregressive probabilistic language modeling; distributed representations analyzed through their structural organization both within specific layers and across the depth of the network; attention mechanisms; and training dynamics. This approach allows for a rigorous evaluation of how models utilize InContext Learning and process semantics during inference, effectively isolating these capabilities from the effects of post-training alignment (RLHF).

The paper supports its theoretical framework with quantitative benchmarks drawn from comparative literature and specific observations of model behavior. To contextualize the efficiency of neural networks, the author cites the "curse of dimensionality," demonstrating that modeling a sequence of just 10 words from a 100,000-word vocabulary using traditional N-gram approaches would require $10^{50}$ parameters, effectively limiting N-gram context windows to approximately 3 words. The research further documents the rapid expansion of context windows from GPT-2’s **1024 tokens** to several hundred thousand tokens in state-of-the-art models. Notably, specific experiments regarding semantic stability reveal that pre-alignment GPT models exhibit semantic functionality strikingly similar to aligned (post-RLHF) models, indicating that alignment alters output behavior but not the fundamental semantic representations encoded during pre-training.

The significance of this research lies in its ability to decouple the debate of "understanding" from the mechanics of semantic representation. By proving that core semantic capabilities are largely stable regardless of reinforcement learning alignment, the paper provides a refined methodology for evaluating LLMs based on their internal architecture rather than their conversational persona. This work empowers researchers to distinguish between the model's inherent linguistic potential and the safety filters applied afterward. Ultimately, this synthesis of classical semantics and AI architecture offers the technical community a more nuanced, granular perspective for designing and interpreting future generations of language models.

## Key Findings

*   **Controversy of Understanding:** While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to replicate human language capabilities, the extent to which they possess 'true understanding' remains a controversial topic.
*   **Specific Linguistic Levels:** LLMs possess semantic capabilities that can be effectively analyzed by narrowing the scope to specific linguistic levels, specifically word and sentence semantics.
*   **Classical Theories:** The application of classical semantic theories (specifically those by Frege and Russell) to the internal representations of LLMs yields a more nuanced understanding of their linguistic potential than binary classifications of 'understanding' might suggest.

## Methodology

The research narrows the broad question of language understanding down to an analysis of semantics at the word and sentence level. It involves examining the inner workings of LLMs and the specific representations of language they generate, interpreted through classical semantic theories proposed by Frege and Russell.

## Contributions

*   **Interdisciplinary Synthesis:** Bridges the gap between modern LLM architecture and classical philosophy of language by applying the theories of Frege and Russell to contemporary AI models.
*   **Analytical Framework:** Provides a refined methodology for evaluating LLM understanding by focusing on word and sentence-level semantics rather than holistic conversational performance.
*   **Nuanced Perspective:** Moves beyond the debate of whether LLMs simply mimic or truly understand, offering a granular picture of their semantic capabilities derived from their internal representations.

## Technical Details

The paper establishes a theoretical framework analyzing LLMs via internal representations, characterized by four technical elements:

1.  **Probabilistic Language Modeling**
    *   Defined by an autoregressive scheme.
    *   The probability of a sequence is the product of conditional probabilities.

2.  **Distributed Representations (Embeddings)**
    *   Maps discrete tokens to continuous feature vectors in a latent space ($x \in \mathbb{R}^d$).
    *   Analyzed via **Horizontal** (layer-wise) and **Vertical** (cross-layer) structural views.

3.  **Neural Network Architecture**
    *   Specifically utilizes the Transformer architecture.
    *   Employs an attention mechanism that entails a quadratic computational cost relative to input sequence length.

4.  **Training & Inference Mechanisms**
    *   **Self-supervised learning:** Via next-token prediction.
    *   **InContext Learning:** Learning sub-tasks during inference without weight updates.
    *   **Alignment:** (e.g., RLHF) controls outputs without fundamentally altering internal semantic representations.

## Results & Benchmarks

Key quantitative benchmarks and observations cited from literature include:

*   **Curse of Dimensionality:**
    *   Modeling 10 consecutive words with a vocabulary of 100,000 using N-gram approaches would require $10^{50}$ free parameters.
    *   Neural networks learn the probability function dynamically.
    *   Traditional N-gram context windows are limited to ~3 words.

*   **Context Window Evolution:**
    *   Significant expansion from early Transformers like GPT-2 (512 tokens).
    *   State-of-the-art models now support several hundred thousand tokens.

*   **Scaling Laws:**
    *   Demonstrates that quality improves predictably with increases in dataset size, parameter count, and computational resources.

*   **Semantic Stability:**
    *   Experiments indicate pre-alignment GPT models exhibit semantic functionality similar to aligned (post-RLHF) models.
    *   Suggests alignment adjusts output behavior rather than core semantic representations.
