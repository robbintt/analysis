## Executive Summary

This research addresses a critical security gap in Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), which are increasingly deployed for multimodal interaction but remain vulnerable to sophisticated exploitation techniques. While text-based jailbreaking is well-understood, the security implications of audio modality—specifically regarding linguistic and acoustic variations—have been largely unexplored.

The study highlights that multilingual and multi-accent inputs create severe vulnerabilities. The complex interaction between acoustic perturbations and cross-lingual phonetics allows adversaries to bypass safety filters more effectively than standard text prompts, posing a significant risk as multimodal LLMs are inherently more susceptible to compromise via non-English audio inputs.

The paper introduces **'Multi-AudioJail,'** the first systematic framework designed to exploit audio-specific vulnerabilities through a black-box, two-stage attack mechanism. Evaluations on state-of-the-art models revealed alarming vulnerabilities, with the combination of acoustic perturbations and cross-lingual phonetics increasing Jailbreak Success Rates (JSR) by up to **57.25 percentage points**. By releasing a unique dataset and demonstrating the superior efficacy of audio over text-based attacks, this work urges the AI security community to develop robust cross-modal defenses.

## Key Findings

*   **Severe Security Vulnerabilities:** Linguistic and acoustic variations in multilingual and multi-accent inputs expose critical weaknesses in current LALM defenses.
*   **Phonetic & Acoustic Interaction:** The interaction between acoustic perturbations and cross-lingual phonetics can increase Jailbreak Success Rates (JSR) by up to **57.25 percentage points**.
*   **Multimodal Risk:** Multimodal LLMs are inherently more vulnerable than unimodal systems, often compromised via non-English audio inputs.
*   **Superior Attack Vector:** Multilingual audio-only attacks achieve **3.1x** higher success rates compared to traditional text-only attacks.

## Methodology

The researchers utilized **'Multi-AudioJail,'** the first systematic framework designed to exploit audio vulnerabilities. The methodology consists of two main components:

1.  **Novel Dataset Creation:** A dataset of adversarially perturbed multilingual and multi-accent audio jailbreaking prompts was developed to stress-test model inputs.
2.  **Hierarchical Evaluation:** A specialized pipeline was empirically designed to analyze how specific acoustic properties interact with phonetics to degrade safety guardrails.
