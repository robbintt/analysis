## 📝 Executive Summary

The paper addresses the fundamental lack of rigorous causal definitions within the Situation Calculus, a standard framework for reasoning about actions. While AI systems utilize action histories to predict outcomes, existing theories lack a formal grounding in the counterfactual analysis prevalent in broader causality research, specifically the Halpern-Pearl (HP) account. Bridging this divide is essential for advancing explainable AI and robotic systems that must accurately explain *why* an event occurred rather than simply predicting that it will occur.

The authors introduce a novel definition of cause grounded in counterfactual analysis, implemented within Logic ES, a modal variant of the Situation Calculus that simplifies representation while retaining Basic Action Theory. By utilizing successor state axioms and regression, the framework evaluates whether an outcome would persist if a specific action were removed from the history. Conceptually, this approach generalizes existing notions of "achievement causes"—a concept previously defined by Batusov and Soutchanski—providing a formal, logic-based mechanism for causal attribution that aligns action-theoretic reasoning with structural causal models.

As the research is purely theoretical, the results consist of formal proofs and conceptual derivations rather than quantitative metrics. The authors demonstrate that their proposed definition successfully generalizes the concept of achievement causes within action histories. A primary theoretical contribution is the establishment of a formal connection between this action-theoretic account and the standard Halpern-Pearl model of actual causality. Furthermore, the analysis reveals specific nuances in defining causality for disjunctive goals, identifying limitations in how current causal definitions handle complex logical structures.

The significance of this work lies in its successful integration of counterfactual reasoning into action theories, bridging the historical gap between symbolic reasoning about actions and structural causal models. By situating action-theoretic causality within the Halpern-Pearl framework, the authors provide a unified foundation that facilitates cross-disciplinary research in knowledge representation and causal inference. Additionally, the identification of specific difficulties regarding disjunctive goals offers a crucial guide for future research, pushing the field toward more robust definitions necessary for reliable planning and explanation in dynamic AI systems.

## ⚙ Technical Details

### Framework: Logic ES
The paper proposes a formal framework using **Logic ES**, a modal variant of the Situation Calculus designed to simplify representation.
*   **Simplification:** Removes explicit situation terms while retaining Basic Action Theory (BAT), regression, and progression.
*   **Domain:** Operates over a fixed countable domain of standard names ($N$), partitioned into:
    *   Action names ($N_A$)
    *   Object names ($N_O$)
*   **Assumptions:** Assumes infinite domain closure and the Unique Name Assumption (UNA).

### Syntax & Semantics
*   **Syntax:** Includes sorts for objects and actions. Formulas are constructed from fluent predicates, equality, logical connectives, and modal operators:
    *   $[t]\phi$: Formula holds after sequence $t$.
    *   $\square\phi$: Formula holds after any sequence.
*   **Semantics:** A world is defined as a mapping function $w: PF \times Z \to \{0, 1\}$, where truth is evaluated relative to a world and an action sequence.
*   **Dynamics:** Domain dynamics are expressed via a variant of BAT ($\Sigma$), incorporating:
    *   Initial state axioms ($\Sigma_0$)
    *   Action precondition axioms ($\Sigma_{ap}$)
    *   Successor state axioms ($\Sigma_{post}$) which implement Reiter's solution to the frame problem.
