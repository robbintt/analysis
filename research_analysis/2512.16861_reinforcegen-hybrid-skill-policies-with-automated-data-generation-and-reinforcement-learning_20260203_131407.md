## Executive Summary

Learning long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation tasks remains a significant challenge in robotics due to the complexity of physical interactions and the scarcity of training data. These tasks are typically modeled as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with sparse rewards, rendering pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) ineffective and traditional Imitation Learning (IL) prohibitively expensive. Existing solutions often require massive datasets—typically upwards of 1,000 human demonstrations—to achieve reasonable performance, creating a substantial bottleneck for deploying robots in real-world environments where data collection is costly and time-consuming.

ReinforceGen addresses these limitations through a hybrid framework that synthesizes Imitation Learning, motion planning, and localized reinforcement learning. The system generates extensive offline synthetic data from a minimal set of approximately 10 human demonstrations using object-centric synthesis and pose adaptation. The architecture utilizes a three-stage pipeline: a **Pose Predictor** (fine-tuned via Online Distillation), a **Skill Policy** (fine-tuned via Residual RL to explore beyond source demonstrations), and a **Termination Predictor** (fine-tuned via Causal Inference). This localized RL approach allows the agent to explore state spaces outside the original demonstrations without the instability associated with end-to-end exploration.

The framework demonstrates exceptional performance and data efficiency, achieving an 80% success rate on multi-stage, contact-rich manipulation tasks. This performance almost doubles the prior state-of-the-art success rates. Crucially, ReinforceGen accomplishes this while requiring only about 10 human demonstrations, a drastic reduction compared to the ≥1,000 demonstrations needed by traditional methods. The results validate that the hybrid deployment strategy effectively trains end-to-end visuomotor imitation policies by significantly reducing the generalization burden on the neural network.

This research represents a pivotal shift in robotic manipulation, proving that complex, contact-rich behaviors can be learned from orders of magnitude less human data than previously required. By successfully integrating classical motion planning concepts with modern deep learning techniques like residual RL and causal inference, ReinforceGen provides a scalable blueprint for training robots capable of operating in unstructured environments. The methodology sets a new standard for data efficiency, potentially accelerating the deployment of intelligent manipulation systems in industrial and domestic settings where collecting large datasets is infeasible.
