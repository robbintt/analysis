## Executive Summary

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) via soft prompts offers a resource-effective alternative to full model adaptation but introduces significant security risks regarding data privacy. Standard mechanisms for transferring soft prompts expose sensitive information about the source dataset because the continuous vector embeddings are tightly coupled with the private training data. This coupling leaves prompts vulnerable to membership inference attacks and prompt extraction attempts.

The authors introduce **POST (Privacy Of Soft-prompt Transfer)**, a framework designed to decouple the private tuning process from the large target model. The technical pipeline comprises three steps:
1.  **Knowledge Distillation** compresses the target LLM ($\Phi_t$) into a smaller Small Model ($\Phi_s$).
2.  **Local Private Tuning** is performed on $\Phi_s$ using private data to learn a soft prompt $p_s$, utilizing DP-SGD.
3.  **Public Data Transfer** employs gradient-based optimization on public data to map the private prompt $p_s$ to the target prompt $p_t$.

Empirical benchmarking demonstrates that POST successfully defends against Membership Inference and Prompt Extraction/Reconstruction attacks while maintaining downstream utility comparable to non-private baselines. The study validates these outcomes with formal theoretical proofs bounding privacy leakage.

## Key Findings

*   **Privacy Leakage in Standard Methods:** Standard soft prompt transfer mechanisms likely leak sensitive information about the source dataset or training data due to the coupling of embeddings and private data.
*   **Balanced Privacy and Utility:** The method demonstrates privacy preservation without significantly degrading downstream accuracy or efficiency.
*   **Defense Against Attacks:** The approach defends against specific privacy attacks, such as membership inference and prompt extraction/reconstruction.
*   **Efficiency Maintained:** Computational efficiency is maintained, ensuring privacy overhead is manageable compared to full fine-tuning.

## Methodology

The research methodology centers on **Soft Prompt Tuning**, utilizing continuous vector embeddings rather than discrete text or full weight updates. To ensure privacy, the framework utilizes:

*   **Privacy Mechanisms:** Implementation of Differential Privacy (specifically DP-SGD) and Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC).
*   **Transfer Protocol:** A specific protocol for transferring soft prompts from source to target where privacy guarantees are strictly enforced.
*   **Optimization:** Techniques to minimize the noise added by privacy mechanisms to retain the utility of the model.

## Technical Details: The POST Framework

The POST framework utilizes a **Target LLM ($\Phi_t$)** and a **Small Model ($\Phi_s$)**. The pipeline consists of the following three distinct steps:

1.  **Knowledge Distillation:**
    *   A one-time compression of the Target LLM ($\Phi_t$) into the smaller, computationally manageable Small Model ($\Phi_s$).

2.  **Local Private Tuning:**
    *   The user tunes the Small Model ($\Phi_s$) using private data to learn the soft prompt $p_s$.
    *   This step utilizes **DP-SGD** to provide differential privacy guarantees.

3.  **Public Data Transfer:**
    *   The provider transfers the learned private prompt ($p_s$) to the target prompt ($p_t$) using only public data.
    *   This approach addresses soft prompt coupling issues and prevents utility loss associated with previous transfer methods.
