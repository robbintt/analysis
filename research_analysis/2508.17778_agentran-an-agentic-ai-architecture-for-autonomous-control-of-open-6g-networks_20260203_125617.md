## Executive Summary

As networks evolve toward Open RAN and 6G architectures, the complexity of managing radio resources across disparate time scales, spatial domains, and protocol layers has outpaced the capabilities of traditional static automation. Current approaches often rely on "black box" machine learning models that lack explainability and require extensive pre-existing datasets to function, resulting in a significant "cold start" problem. Consequently, operators face a critical challenge in translating high-level business intents into low-level, real-time control signals without manual intervention, creating a need for a more adaptive, transparent, and intelligent control paradigm.

AgentRAN introduces an AI-native, agentic framework that replaces static control loops with a hierarchy of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents acting as rApps, xApps, and dApps within the Open RAN architecture. The system utilizes an "Intent-Based Orchestration" mechanism where agents interpret natural language intents and negotiate control strategies, decomposing complex tasks across time, space, and protocol layers. A key technical component is the "AI-RAN Factory," a continuous learning loop that autonomously generates and refines control algorithms via code generation and model distillation. This architecture leverages LLM reasoning to provide bootstrapped intelligence with zero-start capability and ensures full transparency by making all agent reasoning auditable through structured conversations.

The framework was empirically validated in a live 5G Over-the-Air (OTA) private network environment, successfully managing a three-stage Intent Evolution scenario involving power control and scheduling. The system met strict performance requirements, achieving a total latency of 20 ms Round Trip Time (RTT)—specifically maintaining ≤4 ms Downlink and ≤16 ms Uplink latency—while dynamically adjusting Target SNR without manual intervention. During the testing phases, AgentRAN met Machine Type Communication (MTC) throughput requirements of 30 Mbit/s in Emergency mode and 5 Mbit/s in Post-Emergency mode, while maintaining an average Downlink PRB utilization of 43%.

This research represents a paradigm shift from static, reactive network management to dynamic, intent-based autonomous control, effectively bridging the gap between high-level operator goals and low-level network execution. By solving the cold start problem through reasoning-based intelligence and introducing the concept of a self-improving "AI-RAN Factory," AgentRAN establishes a foundational architecture for future 6G networks. Furthermore, the emphasis on auditable reasoning addresses the growing demand for Explainable AI (XAI) in telecommunications, ensuring that network automation remains transparent and trustworthy as systems become increasingly autonomous.
