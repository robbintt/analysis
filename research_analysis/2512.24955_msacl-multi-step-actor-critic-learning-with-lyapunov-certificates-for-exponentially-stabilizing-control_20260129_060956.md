## Executive Summary

The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to control systems is often hindered by the requirement for complex reward engineering to elicit desired behaviors and the lack of formal stability guarantees. Specifically, achieving provable exponential stability—where the system converges to a target state at a guaranteed exponential rate—remains a significant challenge for model-free RL algorithms. Without these theoretical assurances, RL-based controllers risk exhibiting unsafe behavior or failing to converge in safety-critical physical systems. This paper addresses the need for a learning framework that can achieve rapid, exponentially stable control using only simple reward signals.

The authors propose **MSACL** (Multi-Step Actor-Critic Learning), a model-free off-policy actor-critic framework that merges maximum entropy RL with exponential stability theory. The core innovation lies in learning Lyapunov certificates directly from multi-step trajectory data to verify stability. To achieve this, the method introduces **Exponential Stability Labels (ESL)** to enforce theoretical conditions without complicated reward designs. The framework also utilizes a weighted aggregation mechanism to balance the bias-variance trade-off inherent in multi-step updates and implements a stability-aware advantage function. This advantage function explicitly guides policy optimization toward rapid Lyapunov descent, ensuring the agent prioritizes actions that decrease the Lyapunov value over time.

MSACL was evaluated across six challenging benchmarks involving stabilization and nonlinear tracking (e.g., VanDerPol, Quadrotor, Pendulum). It significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baselines (SAC, PPO, LAC) across metrics such as Reach Rate (RR) and Average Mean Cumulative Reward (AMCR). Notably, MSACL achieved a perfect RR=1.0 on the VanDerPol (AMCR=33.2) and Quadrotor Tracking (AMCR=838.8) tasks, where it was the only successful method. This research establishes a critical link between formal Lyapunov stability theory and practical deep off-policy actor-critic frameworks, providing a foundation for developing safe, robust learning-based controllers.

## Methodology

MSACL is a model-free reinforcement learning framework designed to bridge the gap between exponential stability theory and maximum entropy RL. The core methodology relies on learning Lyapunov certificates using off-policy data.

To ensure safety and stability without relying on complex reward functions, the approach introduces three specific mechanisms:

1.  **Exponential Stability Labels (ESL):** Guarantees that theoretical conditions for stability are satisfied without the need for manually shaping rewards.
2.  **$\lambda$-Weighted Aggregation:** A mechanism designed to balance the bias-variance trade-off inherent in multi-step learning updates.
3.  **Stability-Aware Advantage Function:** A modified advantage function that explicitly guides policy optimization toward rapid Lyapunov descent.

The framework operates using multi-step trajectory horizons to learn control policies that provably stabilize the system.
