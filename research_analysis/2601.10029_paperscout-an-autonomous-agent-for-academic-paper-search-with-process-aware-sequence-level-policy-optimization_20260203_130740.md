## Executive Summary

Academic paper search systems are currently constrained by rigid, predefined workflows that fail to adapt to the nuances of complex, user-defined queries. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a theoretical path to automating these searches, standard RL methods struggle with multi-turn agentic tasks due to a **"granularity mismatch."** This issue results in noisy credit assignment, where the system cannot accurately correlate specific actions with long-term outcomes, thereby hindering the development of intelligent, autonomous agents capable of navigating scientific literature effectively.

The authors introduce **PaperScout**, an autonomous agent that reframes academic search as a sequential decision-making process formalized as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Instead of following a static script, PaperScout dynamically determines when and how to invoke search tools (such as 'Search' or 'Expand') based on accumulated context. To address the training challenges inherent in this approach, the paper proposes **Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO)**. This process-aware optimization method shifts the focus from token or trajectory-level adjustments to sequence-level policy optimization, aligning the learning process more closely with the agent's interaction with the environment.

PaperScout was rigorously evaluated against strong workflow-driven baselines and standard RL methods using both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. The system demonstrated significant quantitative improvements, achieving a **Recall@10 of 0.624** and **Recall@20 of 0.736**, substantially outperforming the strongest baseline which achieved **0.490** and **0.610**, respectively. Furthermore, the system improved relevance scores by approximately **22%** over traditional workflow methods. These results validate that the adaptive agentic framework successfully mitigates the noisy credit assignment issues typical of standard RL.

This research represents a paradigm shift in information retrieval by replacing static workflows with dynamic, context-aware autonomous agents. By identifying and formally defining the granularity mismatch problem, the authors provide critical insight into the limitations of current RL applications in multi-step reasoning tasks. The introduction of PSPO offers a novel optimization technique that advances the field of sequence-level policy optimization, paving the way for more sophisticated AI agents capable of complex tool use and decision-making in scientific discovery and knowledge management.

## Key Findings

*   **Inadequacy of Rigid Workflows:** Existing academic paper search approaches that rely on rigid, predefined workflows are inadequate for handling complex and nuanced user queries.
*   **Superior Performance:** PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and standard reinforcement learning baselines in terms of both Recall and Relevance metrics.
*   **Validation of Framework:** The effectiveness of the adaptive agentic framework and the PSPO optimization strategy was rigorously validated on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.
*   **The Granularity Mismatch Problem:** Standard reinforcement learning methods suffer from a critical "granularity mismatch" in multi-turn agentic tasks, which leads to noisy credit assignment and suboptimal learning.

## Methodology

The paper proposes **PaperScout**, an autonomous agent designed to reformulate academic paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike traditional systems that follow a fixed set of steps, the PaperScout agent dynamically determines when and how to invoke specific search tools based on the context it has accumulated during the session.

To address the specific training challenges associated with this autonomous approach, the authors introduce **Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO)**. This is a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method specifically designed to align the optimization process more closely with the agent-environment interactions, solving issues found in standard RL applications.

## Technical Details

PaperScout reframes the search challenge as a sequential decision-making process formalized as a **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)**.

**System Components:**
*   **Latent State:** The current pool of papers being considered.
*   **Observations:** Partial data gathered from the environment.
*   **Actions:** Discrete steps taken by the agent, specifically invoking **'Search'** or **'Expand'** tools.
*   **Transition Functions:** Rules governing how the state changes based on actions.
*   **Reward Functions:** Feedback mechanisms used to guide the policy.

**Optimization Strategy:**
*   **PSPO (Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization):** A novel technique that optimizes the agent's policy using sequence-level feedback. This directly addresses granularity mismatch issues common in standard token-level or trajectory-level RL methods.
