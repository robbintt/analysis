### 📝 Executive Summary

The current audio processing ecosystem is fragmented, relying on specialized models designed for singular tasks such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Text-to-Speech (TTS) that require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. This reliance on siloed architectures hinders the development of unified systems capable of generalizing across diverse audio domains.

The authors address this by investigating whether the scaling laws and emergent few-shot learning capabilities observed in text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully replicated in the audio domain. Their goal is to develop a single, general-purpose model capable of understanding and generating audio without the need for task-specific retraining.

The core innovation, **MiMo-Audio**, is a massive 7B parameter modular encoder-decoder trained on over **100 million hours** of audio data (2.0 trillion tokens). The architecture employs a distinct technical division of labor: a *MiMo-Audio-Tokenizer* compresses raw audio into discrete representations, while a separate *Patch Encoder* and *Decoder* handle the reconstruction of audio waveforms. The training methodology is bifurcated into two stages: "Understanding Training" and "Understanding-Generation Joint Training."

MiMo-Audio models achieve **state-of-the-art performance among open-source models** and approach the capabilities of leading closed-source systems. The Instruct variant scored **74.9 on the MMAU-Pro benchmark**, rivaling proprietary models like GPT-4o. Furthermore, the model exhibits emergent few-shot abilities on unseen tasks, successfully performing complex operations such as voice conversion, style transfer, and long-form speech continuation. This research represents a paradigm shift, demonstrating that general-purpose audio models can be developed through massive pretraining rather than task-specific fine-tuning.
