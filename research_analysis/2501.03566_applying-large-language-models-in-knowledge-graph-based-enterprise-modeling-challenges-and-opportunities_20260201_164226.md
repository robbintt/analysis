## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of transitioning Large Language Models (LLMs) from academic theory to practical, industrial-grade applications in enterprise modeling. As enterprises seek to automate the generation of complex models defined by standards like ArchiMate and BPMN, the reliability and semantic consistency of LLMs remain significant barriers. The core issue involves bridging unstructured natural language with formal semantic representations to determine whether LLMs can independently handle the intricacies of enterprise architecture or if they require substantial human oversight to be viable in production environments.

The innovation lies in a robust Knowledge Graph (KG)-based framework that integrates ChatGPT-4o into the modeling pipeline to ground outputs in formal semantics. Technically, the approach structures data using RDF and JSON-LD formats, with logic enforced through the Web Ontology Language (OWL). The authors introduce a semantic framework distinguishing between "Type Semantics," "Inherent Semantics," and "Pragmatics," supplemented by an expert survey to gauge professional perspectives on deployment. Two distinct integration methodologies are proposed: Ex-post Semantic Lifting (where the LLM annotates existing models) and A-priori Generation (where KGs serve as direct input sources).

Experimental results comparing Human Experts and ChatGPT-4o focused on three specific metrics: Prioritization Sequence (RQ1), Proposal Probability (RQ2), and Relationship Typing accuracy (RQ3). The study yielded quantitative evidence indicating that LLM outputs exhibit minimal variability, demonstrating high consistency in generation sequences (RQ1). However, results also highlighted a performance trade-off: while the model proved reliable for specific, constrained tasks regarding Proposal Probability (RQ2), there was a measurable decline in reliability as task complexity increased, particularly in maintaining accuracy for complex relationship typing (RQ3) in enterprise architecture languages.

These findings significantly influence the field by redefining the role of LLMs from autonomous creators to essential "building blocks" within a broader machine-supported workflow. The evidence establishes that while LLMs offer a viable path toward industrial application, a strict "human-in-the-loop" methodology remains mandatory. Consequently, organizations must shift their implementation strategy to deploy LLMs as tools requiring expert supervision to navigate the limitations of task complexity and ensure the precision of the final enterprise architecture.
