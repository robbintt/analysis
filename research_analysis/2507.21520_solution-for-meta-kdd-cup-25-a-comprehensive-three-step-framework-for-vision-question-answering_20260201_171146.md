## Executive Summary

This research addresses the persistent challenges in Vision Question Answering (VQA), specifically focusing on the limitations of current Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). VLLMs frequently suffer from hallucinations—generating plausible but factually incorrect responses—and struggle with complex requirements such as retrieving information from multi-source documents and maintaining coherence across multi-turn interactions. These issues are critical to resolve as VQA systems increasingly handle real-world applications where accuracy, strict latency constraints (30 seconds per query), and reliability in processing visual-textual contexts are paramount.

The authors propose a comprehensive, modular three-step framework built upon a single-model strategy using the Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct backbone. Technically, the pipeline combines: (1) Data Augmentation, utilizing GPT-4o mini for label expansion and verification to enhance robustness; (2) Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a reranking component to ground responses in relevant visual context and filter noise; and (3) Multi-task Fine-tuning via LoRA, optimized using vLLM to ensure strict adherence to inference latency requirements. This architecture effectively demonstrates that a singular, well-optimized model can outperform heavier ensemble approaches by integrating retrieval tightly into the generation process.

Evaluated on the CRAG-MM dataset, which consists of 5,000 images across 13 domains, the BlackPearl team secured top rankings in the Meta KDD Cup 2025. The solution achieved 3rd place in Task 1 ("Single-Source Augmentation") and 3rd place in Task 2 ("Multi-Source Augmentation"). Most notably, the framework dominated Task 3 (Multi-turn QA), securing 1st place in automatic evaluation and 2nd place in human evaluation. These metrics validate the framework's ability to handle diverse retrieval complexities and sustained interactions while minimizing hallucinations.

The significance of this work lies in its validation of a streamlined, single-model strategy for complex multi-modal retrieval tasks. By successfully mitigating VLLM hallucinations and improving multi-turn dialogue handling through rigorous RAG and augmentation, the authors set a new performance standard for the CRAG-MM benchmark. This research provides a generalizable blueprint for the field, proving that high performance in visual reasoning can be achieved without relying on unwieldy model ensembles, thereby offering a more efficient path toward deployable and accurate VQA systems.
