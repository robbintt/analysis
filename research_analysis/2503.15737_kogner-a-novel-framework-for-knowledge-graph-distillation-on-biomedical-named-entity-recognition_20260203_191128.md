## Executive Summary

Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) faces substantial challenges due to data sparsity and the high complexity of domain-specific terminology. Traditional fine-tuned models often struggle to generalize across biomedical sub-domains because of insufficient labeled data, while Large Language Models (LLMs) can lack the precise, structured knowledge required to disambiguate complex entities.

This paper introduces **KoGNER**, a novel framework utilizing a teacher-student knowledge distillation architecture to integrate structured knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The "Teacher" model serves as a Knowledge Graph Encoder, generating rich embeddings by synthesizing textual information and logical information via TransR. Crucially, the framework employs an **Entity-Aware Augmentation** process that utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture structural and topological information, which is then integrated into the student's contextual embeddings.

The "Student" model, a lightweight NER architecture, learns to mimic these representations through a dual-objective training function combining Language Loss (Binary Cross-Entropy) and Distillation Loss (Mean Squared Error). This allows the student model to incorporate structured semantic relationships from UMLS, enhancing its understanding of entity boundaries and types.

KoGNER demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, particularly in zero-shot scenarios. In zero-shot evaluations on the BMG dataset, KoGNER outperformed GPT-4o by a significant margin. While fine-tuned baseline models like GLiNER maintained an advantage in specific, fully supervised tasks (NCBI, BC5CDR), KoGNER proved superior in generalization and zero-shot environments. This research establishes that structured knowledge distillation is a highly effective strategy for domain-specific NER, offering a scalable solution for data-constrained biomedical environments.

## Key Findings

*   **State-of-the-Art Performance:** KoGNER achieves superior results on benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming traditional fine-tuned NER models and Large Language Models (LLMs).
*   **Mitigation of Data Sparsity:** Utilizing knowledge graphs (KGs) effectively improves NER accuracy by addressing issues related to sparse data.
*   **Reduced Ambiguity:** The integration of structured knowledge reduces ambiguity in entity detection and improves classification accuracy.
*   **Zero-Shot Dominance:** The framework excels in zero-shot evaluations, outperforming GPT-4o by **10.3% F1** on the BMG dataset.

## Methodology

The KoGNER (Knowledge Graph distilled for Named Entity Recognition) framework employs a structured two-step process to integrate external knowledge into the NER task:

1.  **Knowledge Distillation**
    External knowledge is distilled from a comprehensive Knowledge Graph into lightweight representations that are accessible to the student model.

2.  **Entity-Aware Augmentation**
    Contextual embeddings are enriched with KG information and integrated into a Graph Neural Network (GNN). This step enhances the model's understanding of complex entity relationships within the biomedical context.

***

## Technical Details

The architecture relies on a bi-encoder teacher-student framework designed to bridge the gap between structured knowledge and raw text.

### Architecture Components

*   **Student Model**
    *   Processes input text and entity sets.
    *   Generates span representations via a sliding window and Feed-Forward Network (FFN).
    *   Generates entity representations via a separate FFN.
*   **Teacher Model (Knowledge Graph Encoder)**
    *   Generates rich embeddings combining three distinct information types:
        *   **Textual Information**
        *   **Spatial Information:** Extracted via a Graph Neural Network (GNN).
        *   **Logical Information:** Processed via TransR.

### Training Objective

The model is optimized using a combined loss function to ensure the student model accurately replicates the teacher's rich knowledge representations:

$$ \text{Total Loss} = \text{Language Loss (BCE)} + \text{Distillation Loss (MSE)} $$

*   **Language Loss:** Binary Cross-Entropy for standard NER tasks.
*   **Distillation Loss:** Mean Squared Error to align the student's span representations with the teacher's KG embeddings.

## Performance & Results

Evaluation was conducted on the BMG dataset and five standard biomedical datasets (GENIA, NCBI, BC5CDR, BC4CHEMD, BC2GM) using the **F1 score**.

### Comparative Analysis (F1 Scores)

| Dataset | KoGNER | Fine-tuned GLiNER | GPT-4o | Winner |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **BMG (Zero-shot)** | **51.6%** | 42.8% | 41.3% | **KoGNER** |
| **GENIA** | **32.8%** | 31.1% | - | **KoGNER** |
| **BC2GM** | **31.2%** | 29.8% | - | **KoGNER** |
| **NCBI** | 32.6% | **44.1%** | - | **GLiNER** |
| **BC5CDR** | 43.2% | **55.8%** | - | **GLiNER** |

### Insights

*   **Generalization:** KoGNER consistently outperformed GLiNER in zero-shot and generalization tasks (BMG, GENIA, BC2GM).
*   **Supervised Specificity:** In specific, fully supervised domain tasks, fine-tuned GLiNER demonstrated higher recall, outperforming KoGNER on NCBI and BC5CDR.
