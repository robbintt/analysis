## Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of creating general-purpose AI agents capable of autonomously generating and optimizing complex workflows without relying on supervised learning. Current state-of-the-art methods typically depend heavily on large, labeled datasets to guide agent behavior, which limits their applicability in dynamic, real-world environments where ground truth data is unavailable or expensive to acquire. The paper aims to bridge this gap by developing a system that can adapt its reasoning process on the fly, tackling multi-step problems in domains such as coding, mathematics, and conversational QA without human-annotated training signals.

The core innovation is **Polymath**, a self-optimizing agent built upon a dynamic hierarchical workflow architecture. This architecture combines a high-level "Task Flow Graph" to manage overall strategy with low-level "Code-Represented Subtask Workflows" for execution details. Optimization is achieved through a novel integration of multi-grid-inspired graph restructuring and a Self-Reflection-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm. Unlike supervised approaches, this evolutionary mechanism refines workflows iteratively based on evaluation feedback, utilizing a Subtask Effective Score (calculated as $s = d \cdot c$) stored in a vector database to mitigate noise via clustering and statistical analysis.

Polymath demonstrates significant performance gains, achieving an **8.1% average improvement** over state-of-the-art baselines across coding, mathematics, and multi-turn question answering benchmarks. In the process, the system generated 35,720 distinct workflows, averaging 64.7 lines of code per workflow. Ablation studies on the MBPP dataset highlight the importance of the Task Flow Graph, with workflows utilizing it achieving a correctness average of 0.82 and combined scores up to 0.90, compared to 0.71 for those without it. Furthermore, stability analysis indicated robust performance with low standard deviations ranging between 0.27 and 0.29.

The significance of this work lies in its demonstration of a **label-free optimization methodology** that eliminates the dependency on curated labeled datasets, a major bottleneck in agent development. By successfully validating a self-refinement mechanism across six diverse datasets, Polymath establishes a new paradigm for agentic AI that prioritizes adaptability and autonomous code generation. This advancement paves the way for deploying intelligent agents in open-ended environments where tasks evolve rapidly and predefined training data is insufficient.
