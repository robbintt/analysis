## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of integrating **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) systems to overcome the "black box" limitations of traditional machine learning in industrial fault diagnosis. The core technical hurdle lies in bridging the gap between continuous, high-frequency raw time-series sensor data and the discrete, text-based architecture of LLMs. Furthermore, the industry lacks clarity on optimal system designs, specifically regarding the trade-offs between single and multi-model approaches and the ability of these models to handle dynamic, non-stationary data streams typical of industrial environments.

The paper introduces a **"Multi-Stage LLM Framework"** utilizing a cascaded two-stage pipeline to convert numerical sensor data into semantic fault diagnoses. Stage 1 employs an Anomaly Detection LLM for binary classification and initial explanation generation, while Stage 2 uses a Fault Classification LLM with in-context learning to categorize specific faults (e.g., Refrigerant Leak, Compressor Fault). A key technical contribution is the use of a physics-based HVAC simulator to generate ground truth data via thermodynamic differential equations and Gaussian noise.

**Quantitative evaluation** demonstrates that LLMs achieve substantially higher diagnostic performance when processing descriptive statistical summaries compared to raw time-series inputs. Specifically, models using statistical summaries achieved an accuracy of **94%** and an F1-score of **0.91**, significantly outperforming those using raw data (72% accuracy). Additionally, Multi-LLM systems utilizing specialized prompts improved fault classification sensitivity by approximately **18%** over single-LLM architectures. The study also explicitly validated explainability, with human experts confirming that **88%** of the generated justifications were technically accurate and relevant. However, results highlighted a clear limitation: in continual learning settings, the model's ability to calibrate predictions degraded by over **25%**, revealing an inability to adapt effectively to streaming data.
