## Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of augmenting human cognition in real-time, specifically focusing on the application of time pressure as a performance enhancement tool. Time pressure functions as a "double-edged sword"; while it can increase physiological arousal and focus, excessive pressure induces anxiety that degrades accuracy. The central problem is dynamically regulating this feedback loop to optimize both speed and accuracy without causing cognitive overload. Existing methods struggle to balance these competing psychological factors, and the field faces a significant data bottleneck: training adaptive policies typically requires exhaustive, unsafe, and expensive interactions with human subjects.

The key innovation is the **"Cognitive Exoskeleton,"** a dual-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework designed to bypass the data scarcity bottleneck through Sim-to-Real transfer. The architecture employs a Simulation Agent that mimics human cognitive speed-accuracy trade-offs using a Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM), creating a robust synthetic environment. A Regulation Agent is then trained against this simulation to learn optimal control policies before deployment. This decoupling allows the system to learn how to modulate time pressure visualizations based on user state inputs—such as recent response times—without requiring iterative human-in-the-loop training cycles.

The framework was validated through user studies involving mathematical arithmetic problem-solving, where it demonstrated quantifiable superiority over baseline groups. Participants using the Cognitive Exoskeleton achieved a correct rate of approximately **88.6%**, representing a significant performance increase of roughly **22.3%** compared to non-adaptive control methods. The system successfully managed the inherent trade-offs of time pressure, maintaining high accuracy and speed while effectively increasing user arousal without inducing anxiety. These results confirm that the simulation agent was sufficiently accurate to mimic user cognition, allowing the Regulation Agent to transfer effectively to real-world interaction.

This paper significantly advances the field of human-computer interaction by providing a scalable solution to the data limitations often found in real-time adaptive systems. By validating a simulation-based training approach, the authors establish a practical pathway for deploying reinforcement learning in sensitive human environments. The successful demonstration of using AI to dynamically balance psychological factors establishes the "Cognitive Exoskeleton" as a foundational concept for future intelligent systems, with broad implications for optimizing human performance in high-stakes domains such as air traffic control, emergency response, and complex surgery.

## Methodology

The researchers utilized **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** to create an adaptive policy that controls time pressure visual feedback based on user performance in real-time.

To mitigate high data requirements and training complexity, the authors proposed a **dual-DRL framework** consisting of two distinct components:

1.  **Regulation DRL Agent:** Learns to regulate user performance.
2.  **Simulation DRL Agent:** Trained on existing data to mimic human cognition and act as a simulator.

The framework was validated through a rigorous user study comparing the performance of users aided by the system against a baseline group in mathematical arithmetic problem-solving scenarios.
