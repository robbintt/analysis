## Executive Summary

Current approaches to interleaved image-text generation face a critical "**One-Tool**" bottleneck. Systems relying on a single generative mechanism—typically diffusion models—struggle to simultaneously achieve visual creativity, factual accuracy, and programmatic precision. This architectural limitation hinders rigorous logical reasoning and real-world fact verification, rendering models ineffective for complex tasks that require the synthesis of precise data alongside visual content.

This research introduces **LLM-I (LLM-Interleaved)**, a framework that fundamentally reframes interleaved generation from a direct synthesis task into a "**tool-use**" orchestration problem. The system employs a central LLM or MLLM agent trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) to act as an intelligent conductor for a toolkit of external visual tools. This toolkit includes online image search, diffusion-based generation, code execution, and image editing.

The optimized agent combines rule-based constraints with LLM/MLLM evaluators to maximize performance. LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four distinct benchmarks, successfully resolving trade-offs between creativeness and precision. Furthermore, the implementation of a novel test-time scaling strategy—employing stochastic sampling, concurrent querying, and iterative debugging—delivers measurable performance gains in reliability and quality.

## Key Findings

*   **State-of-the-Art Performance:** LLM-I outperforms existing methods across four benchmarks, effectively balancing creativity with precision.
*   **Resolution of "One-Tool" Bottleneck:** The framework successfully handles tasks requiring both factual grounding and programmatic precision, limitations often found in single-tool approaches.
*   **Effective Orchestration:** A central LLM or MLLM agent can dynamically manage a diverse array of specialized visual tools (search, generation, coding, editing).
*   **Test-Time Scaling:** The introduction of a novel test-time scaling strategy provides measurable performance gains.
*   **Robust Generalization:** The framework generalizes effectively across multiple model backbones.

## Methodology

The study re-imagines the generation process by shifting from a direct generation task to a "tool-use" paradigm. The methodology involves three core layers:

1.  **Agent Orchestration:** A central LLM or MLLM is empowered as an intelligent orchestrator. It dynamically manages a toolkit of specialized visual tools.
2.  **Toolkit Composition:** The agent utilizes:
    *   **Online Image Search** (Google Search API)
    *   **Diffusion-based Generation** (Seedream 3.0)
    *   **Code Execution** (Python sandbox)
    *   **Image Editing**
3.  **Reinforcement Learning Training:** The agent is trained via an RL framework optimized for tool selection. This uses a **hybrid reward system** that combines:
    *   Rule-based logic
    *   Evaluative judgments from LLM and MLLM evaluators

## Technical Details

### Architecture & Paradigm
*   **Proficient Tool-User:** The framework adopts an agentic paradigm where a central LLM/MLLM orchestrates external tools.
*   **Objective:** Solve the "One-Tool" bottleneck by enabling the model to select the right tool for the specific sub-task (e.g., using search for facts rather than hallucinating via diffusion).

### Training Pipeline
*   **Dataset:** ~4k samples generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro.
*   **Annotations:** Utilized implicit prompts and constraint annotations (values: -1, 0, n, Inf) to force reasoning about tool selection.
*   **Validation:** Data was validated by GPT-4o.
*   **Optimization:** RL recipe designed to maximize the efficiency of tool selection.

### Inference Strategy
*   **Test-Time Scaling:** A novel strategy involving three stages:
    1.  **Stochastic Sampling**
    2.  **Filtering**
    3.  **Enhancement**
*   **Enhancement Techniques:**
    *   **Concurrent querying:** Running search and diffusion simultaneously for images.
    *   **Iterative debugging:** For code execution errors.

## Results

*   **Benchmark Dominance:** LLM-I achieved superior results across four benchmarks compared to existing methods.
*   **Complex Task Handling:** Successfully navigated tasks requiring high factual grounding and programmatic precision.
*   **"Mini-Project" Benchmark:** Introduced a new benchmark featuring tasks with background context and high informational density visual requirements.
    *   **Evaluation:** Assessed via 10 distinct metrics per sample.
*   **Backbone Versatility:** The model showed robust performance when applied to four different model backbones.
*   **Scaling Impact:** The test-time scaling strategy provided quantifiable improvements in reliability and output quality.
