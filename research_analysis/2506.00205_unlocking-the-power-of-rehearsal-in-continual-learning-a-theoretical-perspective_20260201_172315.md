## Executive Summary

Continual learning (CL) systems face the pervasive challenge of **catastrophic forgetting**, where the acquisition of new knowledge severely degrades performance on previous tasks. While rehearsal-based methods are the dominant mitigation strategy, they rely heavily on heuristic approaches—specifically standard Concurrent Rehearsal—without a rigorous theoretical foundation for scheduling. This lack of mathematical grounding results in suboptimal performance when dealing with complex, heterogeneous task streams, as existing methods fail to account for the geometric relationships between tasks.

This paper addresses this gap by establishing the first rigorous theoretical analysis of rehearsal scheduling in overparameterized linear models, moving the field from trial-and-error heuristics toward a mathematically grounded strategy. The authors introduce a theoretically grounded **Hybrid Rehearsal Framework**, built upon the quantification of task similarity using "Task Gap"—defined as the Euclidean distance between optimal weight vectors.

The core innovation lies in adaptively partitioning the memory buffer based on this metric: the framework applies **Concurrent Rehearsal** for tasks with a low Task Gap and **Sequential Rehearsal** for tasks with a high Task Gap. Empirical validation on standard benchmarks confirms that the Hybrid Rehearsal framework consistently achieves superior performance, significantly reducing catastrophic forgetting and achieving higher Average Accuracy than fixed strategies.

## Key Findings

*   **Optimal Strategy Depends on Task Similarity:** Theoretical analysis reveals that Sequential Rehearsal outperforms the standard Concurrent Rehearsal when tasks are less similar to one another.
*   **Superiority of Hybrid Rehearsal:** A novel Hybrid Rehearsal method, which strategically trains similar tasks concurrently and dissimilar tasks sequentially, yields better performance than the standard concurrent approach.
*   **Theoretical Characterization of Error:** The study provides explicit characterizations of forgetting and generalization error within the context of overparameterized linear models, clarifying the mechanics behind different rehearsal strategies.
*   **Validation in Deep Learning:** Experiments using deep neural networks confirm that the proposed hybrid approach effectively outperforms standard concurrent rehearsal in practice.

## Methodology

The authors utilize a theoretical analysis framework applied to overparameterized linear models to compare two distinct rehearsal strategies:

1.  **Concurrent Rehearsal:** Training on past and new data simultaneously.
2.  **Sequential Rehearsal:** Training on new data first, followed by the sequential revisiting of past data.

The methodology involves explicitly characterizing forgetting and generalization error to evaluate performance. Following the theoretical derivation, the authors validate their findings through empirical experiments utilizing deep neural networks to demonstrate the real-world applicability of the proposed Hybrid Rehearsal method.

## Technical Details

*   **Theoretical Framework:** Frames Continual Learning within overparameterized linear models.
*   **Similarity Metric:** Uses 'Task Gap' (Euclidean distance between optimal weight vectors) to measure task similarity.
*   **Hybrid Framework:** Proposes a new framework that partitions the memory buffer into similar and dissimilar task subsets.
*   **Training Pipeline:** Employs a two-stage process:
    *   **Phase 1 (Concurrent):** Trains on current data and similar memory data.
    *   **Phase 2 (Sequential):** Iterates through dissimilar memory data sequentially.

## Results

*   **Primary Metrics:** The paper uses Forgetting and Generalization Error as primary measures of success.
*   **Validation:** Simulations validated theoretical predictions regarding the relationship between Task Gap and rehearsal strategy.
