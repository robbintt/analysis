---

> ### Executive Summary
>
> Few-shot image classification faces the inherent challenge of learning discriminative representations from severely limited data, often suffering from high intra-class variability where objects of the same class appear vastly different. Additionally, current methods frequently encounter **"supervision collapse"** when relying on single image-level annotations, failing to semantically align relevant local features without extensive examples. Addressing these issues is critical for advancing computer vision applications where data collection is expensive or impractical.
>
> The authors propose **SCAM-Net** (Generalization-optimized Systems Consolidation Adaptive Memory Dual-Network), a bio-inspired framework mimicking the human brain's Complementary Learning Systems. The architecture utilizes a dual-network structure consisting of a Hippocampus model for short-term adaptation via gradient descent and a Neocortex model for long-term knowledge consolidation updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
>
> Evaluated on standard benchmarks **miniImageNet** and **tieredImageNet**, SCAM-Net demonstrated strong performance, particularly in 1-shot settings. This research is significant for successfully bridging neuroscience principles with deep learning to solve few-shot recognition problems. By effectively resolving supervision collapse under weak supervision, SCAM-Net provides a robust mechanism for identifying semantically relevant local regions amidst high variability.

> ## Technical Specifications
>
> The architecture of SCAM-Net consists of several distinct technical components designed to optimize few-shot learning:
>
> **Architecture Components**
> *   **Hippocampus Model:** Responsible for short-term adaptation via gradient descent.
> *   **Neocortex Model:** Responsible for long-term information storage, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
> *   **Backbone:** Utilizes a Vision Transformer (ViT-S/16) backbone (~22M parameters) pre-trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM).
>
> **Interaction & Training**
> *   **Dual-Stream Interaction:** Employs a Consistency Loss (MSE) that constrains the Hippocampus using guidance from the Neocortex.
> *   **Similarity Calculation:** Calculates pair-wise cosine similarity between support and query patch embeddings using block-diagonal masking.
> *   **Adaptive Memory Module:** Located in the Neocortex, it maintains global class representations using CLS tokens. Memory is updated by averaging for existing classes or appending for new ones.
>
> **Loss Function**
> The composite loss function is defined as:
> $$L = L_{CE}(\hat{y}_h, y) + L_{Cons}(\hat{y}_h, \hat{y}_n) + \lambda L_{CE}(\hat{y}_c, y)$$
