## 📑 Executive Summary

### Problem
Neural image compression typically relies on quantizing latent representations to reduce bitrate, yet standard implementations often utilize non-uniform scalar quantization, which is theoretically suboptimal compared to vector quantization. Furthermore, optimizing these codecs usually requires access to reconstruction error gradients (distortion gradients), which are computationally expensive or unavailable at decoding devices. This paper addresses the dual challenge of inefficient quantization geometry and the difficulty of optimizing rate-distortion performance without direct access to distortion gradients during the decoding process.

### Innovation
The authors introduce an optimization framework that exploits latent properties through two primary mechanisms: optimal uniform vector quantization and entropy gradient-based optimization. Theoretically, the paper analyzes quantization grid geometries—specifically Square, Hexagonal, and Truncated Octahedral—to determine the configuration that minimizes distortion under a uniform distribution, establishing the Truncated Octahedron as the optimal shape. Additionally, the authors propose "Latent Shifting," a technique leveraging the mathematical correlation between the entropy gradient and the reconstruction error gradient (Corollary 2.1). By proving that $\nabla \log(p) \propto -\lambda \nabla d$, the framework uses the entropy gradient as a proxy for the distortion gradient, enabling efficient optimization of the latent code without needing the original source image.

### Results
Theoretical analysis reveals that the Truncated Octahedral grid reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) by approximately 5.7% compared to standard Square grids and 2.0% compared to Hexagonal grids. In practical experiments using the MBT 2018-Mean codec, the proposed "Latent Shifting" methods yielded consistent bitrate savings. The Combined Main & Side Shift approach achieved a BD-Rate reduction of 1.301% and a BD-PSNR gain of +0.0705 dB, while the Main Shift alone achieved a 1.270% BD-Rate reduction. Although theoretical upper bounds suggest potential bitrate savings of up to 26.15%, the practical implementation reliably delivers gains in the 1–3% range.

### Impact
This research is significant because it provides a viable method to enhance off-the-shelf neural and traditional compression codecs without requiring extensive retraining or access to source data at the decoder. By establishing the entropy gradient as a proxy for the reconstruction error gradient, the work offers a new theoretical and practical tool for rate-distortion optimization. The consistent realization of 1–3% bitrate reduction demonstrates that refining latent space geometry and utilizing gradient-based techniques can provide tangible efficiency gains for state-of-the-art image compression systems.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Quantization Grid Geometry
The paper analyzes grid geometry under uniform distribution to derive theoretical MSE bounds. The performance ranking is as follows:

1.  **Truncated Octahedron (Optimal):**
    *   $MSE(o) \approx 0.0785u^2$
    *   Reduces MSE by ~5.7% compared to Square grids.
2.  **Hexagon:**
    *   $MSE(h) \approx 0.0801u^2$
    *   Reduces MSE by ~2.0% compared to Square grids.
3.  **Square (Baseline):**
    *   $MSE(s) = 0.0833u^2$

### Optimization Formulation
Codec training is formulated as an unconstrained multi-objective optimization (**Theorem 2**) balancing rate and distortion:
*   **Rate:** Negative log-likelihoods of factorized and hyperpriors.
*   **Distortion:** MSE / MS-SSIM.
*   **Balancing:** Utilizes Lagrange multipliers ($\lambda$).

### Gradient Correlation
**Corollary 2.1** establishes a critical relationship between gradients:
$$ \nabla_{\hat{z}} \log(p_f(\hat{z})) \propto -\lambda \nabla_{\hat{z}} d(\dots) $$

This indicates that minimizing distortion minimizes entropy, which enables 'Latent Shifting' optimizations at the decoder.

## 📈 Results

### Theoretical Analysis
*   **Truncated Octahedron vs. Square:** ~5.7% MSE reduction.
*   **Truncated Octahedron vs. Hexagon:** ~2.0% MSE reduction.

### Experimental Results (MBT 2018-Mean Codec)
Practical implementation of Latent Shifting yielded the following:

*   **Side Shift:**
    *   BD-Rate: -0.031%
    *   BD-PSNR: +0.0705 dB
*   **Main Shift:**
    *   BD-Rate: **-1.270%**
*   **Combined Main & Side Shift:**
    *   BD-Rate: **-1.301%**
    *   BD-PSNR: +0.0705 dB

> **Note:** While theoretical upper bounds ("True Gradients") suggest up to **~26.150%** bitrate reduction, the practical 'Latent Shift' implementation achieves consistent but modest gains of **1.27% to 1.301%**.
