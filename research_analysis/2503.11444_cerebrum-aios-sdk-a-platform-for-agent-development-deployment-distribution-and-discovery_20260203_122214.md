## Executive Summary

The current ecosystem of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents suffers from critical fragmentation and a lack of standardized tooling, creating significant barriers to managing the complete agent lifecycle. Developers face substantial hurdles in agent development, deployment, distribution, and discovery due to this disjointed infrastructure. This fragmentation impedes innovation, as researchers and developers must repeatedly build low-level systems rather than focusing on agent logic, highlighting a pressing need for a unified, standardized platform to streamline these processes and foster a cohesive environment for agent-based applications.

To address these challenges, the authors introduce **Cerebrum**, a modular Agent SDK built on the AIOS kernel designed to standardize agent management while preserving development flexibility. The technical architecture features a four-layer design—comprising LLM interaction, memory (using byte-based limits and LRU-k eviction), storage (hybrid hierarchical/vector), and tool management—supplemented by an optional Overrides Layer for fine-grained kernel control. Cerebrum supports complex agent methodologies, including Chain of Thought (CoT), ReAct, and tool-use agents, through a Manager Module that handles version control, custom packaging (`.agent`, `.tool`), and dynamic loading with isolation.

The ecosystem is further bolstered by a community-driven Agent Hub and an interactive web-based testing interface, enabling users to evaluate agents visually and efficiently. While the study relies on qualitative validation due to the absence of traditional quantitative benchmarks (such as latency or throughput), it demonstrates the platform’s capability to successfully execute complex architectures like CoT and ReAct. A key metric of success is the SDK’s usability efficiency: the Client Interface employs a Builder Pattern and Auto-Configuration factory classes to enable the deployment of complex agents in just one to two lines of code. The results confirm that the framework successfully balances standardization with flexibility, allowing for the implementation of custom policies and parameters without adhering to rigid, monolithic structures.

Cerebrum represents a foundational advancement in LLM agent infrastructure by lowering the barrier to entry and establishing a standardized environment for the agent lifecycle. By providing a unified framework that bridges the gap between fragmented tools and a cohesive ecosystem, Cerebrum empowers researchers to innovate on agent logic rather than infrastructure.

## Key Findings

*   **Fragmentation Gap:** There is a significant lack of standardized tools within the field for the complete lifecycle management of LLM-based agents, specifically regarding development, deployment, distribution, and discovery.
*   **Unified Solution:** Cerebrum successfully addresses these gaps by functioning as a unified platform that integrates a modular SDK, a community-driven hub, and an interactive testing environment.
*   **Complex Architecture Support:** The platform is capable of supporting and effectively demonstrating various complex agent architectures, including Chain of Thought (CoT), ReAct, and tool-use agents.
*   **Balanced Framework:** The framework achieves a balance by providing a standardized structure for agent development while maintaining the flexibility required for researchers and developers to innovate.

## Methodology

The researchers designed and implemented Cerebrum as a comprehensive Agent SDK for AIOS using a modular four-layer architecture that encompasses LLM management, memory, storage, and tool management.

To validate the platform's effectiveness, the authors implemented specific agent architectures (Chain of Thought, ReAct, and tool-use agents) within the framework. Additionally, the methodology involved the creation of an ecosystem consisting of:

*   **Agent Hub:** A community-driven infrastructure featuring version control and dependency management.
*   **Interactive Interface:** A web-based environment to facilitate agent testing and evaluation.

*   **Packaging:** Uses custom file formats (`.agent`, `.tool`).
*   **Loading:** Implements dynamic loading with isolation.

### **Client Interface**
*   **Design Patterns:** Utilizes the Builder Pattern and Auto-Configuration factory classes.
*   **Deployment:** Enables full agent deployment in **1–2 lines of code**.
