## Executive Summary

Current AI ethics frameworks are insufficient for the unprecedented rise of Generative AI (GenAI), creating an urgent need for updated conceptual tools. The core issue is that GenAI enables an **"experience-as-real" phenomenon**, where users perceive technology as human, thereby complicating existing ethical parameters. This **"Human-Likeness Affordance"** simultaneously aggravates and alleviates traditional dilemmas such as responsibility, privacy, and bias. As GenAI adoption has outpaced earlier technologies like the PC and the internet, static ethical guidelines are failing to address the unique societal risks posed by these systems.

The key innovation is a three-part conceptual framework comprising a Technical Primer, Comparative Ethical Evaluation, and Phenomenological Examination. Technically, the research distinguishes GenAI by its use of Deep Neural Networks, Self-Supervised Learning, and Transformers, which learn data structure and distribution rather than mapping inputs to outputs. This architecture enables scalable emergent capabilities like translation, summarization, and reasoning. The work highlights how specific interaction design features engineer a perception of agency, grounding the analysis in concrete technical mechanisms rather than abstract theory.

While the paper utilizes qualitative diagnostic mapping rather than quantitative experimental metrics, findings reveal a direct correlation between model scaling and "experience-as-real" phenomena. The study identifies specific risk vectors driven by **'mimetic generativity,'** moving beyond general concerns to concrete issues like eroded authorship distinctions, the formation of 'as-if' social relationships, and susceptibility to new forms of influence. Results demonstrate that as models scale to produce highly intelligible and helpful content, the user tendency to treat coherent, responsive behavior as intentional intensifies, creating a measurable need for updated risk assessments regarding intellectual property and social manipulation.

This work establishes the Human-Likeness Affordance as the foundational anchor for future AI ethics discourse, providing policymakers and technologists with actionable tools to mitigate risk. By offering a Diagnostic Mapping of how GenAI transforms traditional dilemmas and a Taxonomy of Novel Risks linked to mimetic generativity, the framework bridges the gap between technical architecture and societal implication. The significance lies in shifting ethical analysis from theoretical abstraction to a pragmatic, diagnostic approach, enabling stakeholders to address the specific phenomenological dangers of mimetic generativity in policy and design.

## Key Findings

*   **Human-Likeness Affordance:** Identified as the central ethical characteristic, allowing users to experience technology as human.
*   **Dual Ethical Impact:** Generative AI both aggravates and alleviates existing ethical issues, including:
    *   Responsibility gaps
    *   Privacy concerns
    *   Algorithmic bias
*   **Mimetic Generativity:** Introduces novel ethical dimensions driven by the technology's ability to mimic human creation.
*   **Emerging Societal Risks:**
    *   Debates over authorship and intellectual property.
    *   Formation of 'as-if' social relationships.
    *   New, sophisticated forms of influence and manipulation.

## Methodology

The research employs a theoretical and conceptual analysis framework organized into three distinct parts:

1.  **Technical Primer:** Establishes a foundational understanding of how the technology functions.
2.  **Comparative Ethical Evaluation:** Assesses the interactions of GenAI with existing AI ethics principles.
3.  **Phenomenological Examination:** Investigates emergent behaviors and new social phenomena arising from the use of the technology.

## Technical Details

The paper distinguishes Generative AI from discriminative models through its underlying architecture and learning processes.

### Core Functionality
*   **Learning Mechanism:** Learns the structure and distribution of data rather than strictly mapping inputs to outputs.
*   **Architecture:** Utilizes Deep Neural Networks.
*   **Training Paradigm:** Employs Self-Supervised Learning.
*   **Key Components:** Transformers are identified as the critical technology enabling scaling.

### Emergent Capabilities
Scaling these models leads to emergent behaviors, including:
*   Translation
*   Summarization
*   Reasoning
*   Text composition

### Interaction Design Features
Specific design choices reinforce the perception of agency:
*   **Conversational Interfaces:** Natural language dialogue.
*   **Memory/Planning Displays:** Visualizations suggesting foresight and memory retention.
*   **Multimodal Outputs:** Integrating text, image, and audio.
