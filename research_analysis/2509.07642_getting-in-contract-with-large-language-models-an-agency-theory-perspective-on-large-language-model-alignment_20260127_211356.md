## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical risks organizations face when integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) by framing the adoption process as a principal-agent problem rooted in economic Agency Theory. The central issue is information asymmetry: human stakeholders (principals) cannot fully observe or control the decision-making process of the AI (agent), leading to potential misalignment between organizational goals and model outputs.

The key innovation is the **'LLM ATLAS' (LLM Agency Theory-Led Alignment Strategy)**, a conceptual framework that translates economic contract mechanisms into technical engineering standards. Rather than relying on generic software lifecycles, LLM ATLAS operationalizes "contractual agreements" by mapping Agency Theory to five operational phases of the machine learning lifecycle.

Technically, the framework distinguishes between **Inner Alignment** (aligning the model’s internal objective functions with incentives) and **Outer Alignment** (ensuring outputs adhere to human instructions). It defines the **'HHH' criteria** (Helpfulness, Honesty, Harmlessness) and the **'RICE' framework** (Robustness, Interpretability, Controllability, Ethicality) as the enforceable clauses of this contract.

As a conceptual study, the paper does not present quantitative experimental results. Instead, its primary contribution is the derivation of the LLM ATLAS taxonomy, which identifies specific agency risks within distinct phases of the LLMOps lifecycle. This work establishes a necessary bridge between economic theory and machine learning engineering, providing organizations with a robust mechanism to manage the "black box" nature of AI through governance protocols that are legally, economically, and technically sound.

## Technical Details

### Proposed Approach: LLM ATLAS
The **LLM Agency Theory-Led Alignment Strategy** is grounded in Agency Theory to address the principal-agent problem and mitigate information asymmetries during organizational LLM adoption.

### Operational Alignment Phases
The methodology maps alignment challenges to five operational phases derived from CRISP-DM, MLOps, and LLMOps:

1.  **Business Problem Definition**
2.  **Data Acquisition and Preparation**
3.  **Model Selection** (specifically evaluating open vs. closed-source trade-offs)
4.  **Model Development**
5.  **Deployment and Monitoring**

### Alignment Frameworks
Alignment is operationalized through specific criteria and frameworks to act as "contractual clauses":

*   **HHH Criteria:**
    *   Helpfulness
    *   Honesty
    *   Harmlessness
*   **RICE Framework:**
    *   Robustness
    *   Interpretability
    *   Controllability
    *   Ethicality

### Alignment Distinction
*   **Inner Alignment:** Focusing on aligning the model’s internal objective functions with intended incentives.
*   **Outer Alignment:** Ensuring that the model's outputs strictly adhere to human instructions and values.
