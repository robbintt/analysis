## Executive Summary

This research addresses **Contextual Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization (CSCO)**, a critical challenge involving the selection of optimal combinatorial structures under uncertainty while leveraging contextual side information. This problem is significant because traditional operations research methods often fail to utilize contextual data effectively, while existing machine learning approaches, such as imitation learning, rely on expensive Lagrangian-based heuristics that are computationally prohibitive. The authors aim to bridge this divide by developing a **scalable framework** for training neural combinatorial policies that approximate the minimization of expected risk using a surrogate objective derived from historical data, offering a rigorous alternative to heuristic-dependent methods.

The key innovation is a novel **primal-dual algorithm** that integrates operations research with machine learning through a surrogate learning problem, utilizing neural networks embedded with combinatorial optimization layers. Technically, the method employs a score-to-distribution mapping via Legendre-type functions and applies a **Fenchel-Young regularization** term to the surrogate objective. Crucially, the authors introduce a specific regularization method using **sparse perturbations on the distribution simplex**; this modification enables tractable updates in the original space and accommodates a wide range of objective functions. By operating within the convex envelope's polytope via moment mapping, the algorithm ensures stability and broad applicability across different combinatorial settings.

Experimental evaluations on a contextual stochastic minimum-weight spanning tree problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves **performance parity** with imitation learning baselines in terms of empirical risk (cost) but with superior computational efficiency by avoiding the need for expensive Lagrangian-based heuristics. The authors provide rigorous theoretical evidence, establishing a convergence rate of $O(1/t)$ to the global minimum of the surrogate problem under the assumption of a convex Jensen gap for the regularizer, alongside linear convergence in specific settings. Furthermore, the research provides a specific bound on the suboptimality of the resulting policy, validating the method's scalability in large-scale settings where traditional methods falter.

This work significantly impacts the field by providing a rigorous, mathematically grounded foundation for neural combinatorial policies in stochastic environments. By extending Fenchel-Young loss results and proving explicit suboptimality bounds alongside defined convergence rates, the paper offers a robust alternative to computationally expensive imitation learning techniques. This approach successfully bridges the gap between operations research and machine learning, enabling the efficient deployment of context-aware decision policies in complex, real-world optimization problems that were previously constrained by computational limitations.
