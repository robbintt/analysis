## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) security are statistically unreliable. The field treats safety as a binary property derived from limited sample sizes, failing to account for the stochastic nature of model generation. Most evaluations rely on point estimates (e.g., "0% jailbreak success") from datasets often smaller than $N=50$. This approach yields high-variance estimates that cannot accurately reflect a model's true vulnerability. Consequently, organizations cannot distinguish between genuinely robust defenses and those that merely appear secure due to random chance, leading to a false sense of security.

### **Innovation**
To address these deficiencies, this research proposes adopting **Bayesian statistical modeling**, specifically utilizing **Beta-Binomial conjugate distributions**, to quantify uncertainty in security evaluations.
*   **Posterior Distributions:** Instead of a single Attack Success Rate (ASR), the method constructs posterior distributions over success probabilities.
*   **Credible Intervals:** enables the calculation of rigorous credible intervals.
*   **Sequential Analysis:** Implements a stopping rule to determine the precise number of samples needed to achieve statistical significance, preventing false negatives and eliminating arbitrary sample sizing.

### **Results**
The analysis provides quantitative evidence that standard practices are statistically underpowered:
*   **Uncertainty in Small Samples:** An evaluation reporting 0% failure on a sample size of 10 yields a 95% credible interval of roughly **[0, 31%]**, meaning the model could still be critically insecure.
*   **Sample Size Requirements:** To distinguish between a robust model (1% ASR) and a vulnerable one (10% ASR) with 95% confidence, over **600 samples** are required—exceeding typical benchmarks by an order of magnitude.
*   **Cost Reduction:** The proposed sequential testing protocol reduces evaluation costs by approximately **50%** compared to fixed-size sampling by identifying "borderline" defenses and stopping early for clearly broken models.

### **Impact**
This research establishes a necessary statistical foundation for LLM safety, shifting the industry focus from simplistic, high-variance metrics to **probabilistic assurance**. By providing a framework to calculate exact sample sizes and certify model safety within defined confidence bounds, organizations can set meaningful safety thresholds. This prevents the costly deployment of insecure models and influences the field toward reporting uncertainty intervals alongside performance metrics.
