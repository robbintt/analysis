## Executive Summary

The rapid emergence of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a paradigm of "Agentic AI," which currently evolves largely in isolation from decades of established research in Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP). This paper addresses the critical disconnect between these two domains, highlighting a lack of architectural rigor in modern agentic platforms and the risk of traditional agent toolkits becoming obsolete without integrating generative capabilities. The authors argue that examining the bidirectional relationship between traditional Agent Toolkits and modern LLMs is essential to prevent the duplication of past mistakes and to ensure that the agentic systems of the future are built upon robust, proven engineering principles rather than ad-hoc implementations.

The key innovation presented is `astra-langchain4j`, a library that integrates LLMs directly into the ASTRA programming language. Built on the Java LangChain4J library, the solution extends ASTRA’s module system by introducing specific types for Sensors, Actions, Predicates, Terms, and Events to manage AI interactions. The architecture features a prompt templating engine using `${<param>}` syntax and a unique `BeliefRAG` mechanism that automatically mines the agent's existing belief base to inject relevant context into prompts.

The paper validates technical feasibility through three functional case studies: a "Joker" agent for basic templating, a "Happy" agent for structured output parsing, and a complex Travel Planner involving multi-agent coordination. The significance of this research lies in its demonstration that the "wealth of experience" embedded in traditional Agent Toolkits provides a necessary foundation for the chaotic field of Agentic AI, offering a pathway toward more stable, transparent, and maintainable AI systems.

## Key Findings

*   **Bidirectional Relationship:** There is a critical need to examine the bidirectional relationship between emerging Generative/Agentic AI technologies and traditional Agent Toolkits.
*   **Technical Feasibility:** The development of `astra-langchain4j` demonstrates the technical feasibility of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the ASTRA programming language.
*   **Practical Insights:** Practical implementation via three distinct examples yielded valuable insights into the strengths and challenges of combining LLMs with agent-oriented programming.
*   **Leveraging Experience:** The wealth of experience and design principles found in traditional Agent Toolkits offers significant value for informing the design and architecture of modern agentic platforms.

---

## Methodology

The researchers adopted a **prototype development and case study approach**. This process involved three main phases:

1.  **Prototype Development:** Developing a prototype integration that bridges Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ASTRA programming language (a traditional Agent Toolkit).
2.  **Implementation:** Implementing three specific example scenarios to test and demonstrate the capabilities of this integration.
3.  **Retrospective Analysis:** Conducting a retrospective analysis of these implementations to discuss the experiences and lessons learned regarding the interaction between LLMs and agent programming structures.

## Contributions

*   **Prototype Implementation:** The paper introduces `astra-langchain4j`, a concrete tool that integrates LLMs into an established agent programming language, facilitating the use of generative AI within multi-agent systems.
*   **Cross-Generational Design Insights:** It provides a framework for understanding how decades of research in traditional Agent Toolkits can be leveraged to improve and stabilize the design of new, rapidly evolving Agentic AI platforms.
*   **Practical Evaluation:** Through three example implementations, the paper contributes a practical assessment of how LLMs impact traditional agent programming paradigms.

## Technical Details

The solution is implemented as the `astra-langchain4j` library within the ASTRA agent programming language.

### Architecture
*   **Foundation:** Built on top of the Java LangChain4J library.
*   **Extension:** Utilizes ASTRA's module system.
*   **Types:** Extends capabilities through five specific types:
    *   Sensors
    *   Actions
    *   Predicates
    *   Terms
    *   Events

### Key Mechanisms
*   **LLM Invocation:** Supports direct invocation with configurable parameters (e.g., API keys, temperature).
*   **Prompt Templating:** Uses `${<param>}` syntax managed by `AbstractTemplate` and `Templater` classes.
*   **Response Parsing:** Uses `inferBindings` to extract structured data from unstructured LLM responses.
*   **BeliefRAG:** A notable feature that mines the agent's belief base to supplement prompts automatically with relevant context.
*   **Configuration:** Supports multiple inheritance for configuration reuse and role-based agent configuration via system messages.

## Results

The paper validates the technical feasibility through three functional examples rather than quantitative benchmarks.

| Example | Functionality | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Joker" Agent** | Basic prompt templating and parameter binding. | Successfully generated a joke. |
| **"Happy" Agent** | Structured output parsing and constraint handling. | Successfully extracted "YES"/"NO" answers using `inferBindings`. |
| **Travel Planner** | Complex multi-agent coordination involving 1 Coordinator and 4 roles (Planner, Local, Language, Summary). | Successfully executed sequential steps to solve a multi-step task. |

**General Findings:**
*   Traditional Agent Toolkits like ASTRA can successfully encapsulate LLM interactions.
*   Traditional agent concepts (beliefs, plans, roles) provide a valuable structural framework for Agentic AI.
