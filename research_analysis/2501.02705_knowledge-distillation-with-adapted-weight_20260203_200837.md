## Executive Summary

Standard Knowledge Distillation (KD) processes typically treat all training samples as equally significant, a limitation that critically hinders model robustness when data is noisy or heterogeneous. This paper addresses the failure of traditional distillation methods to account for varying data quality, which often leads to sub-optimal generalization and performance degradation in student models. By ignoring the specific impact of individual data points, conventional approaches lack the necessary mechanisms to suppress harmful samples, creating a barrier to deploying reliable and interpretable compressed models.

The authors introduce the **Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Influence Weight (KD-AIF)** framework, which integrates influence functions derived from robust statistics into the Teacher-Student architecture. Technically, the method operates under an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) assumption, shifting the optimization focus from minimizing empirical training risk to minimizing validation risk. KD-AIF utilizes a first-order Taylor approximation to efficiently compute influence weights for individual data points. These weights dynamically modify the training objective by combining standard distillation loss with ground-truth loss, allowing the model to prioritize informative samples while actively suppressing those identified as noisy or harmful.

The KD-AIF framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing baselines on **CIFAR-100**, **CIFAR-10-4k**, **SVHN-1k**, and **GLUE**. The results indicate measurable improvements in accuracy and generalization, particularly in low-resource or noisy environments such as the 4k-subset CIFAR-10 and 1k-subset SVHN. Beyond raw performance, the method exhibits significant noise robustness and maintains high efficacy in both standard Knowledge Distillation and Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) tasks. Furthermore, the generated influence weights align with Rank Graduation Robustness standards, confirming that the model's ranking of sample importance remains stable and resilient to outliers.

This research advances the field of model compression by formally bridging the divide between high performance and interpretability. By making the specific influence of training data transparent, KD-AIF facilitates the deployment of Large Models that are not only efficient but also trustworthy. The work establishes a technical standard for sustainable AI deployment, offering a viable path to compress complex models without compromising the "black box" nature of their decision-making processes or their robustness against data irregularities.
