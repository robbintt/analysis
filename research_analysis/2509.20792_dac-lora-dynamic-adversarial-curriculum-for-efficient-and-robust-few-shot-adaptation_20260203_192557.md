## Executive Summary

This research addresses a critical security vulnerability in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly those utilizing CLIP backbones, when adapted using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA. While PEFT techniques enable efficient few-shot adaptation without the computational cost of full fine-tuning, they inadvertently leave models highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. This security gap poses a significant risk for real-world deployments, as malicious actors can exploit the adaptation phase to degrade model performance using imperceptible perturbations. The paper highlights that standard adaptation methods prioritize efficiency and clean accuracy but fail to maintain robustness against iterative adversarial threats, leaving the model exposed to catastrophic failure in hostile environments.

The authors introduce **DAC-LoRA (Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum LoRA)**, a framework that integrates adversarial training directly into the LoRA adaptation process. The key innovation is a "dynamic adversarial curriculum" that progressively increases the difficulty of attacks during training. This approach is grounded by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC), an optimization principle that ensures the model converges to a stable local minimum, thereby guaranteeing reliable robustness rather than oscillating performance. Utilizing a TRADES-inspired loss function, the method dynamically ramps up the average number of Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) iterations as training progresses. This curriculum-based approach forces the model to adapt to increasingly complex adversarial examples. Crucially, DAC-LoRA achieves this by only updating the low-rank decomposition matrices, ensuring the solution remains lightweight and does not require the heavy computational overhead associated with full fine-tuning.

Evaluated on Caltech101, DTD, Oxford Pets, and UCF101 in 4-shot and 16-shot settings, DAC-LoRA demonstrates a substantial improvement in robustness compared to standard LoRA, which typically suffers near-zero accuracy under adversarial pressure. DAC-LoRA maintains high clean accuracy (ranging from 65% to 95%) while significantly recovering robustness. However, the results reveal a nuanced trade-off: while increasing the shot count generally improves clean accuracy and robustness against weak attacks, it often degrades robustness against strong attacks. The significance of this work lies in its demonstration that robustness can be achieved without sacrificing the efficiency benefits of PEFT, offering a versatile strategy applicable to various iterative attack methods.

## Results

The study evaluated DAC-LoRA in a Few-Shot Learning setting (4-shot and 16-shot) across four datasets: **Caltech101**, **DTD**, **Oxford Pets**, and **UCF101**.

### Performance Overview
*   **Clean Accuracy:** Generally maintained between **65% and 95%**.
*   **Perturbation Impact:** Adversarial accuracy decreases as the perturbation budget increases ($\epsilon=2/255$ to $\epsilon=8/255$).
*   **Shot Count Trade-off:** Increasing the shot count generally improves Clean Accuracy and robustness against weak attacks but often degrades robustness against strong attacks ($\epsilon=8/255$).

### Specific Metrics
*   **Caltech101 (4-shot):**
    *   Clean Accuracy: **94.20%**
    *   Adversarial Accuracy ($\epsilon=8/255$): **65.27%**
*   **Oxford Pets (16-shot):**
    *   Adversarial Accuracy ($\epsilon=8/255$): Dropped to **21.50%**
*   **Most Challenging Dataset:** **DTD** proved to be the most difficult for the framework to maintain robustness.
