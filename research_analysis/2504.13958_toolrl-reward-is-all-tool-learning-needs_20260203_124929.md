## Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of effectively training Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR), where models must interact with external tools to solve complex queries. The authors identify that the current industry standard, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), is fundamentally limited for this task. SFT models tend to "overthink" and struggle to generalize to unfamiliar tools or complex scenarios due to a lack of robust feedback mechanisms. The paper posits that the critical bottleneck in tool learning is not model architecture or data volume, but rather the inadequacy of reward signals, which are often too coarse-grained to guide the model effectively through multi-step reasoning processes.

The key innovation is the introduction of a comprehensive Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework utilizing **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)** specifically designed for tool learning. Unlike standard RL approaches that rely on a critic model, GRPO employs a group-based evaluation strategy to optimize policy. The core technical contribution lies in a systematic "principled reward design" strategy that moves beyond simple success/failure signals. The authors rigorously explore reward engineering across four distinct dimensions: reward types, scales, granularity, and temporal dynamics. By providing fine-grained, feedback-driven rewards tailored to tool selection and application, the method enables the model to learn precise tool usage without requiring a critic model, offering a more scalable and stable training paradigm.

Empirically, the proposed RL approach demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines. Across the BFCL, Bamboogle, and API-Bank benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-7B model, the method achieved a **15% gain over standard SFT models** and a **17% improvement over base models**. Specifically, the hybrid SFT400+GRPO model achieved 58.38% accuracy on BFCL (compared to 52.98% for SFT4K), 72.00% on Bamboogle (compared to 60.00% for SFT4K), and 64.66% on API-Bank. Furthermore, cross-model validation on both Qwen2.5 and LLaMA3.2 confirmed that "GRPO Cold Start" strategies consistently yielded stable convergence, establishing that RL is significantly more data-efficient than simply scaling SFT training data.

This work significantly influences the field of tool learning by establishing that reward design is the primary lever for improving LLM performance in tool-use scenarios. It represents the first comprehensive study to systematically analyze reward strategies for tool selection and application within the RL paradigm. By demonstrating that RL with tailored rewards outperforms SFT in reasoning and generalization, the authors provide a clear roadmap for future research to move away from data-intensive SFT toward feedback-efficient RL. The release of all code and empirical findings validates the stability and scalability of this approach, providing a reproducible foundation for developing more capable and generalizable tool-using agents.

## Methodology

The authors utilize a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework** to train Large Language Models (LLMs) for tool use. They conducted a comprehensive study to systematically analyze a wide spectrum of reward strategies, focusing on four dimensions:

1.  Reward Types
