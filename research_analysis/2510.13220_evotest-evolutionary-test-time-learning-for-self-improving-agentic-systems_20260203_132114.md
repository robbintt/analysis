## Executive Summary

Current AI agentic systems face a fundamental limitation: they lack the capability to autonomously acquire complex skills within novel environments without pre-training or fine-tuning. This inability to learn "on the fly" restricts the utility of agents in dynamic, real-world scenarios where environments are unknown and constantly changing. Established adaptation methods, such as reflection-based mechanisms and reinforcement learning (RL), struggle to improve performance in these settings; specifically, these approaches fail to generalize well to unseen tasks or suffer from severe data inefficiency.

The authors introduce **EvoTest**, a gradient-free evolutionary framework designed for test-time learning that operates without modifying underlying model weights. Instead of relying on backpropagation, EvoTest evolves the agentic system's configuration using a cooperative dual-role architecture:
*   **Actor Agent:** Executes the primary task.
*   **Evolver Agent:** Analyzes episode transcripts to propose structural revisions.

The learnable configuration is defined as a tuple comprising policy prompts ($p$), deployment-time memory ($M$), hyperparameters ($h$), and tool-use routines ($u$). Through evolutionary operators—such as prompt mutation, memory updates, and tool refinement—and selection governed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, the system leverages rich narrative feedback to iteratively optimize its decision-making logic.

**Evaluations on the J-TTL benchmark demonstrate EvoTest's superior performance and data efficiency.** Crucially, EvoTest achieved a **100% win rate** in the complex 'Detective' and 'Library' games, whereas all reflection-based baselines (Reflexion, MemGPT, MemoryBank) failed completely with a **0% win rate**. Regarding the magnitude of improvement, EvoTest significantly outperformed competitors in total score; for example, in 'Zork1', EvoTest achieved an average score of approximately **35**, which is roughly **7x higher** than Reflexion's score of **5**. Furthermore, EvoTest demonstrated high sample efficiency, effectively converging to optimal strategies within fewer than **10 episodes**, while RL methods proved too slow and data-inefficient to achieve comparable results.

## Key Findings

*   **Critical Limitation in Current AI:** Existing AI agents cannot effectively learn complex skills on the fly in novel environments, significantly limiting their practical utility.
*   **Benchmark Shortcomings:** Established adaptation methods, including reflection and reinforcement learning, struggle to improve performance on the new Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark.
*   **Superior Performance:** EvoTest consistently outperforms strong baselines, including reflection-based and memory-only agents.
*   **Complex Task Mastery:** EvoTest is the only evaluated method capable of achieving victory in specific complex scenarios like the 'Detective' and 'Library' games.
*   **Method Failure:** Analysis shows that reflection methods failed to alter decision logic effectively, while RL was too slow and data-inefficient for these scenarios.

## Methodology

The research proposes **EvoTest**, an evolutionary test-time learning framework designed to function without gradients or fine-tuning. The core methodology relies on a cooperative two-agent design and an evolutionary approach to system configuration:

1.  **Dual-Role System:**
    *   **Actor Agent:** Responsible for executing the primary task within the environment.
    *   **Evolver Agent:** Analyzes episode transcripts to propose structural revisions and improvements.
2.  **Configuration Evolution:** Instead of updating model weights, the framework evolves the entire agentic system. This involves:
    *   Rewriting system prompts.
    *   Updating memory.
    *   Tuning hyperparameters.
    *   Learning tool-use routines.
3.  **Gradient-Free Operation:** The approach avoids backpropagation entirely, relying instead on evolutionary strategies to adapt the agent's behavior at test time.

## Technical Details

*   **Framework Type:** Gradient-free, evolutionary test-time learning (does not update model weights).
*   **Base Model:** Operates on a fixed backbone LLM.
*   **Architecture:** Cooperative two-agent design (Actor Agent + Evolver Agent).
*   **Learnable Configuration:** Represented as a tuple $\theta = (p, M, h, u)$:
    *   $p$: Policy prompt.
    *   $M$: Deployment-time memory (success/failure logs).
    *   $h$: Hyperparameters (temperature/exploration settings).
    *   $u$: Tool-use routines (memory interaction/state abstraction).
*   **Update Mechanism:** Utilizes evolutionary operators including:
    *   Prompt mutation.
    *   Memory update.
    *   Hyperparameter tuning.
    *   Tool-use refinement.
*   **Selection Strategy:** Upper Confidence Bound (UCB).
*   **Feedback Loop:** Leverages rich narrative feedback rather than sparse rewards.

## Results

Evaluations were conducted on the **J-TTL (Jericho Test-Time Learning) benchmark**, utilizing text-based games modeled as POMDPs (Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes), including *Detective*, *Library*, *Zork1*, *Zork3*, *Balances*, and *Temple*.

**Protocol:**
*   $K$ consecutive episodes resetting to the same initial state.
*   Step limit of 110 per episode.
*   Primary metric: Total Score (Return) per episode.

**Outcomes:**
*   **vs. Reflection/Memory Agents:** EvoTest consistently outperformed baselines like Reflexion, MemGPT, and MemoryBank.
*   **vs. Reinforcement Learning:** RL methods were found to be too slow and data-inefficient compared to EvoTest.
*   **Unique Achievement:** EvoTest was the sole method to achieve victory in 'Detective' and 'Library' games.

## Contributions

*   **J-TTL Benchmark:** Introduction of the Jericho Test-Time Learning Benchmark to measure progress in test-time learning capabilities.
*   **EvoTest Framework:** Development of a gradient-free self-improvement framework that evolves system configurations rather than relying on backpropagation.
*   **Empirical Validation:** Demonstrated the limitations of current state-of-the-art methods (Reflection, RL) and established EvoTest as the new state-of-the-art solution for continuous on-the-fly adaptation.
