## 📑 Executive Summary

**Problem: The Feasibility Crisis of Native Language Models**
This paper confronts the data scarcity barrier threatening the European Union's goal of Digital Language Equality (DLE) by 2030. The authors demonstrate that the massive data requirements for training native Large Language Models (LLMs) render the development of distinct models for every European language technically and economically unfeasible, particularly for the 60+ regional and minority languages currently lacking sufficient pre-training corpora. The study estimates that **21 European languages are at immediate risk of digital extinction** if technological support is dependent on monolingual solutions, creating an urgent need for alternative pathways to support these under-resourced linguistic groups.

**Innovation: The "Technological Off-Ramp" and MLLM Architectures**
The core innovation is a proposed "technological off-ramp" strategy that positions Multilingual LLMs (MLLMs) as a viable substitute for unattainable native models. Technically, this approach relies on cross-lingual generalization and zero-shot transfer learning, allowing models trained on high-resource languages to process low-resource languages with minimal specific training data. The authors provide a granular analysis of specific architectures, contrasting generalist models like **Llama** (focused on 8 languages) and **Gemma 2** (predominantly English) with European initiatives such as **EuroLLM**, **Salamandra**, and **Teuken-7B** (all covering EU-24 languages plus others), as well as **BLOOM** and **Mistral Nemo**. The analysis further delineates model architectures from supporting infrastructure, identifying the **Common European Language Data Space (LDS)** as the necessary decentralized foundation for data sovereignty and lineage tracking.

**Results: Qualitative Assessment of Cross-Lingual Capabilities**
Rather than presenting new experimental benchmarks, this analytical review synthesizes qualitative evidence to assess model performance. The analysis indicates that models such as **Llama** and **Gemma 2** retain strong capabilities in low-resource languages—including Romanian, Slovenian, Slovakian, and Latvian—even when trained predominantly on English data. Furthermore, the review finds that models trained on more linguistically balanced datasets can compete effectively with those heavily skewed toward English, with European initiatives like **BLOOM** and **Mistral Nemo** demonstrating consistent performance across the 24 official EU languages. These findings confirm that MLLMs can outperform the hypothetical potential of monolingual models trained on under-resourced data.

**Impact: Redefining the Pathway to Digital Language Equality**
This research significantly influences European Language Technology by validating the "off-ramp" strategy as the only practical pathway to achieving the 2030 DLE goals. By confirming that MLLMs can effectively support under-resourced languages where native development is impossible, the study shifts the strategic focus from monolingual solutions to optimized multilingual approaches. The paper serves as a critical call to action for the systematic adoption of these models, while explicitly identifying open questions regarding data infrastructure implementation that must be resolved to transition this strategy from theoretical validation to widespread practice.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Data Resource Constraints:** Large Language Models (LLMs) require vast pre-training data, making the creation of native LLMs for under-resourced languages technically impossible.
*   **Retention of Capabilities:** Multilingual LLMs retain strong capabilities for under-resourced languages even when trained on minority amounts of data specific to those languages.
*   **The "Off-Ramp" Solution:** Multilingual LLMs offer a 'technological off-ramp', providing a viable and necessary pathway for languages that cannot support their own native models.
*   **Implementation Challenges:** While the theory is sound, the systematic application of this approach currently faces unresolved open questions that must be addressed.
