## Executive Summary

This research addresses the persistent challenge of evaluating the quality of machine learning explanations (XML). Current evaluation metrics often fail to capture the perceived usefulness of an explanation to a human user, while accurate human-in-the-loop studies are resource-intensive and difficult to scale. This problem is critical because robust, human-aligned evaluation methods are essential for the development of trustworthy, interpretable AI systems that can be effectively deployed in high-stakes environments.

The core innovation proposed is the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as automated judges for explanation quality. Technically, the study utilizes Transformer-based architectures with multi-headed self-attention—specifically GPT-4o and Mistral-7.2B—to evaluate explanations generated by standard methods such as LIME and Similarity-based techniques. Conducted as a forward simulation on the Iris classification task, the study incorporates a "no-explanation" baseline and compares the evaluations of 38 participants, comprising both LLM instances and human judges, within a Human-grounded evaluation framework.

The study evaluates performance using a dual-metric approach: objective Accuracy scores and subjective 5-point Likert scales across five specific statements regarding explanation quality. The primary experimental outcome involves a correlation analysis between the LLM-based judges (GPT-4o and Mistral-7.2B) and the human judges. This analysis determines the degree of alignment between automated and human assessments, providing specific data on how well different LLMs can mimic human evaluation patterns for the Iris classification task.

The significance of this work lies in its potential to streamline the validation of Explainable AI (XAI) systems by replacing costly manual user studies with scalable LLM-based evaluation. By demonstrating that models like GPT-4o and Mistral-7.2B can correlate with human judgment, the research provides a pathway for more efficient, large-scale assessment of XML methods. This shift could significantly lower the barriers to validating interpretable models, ensuring that future AI systems are assessed for human-centric utility without the prohibitive logistical costs of traditional user studies.
