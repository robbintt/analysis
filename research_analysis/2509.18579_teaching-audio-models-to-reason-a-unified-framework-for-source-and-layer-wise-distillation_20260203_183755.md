## Executive Summary

Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) currently face a critical "modality gap" that prevents them from performing complex reasoning tasks. While proficient at transcription, these models struggle to bridge raw audio signals with the symbolic logic required for high-level inference. This limitation restricts LALMs to simple recognition tasks, hindering the development of voice-driven systems capable of deep contextual understanding or automated cognitive analysis. Addressing this deficit is essential for evolving audio AI from passive transcribers into active, reasoning-capable assistants.

The researchers introduce a **Unified Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework** designed to transfer reasoning capabilities from advanced textual teacher models to audio student models. The core technical contribution is a dual-dimensional distillation strategy: **Source-wise distillation** employs both textual and acoustic teachers to provide modality-specific supervision, while **Layer-wise distillation** aligns the internal hidden states of the teachers with the corresponding layers of the student model. This hierarchical integration allows the audio student to learn structured intermediate representations, effectively mapping symbolic reasoning onto acoustic signal processing without discarding phonetic information.

Experimental evaluations on the AirBench benchmark demonstrated that the framework significantly enhances reasoning performance. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of **57.1%** on complex reasoning tasks, outperforming the baseline student model by **3.5%**. Crucially, this cognitive improvement did not degrade acoustic competence; the model maintained a competitive Word Error Rate (WER), confirming that the distillation process successfully decoupled reasoning gains from fundamental speech recognition capabilities.

This research establishes a viable pathway for transforming Large Audio Language Models from transcription tools into reasoning engines. By proving that complex symbolic logic can be effectively induced in audio models via structured knowledge transfer, the framework offers a more efficient alternative to training LALMs from scratch. This work sets a new precedent for cross-modal knowledge distillation, potentially reducing the computational cost of developing intelligent voice systems and accelerating their deployment in high-stakes environments requiring nuanced auditory comprehension.

## Methodology

The researchers propose a **Unified Knowledge Distillation Framework** designed to transfer reasoning capabilities from a textual teacher to an audio student model. The methodology relies on a sophisticated dual-dimensional strategy:

1.  **Source-wise Distillation:** This component utilizes both textual and acoustic teachers to provide modality-specific supervision, ensuring the student model learns from distinct but complementary sources.
2.  **Layer-wise Distillation:** This technique aligns teacher signals with the appropriate layers of the student model, facilitating hierarchical integration of knowledge throughout the network's depth.
