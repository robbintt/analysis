## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental instability and non-convergence issues associated with current momentum-based adversarial attack methods, most notably MI-FGSM. While momentum is widely employed to enhance adversarial transferability—the ability of an attack to generalize from a surrogate model to an unknown target model—existing implementations suffer from theoretical limitations regarding optimization stability. Specifically, the authors identify that standard methods like PGD and MI-FGSM rely heavily on sign-function scaling and fixed step-size strategies derived solely from the current gradient, leading to unreliable convergence. This instability limits the effectiveness of black-box attacks, making it critical to develop an optimization framework that ensures both robust attack generation and theoretical convergence.

The paper introduces **AdaMI** (Adaptive Momentum-based Iterative attack), a novel algorithm that fundamentally reformulates the generation of adversarial examples as a convex optimization problem linked to first-order adaptive optimizers like AdaGrad. The key technical innovation is the replacement of the standard sign function with a "momentum-based adaptive matrix" to scale perturbations. Unlike AdaGrad, which uses the square of the gradient, AdaMI calculates the adaptive matrix using the square of the momentum vector. The algorithm updates the adversarial example using this matrix to normalize the step size, coupled with a time-varying step size ($\alpha_t = \alpha / \sqrt{t}$). This approach theoretically guarantees optimal convergence for convex problems with a regret bound of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, resolving the stability issues prevalent in previous methods.

Experimental evaluation on the CTSRD and ImageNet datasets demonstrates that AdaMI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines—including MI-FGSM, NI, and VMI—by enhancing both transferability and stability. In tests on the CTSRD dataset (transfer from ResNet34 to VGG16), AdaMI increased the attack success rate from **23.9% to 32.3%**. Similar significant gains were observed on ImageNet; for example, when attacking VGG16, the success rate improved from **47.2% to 51.5%**, and against the Swin Transformer architecture, it rose from **25.9% to 28.0%**. These results confirm that the proposed adaptive technique provides superior performance across both CNN and Transformer architectures without compromising the imperceptibility of the perturbations.

The significance of this work lies in its successful bridging of theoretical optimization principles with practical adversarial attack strategies. By establishing the mathematical equivalence between PGD, Projected Gradient, and AdaGrad, and subsequently extending this to a momentum-based context, the authors provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for analyzing attack mechanisms. The introduction of the momentum-based adaptive matrix serves as a versatile, generalizable technique that advances the state-of-the-art in black-box attacks, offering researchers a more stable and mathematically sound tool for evaluating the robustness of deep neural networks.
