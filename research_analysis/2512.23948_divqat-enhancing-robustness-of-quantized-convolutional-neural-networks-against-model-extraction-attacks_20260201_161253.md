## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical vulnerability of quantized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to model extraction attacks, a pressing security concern in edge computing environments where resource constraints often render standard defense mechanisms infeasible. While quantization is essential for deploying models on IoT and mobile devices, it creates unique security gaps; conventional post-processing defenses, such as inference-time noise injection, impose computational latency that often exceeds the capabilities of edge hardware. The paper highlights a significant gap in the literature regarding the robustness of quantized models against sophisticated extraction strategies, motivating the need for a solution that protects intellectual property without sacrificing the operational efficiency required in resource-constrained settings.

The authors propose **DivQAT (Divergence Quantization Aware Training)**, a novel training algorithm that integrates defense directly into the quantization process during the training phase, rather than treating security as a post-processing step. Technically, DivQAT utilizes a dual-model setup consisting of a frozen non-quantized "teacher" model and a quantized "student" model initialized from the teacher's weights. The core innovation is a composite loss function defined as $L_{total} = L_{CE} - \alpha \cdot D_{KL}$, where Cross-Entropy ($L_{CE}$) preserves the student's task accuracy, and the minimization of the negative Kullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) actively maximizes the output divergence between the student and teacher. This approach forces the quantized model to maintain high utility for legitimate users while generating a misleading output distribution that disrupts the gradient updates used by attackers during extraction.

DivQAT represents a significant advancement in secure AI deployment by establishing a novel technique to modify the quantization process explicitly for model extraction defense. By addressing the limitations of previous approaches—specifically high computational costs, unrealistic assumptions about victim models, and incompatibility with quantized hardware—DivQAT resolves the traditional trade-off between robustness and resource efficiency. This capability enables the secure deployment of proprietary algorithms on edge devices, ensuring that model confidentiality is maintained for Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile platforms without compromising inference speed or accuracy.

*   **Composability:** Combining DivQAT with other existing defense mechanisms yields improved effectiveness compared to traditional Quantization Aware Training (QAT).
*   **Edge Efficiency:** Unlike previous computationally expensive defenses, DivQAT addresses the constraints of edge device implementations by integrating defense mechanisms during the design phase rather than as a post-processing step.
