## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the sample complexity inefficiencies inherent in the **Multi-Distribution Learning (MDL)** framework, a setting within pure-exploration multi-armed bandits focused on learning decision rules that perform well across distinct data distributions. The core problem is that traditional distribution-independent bounds rely on worst-case assumptions, resulting in pessimistic guarantees that ignore the specific structure of the data environment, such as suboptimality gaps and variance. This leads to inefficient uniform sampling strategies that fail to capitalize on the characteristics of dynamic or shifting data distributions. The research is driven by the need to move beyond these loose bounds and establish a theoretical foundation for optimized, non-uniform sample allocation that adapts to the underlying difficulty of the learning task.

The key innovation is the derivation of distribution-dependent, non-asymptotic regret bounds, achieved by applying empirical process theory—including Rademacher complexity, McDiarmid's Inequality, and Empirical Bernstein Inequality—to the MDL setting. The authors introduce the **LCB-DR** (Lower Confidence Bound for Distributionally Robust) algorithm, which adapts the "optimism in the face of uncertainty" principle to distributionally robust optimization. Unlike standard pessimistic robust approaches, LCB-DR operates by selecting the decision rule with the lowest Lower Confidence Bound on risk. By treating the unknown risk as the most favorable value within the confidence interval, the algorithm optimistically explores decisions that could potentially be optimal, effectively bridging the gap between robust risk minimization and adaptive exploration.

The results provide specific quantitative improvements over distribution-independent baselines. The authors demonstrate that the proposed strategies achieve regret scaling inversely with the suboptimality gap $\Delta$—specifically, approaching rates of $\tilde{O}(1/\Delta)$—and exhibit a variance-dependent scaling of roughly $\tilde{O}(\sigma^2/\Delta^2)$. This represents a significant improvement over uniform allocation, where regret scales purely with the number of distributions. Synthetic experiments validate these non-asymptotic guarantees, showing that the adaptive LCB-DR and Modified UCB-E algorithms significantly outperform non-adaptive strategies. These findings confirm that dynamic, uncertainty-aware allocation leads to lower cumulative regret in finite-sample regimes.
