## Executive Summary

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the standard paradigm for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet this process relies heavily on the assumption that human evaluators provide consistent and accurate ground truth signals. This paper addresses a critical vulnerability in this pipeline: the impact of evaluator cognitive limitations, specifically rationality, on the stability of AI alignment. The authors argue that without governance controls, variability in human cognitive capacity can introduce significant noise and bias into reinforcement signals, leading to unstable model training and misalignment with expert standards.

The core innovation is a proposed **"governance overlay"** for the standard three-stage RLHF pipeline (Feedback Collection, Reward Modeling, and Policy Optimization). Technically, the authors introduce a framework that treats evaluator cognitive capacity as a quantifiable risk metric. This framework involves pre-screening evaluators using a 20-item rationality test, systematically auditing feedback for consistency, and implementing reliability-weighted reinforcement aggregation during training. By categorizing evaluators into "high-rationality" and "low-rationality" groups based on these psychometric metrics, the system can filter or weight feedback to optimize the quality of the supervision signal.

In a controlled experiment involving 10 degree-holding participants evaluating GPT-4 generated responses, the study measured performance using Test-Retest Consistency Score (TRCS) and Bias Deviation (BD). The results demonstrated a statistically significant correlation ($p < 0.01$) between cognitive capacity and reinforcement signal stability. High-rationality evaluators generated feedback that was significantly more consistent and closely aligned with expert ground truth (established by a psychology Ph.D. student), displaying high TRCS and low BD. Conversely, low-rationality evaluators exhibited considerable variability in their decisions and higher divergence from expert standards, confirming that lower rationality scores directly degrade the reliability of the feedback loop.

This research highlights an essential **"governance risk"** in current AI deployment practices, shifting the focus from simply collecting more human data to ensuring the psychological quality of the human supervisors. By validating that evaluator rationality is a predictor of RLHF stability, the authors provide a roadmap for creating more robust, fair, and transparent alignment systems. The proposed mitigation strategies—pre-screening and reliability-weighted aggregation—offer an immediate path for practitioners to reduce label noise and improve model governance.

## Key Findings

*   **Evaluator Consistency:** Evaluators with higher rationality scores generate feedback that is significantly more consistent and aligned with expert standards.
*   **Decision Variability:** Evaluators with lower rationality scores exhibit considerable variability in their reinforcement decisions.
*   **Statistical Significance:** The observed differences in consistency and alignment are supported by statistical significance ($p < 0.01$).
*   **Cognitive Correlation:** The cognitive capacity of evaluators (specifically their level of rationality) directly correlates with the stability of the reinforcement signals within the RLHF process.

## Methodology

The study utilized a **controlled experiment design** that categorized participants into two distinct groups based on cognitive capacity:
*   **High-Rationality Group**
*   **Low-Rationality Group**

The researchers compared the reinforcement decisions and feedback outputs of these two groups to measure consistency levels and alignment with expert feedback.

## Technical Details

**Proposed Framework**
The paper proposes a **governance overlay** for the standard three-stage RLHF pipeline:
1.  Feedback Collection
2.  Reward Modeling
3.  Policy Optimization

**Governance Components**
*   **Evaluator Pre-screening:** Based on cognitive capacity (rationality).
*   **Auditing:** Systematic auditing of feedback consistency.
*   **Reliability-Weighted Aggregation:** Using reliability weights for reinforcement signals.

**Experimental Setup**
*   **Model:** GPT-4 with default parameters.
*   **Datasets:**
    *   25 multi-choice rationality questions.
    *   25 generated questions.
*   **Participants:** 10 degree-holding participants stratified by a 20-item rationality test.
*   **Ground Truth:** Established by a psychology Ph.D. student.

## Results

To quantify performance, the study introduced two specific metrics:

*   **Test-Retest Consistency Score (TRCS):** Used to measure decision stability.
*   **Bias Deviation (BD):** Used to measure divergence from expert ground truth.

**Outcomes:**
*   **High Rationality Evaluators:** Showed significantly higher TRCS and lower BD.
*   **Low Rationality Evaluators:** Exhibited considerable variability and higher divergence.
*   **Correlation:** The relationship between cognitive capacity and reinforcement signal stability was statistically significant ($p < 0.01$).

## Contributions

*   **Identification of Governance Risks:** Highlighting the specific impact of evaluator cognitive limitations (rationality) on the reliability of AI alignment pipelines.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Proposing specific governance interventions, including evaluator pre-screening, systematic auditing, and reliability-weighted reinforcement aggregation.
*   **Pipeline Improvement:** Establishing a framework for enhancing the fairness, transparency, and robustness of RLHF systems.
