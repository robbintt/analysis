## Executive Summary

Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for specialized tasks traditionally requires costly retraining and access to massive proprietary datasets. While model merging offers a compelling alternative—synthesizing multiple expert models into a single unified model without raw data or significant retraining—the field suffers from severe fragmentation. With techniques spread across more than ten machine learning subdomains, a lack of standardized taxonomy has hindered the adoption and systemic improvement of these methods. This paper addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive review to consolidate the literature, clarifying how disparate merging techniques relate to one another and establishing a unified theoretical framework for the field.

The paper’s core contribution is a novel taxonomic framework that categorizes the merging process into **Pre-Merging** and **During Merging** stages. Pre-merging focuses on preparing models for compatibility—such as aligning weight basins or transforming architectures—while During Merging strategies are classified by how they resolve parameter interference. Rather than simply listing acronyms, the survey distinguishes methods by their approach to conflict resolution: Basic Merging utilizes task vectors for arithmetic operations; Subspace-based methods (e.g., Ties-Merging) prune irrelevant parameters; and Optimization-based methods use gradient updates to minimize loss. This structure reframes the problem from simple weight averaging to the geometric manipulation of model parameters, establishing Task Vectors as a fundamental component for enabling complex capabilities like analogical reasoning and targeted forgetting.

The survey’s comparative analysis highlights critical performance trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. A key operational finding is that successful merging consistently compresses multi-expert knowledge into a **$1\times$ parameter model**, maintaining inference efficiency without bloat. However, performance varies significantly by methodology: naive weight averaging is shown to be generally inadequate due to parameter interference, whereas Task Arithmetic remains highly effective for multi-task learning. The results further distinguish methods by resource intensity; Tuning-Free approaches (e.g., Ties-Merging) offer the highest efficiency by requiring no gradient updates and often operating without data, while Training-Based methods (e.g., AdaMerging) achieve robustness at the cost of additional optimization cycles and labeled data dependency.

By mapping the application of merging techniques across LLMs, MLLMs, continual learning, and few-shot learning, this paper provides a roadmap that transforms model merging from a set of isolated tricks into a standardized discipline. The establishment of a clear taxonomy and the release of a curated open-source repository of papers and theories accelerate the adoption of merging as a viable, resource-efficient strategy for model empowerment. Ultimately, this work guides future research toward addressing the remaining challenges in interference management, promoting a shift away from expensive retraining toward more sustainable, composition-based AI development.

## Technical Details

The paper establishes a technical framework for merging parameters $\{\Theta^{(1)}, ..., \Theta^{(T)}\}$ from $T$ expert models into a single set $\Theta_{merge}$ without accessing original training data.

### Categorization Strategy

#### 1. Pre-Merging Methods
Focus on preparing models for compatibility before the merge process.
*   **Merger-Friendly Fine-Tuning:** Aims for weight disentanglement via linearization along the tangent space or sharpness-aware minimization (e.g., SAFT-Merge).
*   **Architecture Transformation:** Converts heterogeneous architectures into homogeneous ones to allow merging.
*   **Weight Re-basin/Alignment:** Aligns weight spaces to facilitate optimal merging.

#### 2. During Merging Strategies
Focus on the actual mathematical operation of combining weights.
*   **Basic Merging:**
    *   *Simple Averaging:* Often found to be ineffective due to interference.
    *   *Task Arithmetic:* Utilizes task vectors $\tau_t = \Theta^{(t)} - \Theta^{(0)}$ for multi-task learning, forgetting, and analogies.
*   **Weighted-based Merging:** Uses metrics to determine the importance of weights (e.g., Fisher-Merging, RegMean).
*   **Subspace-based Merging:**
    *   *Sparse Methods:* Prunes irrelevant parameters (e.g., Ties-Merging, DARE).
    *   *Low-Rank Methods:* Decomposes weights for efficient merging (e.g., HO-GSVD).
*   **Optimization-based Merging:** Uses data-free optimization to minimize loss (e.g., AWD).
*   **Routing-based Merging:** Dynamically selects parameters or experts during inference.
