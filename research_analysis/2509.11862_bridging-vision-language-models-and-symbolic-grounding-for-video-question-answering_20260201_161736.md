> ## 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve remarkable success in surface-level visual recognition but encounter significant limitations in Video Question Answering (VQA) when tasked with deep semantic reasoning or precise temporal grounding. These models typically rely on shallow statistical correlations rather than robust causal logic, rendering them ineffective at answering complex "why" and "how" questions that require an understanding of event dynamics. This deficiency is a critical barrier to the deployment of VLMs in dynamic, real-world environments where interpretability and accurate temporal localization are essential.
>
> To address these challenges, the researchers introduce **SG-VLM**, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that integrates Symbolic Scene Graphs (SGs) as intermediate grounding signals to bridge the gap between deep learning and symbolic AI. The methodology extracts structured object-relation representations from raw video data and fuses them with frozen VLM backbones—specifically QwenVL and InternVL—via a sophisticated prompting mechanism and visual localization techniques. Crucially, this approach preserves the generalization capabilities of the pre-trained VLMs by keeping their weights fixed while significantly enhancing their reasoning pipeline with explicit, interpretable symbolic structure.
>
> SG-VLM was rigorously evaluated across three standard benchmarks—**NExT-QA**, **ActivityNet-QA**, and **iVQA**—delivering statistically significant gains over baselines. The data highlights a diminishing return phenomenon, where the weaker QwenVL model sees more substantial relative improvements compared to the more powerful InternVL, indicating that performance gains saturate as the sophistication of the base model increases.
>
> This work provides crucial empirical grounding for the neuro-symbolic AI paradigm, demonstrating that explicit symbolic structure effectively mitigates temporal and causal reasoning deficits inherent in deep learning models. Ultimately, SG-VLM establishes a viable, interpretable path toward more reliable video understanding systems that combine the perceptual power of VLMs with the logical precision of symbolic AI.

*   **Efficacy of Symbolic Integration:** Integrating symbolic scene graphs (SGs) as intermediate grounding signals successfully improves VQA performance, particularly in causal and temporal reasoning tasks.
*   **Benchmark Superiority:** The proposed SG-VLM framework outperforms prior baselines across multiple benchmarks, including **NExT-QA**, **iVQA**, and **ActivityNet-QA**.
*   **Diminishing Returns:** The method shows constrained performance gains when applied to strong state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, highlighting a ceiling effect in current symbolic integration techniques when applied to highly capable models.
