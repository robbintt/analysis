## 📋 Executive Summary

> **Current approaches to AI-assisted design are hindered by a critical gap between abstract conceptual inputs (such as sketches or text) and the precise, parametric engineering models required for industrial manufacturing.**

This paper addresses the challenge of automating the translation of multimodal inputs into fully parametric, code-based CAD models using the CadQuery Python library. The key innovation is a **Vision Language Model (VLM)-based Multi-Agent System (MAS)** that replicates the structure of an industrial product development team operating within the V-model framework.

Technically, the system deploys three specialized LLM-based agents:
*   **RequirementsEngineer:** Parses user inputs and manages specifications.
*   **CadEngineer:** Formulates construction plans and writes code.
*   **QualityAssuranceEngineer:** Performs visual verification to ensure geometric compliance.

The architecture features a dual-loop feedback mechanism: an **inner loop** facilitates automated correction between the CadEngineer and QualityAssuranceEngineer to refine code, while an **outer loop** enables collaborative validation between the RequirementsEngineer and the user. The system demonstrated robust performance in end-to-end generation tasks, successfully creating parametric CAD models from multimodal inputs without manual intervention.

This research represents a significant paradigm shift from static 3D mesh generation to dynamic, parametric engineering workflows, setting a new precedent for Human-AI collaboration in complex technical automation.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Industrial Mimicry:** The proposed VLM-based Multi-Agent System successfully mirrors industrial team structures by delegating tasks to specialized agents (requirements, CAD engineering, and QA).
*   **Automated Generation:** The system enables the automatic generation of parametric CAD models directly from sketches and/or textual descriptions.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** An iterative validation loop allows for collaborative refinement of the generated models between the system and the user.
*   **Architectural Validation:** Ablation studies confirm that the specific architectural components of the system provide distinct benefits to the overall design process.
*   **Broad Utility:** The approach demonstrates potential to enhance design effectiveness for both industrial experts and hobbyists.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The researchers developed a Multi-Agent System based on Vision Language Models (VLM) designed to replicate a human engineering team. The methodology is characterized by the following phases and tools:

1.  **Specialized Agents:** The system utilizes distinct agents for three specific phases:
    *   Requirements Engineering
    *   CAD Engineering
    *   Vision-based Quality Assurance
2.  **External Resources:** Agents are provided with access to external resources, specifically parametric CAD tooling and technical tool documentation.
3.  **Process Workflow:**
    *   **Input:** Multimodal inputs (sketches or text).
    *   **Generation:** Automatic generation of a model.
    *   **Refinement:** A user-in-the-loop iterative process for final adjustments.
