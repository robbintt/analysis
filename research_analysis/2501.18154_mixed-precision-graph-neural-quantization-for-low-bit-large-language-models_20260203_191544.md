## Executive Summary

The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments is severely hindered by their massive computational and memory requirements. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is the standard technique for mitigating these constraints by reducing the bit-width of model weights. However, existing PTQ strategies face a critical performance cliff when operating at extremely low bit-widths (below 3 bits), where significant accuracy degradation occurs.

This paper addresses the challenge of maintaining high inference quality in LLMs under these aggressive compression scenarios, a necessity for enabling advanced AI on edge and mobile devices. The authors introduce **Mixed-Precision Graph Neural PTQ (MG-PTQ)**, a novel framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into the quantization process.

Unlike traditional methods that treat weights in isolation, MG-PTQ utilizes a GNN module to model dependencies and relationships between different weights within the model. By leveraging GNN information propagation, the system captures the interdependence of parameters to accurately assess weight importance. This analysis drives an adaptive bit-width allocation mechanism, allowing the framework to dynamically assign optimal quantization strategies—allocating higher precision where necessary and lower precision where it is safe—thereby minimizing overall quantization error.

Extensive experiments conducted on the WikiText2 and C4 datasets validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that MG-PTQ establishes new state-of-the-art benchmarks for low-bit quantization. Specifically, the method consistently outperforms the previous leading PTQ method, GPTQ, under low-bit conditions (less than 3 bits). The experiments confirm that MG-PTQ successfully resolves the performance limitations typical of existing strategies, maintaining superior model stability and accuracy even when operating at these extreme compression levels.

This research significantly advances the field of model compression by providing a viable pathway to deploy high-performance LLMs on hardware with strict resource limitations. By solving the "sub-3-bit" quantization problem, MG-PTQ allows developers to drastically reduce model size and memory bandwidth without the substantial performance drop that currently hinders edge deployment. The introduction of graph-based dependency modeling represents a paradigm shift in PTQ, moving the field toward more intelligent, mixed-precision allocation strategies that preserve the semantic richness of LLMs while maximizing hardware efficiency.
