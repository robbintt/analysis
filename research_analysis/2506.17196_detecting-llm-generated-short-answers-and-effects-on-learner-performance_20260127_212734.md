## Executive Summary

The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into higher education poses a significant threat to academic integrity, particularly regarding the detection of AI-generated content in formative assessments. General-purpose AI detectors are notoriously unreliable when analyzing short-answer responses (under 100 words), a format commonly used to gauge student understanding. This paper addresses the critical gap in accurate text classification for low-stakes, short-form content and investigates the broader pedagogical implications of LLM misuse, specifically examining how reliance on these tools correlates with learner performance on subsequent assessments.

The study introduces a detection framework architected around a fine-tuned GPT-4o model, specifically optimized to distinguish between human-written and GPT-4o-generated text. Technically, the approach employs a multimodal architecture that incorporates auxiliary behavioral indicators, including assessment scores, readability metrics, and response duration. This enriches the feature set used for classification, allowing the model to detect subtle patterns indicative of AI usage. The system was trained and evaluated on a rigorous dataset of approximately 1,635 responses from 534 college students, annotated via a strict codebook that defines LLM text as content produced without paraphrasing.

The fine-tuned GPT-4o model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 0.78. This represents a statistically significant improvement over the primary baseline, GPTZero, which achieved only 70% accuracy and a Macro F1 score of 0.50. Crucially, the proposed model achieved a lower False Positive Rate (FPR) than existing baselines, a critical metric for minimizing the unfair penalization of human students. In addition to detection efficacy, the analysis revealed a tangible impact on learning outcomes: learners suspected of LLM misuse were more than twice as likely to answer corresponding post-assessment questions correctly compared to those who did not misuse LLMs.

These findings hold substantial significance for the field of learning engineering and educational technology. By validating that transformer-based models, when augmented with behavioral data, can reliably detect AI involvement in short answers, the authors provide a technical path forward for institutions seeking to uphold assessment integrity. Furthermore, the statistically significant correlation between LLM use and higher post-test scores challenges educators to rethink assessment design, as it suggests that AI tools may currently boost short-term performance metrics, potentially masking gaps in genuine knowledge retention.

## Key Findings

*   **Superior Detection Rates:** The fine-tuned GPT-4o model significantly outperforms standard general-purpose detectors, specifically GPTZero, in the context of short educational texts.
*   **Performance Correlation:** There is a strong positive correlation between LLM misuse and immediate assessment performance; students flagged for AI usage were more than twice as likely to answer posttest questions correctly.
*   **Reliability in Short Texts:** The study successfully addresses the "low-stakes" detection gap, proving that reliable classification is possible even with texts under 100 words when using auxiliary behavioral data.
*   **Reduction in False Positives:** The proposed model achieves a lower False Positive Rate than baselines, mitigating the risk of unfairly accusing students who write legitimately.
