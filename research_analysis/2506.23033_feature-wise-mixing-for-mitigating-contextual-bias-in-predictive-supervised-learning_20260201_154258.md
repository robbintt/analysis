## 📑 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of **contextual bias** in predictive supervised learning, where model performance deteriorates due to underlying distributional shifts across varying demographics or environments. The authors propose a novel "feature-wise mixing" framework designed to mitigate bias at the representational level without requiring prior knowledge of sensitive attributes.

Technically, the method expands data frequency and integrates socio-economic distributions from multiple regions (Kolkata, Colombo, Mombasa) using specific scaling coefficients and noise injection ($x'_i = x_i + \epsilon_i$). By redistributing feature representations, the framework ensures equal contribution from diverse regions.

Experimental validation across SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest classifiers demonstrated an **overall average bias reduction of 43.35%**, with Random Forest leading at 46.68%. Crucially, the method achieved a statistically significant decrease in Mean Squared Error (MSE), proving that predictive performance improves alongside fairness. It consistently outperformed SMOTE and remained competitive with complex reweighting methods, offering a scalable, simplified preprocessing workflow that decouples fairness correction from heavy computational burdens.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Data Augmentation Strategy
*   **Expansion:** Monthly data (765 points) expanded to daily frequency (23,000 observations), representing a **~31x expansion**.
*   **Technique:** Utilized Gaussian noise injection: $$x'_i = x_i + \epsilon_i$$
*   **Validation:** Distribution fidelity was preserved via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test ($D = 0.032, p > 0.05$).

### Feature-Wise Mixing Framework
*   **Integration:** Combines socio-economic distributions from three regions ($D^{\text{aug}}_r$).
*   **Formula:** Implemented using the mixing equation:
    $$D_{\text{mix}} = \bigcup_{r=1}^{3} \alpha_r D^{\text{aug}}_r$$
*   **Mechanism:** Ensures equal regional contribution via scaling coefficients ($\alpha_r$) without requiring explicit bias attribute identification.

### Experimental Setup
*   **Split:** 80/20 train-test split.
*   **Validation:** 10-fold cross-validation with error bars at $2 \times \text{SEM}$.
*   **Classifiers:** SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   Predictive Performance: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
    *   Fairness Metric: Bias Reduction Metric ($\Delta_{\text{bias}}$):
        $$\Delta_{\text{bias}} = \frac{MSE_{D_r} - MSE_{D_{\text{mix}}}}{MSE_{D_r}} \times 100$$
