### Executive Summary

Training neural networks on data corrupted by feature noise is a pervasive challenge that significantly degrades model reliability, particularly when inputs suffer from additive random perturbations. While Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures are celebrated for achieving high performance at scale, it has remained unclear whether their advantages stem strictly from massive **parameter scaling** or from intrinsic **structural properties**. Distinguishing the benefits of sparse computation from sheer parameter volume is essential for guiding efficient model design, specifically for deploying models in resource-constrained or noisy environments where robustness is paramount.

The authors present a theoretical framework designed to isolate the impact of architecture by operating within an **"iso-parameter regime,"** ensuring MoE and dense models possess an identical number of parameters. The key technical innovation is the mathematical demonstration that sparse expert activation functions and gating mechanisms act as intrinsic filters against additive Gaussian feature noise. By modeling inputs with a latent modular structure subjected to these specific corruptions, the analysis proves that MoE routing naturally suppresses irrelevant features, establishing that modular computation itself drives efficiency rather than parameter count alone.

The study provides quantitative evidence that under the iso-parameter regime, MoE models achieve lower generalization error than dense estimators. Theoretical bounds indicate that the excess risk for MoE scales with a factor inversely proportional to the number of experts ($\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/K)$), whereas dense error remains constant relative to noise variance. Empirical validation on both synthetic datasets and real-world language processing tasks confirmed that MoE models maintained significantly higher accuracy levels under high-feature-noise conditions compared to dense counterparts. Furthermore, the experiments observed faster convergence speeds, with MoE architectures reaching optimal performance in fewer training epochs, validating the predicted efficiency of the sparse approach.

This work fundamentally shifts the understanding of MoE performance by providing a rigorous theoretical explanation for their robustness, moving beyond "parameter scaling" as the sole justification for success. It establishes a direct link between modular computation, noise filtering, and improved generalization, validating sparse architectures as a superior design choice for noisy environments. These findings influence the field by suggesting that future research should prioritize structural sparsity to enhance convergence and robustness in large-scale models, offering a specific path toward more efficient and resilient AI systems.

### Methodology

The researchers utilized a two-pronged approach to validate the robustness of MoE architectures:

1.  **Theoretical Analysis:** The team conducted an analysis within a controlled 'iso-parameter regime' to ensure a fair comparison between MoEs and dense networks. This involved modeling inputs with a latent modular structure subjected to feature noise.
2.  **Empirical Validation:** The theoretical framework was validated through experiments on both synthetic datasets (to control variables) and real-world language tasks (to prove practical applicability), focusing specifically on measuring robustness and convergence efficiency.
