## Executive Summary

Deploying deep learning models in resource-constrained environments often requires model quantization to reduce memory footprint and improve inference latency. However, a significant challenge in this domain is the **accuracy-efficiency trade-off**: while full quantization maximizes compression, it frequently introduces unacceptable accuracy degradation by uniformly reducing precision across all layers. Furthermore, hardware accelerators often possess heterogeneous capabilities, where certain operations may not support specific quantized formats, rendering a fully quantized model unusable on specific target hardware.

This paper addresses the need for a more granular approach to quantization that preserves model accuracy while still delivering substantial efficiency gains across diverse hardware architectures. The authors introduce **SeQTO (Selective Quantization Tuner)**, an end-to-end framework designed to automate the selective quantization of ONNX models. Unlike traditional methods that apply uniform quantization, SeQTO employs a multi-stage pipeline to generate mixed-precision model variants, quantizing specific layers or tensors while keeping others in full precision.

The system deploys these variants onto actual hardware (CPUs and GPUs) to profile real-world performance metrics. A core technical innovation is the use of **Pareto Front-based objective minimization**, which mathematically navigates the trade-offs between accuracy and model size to identify optimal configurations. This allows the framework to dynamically determine the best layers to quantize based on empirical data rather than static heuristics.

Empirical evaluations across four ONNX models demonstrate that SeQTO successfully mitigates the accuracy pitfalls associated with full quantization. The framework achieved up to **54.14% lower accuracy loss** compared to fully quantized baselines. Crucially, this improvement in accuracy did not come at the cost of efficiency; SeQTO retained up to **98.18%** of the model size reduction seen in fully quantized models. These results were validated across two different quantization settings and on both CPU and GPU devices, confirming the framework's versatility and robustness.

SeQTO represents a significant advancement in the practical deployment of neural networks by moving beyond binary full-quantization strategies. By providing a tool that mathematically optimizes the balance between accuracy and resource usage, it empowers engineers to deploy high-performance models on hardware with strict resource constraints or limited operation support.
