## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the lack of a scientific framework for designing and scaling Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent systems. While multi-agent architectures are widely adopted to solve complex tasks, current design choices—regarding architecture, agent heterogeneity, and coordination intensity—are often made ad-hoc. This issue is critical because inefficient scaling leads to prohibitive computational costs with diminishing performance returns. The study aims to move beyond trial-and-error engineering by systematically evaluating how different structural paradigms and agent capabilities influence overall system efficacy on complex reasoning benchmarks.

The key innovation is a rigorous empirical framework that dissects agent system performance across four architectural paradigms: **Centralized (Orchestrator-Subagents)**, **Decentralized (Peer Debate with Voting)**, **Hybrid**, and **Independent**. The research introduces a methodology for "agent stratification," testing combinations of high-capability models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro) and low-capability models (e.g., GPT-4o mini, Claude 3 Haiku, Gemini 1.5 Flash) in both homogeneous and heterogeneous configurations.

Evaluated on the **BrowseComp** benchmark—which tests complex web-browsing and information synthesis capabilities—the study yielded several counter-intuitive quantitative findings. Heterogeneous configurations frequently outperformed homogeneous ones; notably, a centralized Anthropic setup using a low-capability orchestrator with high-capability sub-agents achieved **42% accuracy**, a 31% improvement over homogeneous high-capability groups (32%).

The research identified a non-linear relationship between coordination and performance: an "**optimal band**" exists where overhead is between 200% and 300% (efficiency $\approx 0.16$). Conversely, "over-coordination" ($O > 400\%$) reduced efficiency to $\approx 0.11$ and significantly increased coordination failure rates to 12.4%. These findings provide the first quantitative laws for scaling agent systems, shifting the field from heuristic design to a principled science.

## Key Findings

*   **Heterogeneity Advantage:** Heterogeneous configurations often outperform homogeneous groups. Specifically, a centralized setup with a Low-Capability Orchestrator and High-Capability Sub-agents outperformed homogeneous High-Capability groups by **31%** in accuracy (42% vs. 32%).
*   **The Sub-Agent Bottleneck:** High-capability sub-agents are consistently more critical than the orchestrator. High-capability sub-agents paired with low-capability orchestrators outperformed the inverse setup, identifying sub-agent capability as the primary system bottleneck.
*   **Optimal Coordination Band:** Performance follows a non-linear curve. The optimal efficiency ($\approx 0.16$) is achieved with a coordination overhead ($O$) between **200% and 300%**.
*   **Over-Coordination Risk:** Exceeding 400% overhead leads to diminishing returns, reducing efficiency to $\approx 0.11$ and spiking coordination failure rates to **12.4%**.
*   **Error Specialization:** Centralized architectures are highly effective at reducing specific errors, slashing context omission by **66.8%** and logical contradictions by **36.4%**.

## Technical Details & Architecture

### Architectural Paradigms
The study evaluates four distinct structural approaches:

| Paradigm | Structure | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Centralized** | Orchestrator-Subagents | Hierarchical; single manager directs sub-agents. |
| **Decentralized** | Peer Debate with Voting | Flat structure; agents debate and vote on outcomes. |
| **Hybrid** | Combination Approach | Merges centralized and decentralized traits; high protocol complexity. |
| **Independent** | Baseline | Single-agent or non-coordinating approach. |

### Agent Stratification
To test capability impacts, the research stratified agents into tiers:

*   **High-Capability Models:** GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini-2.5 Pro.
*   **Low-Capability Models:** GPT-4o nano, Claude Sonnet 3.7, Gemini-2.0 Flash.
*   **Configurations Tested:**
    *   *Homogeneous:* All High or All Low capability.
    *   *Heterogeneous:* Mixed capabilities (e.g., High Orchestrator + Low Sub-agents vs. Low Orchestrator + High Sub-agents).

### Operational Mechanisms
Specific mechanisms were isolated to handle different failure modes:
*   **Logical Contradiction Reduction:** Achieved via Consensus (Centralized) and Peer Verification (Decentralized).
*   **Numerical Drift Reduction:** Handled via Sub-problem verification.
*   **Context Omission Reduction:** Managed via Orchestrator synthesis.

## Results Analysis

### Heterogeneity Impact (BrowseComp-Plus Benchmark)
The data reveals that "smarter workers" are more effective than "smarter managers."

*   **Centralized (Anthropic):**
    *   Low Orchestrator + High Sub-agents: **0.42 Accuracy**
    *   Homogeneous High: **0.32 Accuracy**
    *   **Improvement:** +31%
*   **Centralized (OpenAI/Gemini):** Performance degradation observed in heterogeneous configurations compared to Anthropic.
*   **Decentralized (Mixed Intelligence):**
    *   *Anthropic:* Mixed (0.47) vs Homogeneous High (0.37) → **+27% Gain**
    *   *OpenAI:* Mixed (0.53) vs Homogeneous High (0.50) → **+6% Gain**

### Error Analysis Breakdown
Centralized architectures proved superior in mitigating reasoning errors, while Hybrid approaches sometimes amplified specific issues (like numerical drift).

| Error Type | Architecture | Rate | Reduction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Context Omission** | Centralized | 8.3% | **66.8%** |
| **Logical Contradiction** | Centralized | 9.1% | **36.4%** |
| **Numerical Drift** | Centralized/Decentralized | 18.3% | **24%** |
| **Numerical Drift** | Hybrid | 26.4% | *(Amplified)* |
| **Coordination Failure** | Hybrid | 12.4% | *(Highest Failure Rate)* |

### Coordination Regimes
The study defines the computational cost relative to a single-agent baseline as Coordination Overhead ($O$).

| Regime | Overhead Range | Efficiency | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Under-Coordination** | $O < 100\%$ | Low | Mechanisms not effectively engaged. |
| **Optimal Band** | $200\% < O < 300\%$ | $\approx 0.16$ | **Highest success-to-cost ratio.** |
| **Over-Coordination** | $O > 400\%$ | $\approx 0.11$ | Reduced efficiency; protocol complexity introduces failure modes. |

## Conclusion

This work establishes a principled foundation for the engineering of multi-agent systems. By defining the optimal coordination band and identifying sub-agent capability as the critical bottleneck, the authors offer a blueprint for building cost-effective, scalable AI solutions. This research marks a shift from heuristic design to a science of scaling, enabling developers to maximize performance while strictly managing computational expenditures.
