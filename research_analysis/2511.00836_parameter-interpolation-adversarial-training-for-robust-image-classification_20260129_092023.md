## 📝 Executive Summary

> **Problem:** Standard adversarial training methods are fundamentally constrained by robustness oscillations and overfitting. These issues cause wild fluctuations in robustness across training epochs and widen the performance gap between training and test data. This inherent instability prevents consistent decision boundaries, limiting the reliability of adversarial defenses.
>
> **Solution:** The authors propose **Parameter Interpolation Adversarial Training (PIAT)**, a framework that stabilizes the learning trajectory through two technical contributions. First, PIAT smooths the optimization path by interpolating model parameters between the previous epoch ($\theta_{t-1}$) and the current epoch ($\theta_t$), mitigating sharp shifts in the decision boundary. Second, the framework integrates a **Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE)** loss function. Unlike standard approaches that align absolute logit magnitudes, NMSE aligns the *relative* magnitudes of logits between clean and adversarial examples.
>
> **Validation:** Experimental validation highlights PIAT’s efficacy on both synthetic and standard benchmarks. In a synthetic 3D binary classification task, PIAT achieved stable convergence under a high learning rate (0.5) using SGD momentum, whereas standard methods struggled. On CIFAR-10, PIAT demonstrated prominent improvements in robust accuracy, effectively alleviating robustness oscillations and reducing overfitting. The framework proved effective across architectural paradigms, including CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs).

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Training Instability:** Existing adversarial training methods suffer from robustness oscillations and overfitting issues, which degrade their overall defense efficacy.
*   **Parameter Smoothing:** Interpolating model parameters between the previous and current epochs (PIAT) leads to more moderate decision boundary changes, alleviates overfitting, and improves model convergence.
*   **Loss Function Optimization:** Utilizing Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) enhances robustness by focusing on aligning the **relative magnitude** of logits between clean and adversarial examples, as opposed to the absolute magnitude.
*   **Cross-Architecture Efficacy:** The proposed framework demonstrates the ability to prominently improve robustness across different architectural paradigms, including both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs).

## 🛠️ Methodology

The research proposes a novel framework termed **Parameter Interpolation Adversarial Training (PIAT)**. The core technical approach involves:

1.  **Parameter Interpolation:** Tuning model parameters during the training process by interpolating the parameters from the previous epoch with those of the current epoch. This interpolation is designed to moderate shifts in the model's decision boundary.
2.  **NMSE Integration:** Incorporating the Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) to align the relative magnitude of logits between clean and adversarial examples, rather than relying on absolute magnitude alignment.

## 🧩 Technical Details

**Core Framework**
*   **Objective:** Mitigate robustness oscillations and overfitting by interpolating model parameters between the previous epoch ($\theta_{t-1}$) and the current epoch ($\theta_t$) to achieve moderate changes in the decision boundary.
*   **Architecture Agnostic:** The method is applicable to both CNNs and ViTs.

**Loss Function**
*   **NMSE (Normalized Mean Square Error):** A regularization term that aligns logits based on relative magnitude rather than absolute values (unlike ALP).

**Synthetic Toy Example Setup**
*   **Task:** 3D binary classification dataset (concentric circles).
*   **Data Generation Equations:**
    *   $x_1 = \rho_i \cos(z) + \epsilon_1$
    *   $x_2 = \rho_i \sin(z) + \epsilon_2$
    *   $x_3 \sim U(\alpha_i, \beta_i)$
*   **Model Architecture:** Single-hidden-layer MLP.
