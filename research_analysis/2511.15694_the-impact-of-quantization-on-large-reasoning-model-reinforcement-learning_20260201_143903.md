## 📑 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of deploying Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) efficiently, specifically regarding how quantization affects models trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL). While quantization is essential for reducing the computational footprint of large models, most existing research focuses on its impact during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The interaction between low-precision computations and the distinct reward-based optimization landscape of RL remains poorly understood. This gap is significant because RL is increasingly used to align complex reasoning capabilities; if quantization destabilizes this training phase, it could degrade the model's ability to perform high-level mathematical reasoning, negating the benefits of efficient deployment.

The authors introduce a rigorous experimental framework to isolate the specific effects of quantization on the RL training trajectory, bypassing Supervised Fine-Tuning entirely. Utilizing Qwen3 models ranging from 0.6B to 8B parameters, the study compares three distinct strategies: **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)** applied during the RL phase, **QLoRA** (which freezes NF4 base weights while training low-rank adapters), and **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)**. The methodology employs pure RL algorithms (GRPO and drGRPO) on the MATH dataset, allowing the researchers to directly observe how 8-bit and 4-bit precision constraints, particularly via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) in QAT, interfere with the policy optimization process compared to adapter-based or post-hoc quantization methods.

The study reveals that **Quantization-Aware RL training is a suboptimal strategy**, introducing performance degradation that intensifies with model scale. While pure RL training successfully improved the Mean Reward of the 8B model from 0.473 to 0.594, applying QAT during this process hindered learning. Conversely, QLoRA and PTQ demonstrated superior resilience; QLoRA (4-bit) achieved the lowest quantization error for the 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B models. For the largest 8B model, PTQ (4-bit) proved exceptionally effective, achieving a Mean Reward of 0.581—nearly on par with the full-precision baseline of 0.594 and significantly outperforming the QAT approach.

These findings offer decisive technical guidance for the field, effectively discouraging the use of Quantization-Aware RL in favor of post-training or parameter-efficient quantization strategies like PTQ and QLoRA. By validating that strong reasoning capabilities can be achieved through pure RL without SFT and subsequently compressed efficiently, the paper establishes a vital performance baseline for future research on model alignment. This work steers the industry toward more deployment-friendly practices, ensuring that the pursuit of efficiency does not come at the cost of the complex reasoning capabilities acquired through reinforcement learning.
