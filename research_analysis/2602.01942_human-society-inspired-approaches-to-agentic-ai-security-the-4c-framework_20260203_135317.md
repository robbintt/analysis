## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical inadequacy of traditional, system-centric cybersecurity defenses in mitigating risks posed by agentic AI. Because AI agents possess autonomy and exhibit emergent behaviors, viewing them as isolated software components fails to capture the risks arising from their operation within complex socio-technical ecosystems. The authors argue that current security models are insufficient because they focus on infrastructure protection rather than the unique challenges of autonomous decision-making. Consequently, the industry requires a paradigm shift toward preserving behavioral integrity and ensuring alignment with human intent to secure these advanced systems effectively.

The key innovation is the introduction of the **"4C Framework,"** a novel taxonomy for multi-agent security inspired by human societal governance, which categorizes risks into Core (infrastructure), Connection (trust), Cognition (reasoning), and Compliance (governance). Technically, the paper proposes a Reference Multi-Agent Architecture for incident response, utilizing a specific processing pipeline that spans Input $\rightarrow$ Intent Extraction $\rightarrow$ Query Expansion $\rightarrow$ Subtask Breakdown $\rightarrow$ Plan & Execute $\rightarrow$ Tool Action $\rightarrow$ Output. This architecture incorporates both Short-Term and Long-Term memory systems and deploys specialized agent roles—including Triage, Context, Remediation, and Oversight agents—that communicate via message handoffs and shared state rather than direct peer-to-peer sockets.

As this paper is theoretical and conceptual in nature, it does not provide quantitative performance metrics, success rates, or benchmark scores. Instead, the results are qualitative, focusing on the successful decomposition of complex multi-agent behaviors into the 4C dimensions to analyze interdependent security risks. The authors demonstrate the framework's relevance by citing qualitative examples of emergent capabilities, such as GPT-4 bypassing CAPTCHAs, to illustrate the types of behavioral risks that the new taxonomy is designed to address.

The significance of this work lies in its fundamental redefinition of AI security to encompass behavioral integrity and alignment with human values, moving beyond mere code defense. By providing a structured taxonomy and a reference architecture, the 4C Framework establishes a principled foundation for the development of governable and safe agentic AI systems. This contribution influences the field by equipping researchers and engineers with the conceptual tools necessary to design trustworthy AI agents capable of operating securely in open, unpredictable environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Insufficiency of System-Centric Defenses:** Traditional cybersecurity measures fail to address risks arising from the autonomy and emergent behaviors of agentic AI.
*   **Shift in Risk Landscape:** AI agents must be viewed as participants in complex socio-technical ecosystems rather than isolated components.
*   **The 4C Framework:** Agentic risks can be categorized into **Core** (infrastructure), **Connection** (trust), **Cognition** (reasoning), and **Compliance** (governance).
*   **Behavioral Integrity Focus:** Security requires a shift from system protection to preserving behavioral integrity and intent.

## Methodology

The research employs two primary theoretical approaches:

1.  **Conceptual Framework Development:** A theoretical, design-oriented approach inspired by human societal governance structures.
2.  **Multi-Dimensional Risk Analysis:** Decomposing complex behaviors of multi-agent systems into specific dimensions (Core, Connection, Cognition, Compliance) to analyze interdependent security risks.

## Technical Details

### The 4C Framework Taxonomy
The paper proposes mapping societal layers to agentic AI components to identify security vulnerabilities:

| Layer | Domain | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core** | Infrastructure | System integrity and foundational hardware/software resources. |
| **Connection** | Trust | Communication channels and interaction protocols between agents. |
| **Cognition** | Reasoning | Decision-making processes, planning, and logic capabilities. |
| **Compliance** | Governance | Guardrails, regulations, and alignment with human values. |

### Reference Multi-Agent Architecture
The paper outlines a specific architecture for incident response with the following characteristics:

**Processing Pipeline:**
`Input` $\rightarrow$ `Intent Extraction` $\rightarrow$ `Query Expansion` $\rightarrow$ `Subtask Breakdown` $\rightarrow$ `Plan & Execute` $\rightarrow$ `Tool Action` $\rightarrow$ `Output`

**System Components:**
