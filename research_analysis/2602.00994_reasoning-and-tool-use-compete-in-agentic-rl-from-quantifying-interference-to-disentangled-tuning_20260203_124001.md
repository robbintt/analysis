## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses a fundamental flaw in the prevailing **Agentic Reinforcement Learning (ARL)** paradigm, where a single shared model is typically trained to handle both reasoning and tool-use capabilities. The authors demonstrate that this joint training approach suffers from significant **"training interference,"** where the optimization of one capability actively degrades the other. This problem matters because it limits the effectiveness of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents; despite the assumption that shared parameters foster generalization, the reality is that reasoning and tool-use behaviors induce conflicting gradient directions ($g^{(r)}$ and $g^{(a)}$), resulting in sub-optimal performance for both tasks.

The paper introduces a two-pronged technical innovation to diagnose and resolve this interference:
1.  **LEAS (Linear Effect Analysis System):** A diagnostic framework that quantifies interference by calculating interaction coefficients ($\lambda_{q23}$) across various model variants, with negative values confirming the detrimental interaction.
2.  **DART (Disentangled Agentic Reasoning Tuning):** Resolves the conflict by decoupling parameter updates using two disjoint Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) subspaces (rank 8 each) within a single backbone model.

Empirical results validate that interference is the dominant mode of interaction. The DART framework proved highly effective, achieving an average performance improvement of **6.35%** over standard joint training baselines. Notably, DART matched the performance upper bound of a complex multi-agent system using only a single, disentangled model. This work significantly influences the field by challenging the assumption that shared parameters are inherently beneficial, providing a new, more effective optimization direction for future research in LLM agents.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Existence of Training Interference:** Joint training on a single shared model is flawed, with quantitative evidence revealing significant interference between reasoning and tool-use behaviors.
*   **Gradient Misalignment:** Reasoning and tool-use capabilities induce misaligned gradient directions that actively undermine joint optimization effectiveness.
*   **Efficacy of Decoupling:** Explicitly decoupling parameter updates for reasoning and tool-use leads to superior performance compared to standard joint training methods.
*   **Performance Benchmarks:** The proposed DART framework achieves an average performance improvement of 6.35% over baseline methods and matches multi-agent system performance using a single model.

## 🔬 Methodology

The researchers employed a **Linear Effect Attribution System (LEAS)** to systematically investigate and quantify interference between reasoning and tool-use behaviors within shared model parameters. They conducted an in-depth analysis of gradient directions during training to empirically demonstrate misalignment.

To address the identified interference, they developed the **Disentangled Action Reasoning Tuning (DART)** framework. This solution utilizes separate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules to explicitly decouple parameter updates for reasoning and tool-use, allowing for distinct optimization paths within a single model.
