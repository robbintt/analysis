## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to traffic safety, specifically in predicting truck driving risks, while overcoming the inherent "black box" limitation that typically obscures model reasoning. In high-stakes environments like commercial trucking, accurate prediction is insufficient without transparent explanations of the causative factors. Existing models often fail to provide reliable, domain-specific insights, limiting their utility for safety management and operational decision-making.

The key innovation is the **LIFT (Literature-informed Fine-tuned LLMs)** framework, a novel architecture designed to ground LLMs in domain-specific scientific knowledge to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. Technically, the system operates through three interconnected components: a Literature Processing Pipeline that synthesizes findings from 299 domain papers into a structured knowledge base; an LLM-driven Inference Core that is fine-tuned on real-world data to predict risks and generate explanations; and a Result Evaluator that quantifies performance.

LIFT demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to benchmark models, achieving a significant **26.7% improvement in recall** and a **10.1% increase in the F1-score**. Beyond prediction, the framework exhibited robust interpretability, maintaining consistency across various data sampling conditions. Experiments validated that the integration of the 299-paper knowledge base is essential, as it is the primary driver of the model's ability to explain variable importance. Furthermore, the risky scenarios identified by the framework were statistically confirmed through PERMANOVA tests, verifying the reliability of the model's generated insights.
