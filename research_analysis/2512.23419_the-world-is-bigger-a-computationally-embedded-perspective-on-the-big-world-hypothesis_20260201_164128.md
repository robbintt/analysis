## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the theoretical and practical hurdles of the **Big World Hypothesis**, which posits that agents operate within environments far exceeding their internal computational resources. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning frameworks that treat agents as external observers or rely on *ad hoc* regularization, this work formally models the environment as an **Algorithmic Markov Process** with a countable state-space and polynomial-time computable transitions. This distinction is critical because it captures the physical reality that an agent is fundamentally embedded within its environment—a universal computer—creating a setting where the agent is a part of the system rather than a distinct entity. The authors formalize the agent as an **Embedded Automaton**, arguing that this shift from static policy convergence to continual adaptation is necessary to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world applications where environmental complexity is effectively infinite.

The key technical innovation is the "computationally-embedded perspective," which establishes a rigorous isomorphism between an embedded agent and a stateful policy operating within a **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)**. The authors characterize the environment through **Uniform Locality**, where transitions depend on local substates and boundary-spaces, and define the agent via input, output, and internal state spaces. Crucially, they propose **"interactivity"** as a novel objective function, measuring an agent's ability to continually learn new predictions and adapt behaviors over time. To optimize this, a specific model-based reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to maximize interactivity, providing a mathematical foundation for intrinsic motivation that arises naturally from the constraints of the agent's computational embedding.

The study yields significant results grounded in specific metrics, including **Algorithmic Complexity** ($K_U(x|y)$) and internal state-space capacity. Theoretically, the authors prove that the finite internal state space of an embedded agent acts as a natural bottleneck, creating inherent capacity constraints without external regularization. Empirically, evaluations on synthetic continual learning problems demonstrated a distinct architectural performance divergence: while deep nonlinear networks struggled to sustain high levels of interactivity, **deep linear networks** successfully maintained and increased interactivity as their capacity increased. These findings quantify the limitations of current architectures, showing that computational embedding naturally forces adaptation due to the environment's superior capacity.

## Key Findings

*   **Theoretical Equivalence:** An agent modeled as an automaton within a universal computer is theoretically equivalent to an agent operating in a POMDP over a countably infinite state-space.
*   **Architectural Performance:** Deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain "interactivity," whereas deep linear networks are capable of sustaining higher levels of interactivity as their capacity increases.
*   **Constraint Nature:** Computational embedding inherently constrains an agent regardless of its capacity, creating a natural setting for continual learning without the need for explicit, *ad hoc* capacity constraints.

## Methodology

The research employs a multi-step approach to formalize and test the embedded agent hypothesis:

1.  **Formal Modeling:**
    The authors define a "computationally-embedded perspective" by representing an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal formal computer.

2.  **Objective Definition:**
    They propose **"interactivity,"** a metric designed to measure an agent's ability to continually adapt behavior by learning new predictions.

3.  **Algorithm Development:**
    A model-based reinforcement learning algorithm is developed specifically to maximize this interactivity objective.

4.  **Evaluation:**
    The method is assessed using a constructed synthetic problem designed to test continual learning capabilities across different network architectures.
