## 📋 Executive Summary

This research addresses the inherent limitations of standard transfer learning in nonparametric regression, specifically when dealing with high-dimensional covariate spaces and heterogeneous data relationships. Traditional methods often rely on a global, homogeneous relationship between source and target domains—an assumption frequently violated in practice—which leads to "negative transfer," the inclusion of irrelevant data that actively degrades model performance. Furthermore, as the number of features increases, the "curse of dimensionality" causes estimation accuracy to plummet. This paper focuses on the critical challenge of leveraging large volumes of low-quality source data to enhance the estimation of a target function based on a limited, high-quality target sample, despite significant discrepancies in data distributions.

The key innovation is the **"Localized Functional Transfer"** framework, operationalized through the Tessellation Localized Transfer Learning ($(TL)^2$) algorithm. This method introduces a "Local Transfer Assumption," rejecting the idea of a uniform transformation across the feature space. Instead, it partitions the covariate space $[0,1]^d$ into a finite tessellation of admissible cells. Within each specific cell, the target function is modeled as a low-complexity, one-dimensional transformation of the source function ($f_T(x) = g_l(f_S(x))$). This design significantly reduces functional complexity. Technically, the framework is fully data-driven and adaptive, consisting of two stages: first, computing a global Nadaraya-Watson estimator for the source and estimating local transfer functions using a target training subsample; and second, optimizing the partition structure via empirical risk minimization on a validation set.

The study establishes robust theoretical results, focusing on precise quantitative bounds to validate the framework. The authors demonstrate that the method achieves minimax optimality by attaining sharp minimax rates of convergence, effectively mitigating the curse of dimensionality through reduced problem complexity within partitions. Key quantitative contributions include rigorous oracle inequalities that decompose excess risk into distinct estimation and approximation terms. These inequalities formally confirm the method's robustness to model misspecification and its ability to strictly control negative transfer by bounding the potential loss from incorporating source data.

This work is significant for its rigorous mathematical treatment of heterogeneity in transfer learning, moving beyond global transfer assumptions that often fail in practical scenarios. By establishing minimax optimality and deriving oracle inequalities, the paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for localized transfer methods. The $(TL)^2$ algorithm offers practitioners a powerful, automatic tool for detecting and exploiting local structures of transfer without prior knowledge, serving as a reliable safeguard against negative transfer. This framework expands the potential adoption of transfer learning in nonparametric settings, particularly for applications where data quality is high in the target domain but low in the source domain, and feature dimensions are substantial.
