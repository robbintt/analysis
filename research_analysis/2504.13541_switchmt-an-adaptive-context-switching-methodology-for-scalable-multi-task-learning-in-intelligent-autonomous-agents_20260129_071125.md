## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the bottlenecks of **scalability** and **task interference** in Multi-Task Learning (MTL) for intelligent autonomous agents. Traditional methodologies relying on fixed, pre-determined context-switching intervals often fail to adapt to heterogeneous learning speeds, leading to catastrophic forgetting.

**Innovation**
The core innovation, **SwitchMT**, replaces static scheduling with a dynamic mechanism driven by internal learning progress. The system utilizes a Deep Spiking Q-Network (MTSpark_ADD) featuring active dendrites and a dueling structure. An adaptive switching policy monitors internal network dynamics—specifically triggering a task switch when relative parameter changes fall below a threshold of **$1 \times 10^{-5}$** (plateau detection), with final actions determined via the argmax of Q-values.

**Results**
Evaluated on the Atari 2600 suite, SwitchMT significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baselines (DQN and DSQN).
*   **Pong:** SwitchMT (20.8) vs DQN (15.5)
*   **Breakout:** SwitchMT (425) vs DSQN (310)
*   **Enduro:** SwitchMT (865) vs Baselines (~600)

The results demonstrated a **30% performance gap** in favor of SwitchMT and a drastic reduction in training variance compared to unstable baselines.

**Impact**
This work resolves inherent scalability limitations of fixed-interval SNNs, paving the way for autonomous, efficient generalist agents capable of learning diverse skill sets without catastrophic forgetting.

## Methodology

The researchers propose **SwitchMT**, a novel adaptive task-switching methodology designed specifically for reinforcement learning environments.

*   **Architecture:** It utilizes a **Deep Spiking Q-Network** architecture enhanced with active dendrites and a dueling structure.
*   **Specialization:** This architecture generates specialized sub-networks using task-specific context signals to isolate different tasks.
*   **Adaptive Policy:** An adaptive task-switching policy determines when to switch tasks. This decision is based on a combination of reward signals and internal network dynamics, allowing the agent to respond to its own learning progress rather than an external clock.

## Technical Details

**Core Mechanism: Adaptive Context Switching**
SwitchMT replaces fixed interval task switching with a dynamic context switching mechanism. This is specifically designed to mitigate task interference in multi-task learning scenarios.

**Architecture: MTSpark_ADD**
The system relies on the MTSpark_ADD architecture, which integrates two key components:
*   **Active Dendrites:** Used to process context signals.
*   **Dueling Architecture:** Used to separate state value and advantage streams for better policy evaluation.

**Switching Logic**
The adaptive task-switching policy dynamically shifts the agent to a new task based on learning progress.
1.  **Monitoring:** The system monitors relative parameter changes within the network.
2.  **Trigger:** A switch is triggered when parameter changes fall below a defined threshold (indicating a learning plateau).
3.  **Decision:** The final switching action is determined via the argmax of Q-values.
