## Executive Summary

The proliferation of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Large Language Model (LLM) applications has outpaced a rigorous understanding of their actual efficacy compared to Single-Agent Systems (SAS). This paper addresses the critical problem of uncontrolled MAS deployment, which often assumes more agents automatically yield better performance without accounting for specific task structures or the computational overhead involved. This issue matters because MAS can introduce significant latency and coordination costs; without a clear framework to determine when these costs are justified, resources are wasted and performance may even degrade. The authors establish that MAS benefits are strictly conditional, relying heavily on verification protocols, agent capabilities, and the intrinsic complexity of the reasoning task.

To resolve these ambiguities, the authors introduce **MAS-Orchestra**, a novel framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem. Unlike traditional sequential approaches, MAS-Orchestra utilizes "holistic orchestration," generating the entire multi-agent system at once and abstracting sub-agents as "callable functions." This design allows a central orchestrator LLM to perform global reasoning by decomposing tasks and coordinating functions, rather than relying on rigid, code-level sequential execution. Complementing this framework, the researchers developed **MASBENCH**, a controlled benchmark suite designed to evaluate systems across five distinct axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallelism, and Robustness, enabling a structured analysis of performance dynamics.

Experimental results demonstrate that MAS-Orchestra achieves over **10x efficiency gains** alongside superior performance on complex reasoning tasks. In the "Weak Sub-Agent Regime" (using Qwen-7b), MAS consistently outperforms SAS, with the notable exception of tasks with high Depth, where SAS matches or exceeds MAS due to lower sequential overhead. Conversely, in the "Strong Sub-Agent Regime" (using GPT-120b), performance gains diminish across Depth, Horizon, Breadth, and Parallelism axes due to coordination costs and error propagation. However, the framework excels in adversarial scenarios; while SAS performance collapses to near-zero accuracy under data poisoning, MAS-Orchestra maintains high accuracy through redundancy and a "Final Answer" moderator agent. The findings suggest MAS is most effective at the **"edge of sub-agent competence,"** where agents are capable but require explicit orchestration.

The significance of this research lies in its theoretical and practical redefinition of MAS utility, shifting the narrative from a general preference for multi-agent solutions to a nuanced, task-dependent decision framework. By establishing that MAS efficacy is conditional and identifying the "edge of competence" as the optimal deployment zone, the paper provides a roadmap for engineers to select between SAS and MAS based on quantifiable task characteristics rather than intuition. The introduction of MASBENCH sets a new standard for evaluating multi-agent reasoning, moving the field toward more rigorous, controlled comparisons. Ultimately, this work facilitates the design of more robust and efficient AI systems by clarifying when holistic orchestration is truly superior to single-agent reasoning.

## Key Findings

*   **Conditional Benefits:** The advantages of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are strictly conditional, dependent on task structure, verification protocols, and agent capabilities.
*   **Significant Efficiency:** The MAS-Orchestra framework achieves over **10x efficiency gains** while delivering superior performance on complex reasoning tasks.
*   **Functional Abstraction:** Abstracting subagents as callable functions facilitates better global reasoning compared to traditional sequential code-level execution.
*   **Task Structure Matters:** Five key characteristics determine when MAS outperforms Single-Agent Systems (SAS): **Depth**, **Horizon**, **Breadth**, **Parallelism**, and **Robustness**.
*   **Optimal Deployment Zone:** MAS is most effective at the "edge of sub-agent competence"—scenarios where sub-agents are capable but require explicit orchestration.

## Methodology

The research approach centers on reformulating how multi-agent systems are designed and evaluated:

*   **RL Formulation:** The framework formulates MAS orchestration as a **function-calling reinforcement learning problem**, treating system generation as a training-time optimization task.
*   **Holistic Orchestration:** Instead of building agents step-by-step, the system generates the entire MAS structure at once.
*   **Subagent Abstraction:** Sub-agents are treated as "callable functions," allowing the orchestrator to focus on global reasoning and task decomposition.
*   **Controlled Benchmarking:** The researchers introduced **MASBENCH**, a benchmark suite that rigorously evaluates performance across five specific structural axes.

## Technical Details

### Framework Architecture
*   **Paradigm Shift:** Moves from Single-Agent Systems (SAS) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) using **Holistic Orchestration**.
*   **Role of the Orchestrator:** Specific LLMs serve as orchestrators to manage task decomposition and coordination.
*   **Adversarial Defense:** To ensure robustness against data poisoning, the architecture employs:
    *   A **"Final Answer" agent** that acts as a moderator to identify adversarial signals.
    *   **Conflict assignment** mechanisms where different sub-agents are assigned to verify specific aspects of the task.

### Task Evaluation Axes (MASBENCH)
The framework evaluates task structures based on the following five dimensions:

1.  **Depth:** The sequential dependency of steps.
2.  **Horizon:** The length of the reasoning chain.
3.  **Breadth:** The number of distinct sub-tasks.
4.  **Parallelism:** The capability for simultaneous execution of tasks.
5.  **Robustness:** The system's resistance to adversarial attacks and data poisoning.

## Results

### Efficiency & General Performance
*   **Metric:** Evaluated using Avg@8 accuracy.
*   **Outcome:** MAS-Orchestra achieved over **10x efficiency gains** compared to baseline methods.

### Performance by Regime
*   **Weak Sub-Agent Regime (Qwen-7b):**
    *   MAS generally **outperforms** SAS.
    *   **Exception:** On the Depth axis, SAS matches or outperforms MAS due to lower overhead in sequential scenarios.
*   **Strong Sub-Agent Regime (GPT-120b):**
    *   Performance gains **diminish** across Depth, Horizon, Breadth, and Parallel axes.
    *   **Cause:** Increased coordination costs and error propagation negate the benefits of adding agents.

### Robustness Analysis
*   **Single-Agent Systems (SAS):** Performance collapses to **near-zero accuracy** when subjected to data poisoning.
*   **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS):** Maintains high accuracy through built-in redundancy and the moderation capabilities of the "Final Answer" agent.

### Conclusion on Efficacy
The analysis concludes that MAS is not universally superior but is most effective at the **"edge of sub-agent competence,"** where sub-agents possess fundamental capability but require explicit orchestration to manage complex task structures.
