## Executive Summary

> The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design is severely hindered by the scarcity of open-source Hardware Description Language (HDL) datasets and the proprietary nature of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) resources. Traditional approaches to automating hardware synthesis often rely on expensive, resource-intensive fine-tuning or prolonged inference chains, resulting in prohibitive computational costs.
>
> This paper introduces **VeriMaAS (Verification-enabled Multi-Agent System)**, the first framework to automate the composition of agentic workflows specifically for RTL code generation. Its core innovation is a dynamic "Cascading Controller" that replaces static prompting with an adaptive selection of reasoning operators—ranging from simple Zero-shot I/O to complex Debate mechanisms—based on real-time confidence scores and task difficulty.
>
> Crucially, VeriMaAS integrates formal verification feedback directly from standard EDA tools (Yosys, OpenSTA) into the generation loop; synthesis failure rates and tool logs serve as ground truth to guide the process. VeriMaAS demonstrates significant efficiency and correctness gains, achieving a **5-7% improvement (measured by pass@k)** compared to fine-tuned baseline models while utilizing only a few hundred training examples.

**Verification-enabled Multi-Agent System (VeriMaAS)** is an adaptive multi-agent workflow for RTL code generation that replaces static prompting with a dynamic 'Cascading Controller'.

### System Components

*   **Cascading Controller:**
    *   Selects reasoning operators in a fixed sequence of increasing complexity.
    *   Selection is based on confidence scores against specific thresholds.
    *   Generates **K=20** candidates.
*   **Reasoning Operators (in order of complexity):**
    1.  Zero-shot I/O
    2.  Chain of Thought (CoT)
    3.  ReAct
    4.  Self-Refine
    5.  Debate
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Utilizes EDA tool logs (Yosys, OpenSTA) and synthesis failure rates to gauge task complexity.
    *   Triggers more advanced operators based on the difficulty of the task.
*   **Toolchain:**
    *   **Synthesis/Verification:** Yosys
