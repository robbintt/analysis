### 📝 Executive Summary

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to the software development lifecycle, the industry faces a critical blind spot regarding the environmental sustainability of AI-assisted coding. While LLMs promise efficiency gains and accelerated development cycles, their substantial computational demands present a potentially significant ecological cost that organizations struggle to quantify.

This paper addresses the urgent need to measure this trade-off by establishing a rigorous framework to compare the carbon emissions of manual development against LLM-assisted workflows. This research is vital because, without concrete data, engineering leaders cannot accurately assess the environmental liability of adopting AI tools or align these practices with corporate sustainability goals and regulatory standards.

The study introduces a comparative analysis framework utilizing **Codeforces**—a competitive programming platform—as a controlled simulation environment. The researchers defined two distinct workflows: a Baseline approach using historical human execution data and an Intervention approach utilizing GPT-4. The technical innovation lies in the methodology used to quantify environmental impact; rather than physically measuring power draw in real-time, the researchers estimate energy consumption by translating granular code metrics (runtime, memory usage, and development time) into quantifiable energy and carbon footprint equivalents.

The empirical analysis reveals a **substantial carbon penalty** associated with AI assistance. LLM-assisted coding exhibits end-to-end energy consumption an order of magnitude larger than manual coding. This disparity is not uniform across all tasks; the study identified a statistically significant correlation between task complexity and the carbon footprint gap.

This research provides the software engineering community with a crucial quantitative benchmark, challenging the often-assumed universal efficiency of AI-assisted development. The paper establishes a foundation for future **"Green AI"** practices, urging the field to move beyond simple performance metrics and incorporate carbon footprint analysis into the standard evaluation of coding assistance tools.
