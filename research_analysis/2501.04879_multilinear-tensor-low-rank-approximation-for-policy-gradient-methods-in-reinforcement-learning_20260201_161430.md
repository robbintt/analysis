## Executive Summary

Reinforcement learning (RL) policy optimization typically relies on deep Neural Networks (NNs), which incur high computational and sample complexities due to their over-parameterized nature. A fundamental inefficiency in standard architectures is their inability to exploit redundancies and local similarities within state-action representations. This inability leads to wasted computational resources, the learning of redundant parameters, and a requirement for extensive data to achieve convergence, creating a significant bottleneck for resource-constrained applications.

The authors address these limitations by introducing a **Multilinear Tensor Low-Rank Approximation framework** for policy-gradient methods. The core technical innovation involves replacing standard dense NN parameterizations with a tensor structure constrained by PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. By enforcing a low-rank constraint on the policy tensor, the framework reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the policy's essential dynamics. This approach is integrated into specific algorithms—**Tensor Low-Rank Policy Gradient (TLRPG)**, **Tensor Low-Rank Actor-Critic (TLRAC)**, and **Trust-Region variants (TRTLRPO and PTLRPO)**—which leverage the sparse tensor structure to decompose gradient computations into probability-dependent and model-dependent terms.

Evaluations on OpenAI Gym environments (MountainCar and Pendulum) demonstrated that tensor low-rank models achieve cumulative rewards comparable to standard NN baselines while delivering substantial efficiency gains. The proposed methods significantly reduced both computational time and sample complexity by maintaining a much lower parameter count. Theoretically, the authors provide rigorous guarantees for convergence, proving that the proposed methods converge to an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{H})$-stationary solution (where $H$ denotes the number of iterations) under standard assumptions of Lipschitz continuity and bounded rewards. Furthermore, empirical validation of the low-rank assumption confirmed that the parameter structures of standard NNs trained on these tasks naturally exhibit the low-rank properties that the framework explicitly enforces.

This work establishes a theoretically grounded alternative to universal NN approximation, paving the way for resource-efficient RL algorithms. By demonstrating that complex policy representations can be effectively compressed into low-rank tensor structures, this research mitigates the computational bottlenecks associated with deep networks. The rigorous convergence guarantees and empirical validation offer a robust foundation for future research into compressed, high-performance policy optimization for environments where computational resources are limited.

## Methodology

The research shifts away from standard neural network architectures, utilizing **multi-linear mappings** to estimate the parameters of the RL policy. The workflow involves:

1.  **Tensor Structuring:** Policy parameters are aggregated into a cohesive tensor structure rather than a flat vector or dense weight matrix.
2.  **Decomposition:** The method leverages **PARAFAC decomposition** and tensor-completion techniques.
3.  **Low-Rank Constraint:** These techniques enforce a low-rank constraint on the policy tensor, explicitly exploiting inherent redundancies in the data to streamline the learning process.
