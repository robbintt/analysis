## Executive Summary

> **The Security Dilemma of Transfer Learning**

As the adoption of large-scale pre-trained models accelerates, practitioners increasingly rely on transfer learning to solve downstream tasks. A prevailing assumption in the field is that Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) frameworks, which produce robust feature representations, offer inherent security benefits. This paper addresses the critical question of whether the fine-tuning process mitigates pre-existing vulnerabilities or simply inherits them from the pre-trained backbone.

The authors challenge the "security dilemma" where the superior performance of modern models correlates directly with heightened adversarial risk, exposing a potential single point of failure in the feature extractors shared across thousands of downstream applications.

The key innovation is the **"Backbone Attack,"** a novel transfer strategy that shifts the attack vector from the task-specific classification head to the frozen pre-trained feature extractor. This method operates on the hypothesis that adversarial vulnerabilities reside primarily in the shared backbone rather than the fine-tuned layers. To validate this, the researchers developed a large-scale framework evaluating **20,000 distinct combinations** of tuning meta-information.

The study provides concrete quantitative evidence that traditional security assumptions are flawed. The "Backbone Attack" achieved attack success rates (ASR) **exceeding 90%**, effectively matching the performance of expensive white-box attacks while requiring minimal target knowledge. Furthermore, statistical analysis (ANOVA) revealed that the choice of tuning meta-information is a decisive factor; specific configurations can drastically increase susceptibility, though the fundamental vulnerability of the backbone persists regardless of the fine-tuning method.

## Key Findings

*   **White-Box Comparable Effectiveness:** Attacks transferred via proxy models can achieve effectiveness comparable to white-box attacks with minimal knowledge of the target model.
*   **The "Backbone Attack":** This novel strategy, which uses only pre-trained backbones, outperforms traditional black-box attacks and exposes significant security risks.
*   **Meta-Information Influence:** The specific combinations of tuning meta-information (e.g., optimizers, learning rates) significantly influence adversarial transferability.
*   **SSL Vulnerabilities:** Models tuned on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) backbones inherit critical adversarial vulnerabilities despite their performance improvements in standard tasks.

## Methodology

The researchers conducted a large-scale systematic evaluation designed to measure the impact of information granularity on transferability.

*   **Scale of Evaluation:** The study analyzed **20,000 distinct combinations** of tuning meta-information, covering fine-tuning techniques, backbone families, datasets, and attack types.
*   **Proxy Model Simulation:** The approach centered on using proxy models fine-tuned with diverse configurations to simulate varying levels of attacker knowledge.
*   **Backbone Attack Strategy:** A new method was developed that leverages only pre-trained backbones (bypassing task-specific heads) to generate adversarial examples.
*   **Statistical Validation:** Extensive ablation studies were performed, supplemented by ANOVA testing to assess the statistical significance of meta-information on attack success.
