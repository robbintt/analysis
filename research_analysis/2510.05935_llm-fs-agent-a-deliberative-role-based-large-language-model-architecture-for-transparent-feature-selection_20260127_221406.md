## 📝 Executive Summary

Feature selection is a critical preprocessing step in machine learning that directly impacts model performance, computational cost, and interpretability. Traditional methods often operate as "black boxes," offering selected features without clear reasoning, while Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches can be computationally expensive and opaque. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, where understanding the rationale behind feature selection is essential for trust and compliance.

This paper addresses the challenge of creating a feature selection mechanism that not only maintains high prediction accuracy and reduces computational overhead but also provides explicit, human-interpretable justifications for its decisions. The researchers introduce **LLM-FS-Agent**, a novel deliberative, multi-agent architecture leveraging Small and Medium Language Models (SLMs/MLMs).

The core innovation lies in a structured "debate" framework where specialized agents assume distinct roles to evaluate feature relevance: an **Initiator** proposes features, a **Refiner** adds statistical context, a **Challenger** provides adversarial critique, and a **Judge** renders the final decision. Empirical validation on the CIC-DIAD 2024 dataset demonstrates that LLM-FS-Agent achieves predictive performance consistently superior or comparable to prominent baselines like LLM-Select and PCA, while delivering a 46% average reduction in downstream classifier training time. This successfully validates the architecture's ability to solve the "black box" problem in a real-world cybersecurity context.
