## Executive Summary

This research addresses the inherent instability and sensitivity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to minor variations in prompt wording. This phenomenon, known as prompt sensitivity, creates a significant challenge for system reliability, as slight rephrasing of instructions can lead to drastically different outputs, rendering manual prompt engineering inefficient and unpredictable. The paper posits that this issue stems from a friction between human-crafted prompts and the model’s internal "inductive bias"—the set of assumptions or preferences the model uses to generalize from training data. Understanding and mitigating this misalignment is critical for developing robust LLM applications where consistent performance is required.

The authors introduce Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching (IBEaM), a systematic prompt engineering strategy designed to align input phrasing with the model’s internal probabilistic tendencies. rather than relying solely on human intuition, IBEaM employs a recursive, four-step pipeline:

1. **Component Metrics:** Decomposes the target task into high-level sub-problems.
2. **Inductive Bias Extraction:** The LLM generates its own Likert scale wording and descriptions for each metric.
3. **Inductive Bias Matching:** Injects this model-generated scale into the conversation history as context.
4. **Aggregation:** Combines scores from the sub-metrics.

By utilizing the model’s own output as a constituent part of the subsequent prompt, IBEaM effectively engineers the phrasing to match the model’s inherent biases.

Evaluations of IBEaM on non-comparative classification and ranking tasks—using datasets such as WikiHow, SAGA Task 2, and Action Conditions—demonstrated statistically significant improvements in performance. Specifically, the strategy achieved an improvement in LLM Likert ratings of up to **19% on classification tasks** and up to **27% on ranking tasks**. Beyond the quantitative gains, the method exhibited qualitative improvements in engineering efficiency and rating consistency, suggesting that satisfactory prompt wording is more readily achieved when derived from the model’s own language patterns rather than through exclusive human engineering.

The significance of this work lies in its transition of prompt engineering from an ad-hoc, human-centric trial-and-error process to a systematic, automated alignment technique. By empirically validating that matching prompts to a model's inductive bias drives performance gains, the paper provides a theoretical framework for understanding prompt sensitivity. This contribution influences the field by offering a replicable method for stabilizing LLM outputs, potentially reducing the operational overhead associated with manual prompt design and increasing the reliability of LLMs in complex evaluation tasks.

## Key Findings

*   **Root Cause Identification:** The sensitivity of LLMs to minor changes in prompt wording is directly attributed to the inductive bias present within the models.
*   **Recursive Alignment:** Incorporating an LLM’s own output as a component of its subsequent prompt creates a phrasing that aligns with the model’s inherent inductive bias.
*   **Significant Performance Gains:** The proposed 'Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching' strategy improves LLM Likert ratings for classification tasks by up to **19%**.
*   **Ranking Improvements:** For ranking tasks, the strategy demonstrates an improvement in LLM Likert ratings by up to **27%**.
*   **Efficiency of Model-Generated Prompts:** Satisfactory prompt wording is more easily achieved when derived from the model's own language patterns rather than solely through human engineering.

## Methodology

The researchers utilize an **Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching (IBEaM)** strategy. The core mechanism of this approach involves using the text output generated by the LLM as a constituent part of the input prompt.

This recursive process is designed to engineer the prompt wording specifically to match the inductive bias of the model, thereby reducing friction between the prompt instructions and the model's probabilistic tendencies.

## Technical Details

The **Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching (IBEaM)** process optimizes LLM performance by aligning prompts with the model’s inherent preferences through a structured four-step pipeline:

1.  **Creation of Component Metrics (Decomposition):**
    *   Breaks the target task into high-level sub-problems to create manageable evaluation units.
2.  **Inductive Bias Extraction (Scale Generation):**
    *   Prompts the LLM to generate its own Likert scale wording and descriptions for each metric.
    *   This output represents the extracted inductive bias.
3.  **Inductive Bias Matching (Contextual Prompting):**
    *   Places the generated scale in the conversation history.
    *   Instructs the LLM to evaluate inputs based on 'the previous [metric] scale' to ensure alignment.
4.  **Aggregation:**
    *   Combines scores from component metrics to produce a final evaluation score.

The method effectively shifts prompt engineering from humans to the model, using model-generated scales to ensure consistency and alignment.
