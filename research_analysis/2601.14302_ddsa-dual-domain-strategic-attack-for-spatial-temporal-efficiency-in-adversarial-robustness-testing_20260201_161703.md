## Executive Summary

Video adversarial robustness testing currently faces a critical computational bottleneck due to the reliance on exhaustive frame-by-frame processing and full-image perturbations. Standard approaches demand prohibitive temporal and computational resources, rendering them impractical for real-world, high-volume environments such as UAV surveillance or social media streams. This inefficiency creates a significant gap between theoretical vulnerability assessments and practical security needs, as resource constraints prevent the deployment of robust testing models in latency-sensitive, mission-critical systems.

The paper introduces **DDSA (Dual-Domain Strategic Attack)**, a framework designed to optimize resource usage through a novel two-pronged strategy. In the temporal domain, DDSA employs a scenario-aware trigger function to filter video streams, bypassing non-critical frames and selecting only those with high class priority or model uncertainty. In the spatial domain, the framework utilizes Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to identify and perturb only the most influential pixel regions within the selected frames, rather than modifying the entire image. This dual-domain approach replaces exhaustive processing with targeted, surgical modifications to maximize impact per computation cycle.

The DDSA framework demonstrates the ability to achieve Attack Success Rates (ASR) comparable to state-of-the-art baselines (exceeding 90% in evaluated scenarios) while significantly reducing computational overhead. By focusing processing power exclusively on critical elements, DDSA achieves substantial conservation of resources, successfully enabling high-throughput processing capabilities of hundreds of images per minute. This performance level addresses the limitations of traditional exhaustive methods, which typically fail or introduce unacceptable latency under similar workloads due to hardware constraints.

The primary significance of this work lies in bridging the divide between theoretical adversarial testing and practical application. By integrating XAI to guide perturbations and prioritizing computational efficiency, DDSA enables robustness testing for resource-constrained systems that were previously difficult to secure. This contribution advances the field toward more sustainable and deployable security testing protocols, demonstrating that high efficiency in adversarial evaluation does not necessitate a sacrifice in attack potency.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Resource Efficiency:** The DDSA framework achieves substantial conservation of both temporal and computational resources by avoiding exhaustive frame-by-frame processing and full-image perturbations.
*   **Maintained Attack Effectiveness:** Despite the reduction in processing scope, the framework maintains high attack effectiveness, comparable to exhaustive methods.
*   **Practical Real-World Viability:** The approach overcomes the impracticality of resource-intensive methods, enabling deployment in resource-constrained, real-time environments.
*   **Optimized Processing Scope:** The framework successfully identifies and focuses processing power only on critical elements—specifically, critical frames and pixels.

## Methodology

The proposed methodology centers on the **DDSA (Dual-Domain Strategic Attack)** framework. It utilizes two distinct optimization strategies to maximize efficiency while maintaining potency:

1.  **Temporal Selectivity (Time Domain):**
    *   Employs a scenario-aware trigger function.
    *   Filters video streams to identify "**critical frames**."
    *   Selection is based on **class priority** and **model uncertainty**.

2.  **Spatial Precision (Space Domain):**
    *   Utilizes **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques.
    *   Locates and targets only the most influential pixel regions within selected frames.
    *   Applies perturbations strictly to these regions rather than the full image.
