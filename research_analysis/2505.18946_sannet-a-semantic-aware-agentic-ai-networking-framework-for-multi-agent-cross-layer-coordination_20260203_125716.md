# SANNet: A Semantic-Aware Agentic AI Networking Framework for Multi-Agent Cross-Layer Coordination

> ### 📋 Executive Summary
>
> As networking architectures evolve toward AI-native systems, managing the coordination of multiple autonomous agents across different layers—application, physical, and network—presents a significant challenge. A primary obstacle is that individual agents often operate with conflicting or divergent objectives, leading to suboptimal system performance and instability. Existing frameworks lack the mechanisms necessary for automatic goal discovery and self-orchestration, creating a critical gap that prevents the realization of fully autonomous, self-optimizing networks capable of handling complex operational environments.
>
> To address these coordination challenges, the authors propose **SANNet**, a Semantic-Aware Agentic AI networking framework. SANNet utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) controller to infer user semantic goals and dynamically assign agents to specific tasks. The core technical innovation lies in a dynamic weighting-based conflict-resolving mechanism that formulates multi-agent coordination as an optimization problem. The objective function minimizes the magnitude of the weighted sum of gradients subject to constraints, while a stochastic learning algorithm iteratively updates both the weighting factors and model parameters using three independent data samples, enabling the system to balance competing interests across the network stack effectively.
>
> The feasibility and theoretical soundness of SANNet were validated through a rigorous hardware prototype implemented on an Open RAN and 5G Standalone (5GS) core platform using NI 2944R USRP radios and high-performance computing (Intel i9-13900K, RTX 4090). In a specific immersive communication use case for video streaming Quality of Experience (QoE), the system successfully utilized semantic inference to optimize resolution, demonstrating real-world applicability. Key quantitative results from this implementation included a proven convergence rate for the conflict resolution mechanism of **$O(T^{-1/4})$**, along with validated bounds for both Conflict-Error (C-error) and Generalization-Error (G-error), confirming the system's stability and adaptability under operational conditions. This research makes a substantial contribution to the advancement of AI-native networking by bridging the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems and practical deployment.
