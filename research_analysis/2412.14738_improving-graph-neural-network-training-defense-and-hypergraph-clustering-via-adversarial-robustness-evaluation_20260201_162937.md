## Executive Summary

This paper tackles three critical impediments to the reliable deployment of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): susceptibility to adversarial attacks, inefficient training practices that neglect node-specific robustness, and the inherent difficulty of clustering complex hypergraph structures. Standard training methodologies typically treat all nodes uniformly, failing to account for the varying sensitivity levels inherent in graph data, which compromises model security in high-stakes environments. Furthermore, existing clustering algorithms struggle to manage the intricate higher-order relationships present in hypergraphs. Resolving these limitations is essential for advancing the analytical capabilities and security resilience of graph-based machine learning systems.

The authors introduce a unified framework centered on **Spectral Adversarial Robustness Evaluation** to quantify node sensitivity via spectral analysis and manifold alignment. Technically, the method employs the normalized Laplacian matrix and the Generalized Courant-Fischer Minimax Theorem to compute a weighted eigensubspace matrix (`V_s`), which partitions nodes into "robust" and "non-robust" categories. This classification enables a differential treatment strategy where non-robust samples are filtered or re-weighted. The framework operates through four phases: GNN Embedding, Manifold Capturing (using approximate k-NN graphs), Robustness Evaluation, and Training Set Construction. To address challenges in hypergraph clustering, the method utilizes identified robust nodes as stable spectral anchors; by propagating labels from these robust nodes to the broader structure, the algorithm effectively denoises the hypergraph, stabilizing the clustering process and enabling accurate partitioning of complex data.

Experimental validation confirms substantial gains in both computational efficiency and predictive performance. Most notably, the proposed approximate k-NN graph construction algorithm reduces time complexity from `O(|N|^2)` to `O(|N|log|N|)`, representing a major improvement in scalability for large-scale graphs. The training-set construction strategy successfully enhanced GNN training quality, while the developed defense algorithms significantly increased robustness against noise and adversarial perturbations compared to standard baselines. Additionally, when applied to hypergraph clustering, the proposed method demonstrated superior performance on benchmark datasets, validating its effectiveness not only on standard graphs but also on complex, higher-order structures.

## Methodology

The core methodology relies on spectral analysis to evaluate the adversarial robustness of nodes within a graph. This evaluation is used to classify nodes into **'robust'** and **'non-robust'** categories.

By applying differential treatment to these node types (e.g., filtering or weighting during training), the framework addresses key algorithmic challenges. This approach is utilized to:
1.  Construct specific training sets for optimized learning.
2.  Develop new algorithms for defense mechanisms against attacks.
3.  Improve clustering algorithms for both standard graphs and hypergraphs.
