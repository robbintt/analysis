## Executive Summary

Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated proficiency in single-turn, static visual tasks, yet their capability to perform complex, multi-step agentic reasoning remains largely unproven. The research addresses a critical gap in the evaluation of vision-centric agents, highlighting that existing benchmarks are inadequate for assessing true agentic potential. These prior methods rely heavily on synthetic data, single-turn queries, and limited visual modalities, failing to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios where agents must perform sequential reasoning, utilize tools, and adapt to dynamic environments. This discrepancy makes it difficult to gauge the actual readiness of LMMs for deployment in autonomous systems, necessitating a more rigorous evaluation framework that mirrors authentic, multi-modal decision-making processes.

The core innovation of this work is the introduction of **Agent-X**, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate deep, multimodal reasoning in agentic tasks. Technically, Agent-X employs a formal task structure $S_i$ comprising six distinct components: Multimodal Context ($V_i$), Query ($Q_i$), Tool Subset ($T_i$), Reasoning Trace ($R_i$), Final Answer ($A_i$), and Justification ($J_i$). The benchmark encompasses 828 manually verified tasks across six real-world environments—ranging from web browsing and autonomous driving to security surveillance—and supports single-image, multi-image, and video inputs. Furthermore, the authors introduce a novel, fine-grained evaluation protocol that moves beyond simple final-score metrics to assess step-level correctness, logical coherence, and the efficacy of tool integration within a defined ecosystem of 14 distinct tools (perception, visual operation, math, and artistic).

Evaluation results reveal a significant performance deficit among state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LMMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families. Despite their advanced capabilities, these models achieved a **full-chain success rate of less than 50%** on the Agent-X benchmark. The analysis identifies specific bottlenecks: models struggle primarily with deep reasoning chains and the effective integration of sequential tool use, rather than mere visual perception. In terms of scale and complexity, Agent-X surpasses existing benchmarks like GAIA (466 tasks) and GTA (229 tasks), providing a substantially more challenging dataset that exposes the limitations of current architectures in handling interpretive and generative tasks within authentic visual contexts.

This research significantly influences the field by establishing a new standard for evaluating vision-centric agents, shifting the focus from static question-answering to dynamic, process-oriented assessment. By identifying specific weaknesses in deep reasoning and tool use, the paper provides a clear roadmap for future research, urging the community to move beyond optimizing for single-turn responses. The public release of the Agent-X data and code facilitates reproducibility and enables the development of next-generation models capable of true agentic behavior. Ultimately, Agent-X serves as a critical reality check, demonstrating that while LMMs are progressing, substantial advancements are required to achieve reliable performance in complex, real-world applications.
