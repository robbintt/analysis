> ## 📝 Executive Summary
>
> Current software engineering paradigms struggle to keep pace with the demand for rapid adaptation and reduced time-to-market. While existing approaches like autonomic computing and self-adaptive systems offer some degree of autonomy, they are limited to patching, dynamic weaving, or configuration changes rather than true structural evolution.
>
> This paper addresses the critical need for information systems capable of full lifecycle autonomy—systems that can dynamically modify their own structure and behavior in response to changing requirements without human intervention. The key innovation presented is the formalization of "**self-coding information systems**" (SCIS) as a distinct sub-field within agentic AI.
>
> Technically, SCIS leverages fine-tuned language model (LLM)-based agents to generate, test, and redeploy the source code of their own subsystems at runtime. Unlike autonomic computing, which relies on patching, or self-adaptive systems, which utilize dynamic weaving, SCIS directly modifies source code. The authors provide a rigorous formal definition of these systems and an operational framework detailing core capabilities such as autonomous decision evaluation and runtime code generation.
>
> As this research is an extended abstract and position paper, it does not present empirical experimental results, quantitative metrics, or performance data derived from a prototype. Instead, the primary outputs are qualitative: a comprehensive formal definition of SCIS, a clear differentiation of the paradigm from related fields, and an operational framework outlining necessary system capabilities.
>
> This paper establishes a foundational theoretical framework for a new paradigm in software engineering, shifting the focus from human-maintained code to fully autonomous system evolution. By identifying SCIS as a distinct field, the authors provide a roadmap for future research, specifically highlighting the need for reference architectures, reliability strategies to manage non-determinism, and economic validation models.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Definition
A self-coding information system is defined as an information system capable of **generating and utilizing the source code of its own subsystems during runtime**. This capability is enabled primarily by agents based on fine-tuned language models.

### Architectural Differentiation
The paper distinguishes SCIS from existing paradigms:
*   **vs. Autonomic Computing:** SCIS focuses on full code generation rather than simple patching.
*   **vs. Self-Adaptive Systems:** SCIS generates entirely new code rather than using dynamic weaving techniques.
*   **vs. Configuration-Based Systems:** SCIS performs direct modification of source code rather than adjusting configuration parameters.

### Technical Trade-offs
The authors identify several critical challenges and trade-offs:
*   **Analyzability:** Difficulty in analyzing system behavior due to constant evolution.
*   **Functional Correctness:** Risks associated with non-determinism in code generation.
*   **Resource Utilization:** High demand for computational resources.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Need for specialized hardware to support fine-tuned LLM agents.

### Future Research Directions
*   Developing reliability strategies.
*   Creating reference architectures.
*   Establishing economic validation methods.
