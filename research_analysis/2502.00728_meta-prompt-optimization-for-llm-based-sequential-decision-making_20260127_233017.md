## 📝 Executive Summary

> This research tackles the challenge of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) performance for sequential decision-making tasks, where an agent must interact with an environment over multiple time steps. The efficacy of such agents is heavily dependent on the input prompt, specifically the "Task Description" (the goal) and the "Meta-Instruction" (behavioral guidance). Manual tuning of these components is resource-intensive and fails to generalize across complex environments. The paper addresses the critical need for a systematic, automated approach to prompt optimization that maximizes rewards, essential for the reliable deployment of autonomous agents in dynamic settings.

The core innovation is the **EXPO algorithm**, which formulates prompt optimization as an Adversarial Bandit problem. In this framework, each "arm" represents a distinct combination of a Task Description and a Meta-Instruction. The architecture employs a Neural Network Score Estimator ($M(g(\cdot); \theta)$) to predict rewards for these prompt pairs, while an LLM agent executes actions. Unlike traditional methods that optimize components in isolation, EXPO generates a domain of $k_1$ task descriptions and $k_2$ meta-instructions and focuses on jointly optimizing the pair $(D, I)$. The system trains the neural network using historical data where observed scores serve as labels, enabling the identification of high-performing prompt structures without complex reward modeling.

The algorithm is evaluated against standard decision-making metrics, including Regret, Cumulative Rewards, and Final Reward. While the provided text does not enumerate specific numerical benchmarks, the findings demonstrate that training the neural network with simple observed scores yields performance that rivals or exceeds more complex optimization schemes. Crucially, the results establish that jointly optimizing the task description and meta-instruction significantly outperforms optimizing these components separately, validating the hypothesis that the interaction between prompt elements is a critical determinant of agent success.

## Technical Details

### Algorithm & Modeling
*   **Framework:** Models prompt optimization as an **Adversarial Bandit problem**.
*   **Arms:** Each "arm" represents a specific combination of a Task Description ($D$) and a Meta-Instruction ($I$).
*   **Objective:** To minimize **Regret**.

### Architecture
*   **Neural Network Score Estimator:** Designated as $M(g(\cdot); \theta)$. Used to predict rewards for prompt pairs.
*   **LLM Agent:** Utilized for action selection based on the prompts.

### Optimization Strategy
The process involves three main steps:
1.  **Generation:** An LLM generates a domain of $k_1$ task descriptions and $k_2$ meta-instructions.
2.  **Joint Optimization:** The algorithm jointly optimizes the pair $(D, I)$ rather than treating them as isolated components.
3.  **Training:** The neural network is trained on historical data, using simple observed scores as labels.
