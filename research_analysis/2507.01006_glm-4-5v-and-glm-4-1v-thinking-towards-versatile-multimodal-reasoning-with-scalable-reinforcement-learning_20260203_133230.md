## 📝 Executive Summary

Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to achieve versatile, complex reasoning capabilities across diverse domains such as STEM, video understanding, and real-world grounding. Furthermore, there is a persistent performance gap between open-source models and proprietary closed-source systems, with smaller models often unable to match the reasoning depth of their larger counterparts due to inefficient training paradigms. This paper addresses the need for a scalable training methodology that can unlock latent reasoning potential in VLMs without relying solely on massive parameter scaling.

The core innovation is the introduction of the **GLM-4.xV family** and a novel training technique termed **Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS)**. The architecture utilizes a three-component design: an AIMv2-Huge Vision Encoder (supporting arbitrary resolutions via 2D-RoPE), an MLP Adapter, and a GLM-4 LLM Decoder enhanced with 3D-RoPE for temporal video processing. The training pipeline comprises four stages: large-scale multimodal pre-training (using over 10 billion image-text pairs), long-context continual training (up to 128K tokens), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and the critical RLCS stage. RLCS is designed to progressively challenge the model with complex tasks, effectively activating reasoning capabilities that standard pre-training fails to elicit.

**GLM-4.5V**, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with 106 billion total parameters (12 billion active), achieved state-of-the-art results among open-source models across 42 benchmarks. Notably, it outperformed the closed-source Gemini-2.5-Flash in Coding and GUI Agent tasks. Demonstrating high efficiency, the smaller **GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking** model outperformed the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks. Additionally, the GLM-4.1V-9B-Base model demonstrated superior pre-training efficacy on the MathVista pass@k metric, validating the critical role of the vision foundation model in setting performance upper bounds.

This research significantly narrows the gap between open and proprietary AI systems by releasing high-performance models that rival or exceed commercial alternatives in specific domains. The validation of RLCS offers a scalable new paradigm for enhancing multimodal reasoning, suggesting that complex behaviors can be unlocked through structured reinforcement learning. By demonstrating that a 9-billion parameter model can outperform a 72-billion parameter model on the majority of benchmarks, the study shifts the industry focus toward architectural efficiency and advanced training curricula, democratizing access to state-of-the-art multimodal agents capable of complex tool use and long-context understanding.
