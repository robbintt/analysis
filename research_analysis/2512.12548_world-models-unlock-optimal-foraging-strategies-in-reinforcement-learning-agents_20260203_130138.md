## Executive Summary

> Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle with the "patch-leaving problem" in complex environments—knowing precisely when to leave a depleting resource patch to maximize long-term reward. This issue is critical because standard model-free agents fail to handle the credit assignment required for such long-horizon planning and do not align with ecological optimality principles like the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT). Bridging the gap between artificial decision-making and biological efficiency is essential for developing adaptive, resource-conscious AI systems that can operate effectively in scenarios requiring complex resource management.
>
> The researchers introduce a model-based approach using the **DreamerV2** architecture, which learns a compressed world model to simulate future states within a visual Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Unlike model-free baselines that rely solely on reactive history, DreamerV2 employs predictive representations to perform "imagination-based planning." By operating in a modified 2D "Commons Harvest" environment where resource patches provide exponentially decaying rewards, the agent uses these anticipatory capabilities to evaluate future outcomes. The core innovation identifies predictive world modeling as the specific mechanism allowing agents to naturally converge to the mathematically optimal strategy defined by the MVT.
>
> Over $1.5 \times 10^6$ training steps across four distinct map configurations, the model-based DreamerV2 agent significantly outperformed standard model-free counterparts. While the R2D2 agent failed to learn entirely and PPO demonstrated suboptimal behavior, DreamerV2 successfully adapted to varying environmental constraints. In test scenarios with patch distances of 3, 5, 7, and 9 units, the model-based agent's Patch Residence Time aligned closely with the theoretical MVT optimum. Evaluations based on 25 runs per scenario showed that DreamerV2 optimized its Gameplay Score by accurately judging when to leave depleting patches, a decision pattern that closely mirrors the efficient behavior of biological foragers.
>
> These findings establish a fundamental link between ecological principles and artificial intelligence, proving that bio-inspired architectures yield computationally optimal solutions. By demonstrating that predictive world models are the key to unlocking MVT-compliant behavior, this work provides a blueprint for developing AI systems that are both highly efficient and interpretable. This advances the field of Explainable AI (XAI) by suggesting that agents grounded in biological and ecological laws naturally exhibit decision patterns that are easier for humans to understand and trust. Ultimately, the research positions world models as a critical component for future adaptive systems requiring sophisticated resource management and long-term strategic planning.
