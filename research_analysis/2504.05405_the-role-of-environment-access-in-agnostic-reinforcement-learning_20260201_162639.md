## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental statistical limits of **agnostic policy learning** in reinforcement learning (RL), a setting where an agent must identify the best policy within a restricted class $\Pi$ without the assumption that the class contains an optimal policy. This problem is critical because it reflects real-world scenarios where approximation errors and model misspecification are inevitable. The paper specifically investigates whether standard models of environment access—such as local simulators or reset distributions—are sufficient to achieve sample-efficient learning. By distinguishing between value-based learning (predicting rewards) and policy-based learning (controlling actions), the authors highlight a significant gap in theoretical understanding: while value-based methods are often tractable, it remains unclear under what conditions policy learning is statistically feasible without strong representational assumptions.

The key innovation lies in the introduction of a **"policy emulator,"** a novel architectural construct designed to bridge the gap between environment access and policy optimization. Technically, the policy emulator functions as a tabular MDP constructed to approximate the value functions of the policy class $\Pi$. The authors utilize this emulator within a proposed algorithm (PLHR) to reason about policy performance without requiring direct interaction with the potentially optimal policy. This approach shifts the focus from representational conditions—such as policy completeness—to the specific mechanics of how the agent accesses and queries the environment, specifically leveraging the combination of a local simulator and a $\mu$-reset distribution.

The study establishes rigorous boundaries for the tractability of agnostic policy learning through quantitative complexity metrics. The results demonstrate that policy learning is statistically intractable under standard online RL access, even when the agent is provided with either a local simulator or a $\mu$-reset distribution individually. Specifically, the paper proves that sample complexity lower bounds scale exponentially with the time horizon $H$ in these settings. Consequently, existing algorithms like Cost-Permissible Improvement (CPI) and Posterior Sampling for Dynamic Programming (PSDP) fail in the absence of policy completeness assumptions. However, the paper achieves a positive result: for Block MDPs, policy learning becomes statistically tractable only when the agent is granted both a local simulator and a $\mu$-reset distribution, yielding sample complexity bounds that scale polynomially (specifically $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^3/\epsilon^2)$) rather than exponentially.

This work significantly influences the field of theoretical RL by formally characterizing the "environment access" requirements for agnostic learning. It corrects the misconception that local simulators or reset mechanisms are independently sufficient for policy optimization, proving instead that their combination is necessary for statistical tractability. By introducing the policy emulator and proving the necessity of combined access models, the paper provides a new theoretical foundation for future algorithm design. These findings guide researchers in developing more robust RL systems that can operate efficiently under agnostic assumptions, ensuring that algorithmic architectures are matched with the appropriate types of environment interaction.

## Key Findings

*   **Intractability of Agnostic Learning:** Agnostic policy learning is statistically intractable even with local simulators or reset distributions ($\mu$-reset), contrasting with value-based learning which remains tractable.
*   **Failure of Standard Algorithms:** Existing algorithms like **CPI** (Cost-Permissible Improvement) and **PSDP** (Posterior Sampling for Dynamic Programming) fail in the agnostic setting without policy completeness assumptions.
*   **The "Block MDP" Exception:** Policy learning becomes statistically tractable for **Block MDPs** *only* when provided with both a local simulator and a $\mu$-reset distribution simultaneously.
*   **Relative Difficulty:** The research establishes that policy learning is inherently harder than value-based learning in this context.
*   **Complexity Scaling:** Negative results show sample complexity lower bounds scale exponentially with horizon $H$, whereas the positive result (with combined access) scales polynomially.

## Methodology

The study employs a rigorous analytical framework to evaluate the limits of learning under environment constraints:

*   **Problem Definition:** Defines agnostic policy learning as the task of finding the best policy within a class $\Pi$ without assuming it contains the optimal policy for the environment.
*   **Environment Access Models:** Investigates the impact of specific environment access mechanisms on sample efficiency:
    *   **Local Simulators:** Models that allow querying next states given a state and action.
    *   **$\mu$-Reset Distributions:** Mechanisms allowing the agent to reset the environment state to a specific distribution.
*   **Algorithmic Proposal:** Introduces a new algorithm based on a **'policy emulator'**—a tabular MDP designed to approximate the value functions of the policy class $\Pi$.
*   **Theoretical Analysis:** Uses the policy emulator to derive sample complexity bounds and prove tractability (or intractability) under specific access conditions.
