## 📝 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the disruption caused by the rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into an educational sector built on legacy systems designed for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). It argues that traditional educational technology is ill-equipped to leverage the intent-based, conversational potential of generative AI, a limitation that is fundamentally altering the relationship between learners and educators. This misalignment creates an urgent need to reflect on existing learning paradigms, as legacy methods cannot support the emerging standard of natural language interaction.

The study employs a comprehensive review-based analysis to catalog existing use cases and evaluate the successes and failures of LLMs in educational settings. Based on this empirical review, the author conceptualizes a fundamental shift in human-computer interaction, proposing Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) as the necessary successor to traditional GUIs. The key contribution is a strategic framework for next-generation educational technology that addresses the specific technical and pedagogical requirements of this transition toward intent-based, ubiquitous computing. The analysis reveals that the high velocity of LLM adoption has established a new benchmark for user engagement, rapidly shifting learner expectations. To align with these expectations, the research identifies specific hurdles that must be overcome: the technical challenge of migrating from visual to language-based systems, the pedagogical difficulty of accurately interpreting user intent, and the complexity of managing the evolving dynamic between human learners and AI-mediated instruction.
