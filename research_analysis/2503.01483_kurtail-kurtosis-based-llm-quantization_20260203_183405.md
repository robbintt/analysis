## Executive Summary

Large Language Models (LLMs) demand substantial computational resources, driving the need for aggressive 4-bit quantization of weights, activations, and KV caches to reduce memory footprints and latency. However, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) faces a persistent challenge: activation outliers that cause significant accuracy degradation when models are compressed to low precision. While prior rotation-based methods like SpinQuant have attempted to mitigate these outliers, they typically require expensive multi-GPU clusters for the quantization process, creating a barrier to accessibility for researchers and practitioners with limited hardware.

KurTail introduces a novel PTQ scheme that utilizes a Kurtosis-based rotation to statistically optimize the distribution of activations. The core innovation lies in minimizing kurtosis—a statistical measure of distribution "tailedness"—to effectively smooth out outliers that hinder quantization. Technically, the method performs layer-wise optimization on the Stiefel Manifold using a proxy network and Caley optimizers (Adam or SGD). KurTail employs a hybrid rotation strategy consisting of "fusible" rotations ($R_1, R_2$) that merge directly with model weights for zero runtime overhead, and "online" rotations ($R_3, R_4, R_5$) for the KV cache that introduce minimal computational cost during inference.

In comparative benchmarks, KurTail sets a new standard for performance, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. It achieves a 13.3% boost in MMLU accuracy and a 15.5% reduction in Wiki perplexity compared to QuaRot. Against the resource-intensive SpinQuant, KurTail delivers a 2.6% gain in MMLU accuracy and a 2.9% reduction in perplexity. Furthermore, the method demonstrates robustness by reducing maximum activation values by over 99% in both Multi-Head Self-Attention and Feed-Forward Networks. Crucially, KurTail achieves these results with high efficiency, requiring only a single NVIDIA H100 or A100 GPU and approximately one hour to quantize the LLaMA3-70B model, whereas SpinQuant necessitates a four-GPU setup.

KurTail represents a significant advancement in the field of model compression by successfully decoupling high-performance quantization from massive hardware requirements. By enabling the simultaneous 4-bit quantization of weights, activations, and the KV cache on a single GPU, the method democratizes access to state-of-the-art LLM compression, making it viable for consumer-grade hardware. This approach not only establishes a new benchmark for PTQ accuracy and perplexity but also provides a practical pathway for deploying massive models in resource-constrained environments without sacrificing the quality required for complex reasoning tasks.
