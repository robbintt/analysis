## **Executive Summary**

This research addresses the critical challenge of compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) methods, such as weight truncation and pruning (e.g., LLM-Pruner), often result in catastrophic performance failure or significant accuracy degradation. The authors propose **Dobi-SVD**, a novel framework that applies SVD to the activation matrix ($xW$) rather than the weight matrix, leveraging the Eckart-Young-Mirsky Theorem for optimal decomposition.

Key innovations include a continuous relaxation function using a tanh-based curve to optimize truncation points via a multi-objective loss function. The method utilizes Incremental Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) for weight updates and employs Taylor Expansion to prevent gradient explosion during backpropagation. Furthermore, Parameter Renormalization and Remapping ensure the output distribution facilitates easier quantization.

Evaluated on **Llama-7b** (WikiText2), Dobi-SVD achieved a perplexity score of **6.36** at a **0.8 compression ratio**, significantly outperforming baselines. The approach is highly efficient, requiring the training of only 224 parameters and approximately 8 GPU hours. By enabling high compression with minimal perplexity increase and facilitating low-bit quantization (16-bit to 8-bit), Dobi-SVD establishes a new standard for efficient model compression.
