## Executive Summary

Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a diverse spectrum of methodologies—ranging from response-based and feature-based to relation-based approaches—each with unique benefits for model compression. However, integrating these heterogeneous techniques into a unified training pipeline remains a significant unresolved challenge. Current strategies typically rely on simultaneous integration, which often triggers optimization conflicts where competing loss functions interfere with one another, degrading performance. Conversely, sequential approaches tend to suffer from catastrophic forgetting, as the student model loses knowledge acquired in earlier stages while adapting to new tasks.

To address these issues, the authors introduce **SMSKD (Sequential Multi-Stage Knowledge Distillation)**, a framework designed to decouple heterogeneous KD methods by training the student model in discrete, sequential stages. The core technical innovation involves the use of a **"frozen reference model,"** which anchors the knowledge acquired from previous stages, effectively mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting inherent in sequential training. Additionally, SMSKD implements an adaptive weighting mechanism governed by the **Teacher's True Class Probability (TCP)**. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the reference loss per sample, balancing the retention of prior knowledge with the integration of new information.

Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SMSKD delivers significant quantitative improvements over existing baselines. On ImageNet, using a ResNet-34 to ResNet-18 teacher-student pair, SMSKD achieved a top-1 accuracy of **72.95%**, outperforming both the standard Knowledge Distillation baseline (71.98%) and the state-of-the-art SAKD method (approx. 72.3%). Similar gains were observed on CIFAR-100, where SMSKD improved accuracy to 74.54% compared to the 73.56% baseline. Crucially, these performance gains do not compromise efficiency; the framework incurred negligible computational overhead. SMSKD represents a significant advancement in model compression by providing the first generalized, "plug-and-play" solution for integrating multiple KD methods without optimization conflicts.
