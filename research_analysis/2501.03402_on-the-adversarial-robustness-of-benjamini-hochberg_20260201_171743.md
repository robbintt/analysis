## Executive Summary

This research addresses a critical vulnerability in the **Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure**, the foundational method for controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in large-scale hypothesis testing. While BH is traditionally valued for its distributional robustness, this paper demonstrates that it lacks **adversarial robustness**, leaving it susceptible to test-time attacks where a malicious actor can manipulate statistical findings. This poses a severe security risk in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and anomaly detection, where compromised statistical validity can lead to incorrect regulatory decisions or overlooked threats.

The authors provide a rigorous theoretical framework for analyzing these attacks by modeling an omniscient adversary operating under a **'c-Perturb' model** (an $l_0$-norm constraint) capable of modifying at most $c$ p-values to maximize the False Discovery Proportion (FDP). The paper's primary technical innovation lies in reframing the BH procedure as a **'balls into bins' process**, which is mathematically connected to generalized ballot problems. This combinatorial approach allows for an information-theoretic derivation of non-asymptotic guarantees. The authors introduce specific attack strategies, '**INCREASE-c**' and '**MOVE-1**', which manipulate p-values to artificially inflate the number of false rejections, moving beyond empirical observations to establish formal bounds on FDR degradation.

The analysis reveals that the BH procedure’s FDR guarantees are brittle and easily broken. Under standard non-adversarial conditions, BH guarantees $FDR(BH_q) \le \pi_0 q \le q$ (typically with $\pi_0 \ge 0.90$). However, the authors demonstrate that a perturbation budget as low as **$c=1$** (modifying a single test score) is sufficient to violate these guarantees. By providing non-asymptotic lower bounds, the authors quantify the expected increase in FDP, showing that strategic perturbation can dramatically elevate the error rate. These findings were validated through computational experiments across both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) p-values and those exhibiting Positive Regression Dependency on a Subset (PRDS).

These findings represent a paradigm shift for the field of multiple hypothesis testing, establishing that standard statistical control mechanisms are insufficient in adversarial environments. By exposing the fragility of BH—a gold standard in scientific inference—the work identifies a significant security liability in critical inference pipelines. This contribution bridges the gap between multiple testing procedures and combinatorial probability and will likely drive future research toward developing robustified FDR control methods that can withstand test-time manipulation, fundamentally changing how researchers approach validity in data-driven applications.

## Key Findings

*   **Critical Vulnerability:** The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure is vulnerable to minimal adversarial perturbations that can compromise its control over the False Detection Rate (FDR).
*   **Minimal Attack Surface:** Research shows that modifying as few as **a single test score** ($c=1$) can be sufficient to break FDR control.
*   **Quantified Risk:** The authors provide non-asymptotic guarantees quantifying the expected FDR adjustment under attack.
*   **Domain Impact:** This lack of robustness represents a significant security liability in critical domains like drug discovery and anomaly detection.

## Results

*   **Standard Guarantees:** Under non-adversarial conditions, BH guarantees $FDR(BH_q) \le \pi_0 q \le q$ (assuming proportion of true nulls $\pi_0 \ge 0.90$).
*   **Violation of Bounds:** A perturbation budget as low as **$c=1$** is sufficient to break FDR guarantees.
*   **Dependency Handling:** Experimental scopes included both **i.i.d. p-values** and those exhibiting **PRDS dependency**.
*   **Fidelity Impact:** Strategic perturbation can dramatically decrease model fidelity, turning the distributional robustness of BH into a liability regarding adversarial robustness.
