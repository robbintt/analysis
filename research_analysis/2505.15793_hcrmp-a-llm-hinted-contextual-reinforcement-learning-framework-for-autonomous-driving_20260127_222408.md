## 📋 Executive Summary

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Reinforcement Learning (RL) for autonomous driving faces critical barriers, including a high propensity for LLM hallucinations (with only a ~57.95% non-hallucination rate) and frequency mismatch between discrete language generation and continuous vehicle control. These issues pose significant safety risks when relying on LLMs to generate driving policies directly, particularly in real-time applications requiring low latency.

This paper introduces **HCRMP**, a weakly coupled framework proposing a novel 'LLM-Hinted RL' paradigm. In this approach, the LLM functions solely as a semantic hint generator for state augmentation rather than a direct policy controller. The architecture consists of three core modules: the **Augmented Semantic Representation (ASR)** module; the **Contextual Stability Anchor (CSA)**, which utilizes external knowledge and Multi-Critic networks to generate reliability weights; and the **Semantic Cache Module (SCM)**, which employs Top-K embedding search to synchronize low-frequency LLM guidance with high-frequency RL control loops.

Empirical validation in the CARLA simulator demonstrates HCRMP's efficacy, achieving an **80.3% task success rate** and reducing collision rates by **11.4%** under safety-critical conditions. When benchmarked against *HighwayLLM* and *LearningFlow*, HCRMP exhibited lower vulnerability to hallucinations and output instability, proving its ability to leverage semantic insights without succumbing to semantic errors.

The significance of this research lies in its paradigm shift from direct LLM control to a hinted, reliability-focused architecture that effectively mitigates hallucination risks in safety-critical environments.

## 🧬 Methodology

The paper proposes an **LLM-Hinted Contextual Reinforcement Learning** paradigm designed to leverage the semantic reasoning of LLMs while mitigating their reliability issues.

*   **Core Concept:** The LLM is used **solely to generate semantic hints** for state augmentation rather than direct control policies.
*   **Architecture:** The HCRMP framework is built upon three core modules designed to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and continuous control:
    1.  **Augmented Semantic Representation Module:** Extends the state space to include high-level semantic context.
    2.  **Contextual Stability Anchor Module:** Enhances reliability by utilizing a knowledge base to weigh the utility of LLM hints.
    3.  **Semantic Cache Module:** Integrates low-frequency LLM guidance with high-frequency RL control loops to ensure smooth operation.
