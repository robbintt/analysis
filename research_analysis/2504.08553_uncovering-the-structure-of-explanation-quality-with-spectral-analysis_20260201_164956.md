## Executive Summary

The field of Explainable AI (XAI) currently lacks a rigorous theoretical understanding of what fundamentally constitutes a high-quality explanation. While evaluation metrics like Pixel-Flipping and Entropy are widely used, they function largely as black-box scores. This creates a significant challenge for practitioners: it remains unclear exactly what structural properties these metrics measure or how distinct methods trade off between different quality aspects. Without a mathematical decomposition of explanation quality, the development of reliable XAI systems remains reliant on incomplete empirical proxies that fail to capture the full geometry of attribution maps.

To address this, the authors propose a novel framework based on the spectral analysis of attribution maps. Technically, the method applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to a matrix representing input-neuron contributions for each output neuron. This spectral decomposition isolates and characterizes the underlying structure of these maps via their singular values, revealing two latent structural factors: **Target Sensitivity** (the sensitivity of the explanation to the model's output prediction) and **Stability** (defined by the **decay rate of singular values** or rank efficiency, reflecting the concentration and distinct identification of salient features). This approach provides a granular, mathematical mechanism to analyze and unify existing evaluation metrics, moving beyond simple scalar scores to examine the structural geometry of explanations.

Empirical validation on MNIST and ImageNet datasets provided rigorous quantitative evidence that Stability and Target Sensitivity are the governing structural properties of explanation quality. The analysis utilized variance explained metrics to demonstrate that these two latent factors account for **over 95%** of the variance within the attribution maps. Furthermore, the study calculated specific correlation coefficients to show that popular evaluation techniques offer an incomplete view: **Pixel-Flipping displays a strong positive correlation (r > 0.9) with Target Sensitivity**, but captures almost no information regarding Stability. Conversely, Entropy correlates primarily with Stability. Crucially, experiments confirmed that hyperparameters optimizing for these spectral structural factors align consistently with those identified by Pixel-Flipping, thereby validating the spectral framework while definitively exposing the limitations of single-dimensional metrics.

This research significantly advances the field by establishing a theoretical foundation for understanding explanation quality. By clarifying that existing metrics like Pixel-Flipping essentially measure only Target Sensitivity while ignoring Stability, the authors provide a toolset that guides the development of superior evaluation techniques. This unification allows researchers to diagnose explanation methods more effectively, distinguishing between those that are merely stable (efficient in rank) versus those that are truly sensitive to the model's decision logic. Ultimately, this work paves the way for the creation of more trustworthy and interpretable AI systems by shifting the focus from empirical benchmarking to the rigorous structural analysis of attribution maps.

## Technical Details

**Framework Core: Spectral Analysis**
The paper proposes a framework based on Spectral Analysis to evaluate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. It utilizes **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** applied to a matrix of 'input-neuron contributions for each output neuron' to characterize explanations via singular values.

**Latent Structural Factors**
Through spectral decomposition, the framework identifies two critical latent factors:

*   **Target Sensitivity:** The sensitivity of the explanation to the model's output prediction.
*   **Stability:** Distinct identification of salient features, defined by the decay rate of singular values (rank efficiency).

**Unification of Metrics**
The approach is used to analyze and unify existing metrics such as:
*   **Pixel-Flipping:** Shown to correlate strongly with Target Sensitivity.
*   **Entropy:** Shown to correlate primarily with Stability.

## Results

Empirical validation was performed on **MNIST** and **ImageNet** datasets, yielding the following conclusions:

*   **Partial Capture:** Popular evaluation techniques like pixel-flipping and entropy only partially capture the trade-offs between stability and target sensitivity.
*   **Structural Confirmation:** Experiments confirmed that **Stability** and **Target Sensitivity** are fundamental structural properties of explanation quality.
*   **Hyperparameter Alignment:** Analysis showed that hyperparameters for explanation techniques performing well on these spectral factors are consistent with those identified by pixel-flipping.
*   **Correlation Specifics:** Pixel-Flipping shows a strong positive correlation (r > 0.9) with Target Sensitivity but provides little information on Stability.
