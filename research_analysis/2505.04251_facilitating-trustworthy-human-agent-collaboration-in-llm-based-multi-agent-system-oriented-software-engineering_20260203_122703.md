## 📝 Executive Summary

> The integration of LLM-based Multi-Agent Autonomous (LMA) systems into Software Engineering (SE) workflows offers superior capabilities over singular agents but introduces critical challenges in human-machine interaction. The core issue is the unstructured allocation of tasks between humans and autonomous agents, which creates significant ambiguity regarding accountability and trust. Without a defined collaboration strategy, organizations struggle to maintain reliability and transparency in high-stakes engineering environments. This lack of clear responsibility distribution hinders the adoption of powerful LMA technologies, creating a need for frameworks that ensure automated processes remain compliant with ethical standards and human oversight requirements.
>
> This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses these challenges by adapting the **RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)** model to map specific roles to both human and machine agents. Technically, the architecture utilizes heterogeneous LLM-assigned agents with predefined SE roles—such as Product Owner and Requirements Engineer—operating within a synthesized DevOps structure. To resolve the conflict between sequential Waterfall planning and iterative Scrum development, the framework embeds these methodologies into distinct operational phases governed by the RACI matrix, allowing for structured requirements definition followed by agile execution.
>
> This workflow is supported by Test-Driven Development (TDD) and the Life Cycle Governance (LCG) framework, while Chain-of-Thought prompting is employed to enhance agent reasoning. Crucially, the system aligns technical operations with the **EU AI Act and Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI**, mapping agent behaviors to seven key regulatory requirements. As the research is currently in progress, the paper does not yet provide quantitative experimental results or performance benchmarks. Instead, the study validates the framework's feasibility through a comprehensive example implementation that details the execution of SE tasks by the defined agents. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the internal logic of the RACI matrix in action, showing how accountability is maintained when agents transition between phases of the software lifecycle. To bridge the gap to future empirical evidence, the author outlines a specific validation plan aimed at executing empirical studies to generate performance metrics, moving beyond theoretical design to practical verification.
>
> The significance of this research lies in establishing a structural precedent for responsible Human-Agent Teaming (HAT) in software engineering. By formally integrating Trustworthy AI guidelines and accountability mechanisms directly into the system architecture—rather than treating them as external constraints—the framework provides an actionable pathway for organizations to adopt multi-agent automation. This work shifts the focus of HAT research from purely maximizing automation efficiency to ensuring that human control and ethical risk mitigation are foundational components of system design, facilitating the reliable deployment of advanced LMA systems in industry settings.
