## 📝 Executive Summary

Industrial fault diagnosis and question answering demand high precision and trustworthiness. Current state-of-the-art multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs), while capable of sophisticated collaborative reasoning, face significant deployment barriers due to uncontrolled iterations and unverifiable outputs. These issues, combined with substantial computational overhead, make them unsuitable for edge deployment in safety-critical environments.

This paper introduces **Knowledge Graph-guided Multi-Agent System Distillation (KG-MASD)**, a novel framework that formulates the distillation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The core innovation lies in integrating a knowledge graph as a verifiable structured prior, which enriches state representations and ensures reasoning convergence. By grounding collaborative reasoning in structured knowledge, KG-MASD generates high-confidence instruction-tuning data used to jointly distill reasoning depth and verifiability into lightweight student models.

Evaluations on an industrial QA dataset demonstrate substantial performance gains, with accuracy improvements ranging from **2.4% to 20.1%** compared to baseline models. This research successfully bridges the gap between complex multi-agent reasoning and practical, deployable AI, enabling trustworthy deployment on resource-constrained hardware without sacrificing safety or accuracy.
