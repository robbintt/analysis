## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical challenge of providing accurate, actionable, and contextually relevant agricultural decision support to smallholder farmers facing the complexities of climate change. Traditional AI systems often fail in this domain due to their static, single-agent nature, susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to integrate real-time, localized data. This gap is particularly detrimental to vulnerable rural communities and non-English speakers who require reliable, multilingual guidance on strategies such as water conservation and soil management to ensure their livelihoods and food security.

To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce **AgroAskAI**, a novel multi-agent reasoning framework built on a modular, role-specialized architecture. Unlike static models, this system employs a chain-of-responsibility approach, utilizing specialized agents to coordinate autonomous tasks. The technical core integrates external APIs (OpenCage, OpenWeather) and a curated document repository with an OpenAI Large Language Model. Crucially, the architecture incorporates an internal governance structure featuring a "Reviewer Agent" to validate outputs and mitigate hallucinations, while supporting dynamic, multilingual interactions.

Evaluation of 20 region-specific trial runs demonstrated AgroAskAI’s superior performance compared to baseline systems like ChatGPT and CROPWAT across multiple metrics. Notably, AgroAskAI delivered water conservation implementation steps in 13 instances where ChatGPT failed entirely and provided historical weather data in 16 runs compared to ChatGPT's 3. The research signifies a pivotal advancement in applying agentic AI architectures to sustainable agriculture, offering a scalable solution for accountable decision support.

## Methodology

The researchers developed and evaluated AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system designed specifically for climate adaptation decision support. The methodology is characterized by:

*   **Modular Architecture:** A role-specialized structure employing a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents.
*   **Dynamic Reasoning:** Incorporation of real-time tools and datasets to enable dynamic collaborative reasoning rather than relying on static knowledge bases.
*   **Governance Mechanisms:** Implementation of built-in governance structures to specifically address and mitigate the issue of hallucinations.
*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Conducting experiments on common agricultural queries to assess the system's ability to generate coherent, locally relevant, and multilingual strategies.
