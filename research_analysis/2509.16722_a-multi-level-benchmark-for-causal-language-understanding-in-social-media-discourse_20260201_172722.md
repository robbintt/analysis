## Executive Summary

Current Natural Language Processing (NLP) research on causal understanding relies heavily on benchmarks derived from formal, structured text, which fails to capture the nuances of informal, user-generated discourse found on social media. Existing datasets predominantly focus on explicit causal markers, neglecting the implicit reasoning that frequently occurs in unstructured conversations. This limitation creates a significant gap for models tasked with understanding real-world public health discussions, where causal links are often suggested rather than stated, and language is highly variable.

This paper introduces **CausalTalk**, a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate causal language understanding across four distinct dimensions: binary causal classification, explicit vs. implicit causality distinction, cause-effect span extraction, and causal gist generation. Technically, the work employs a novel hybrid annotation strategy grounded in Fuzzy-Trace Theory. This framework combines gold-standard labels from domain experts with silver-standard labels generated by GPT-4o, which are subsequently verified by humans. This multi-level approach allows for the creation of a rich dataset that supports both discriminative (e.g., classification, extraction) and generative (e.g., gist generation) model evaluations.

The research team processed a massive raw corpus consisting of 239,222 Reddit submissions and 19,138,266 comments, filtered down to a high-quality final dataset of 10,120 annotated posts focused on COVID-19 discourse. Within this dataset, a subset of 600 entries underwent fine-grained span annotation to support detailed extraction tasks. When compared to existing benchmarks such as SemEval-2010 Task 8 (1,325 causal instances) and CausalTimeBank (318 causal instances), CausalTalk represents a substantial increase in scale and complexity specifically tailored to public health contexts during the 2020–2024 timeframe.

CausalTalk fills a critical void in NLP by providing the first comprehensive resource dedicated to implicit causality in informal social media text. By bridging fine-grained detection with gist-based reasoning, the dataset enables researchers to benchmark and improve a wider variety of model architectures, particularly in handling the subtleties of unstructured human communication. Furthermore, the methodological contribution of a hybrid, LLM-assisted annotation pipeline offers a replicable framework for creating future high-quality, multi-dimensional datasets without sacrificing the rigor of human oversight.

## Key Findings

*   **CausalTalk Dataset:** Introduced a large-scale dataset of **10,120 annotated Reddit posts** focused on COVID-19 public health discourse spanning 2020 to 2024.
*   **Multi-Task Support:** The benchmark supports four distinct causal tasks:
    1.  Binary causal classification.
    2.  Distinguishing explicit vs. implicit causality.
    3.  Cause-effect span extraction.
    4.  Causal gist generation.
*   **Hybrid Annotation Strategy:** Successfully implemented a dual-standard labeling approach, combining gold-standard labels from domain experts with silver-standard labels generated by **GPT-4o** and verified by humans.
*   **Bridging the Gap:** Bridges the divide between fine-grained causal detection and gist-based reasoning, facilitating the evaluation of both discriminative and generative NLP models.
