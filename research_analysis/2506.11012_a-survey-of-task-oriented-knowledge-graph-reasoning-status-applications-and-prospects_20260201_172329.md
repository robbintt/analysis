### 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the fragmentation and lack of comprehensive coverage in existing literature regarding Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR). Previous surveys have failed to systematically summarize the full spectrum of KGR tasks, often overlooking downstream applications and emerging, complex reasoning paradigms. This gap is significant because KGR serves as the foundation for cognitive intelligence in high-impact sectors such as public security, healthcare, and financial risk assessment.

The key innovation is a novel, task-oriented taxonomy that categorizes KGR approaches into six distinct types: **static single-step, static multi-step, dynamic, multi-modal, few-shot, and inductive KGR**. The authors structure their survey around three dimensions—primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and challenging reasoning tasks—to provide a complete picture of the domain.

Technically, the survey synthesizes advanced methodologies, including Meta-Learning & Optimization for few-shot scenarios, Time-Aware Mechanisms for dynamic contexts, and Graph Representation Learning (e.g., Cycle patterns, Dual Graph Learning) for handling inductive settings. Furthermore, the authors uniquely explore the intersection of KGR with Large Language Models (LLMs), analyzing how generative AI is reshaping reasoning capabilities. The outcome is a qualitative synthesis of 40 key references mapped to the proposed taxonomy, offering a future roadmap that integrates the potential of LLMs with advanced reasoning paradigms.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Task-Oriented Categorization:** KGR approaches are systematically categorized into six distinct types: static single-step, static multi-step, dynamic, multi-modal, few-shot, and inductive KGR.
*   **Gap in Literature:** Previous surveys have failed to provide a comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks, specifically lacking coverage on downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms.
*   **LLM Integration:** Advanced techniques, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), are significantly impacting the development and capabilities of Knowledge Graph Reasoning.
*   **Sector Impact:** KGR plays a foundational role in enabling cognitive intelligence for high-impact sectors such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare, and financial risk assessment.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The authors employ a comprehensive, **task-oriented survey methodology**. Unlike traditional subject-based reviews, this approach categorizes methods based on three structural dimensions:

1.  **Primary Reasoning Tasks:** The core inference mechanisms.
2.  **Downstream Application Tasks:** Real-world utility and implementation.
3.  **Potential Challenging Reasoning Tasks:** Emerging and complex paradigms.

Additionally, the methodology explores the intersection and impact of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** on KGR, analyzing how modern generative AI influences traditional reasoning methods.
