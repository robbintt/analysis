## Executive Summary

Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) face a critical data bottleneck that hinders complex video reasoning capabilities. Specifically, existing datasets lack sufficient multi-hop questions and video-grounded Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, forcing models to rely on static image priors or textual biases rather than actual video content. This deficiency leads to frequent hallucinations and an inability to perform multi-step temporal reasoning tasks such as tracking state changes, understanding causality, or counting events.

The core innovation of **ReWatch-R1** is a data-centric approach combining a **Multi-Agent ReAct synthesis framework** with a unique reinforcement learning strategy. The authors developed a three-stage pipeline to construct the **ReWatch Dataset**:
1.  **Hierarchical video captioning**
2.  **High-difficulty QA generation** with bias filtering
3.  **Agentic CoT synthesis**

In the synthesis stage, a "Reasoner" agent generates hypotheses while an "Observer" agent verifies them against video frames, simulating a human-like re-watching process to ensure grounding. For model training, ReWatch-R1 utilizes Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by **Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR)**. This RLVR employs a custom Observation & Reasoning (O&R) reward mechanism that evaluates not only answer accuracy but also the fidelity of the reasoning trace to the visual observations, effectively penalizing hallucinations.

ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) average performance across five challenging video reasoning benchmarks, significantly outperforming strong baselines such as VideoRFT, Video-Chat-R1, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B. Qualitative analysis confirms the model’s enhanced ability to handle complex temporal tasks while substantially reducing hallucination rates. This research represents a significant paradigm shift, demonstrating that complex reasoning can be unlocked primarily through high-quality, agentic data synthesis rather than architectural changes alone.
