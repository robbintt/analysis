## Executive Summary

> **Problem**
> Current uncertainty analysis methods in computational mathematics suffer from path dependence, where calculation results change arbitrarily based on the order of operations. Standard techniques, such as interval arithmetic, often incorrectly treat intermediate instances of the same variable as independent inputs, failing to accurately track the propagation of input uncertainty. Furthermore, these methodologies typically ignore intrinsic numerical errors inherent in standard library functions, which can compound to invalidate simulation results. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a rigorous framework designed to maintain consistency regardless of execution order while accurately modeling uncertainty propagation through complex mathematical transformations.

> **Innovation**
> The paper introduces "Statistical Taylor Expansion," a framework that replaces precise inputs with random variables of known distributions to compute statistical moments. The core innovation, "Variance Arithmetic," tracks variable dependencies throughout the calculation process, preventing the method from assuming independence where none exists. To derive mean and variance, the method employs infinite series based on "Bound Moments" ($\kappa(n)$) and standardization. The practical feasibility of these infinite series is established through a convergence proof demonstrating that the ratio of bound moments to a bound function approaches zero as the order increases, effectively justifying series truncation. The method accounts for complex interactions terms such as "Bounding Leakage" and "Uncertainty Bias," and specifically addresses "Distributional Poles and Zeros"—mathematical singularities where variance propagation behaves non-linearly—ensuring the analysis remains robust.

> **Results**
> The study derived explicit propagation formulas for exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and power functions, validating them through Monte Carlo simulations. As sample sizes approach infinity, results for fundamental operations converged to standard statistical expectations, including convolution and product distributions. A significant finding regarding hardware limitations revealed that standard 64-bit floating-point resolution (machine epsilon of $10^{-16}$) is insufficient for accurate uncertainty simulation when input uncertainties range between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-6}$. This deficiency is attributed to catastrophic cancellation during subtraction operations inherent in the variance calculations. Additionally, the research identified that periodic errors in standard library trigonometric functions can resonate with specific input signals, concluding that library outputs must be accompanied by a quantified uncertainty deviation to ensure validity.

> **Impact**
> This research establishes Variance Arithmetic as a technically robust solution for standardizing numerical uncertainty calculations. By successfully managing higher-order interaction terms and singularities without sacrificing path independence, the method offers a significant improvement over traditional interval arithmetic for engineering and scientific computing. The findings compel a reconsideration of numerical software design, suggesting that numerical integrity requires standard library functions to return not just a scalar value, but a defined measure of their inherent uncertainty, thereby creating a pathway for more reliable error handling in technical computing.

## Methodology

The proposed method extends conventional Taylor expansion by replacing precise input variables with random variables of known distributions to compute means and standard deviations. It tracks the dependency of input uncertainties during intermediate steps rather than assuming independence. An implementation termed **'variance arithmetic'** was tested across a broad spectrum of mathematical applications.

## Technical Details

The method utilizes **Statistical Taylor Extension**, treating precise input variables as random variables with known distributions to compute the following:

*   **Mean:** $(f)$
*   **Standard Deviation:** $(\Delta f)$
*   **Reliability Factor:** $(\beta)$

**Core Mathematical Framework:**

*   **Value Representation:** Imprecise values are represented as pairs $(x, \Delta x)$, with **statistical precision** defined as:
    $$ P(x) \approx \frac{\Delta x}{|x|} $$
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Uncorrelated uncertainties.
    *   Mean-reverting condition: $\kappa(1) = 0$.
*   **Series Derivation:** The framework employs **Bound Moments** ($\kappa(n)$) and standardization to derive infinite series formulas for mean and variance.
*   **Error Handling:** It accounts for:
    *   *Bounding Leakage*
    *   *Uncertainty Bias*
    *   *Singularity Types*: Distributional Poles and Zeros.
*   **Comparison:** Implemented as 'Variance Arithmetic', it offers path independence and higher-order interaction terms compared to standard interval arithmetic.

## Results

The paper provides explicit formulas for mean and variance propagation for exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and power functions. Key findings include:

*   **Hardware Limitations:** Floating-point arithmetic resolution ($10^{-16}$) is insufficient for inputs requiring precisions of $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-6}$.
*   **Convergence Analysis:** The ratio of bound moments to a bound function approaches zero as order increases.
*   **Verification:** As sample size $N \to \infty$, the formulas for addition/subtraction and multiplication converge to standard convolution and product distribution results.
*   **Library Function Impact:** Numerical errors in library functions, particularly periodic errors in trigonometric functions, were shown to resonate with signals, suggesting that library function values should accompany an uncertainty deviation.
