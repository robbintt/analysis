> ## **Executive Summary**
>
> Current Large Language Model (LLM) assistants face a fundamental limitation: they are restricted to text-based output, rendering them ineffective for teaching operational or psychomotor skills. This creates a critical gap in high-stakes fields such as aviation, where mastering manual tasks requires muscle memory and physical coordination that verbal instruction or text alone cannot provide. This paper addresses this cognitive-physical divide, arguing that for LLMs to be truly useful in hands-on training and safety-critical scenarios, they must evolve beyond semantic understanding to facilitate physical execution.
>
> To bridge this gap, the researchers introduce **FlightAxis**, a novel system that integrates LLMs with Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) to enable direct physical guidance. The system utilizes a technical pipeline named **'Align-Analyze-Adjust'**: the LLM parses written operational manuals to derive procedural logic, analyzes the user's real-time status, and translates semantic instructions into specific EMS patterns. These patterns induce involuntary muscle contractions in the user's forearm, physically guiding their movements through tasks. The implementation is governed by three core design principles—**Accurate Guidance**, **Accompanied Guidance**, and **Learner Control**—ensuring the AI functions as a collaborative partner rather than an autonomous controller.
>
> User studies evaluating the system demonstrated measurable performance improvements across several key metrics. The FlightAxis system achieved statistically significant reductions in task completion times and notably increased user engagement and error awareness. Comparative analysis against established baselines highlighted specific functional advantages: while LLM-only assistance was effective in improving reaction times and general accuracy, the integration of kinesthetic (EMS) assistance was uniquely responsible for reducing completion times among novices. Furthermore, the system's error-reduction capabilities were shown to be comparable to the precision benefits observed in surgical haptic technologies.
>
> This work significantly expands the utility of LLMs by validating their capacity to drive physical human-computer interaction for skill acquisition. By successfully demonstrating that AI can control human body movements through semantic understanding, the research establishes a new modality for Human-LLM collaboration.

## **Technical Details**

### **System Architecture**
The FlightAxis system combines two primary technologies:
1.  **Large Language Model (LLM):** Generates personalized guidance and translates semantic text into specific control instructions.
2.  **Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS):** Induces involuntary muscle contractions to guide forearm movements physically.

### **Operational Workflow**
The system utilizes a three-step workflow:
*   **Align:** Retrieve expertise from operational manuals.
*   **Analyze:** Monitor and analyze the user's real-time status.
*   **Adjust:** Convert AI output into EMS signals to adjust physical movement.

### **Design Principles**
*   **Accurate Guidance:** Provides direct force to ensure correct movement.
*   **Accompanied Guidance:** Offers real-time assistance throughout the task.
*   **Learner Control:** Ensures the human trainee retains the ability to override AI suggestions.

## **Contributions**

*   **Modality Expansion:** Addresses the limitation of text-only LLM assistants by incorporating kinesthetic feedback for operational skill learning.
*   **Validation of Human-LLM Collaboration:** Demonstrates the viability of AI directly controlling human body movements for skill acquisition.
*   **Novel Application of EMS:** Provides a concrete use case where EMS is driven by semantic understanding to teach complex psychomotor skills.
