## Executive Summary

Current neurosymbolic frameworks in Vision Language Models (VLMs) suffer from weak grounding, where symbolic reasoning components are not strictly anchored to the visual data within images. This disconnect leads to "hallucinated" symbols in reasoning rules and introduces label bias, where models rely on linguistic priors rather than actual image statistics. This issue is particularly critical in high-stakes, low-data domains such as medical imaging, where reliability and interpretability are paramount but current black-box neural models lack transparency.

The authors introduce **Concept-RuleNet (CRN)**, a multi-agent neurosymbolic framework that separates "System-1" perception (VLMs) from "System-2" reasoning (LLMs) through a rigorous four-stage pipeline. The core innovation is a grounding mechanism that first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from images and then conditions symbol discovery on these concepts using Shannon Entropy minimization ($H(S|x) < H(S)$). This ensures that symbols are derived from real image statistics rather than text labels. A symbolic agent (GPT-4o-mini) then composes these grounded symbols into executable first-order rules, which are verified by a vision agent (LLaVA) before final inference. An advanced extension, **CRN++**, further refines this by incorporating counterfactual reasoning and a Mixed Normal Form logic (combining DNF and CNF) to handle complex logical structures.

Concept-RuleNet outperformed state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% across five diverse benchmarks, including medical datasets (BloodMNIST, DermaMNIST) and satellite imagery (UC-Merced, WHU). The framework demonstrated superior reliability by reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols within reasoning rules by up to 50%. In specific failure case analyses, such as the 'Basophil' class in BloodMNIST, ungrounded models scored only 0.48, whereas CRN’s visually anchored approach significantly improved performance by mitigating reliance on spurious correlations.

This research establishes a new standard for integrating interpretable symbolic reasoning with black-box neural perception without sacrificing predictive accuracy. By successfully mitigating label bias and hallucinations through direct visual concept mining, Concept-RuleNet provides a robust architecture for trustworthy AI. The findings are particularly significant for the medical imaging field, demonstrating that neurosymbolic approaches can be effectively applied to complex, underrepresented domains where data scarcity and the need for explainable diagnostics are major hurdles.

*   **Enhanced Reliability:** The approach reduces the occurrence of hallucinated symbols within reasoning rules by up to **50%**, significantly enhancing trustworthiness.
*   **Complex Domain Mastery:** The framework proved effective on complex domains, specifically **medical-imaging benchmarks** (e.g., BloodMNIST) and underrepresented natural-image datasets (e.g., satellite imagery).

## Methodology

The authors propose **Concept-RuleNet**, a multi-agent neurosymbolic system designed to integrate visual grounding with interpretable reasoning through a four-stage pipeline:

1.  **Multimodal Concept Generation:**
    Discriminative visual concepts are mined directly from a subset of training images to establish a visual vocabulary.
2.  **Grounded Symbol Discovery:**
    Visual concepts condition the discovery of symbols to anchor them in real image statistics, ensuring they are visually grounded rather than textually inferred.
3.  **Rule Composition:**
    A Large Language Model (LLM) composes grounded symbols into executable first-order rules, creating the logic structure for reasoning.
4.  **Vision Verification & Inference:**
    A vision verifier quantifies symbol presence to trigger rule execution alongside black-box neural models, ensuring the final prediction aligns with visual evidence.
