> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> This paper addresses the prohibitive computational costs associated with deploying large-scale AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models, which range from 1B to 3B parameters, creating a barrier to their use on resource-constrained edge hardware. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a standard efficiency technique for general transformers, existing methods fail for ARVGs due to three distinct structural and distributional hurdles: severe channel-wise outliers in Adaptive LayerNorm (AdaLN) activations, highly dynamic token-wise activations (including "sink tokens"), and significant sample-wise distribution mismatches. These challenges render standard quantization approaches ineffective, necessitating a specialized framework to enable efficient inference for these advanced generative models.
>
> The authors propose **PTQ4ARVG**, the first training-free PTQ framework tailored for ARVGs, composed of three algorithmic components designed to overcome these specific hurdles. First, **Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS)** mitigates channel-wise outliers by mathematically deriving optimal per-channel scaling factors using Taylor series expansion and Hessian approximations to bound quantization loss. Second, **Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ)** handles dynamic activations without runtime overhead by leveraging fixed sequence lengths; it applies offline, position-specific quantization parameters to AdaLN inputs and separate parameters for sink tokens in linear layers. Third, **Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC)** resolves sample-wise mismatches by utilizing an entropy-based strategy to select calibration samples that accurately represent the training distribution.
>
> The framework was validated across major model architectures including VAR-d30 (2B), RAR-XXL (1.5B), MAR-Huge (1B), and PAR (3B). PTQ4ARVG successfully maintains visual generation quality comparable to full-precision (FP) baselines while operating at aggressive 6-bit and 8-bit quantization levels. For instance, the method effectively compresses the PAR-3B model, which suffers from a baseline inference latency of greater than 3 seconds per image, without sacrificing fidelity. Crucially, this performance is achieved without requiring retraining, and the STWQ module introduces zero additional calibration overhead, validating the framework's efficiency.
