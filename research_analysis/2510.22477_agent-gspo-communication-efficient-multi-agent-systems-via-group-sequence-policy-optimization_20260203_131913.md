## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical bottleneck of prohibitive communication costs in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). In existing "free-for-all" architectures, agents often communicate excessively, leading to high token consumption, increased latency, and economic inefficiency. This verbosity limits the scalability and practical viability of deploying multi-agent systems for complex reasoning tasks, as the computational overhead of communication often outweighs the benefits of collaboration.

The authors introduce **Agent-GSPO**, a novel framework built upon the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm. Unlike standard approaches that treat communication as a byproduct of the task, GSPO utilizes sequence-level reinforcement learning to directly optimize for "token economy." The core technical innovation lies in a communication-aware reward function that explicitly penalizes verbosity while maximizing task performance. By training agents to minimize unnecessary communication tokens without sacrificing accuracy, the algorithm achieves stable and memory-efficient convergence, effectively teaching agents the economic value of information.

Agent-GSPO achieved new state-of-the-art results across seven specific reasoning benchmarks: **GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, MBPP, StrategyQA, Sports Understanding, and Checkmate**. Crucially, this superior performance was delivered while drastically reducing resource usage; the framework successfully cut communication overhead by **nearly 50%** compared to existing methods. This demonstrates that the framework not only outperforms baselines in reasoning capability but does so with substantially greater economic efficiency.

The significance of this work lies in establishing a practical blueprint for creating multi-agent systems that are both scalable and economically viable. Beyond raw metrics, the training process yielded an emergent behavior known as "strategic silence," where agents learned to autonomously withhold communication unless it was strictly necessary to solve the task. By proving that high performance does not require high communication bandwidth, Agent-GSPO shifts the optimization focus for MAS from purely accuracy-based metrics to efficiency-aware objectives, paving the way for the deployment of complex, multi-agent architectures in resource-constrained or cost-sensitive commercial environments.
