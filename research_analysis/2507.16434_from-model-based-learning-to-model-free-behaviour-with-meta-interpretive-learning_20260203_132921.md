## Executive Summary

### **Problem**
This research addresses the fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence of bridging the gap between model-based reasoning—which relies on predictive modeling and planning but is often computationally expensive—and model-free behavior, which offers fast, reactive execution. The core problem lies in creating an autonomous agent that retains the comprehensive problem-solving capabilities of a planner while achieving the efficiency of a reactive system. By addressing this dichotomy, the study aims to enable agents that can navigate novel environments independently, combining the strengths of predictive accuracy with real-time responsiveness without requiring the model to be present during execution.

### **Innovation**
The key innovation is a hybrid three-stage architecture utilizing Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) to systematically transition from model-based logic to model-free execution. First, the system employs the Louise MIL framework to induce a Model-based Solver—a definite clause logic program capable of recursive planning (e.g., A* search) within a fully observable environment. Second, this Solver generates solution traces for navigation problems. Third, MIL uses these traces to induce a Model-free Controller, implemented as a Deterministic Finite State Transducer (Mealy Machine) defined by 4-tuples `(q, o, a, q')`. This approach effectively distills complex planning rules into a reactive policy composed of 4 internal states, 4 discrete actions, and 15 observation labels, operating within a search space of 960 possible tuples.

### **Results**
Experimental validation demonstrated a 100% success rate in performance equivalence, where the Model-free Controller successfully solved every navigation problem that the Model-based Solver was capable of resolving. The methodology was tested across randomly generated mazes and "Lake maps," including specific test cases such as Maze A (requiring a Right-Down-Left sequence) and Maze B (Right-Down-Up). The resulting Controller operates with high efficiency, utilizing only 4 internal states and 4 action labels to handle 15 distinct observation types. While the system achieved total equivalence in defined scenarios, the research noted theoretical limitations: as the Controller is a Regular Automaton, it is restricted to a single action sequence per observation pattern and cannot adapt to different path topologies without retraining.

### **Impact**
This study significantly contributes to the field by confirming the feasibility of synthesizing model-free reactive agents from model-based inductive logic programming. It establishes a novel framework for creating agents capable of independent operation in novel environments, effectively removing the need for a model during execution without sacrificing the problem-solving integrity derived during training. Furthermore, the work highlights the utility of Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) as a powerful tool for constructing the necessary model-based components, offering a viable pathway for developing hybrid systems that leverage the precision of symbolic logic with the speed of behavioral automation.

## Key Findings

*   **Performance Equivalence:** The problem-solving ability of the model-free Controller is equivalent to that of the model-based Solver.
*   **100% Success Rate:** Experiments showed a comprehensive success rate where every navigation problem solved by the Solver was also solved by the Controller.
*   **Broad Validation:** Performance equivalence was validated across randomly generated mazes and lake maps.
*   **Hybrid Feasibility:** The study confirms the feasibility of creating an autonomous agent that combines predictive capabilities with model-free action.

## Methodology

The research methodology relies on a three-stage process centered around Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL):

1.  **Induction of Model-based Solver:** MIL is employed to induce a model-based Solver capable of recursive planning.
2.  **Training Mechanism:** The learned model-based Solver is utilized as a training mechanism to generate solution traces.
3.  **Verification:** The methodology involves a direct comparison of the two agents (Solver vs. Controller) on grid navigation problems to verify if the Controller can replicate the Solver's planning capabilities.

## Technical Details

**Architecture Overview**
The paper proposes a hybrid architecture using Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) to transition from model-based reasoning to model-free execution. The pipeline is implemented in three stages:

1.  **Stage 1:** MIL learns a Model-based Solver (a logic program for recursive planning like A* search using the Louise system).
2.  **Stage 2:** The Solver generates solution traces for navigation problems.
3.  **Stage 3:** MIL learns a Model-free Controller (reactive policy) from these traces.

**System Components**

*   **Model-based Solver:**
    *   Represented as definite clauses in Prolog.
    *   Requires a fully observable environment model.
*   **Model-free Controller:**
    *   Type: Deterministic Finite State Transducer (Mealy Machine).
    *   Composition: 4-tuples `(q, o, a, q')`.
    *   Observation: Local passability via **15 distinct labels**.
    *   Actions: **4 discrete actions** (up, right, down, left).
    *   State Space: **4 internal states**.
    *   Search Space: 960 possible tuples.

**Execution & Libraries**
*   **Execution:** Utilizes stack-machines and SLAM integration to avoid cycles. Supports nondeterministic Finite State Controllers (FSCs).
*   **Software Stack:** Key libraries used include Louise, Controller Freak, and Grid Master.

## Results

The experimental validation demonstrated robust performance across several test environments:

*   **Overall Metrics:** Achieved a **100% equivalence success rate**.
*   **Test Environments:** Randomly generated mazes, "Lake maps", and specific test cases "Maze A" and "Maze B".
*   **Specific Test Cases:**
    *   **Maze A:** FSC successfully navigated using a *Right, Down, Left* sequence.
    *   **Maze B:** FSC successfully navigated using a *Right, Down, Up* sequence.
*   **Theoretical Limitations:** Since FSCs are Regular Automata, they are limited to a single action sequence for a given observation pattern. They cannot solve mazes with different path topologies without retraining.
