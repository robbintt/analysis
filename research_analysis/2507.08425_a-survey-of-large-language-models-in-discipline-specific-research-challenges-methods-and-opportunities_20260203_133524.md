## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical lack of systematic understanding regarding the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into discipline-specific research. As LLMs increasingly permeate academia, they are reshaping methodologies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration; however, the landscape remains fragmented, with researchers struggling to identify the most effective strategies for adapting general-purpose models to highly specialized domains.

A comprehensive synthesis is required to bridge the gap between general AI capabilities and the rigorous demands of fields ranging from hard sciences to humanities. The core innovation is a **dual-perspective framework** that categorizes existing research through a *Technical Perspective* (methodological adaptation) and an *Applicability Perspective* (domain-specific deployment).

Technically, the paper establishes a taxonomy based on interaction with external information, dividing methodologies into **Internal Knowledge Optimization** (Continued Pre-training/CPT, Supervised Fine-tuning/SFT, RLHF) and **External Interaction** (Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation/RAG, Agent-based Methods, and Tool-use Integration). This structure allows the authors to systematically map how specific architectures—such as Transformer models and Hybrid Expert Models (MoE)—are optimized for distinct scientific requirements.

The survey highlights significant quantitative benchmarks and domain-specific successes, noting that open-source models are increasingly competitive with closed-source alternatives. A standout example is DeepSeek V3, a Mixture-of-Experts model with 671 billion parameters and a training cost of $5.57 million, which rivals top proprietary systems. Despite these successes, the results indicate persistent challenges, primarily hallucinations and gaps in domain-specific knowledge. This work serves as a foundational resource for researchers navigating the complex intersection of AI and specialized research.

## Key Findings

*   **Reshaping Research:** LLMs are fundamentally reshaping research methodologies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration across numerous fields, though a systematic understanding of this integration is currently lacking.
*   **Technical Enhancement:** The effectiveness of LLMs in discipline-specific contexts is significantly enhanced through specific technical methodologies, including:
    *   Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
    *   Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    *   Agent-based approaches
    *   Tool-use integration
*   **Broad Applicability:** LLMs are actively contributing to a wide spectrum of disciplines, successfully performing tasks in:
    *   **Hard Sciences:** Mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.
    *   **Humanities & Social Sciences:** Various qualitative and historical analyses.
*   **Challenges Remain:** Despite recent advances, the integration of LLMs into specific disciplines faces prevailing challenges (e.g., hallucinations), necessitating critical examination and highlighting promising avenues for future research.

## Methodology

The authors conducted a **systematic literature survey** that categorizes existing research efforts using a dual-perspective framework:

1.  **Technical Perspective:** Analyzes methodological approaches used to adapt LLMs (e.g., fine-tuning, RAG).
2.  **Applicability Perspective:** Analyzes domain-specific deployments across various academic fields.

Additionally, the methodology involves a critical examination of prevailing challenges and a synthesis of recent advances to highlight future research directions.
