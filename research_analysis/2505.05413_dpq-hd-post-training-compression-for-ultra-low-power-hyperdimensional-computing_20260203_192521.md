## Executive Summary

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) offers a promising, brain-inspired paradigm for edge AI due to its robustness and efficiency, but its deployment on ultra-low power microcontrollers is severely hindered by high memory footprints and computational demands. While model compression is essential for edge deployment, existing state-of-the-art techniques typically require extensive retraining to maintain accuracy. This retraining process is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating a bottleneck that contradicts the energy constraints of edge environments. Therefore, the industry faces a critical need for compression methods that can drastically reduce model size and accelerate inference without the overhead of retraining.

The authors introduce **DPQ-HD** (Decomposition-Pruning-Quantization), a comprehensive post-training compression framework specifically designed for HDC systems that eliminates the need for retraining. The approach optimizes the entire HDC pipeline through a three-step process: Low-Rank Decomposition breaks down the projection matrix into smaller components to reduce storage and multiply-accumulate operations (MACs); Pruning removes redundancy from both the decomposed components and class hypervectors; and Quantization reduces numerical precision to 8-bit integers to meet hardware constraints. Additionally, DPQ-HD implements a progressive inference strategy with an early exit mechanism, allowing the system to halt computation once confidence thresholds are met, thereby further conserving energy.

DPQ-HD demonstrates substantial improvements across key performance metrics, achieving a 20–100× reduction in memory footprint compared to uncompressed HDC workloads. Despite this aggressive compression, the framework maintains near floating-point performance with a marginal accuracy drop of only 1–2%. By removing the retraining requirement, DPQ-HD reduces optimization time by up to 100×. In real-world scenarios on ultra-low power microcontrollers, the system enables inference speedups of up to 56×, matching the accuracy of state-of-the-art retraining-based techniques while outperforming existing post-training compression methods.

This work establishes a new benchmark for the viability of Hyperdimensional Computing on resource-constrained edge hardware. By decoupling model compression from the retraining process, DPQ-HD significantly lowers the barrier to deploying efficient AI models on battery-powered devices. The successful integration of decomposition, pruning, and quantization with early exit mechanisms not only proves that HDC can be optimized for ultra-low power environments but also provides a reproducible pathway for future research into energy-efficient, brain-inspired computing architectures.

## Methodology

The authors propose **DPQ-HD** (Decomposition-Pruning-Quantization), a post-training compression algorithm tailored for Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) systems. The core philosophy of this methodology is to integrate compression techniques without the computational cost of model retraining.

The approach consists of:
1.  **Integrated Compression:** A seamless combination of decomposition, pruning, and quantization applied directly to the trained model.
2.  **Progressive Inference:** A novel strategy featuring an early exit mechanism. The system monitors confidence levels during inference and stops computation immediately once sufficient confidence is achieved, optimizing specifically for ultra-low power hardware constraints.

## Technical Details

DPQ-HD is a post-training compression framework for Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) that requires no retraining. It optimizes the entire HDC pipeline via a three-step process:

### 1. Low-Rank Decomposition (D)
*   **Target:** The projection matrix ($P$).
*   **Mechanism:** Breaks the matrix into smaller matrices ($P_1, P_2$).
*   **Benefit:** significantly reduces storage requirements and decreases the number of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations.

### 2. Pruning (P)
*   **Target:** Decomposed components and class hypervectors.
*   **Mechanism:** Identifies and removes redundant connections and vectors.
*   **Benefit:** Further sparsifies the model, reducing both memory footprint and computational load.

### 3. Quantization (Q)
*   **Target:** Numerical precision of the model parameters.
*   **Mechanism:** Reduces precision down to 8-bit integers.
*   **Benefit:** Ensures compatibility with microcontroller constraints and reduces energy consumption associated with data movement.

### End-to-End Efficiency
The approach ensures efficiency by compressing both the encoding and classification stages of the pipeline simultaneously, rather than treating them as isolated components.
