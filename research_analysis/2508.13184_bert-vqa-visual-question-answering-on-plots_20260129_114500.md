# BERT-VQA: Visual Question Answering on Plots
*Tai Vu; Robert Yang*

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

This research investigates the applicability of state-of-the-art Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques, specifically cross-modality alignment mechanisms, to structured scientific plots. The core hypothesis was that natural image methods might be over-engineered for this specific domain.

To test this, the authors developed **BERT-VQA** and a "Joint Fusion" variant to benchmark against a traditional LSTM/ResNet baseline using the PlotQA dataset. The evaluation revealed a surprising result: there was no significant performance advantage for the complex transformer-based models. While BERT-VQA achieved roughly **56.6% accuracy**, the baseline achieved **56.37%**. These findings demonstrate that computationally expensive alignment mechanisms are not essential for interpreting structured plots, suggesting that efficient architectures tailored to scientific visualizations may outperform blindly applied natural image models.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Hypothesis Disproven:** The core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential for aligning plot components with question phrases was **disproved**.
*   **Architecture Variation:** There is a notable variation in the appropriateness of different model architectures. Specifically, the cross-modality alignment found in general VisualBERT models does not translate as effectively to the structured domain of plots as initially expected.
*   **Domain Specificity:** The study highlights that the "Plot Question Answering" subtask presents specific difficulties that general natural image VQA models do not automatically resolve.
*   **Complexity vs. Necessity:** The results offer counter-intuitive insights, suggesting that complex cross-modality alignment modules may not be necessary for structured data like plots.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The study involved the development and comparison of three distinct architectures to evaluate performance on the PlotQA dataset:

1.  **BERT-VQA (Primary Model):** Based on the VisualBERT architecture, utilizing a pretrained ResNet 101 as the image encoder. It explores the potential of vision-language transformers.
2.  **Joint Fusion Variant:** An extension of BERT-VQA that adds a parallel global CNN features path (ResNet 101) concatenated with VisualBERT outputs. This aims to capture global trends that might be missed by region-based processing alone.
3.  **Baseline Architecture:** A traditional sequential model consisting of an LSTM (for language processing), a CNN (for vision), and a shallow classifier, utilizing late fusion for predictions.

## 📈 Results

The experimental results supported the conclusion that general alignment techniques are less effective on structured plots than on natural images.

*   **Performance Parity:** The complex BERT-VQA models did not significantly outperform the LSTM/CNN baseline. The difference in accuracy was negligible (~0.2%).
