## Executive Summary

This research addresses the inherent inefficiency and rigidity of existing Large Language Model (LLM) systems that rely on static, monolithic architectures or manually crafted multi-agent configurations. Current approaches often utilize a "one-size-fits-all" strategy, applying uniform resource allocation regardless of query complexity or domain requirements. This limitation leads to suboptimal performance and inflated inference costs, as systems lack the agility to scale computational effort up or down based on the specific demands of a task. As LLMs are deployed in increasingly diverse and complex environments, the need for architectures that can dynamically balance accuracy with computational efficiency has become a critical challenge for the field.

The authors introduce **AutoMaAS**, a novel framework that integrates Neural Architecture Search (NAS) principles with Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to create a self-evolving architecture for LLMs. Technically, the system employs Dynamic Operator Lifecycle Management to automatically generate, fuse, and eliminate agents (operators) based on real-time performance-cost analysis. This is supported by a multi-objective optimization function that simultaneously targets accuracy and inference cost, adjusting parameters dynamically in response to input query complexity. Furthermore, the framework utilizes online feedback integration and decision tracing mechanisms to continuously refine the architecture, ensuring the system evolves autonomously rather than relying on static, pre-defined configurations.

In evaluations across six benchmarks—GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, MBPP, MultiArith, and GAIA—AutoMaAS achieved performance improvements of **1.0% to 7.1%** compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specific high scores included 98.8% on MultiArith, 97.2% on HumanEval, and 95.4% on GSM8K. Crucially, the framework realized a relative cost of **58%** compared to a Single-Agent Chain of Thought baseline (100%), representing a **3% to 5% reduction** in inference costs over previous automated design methods. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of the dynamic lifecycle and multi-objective optimization, with operator fusion achieving a 75% success rate and operator modification a 67% success rate.

This research establishes a new standard for automated multi-agent system design by validating that self-evolving architectures can outperform static, hand-crafted models. By demonstrating that continuous online feedback and dynamic resource allocation are viable for LLM deployment, AutoMaAS provides a blueprint for building cost-efficient, high-performance AI agents. The framework’s proven generalizability across various datasets and LLM backbones (including Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4) suggests a significant shift away from manual architecture tuning toward automated, adaptive systems capable of maintaining high accuracy while strictly managing computational resources.
