## Executive Summary

The field of information retrieval has historically faced a significant trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. While Dense Retrieval (DR) models have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy, they require substantial computational resources and memory footprint due to the need to store and compare high-dimensional vectors. Conversely, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) offers superior efficiency and scalability through inverted indexes but has typically lagged behind DR in retrieval quality. Furthermore, leveraging the capabilities of modern Causal Large Language Models (LLMs) for retrieval tasks is difficult, as their unidirectional attention mechanism is unsuitable for the bidirectional contextualization required for effective document understanding. This paper addresses the challenge of closing the performance gap between sparse and dense models while maintaining the resource efficiency necessary for scalable deployment.

The authors introduce **LACONIC**, a family of learned sparse retrievers built upon the Llama-3 architecture (1B, 3B, and 8B parameters). The core innovation is a novel two-phase training curriculum designed to convert causal LLMs into effective bidirectional retrievers. Phase 1 involves Weakly Supervised Pre-finetuning using LoRA on approximately 9 million query-document pairs to adapt the model for bidirectional attention. Phase 2 focuses on High-signal Finetuning using a curated dataset of 690,000 triplets with hard negatives to maximize discriminative power. The model utilizes the SPLADE framework with a bi-encoder architecture—employing Max-pooling, ReLU activation, and log(1+x) rescaling—optimized via an InfoNCE loss function with FLOPs regularization to enforce sparsity.

LACONIC demonstrates that sparse retrieval can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art dense models. On the MTEB Retrieval benchmark, the flagship LACONIC-8B model achieved a score of 60.2 nDCG, ranking 15th globally. Crucially, this performance is attained with drastically reduced resource requirements; the model requires 71% less index memory than equivalent dense retrieval systems. Furthermore, LACONIC exhibits high compute efficiency, training on significantly smaller datasets than many competitors while maintaining the ability to operate effectively on commodity CPU hardware without requiring specialized GPU infrastructure for inference.

This work represents a paradigm shift in the search technology landscape by proving that high accuracy does not necessitate high memory costs. By successfully bridging the gap between learned sparse and dense retrieval, LACONIC enables organizations to deploy state-of-the-art search capabilities on standard, commodity hardware, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for advanced information retrieval systems. The effective conversion of general-purpose causal LLMs into specialized, efficient sparse retrievers opens new avenues for scalable search architectures, suggesting that future systems can prioritize both semantic richness and operational efficiency without compromise.
