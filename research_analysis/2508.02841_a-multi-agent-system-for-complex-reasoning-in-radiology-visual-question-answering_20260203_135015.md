## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical limitations of current Radiology Visual Question Answering (RVQA) systems, specifically the unreliability of monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) when performing complex diagnostic reasoning. Existing models frequently suffer from factual inaccuracies, hallucinations, and cross-modal misalignment—issues that pose significant risks in high-stakes clinical environments. This work is vital because it targets the need for AI tools that can accurately synthesize visual radiological data with textual clinical context, ensuring the reliability required for medical decision support.

The authors propose a specialized **Modular Multi-Agent System (MAS)** that decomposes complex reasoning into a sequential three-stage pipeline, moving away from standard black-box approaches. The system utilizes three distinct agents: the **Context Understanding Agent (CUA)**, which employs embedding-based retrieval and LLM reranking to classify tasks and supply context; the **Multimodal Reasoning Agent (MRA)**, which integrates visual evidence with textual context using an MLLM to generate answers; and the **Answer Validation Agent (AVA)**, which uses an LLM to estimate confidence and validate or revise responses based on specific threshold logic.

A key technical contribution is the use of **"model disagreement filtering"** to curate the evaluation dataset. This method involves aggregating predictions from multiple diverse MLLM baselines and isolating instances where the models produce conflicting outputs. These disagreements signal high complexity or ambiguity, allowing the researchers to construct a test set of "hard cases" that rigorously stress-tests reasoning capabilities.

Evaluations on this rigorously curated dataset of hard cases demonstrated the system's superior performance over strong MLLM baselines. The proposed MAS achieved measurable improvements in key performance indicators, including higher accuracy and F1 scores compared to monolithic models. By utilizing the AVA's confidence threshold logic, the system significantly lowered the rate of factual inaccuracies, hallucinations, and cross-modal misalignment. Case studies further validated these quantitative improvements, confirming the system's ability to maintain high reliability and interpretability even when faced with consistently challenging and diagnostically complex inputs that typically confuse existing state-of-the-art models.

This paper significantly influences the field by establishing a rigorous evaluation standard for medical AI, utilizing model disagreement filtering to create robust test sets that expose model weaknesses more effectively than standard benchmarks. It demonstrates the viability of multi-agent approaches in creating explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications capable of handling the nuanced reasoning required in diagnostics.
