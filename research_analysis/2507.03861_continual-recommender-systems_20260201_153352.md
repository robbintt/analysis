## 📋 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical challenge of adapting recommender systems to highly dynamic environments where user preferences, item pools, and popularity trends shift continuously. Unlike static machine learning domains, recommender systems must perform real-time adaptation without suffering from **catastrophic forgetting**—the tendency of neural networks to lose previously learned information when learning new tasks.

The work identifies a significant gap in the general Continual Learning (CL) literature, which predominantly focuses on domains like vision and graphs while failing to address recommendation-specific constraints. These constraints include the need for per-user stability-plasticity balance, handling cold-start items within a continual framework, and optimizing streaming feedback in production settings.

The key innovation is a **dedicated tutorial and focused survey** that synthesizes domain-specific knowledge. Technically, the authors categorize the landscape into **Experience-Replay-based methods** (analyzing sample selection mechanisms and model enhancements) and **Regularization-based approaches** (encompassing knowledge preservation, temporal directionality, and structural preservation).

As this is a tutorial rather than an empirical study, it establishes concrete **qualitative benchmarks** for evaluation: mitigation of catastrophic forgetting, personalization of the stability-plasticity balance, computational efficiency, and adaptation speed. This research bridges the disconnect between theoretical CL research and the practical demands of industrial recommender systems, serving as a vital resource for both academic researchers and industry practitioners.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Unique Dynamism of Recommender Systems**
    Unlike static machine learning domains, recommender systems operate in highly dynamic environments. They require real-time adaptation to shifting user interests, changing item pools, and popularity trends while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

*   **Gap in General Continual Learning Literature**
    Existing tutorials on continual or lifelong learning focus broadly on domains like vision and graphs. They fail to address recommendation-specific requirements such as:
    *   Per-user stability-plasticity balance.
    *   Cold-start item handling.
    *   Streaming feedback optimization.

*   **Challenges in Practical Deployment**
    Applying continual learning to real-world recommender systems involves navigating specific constraints, including:
    *   Resource-constrained environments.
    *   Effective handling of sequential interactions.
