# 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical scalability challenges inherent in Continual Learning (CL), particularly the prohibitive computational costs associated with standard replay-based methods essential for preventing catastrophic forgetting. The study highlights a significant disconnect between the CL literature and Multi-Task Fine-Tuning (MTFT), arguing that the latter offers efficient strategies underutilized in sequential settings. The problem is acute: naive application of replay methods can double computational overhead, making large-scale deployment impractical. By identifying this efficiency gap, the work establishes the need for a framework that maintains the knowledge retention of replay while adopting the parameter efficiency of MTFT.

The paper presents a unified framework developed through a structured, multi-stage research process. The approach begins by adapting Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for CL environments, followed by the introduction of "phasic consolidation" to optimize replay buffers by minimizing sample volume. A key innovation is the development of "sequential merging," explicitly designed as a tailored offshoot of task arithmetic to function within a sequential task context. This technique allows for the integration of task-specific updates alongside replay mechanisms. The final methodology combines these elements—LoRA for parameter efficiency, phasic consolidation for memory optimization, and sequential merging for weight integration—into a single synergistic toolset.

Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed phasic consolidation strategy reduces the number of required replay samples by up to 55% to maintain specific performance targets. The unified framework significantly outperforms standalone variants of these individual methods, effectively resolving the scalability-efficiency trade-off. Crucially, the results show that this combined approach avoids the doubled computational cost (2x) characteristic of standard, naive replay methods. This validates the hypothesis that integrating MTFT techniques allows for high retention of past knowledge without the unsustainable resource burden of traditional replay strategies.

This work significantly impacts the field by bridging the gap between continual learning and multi-task fine-tuning literature, successfully porting scalable techniques like model merging to sequential environments. The introduction of sequential merging provides a novel adaptation of task arithmetic specifically designed to handle the constraints of continual learning. By offering a highly scalable toolset that preserves past knowledge while acquiring new information, this research establishes a viable pathway for the practical, large-scale deployment of continual learning systems in resource-constrained environments.
