## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of maintaining distribution learnability when training data is subject to integrity violations, either through stochastic noise or adversarial manipulation. While sample-compressible distribution families are known to be PAC-learnable under ideal conditions, their stability in the presence of corrupted data remained an open question. This matters because real-world data is rarely pristine; understanding whether the structural guarantees of compressibility can withstand perturbations is essential for designing robust machine learning systems that can operate reliably in hostile or noisy environments.

The authors introduce a novel "perturbation-quantization framework" that interfaces directly with existing sample compression schemes to analyze stability under minimal assumptions. Technically, the framework relies on concepts such as Local Lipschitz Decodability and convolution analysis to establish the necessary and sufficient conditions required for robustness. This approach provides a unified theoretical treatment for two distinct perturbation models: an additive independent noise model and an adversarial corruption model where a limited subset of samples is manipulated, bridging the gap between structural compressibility and robust learning.

The study establishes that sample-compressible distribution families retain learnability under both noisy and adversarial conditions, with sample complexity bounds exhibiting explicit dependencies on the dimension $d$, the number of components $k$, and the inverse error tolerance $1/\epsilon$. Specifically, the authors derive new sample complexity bounds for learning finite mixtures of high-dimensional uniform distributions ($k$-UMMs) under both additive noise and adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, the paper resolves a significant open problem by providing the first sample complexity bounds for learning Gaussian mixture models ($k$-GMMs) from adversarially corrupted samples, offering formal guarantees on Total Variation (TV) error for the additive noise model and TV-learnability for the adversarial model.

This work significantly advances the field of robust distribution learning by formally demonstrating that the guarantees of PAC-learnability can survive data corruption, effectively extending compressibility theory to accommodate robustness. By solving long-standing open problems regarding the learnability of uniform and Gaussian mixture models under adversarial attacks, the research provides a foundation for future algorithms that are theoretically grounded in stability. The unified analytical framework offers a powerful tool for researchers to evaluate the resilience of various distribution classes against both stochastic noise and deterministic malicious attacks, reinforcing the reliability of learning systems in high-stakes applications.

## Key Findings

*   **Learnability Retention:** Sample-compressible distribution families retain their learnability even when trained on samples subject to perturbations, provided specific necessary and sufficient conditions are met.
*   **Dual Model Robustness:** Robustness is proven for two distinct models of data perturbation:
    *   An additive independent noise model.
    *   An adversarial corruption model where a limited subset of samples is manipulated.
*   **Graceful Scaling:** The sample complexity bounds derived for these scenarios scale gracefully with the intensity of the noise level and the adversary's corruption budget.
*   **High-Dimensional Uniform Mixtures:** New sample complexity bounds were established for learning finite mixtures of high-dimensional uniform distributions ($k$-UMMs) under both additive noise and adversarial perturbations.
*   **Gaussian Mixture Resolution:** The research resolves an open problem by establishing sample complexity bounds for learning Gaussian mixture models ($k$-GMMs) from adversarially corrupted samples.

## Results

The paper proves that sample-compressible distribution families retain learnability under perturbations (additive noise and adversarial corruption) provided specific conditions are met. Sample complexity bounds scale gracefully with noise intensity and corruption budget. New bounds were established for learning high-dimensional $k$-UMMs under both perturbations. The research resolves an open problem by establishing sample complexity bounds for learning $k$-GMMs from adversarially corrupted samples. Formal guarantees on Total Variation error are provided for the additive noise model, alongside TV-Learnability results for the adversarial model.
