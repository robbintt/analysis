## Executive Summary

The rapid evolution of AI agent systems has resulted in a fragmented landscape lacking standardized architectural definitions for agent components, orchestration patterns, and **deployment settings**. As foundation models increasingly function as autonomous system controllers, the absence of a unified taxonomy hinders systematic comparison and engineering optimization. This paper addresses this critical disarray by organizing the disparate array of agent architectures, clarifying complex design trade-offs, and establishing rigorous frameworks for evaluating non-deterministic, tool-augmented AI.

The core innovation is a comprehensive taxonomic framework developed through an active survey methodology in which the authors categorized prior work by functional capabilities to construct a structural taxonomy. Technically, the authors define agents as systems where Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision-Language Models (VLMs) serve as the policy core within a constrained execution loop. This loop is operationalized through five distinct stages: *Observe, Plan, Call Tools, Update Memory, and Verify Outcomes*. The survey categorizes key augmentation strategies—including Tool-Augmentation, Retrieval-Augmentation, and ReAct orchestration—and introduces the "Agent Transformer" abstraction. This architecture maps context to decisions while strictly managing engineering constraints such as time, token limits, and tool-use side effects.

As this work is a comprehensive survey rather than an empirical experimental study, the results are qualitative findings synthesized from extensive literature. The analysis identifies three critical trade-offs that engineers must balance: **Latency versus Accuracy**, **Autonomy versus Controllability**, and **Capability versus Reliability**. The study further characterizes the unique challenges in evaluating agent performance, specifically citing non-determinism, long-horizon credit assignment, environment variability, and hidden costs as primary obstacles. Additionally, the review highlights current gaps in distinguishing between hallucination and grounding failures, compounding errors in long-horizon tasks, and the difficulties associated with managing diverse **deployment settings** and ensuring **interpretability**.

This paper establishes a foundational roadmap for the advancement of autonomous AI by defining the standards for architectural classification and exposing the limitations of current evaluation metrics. By isolating specific open challenges—such as guardrails for tool use, scalable context management, **interpretability**, and the need for reproducible benchmarks—the work directs future research toward solving the most critical bottlenecks in agent reliability. Its significance lies in providing the research community with a shared vocabulary and a clear understanding of the systemic constraints necessary to transition AI agents from experimental prototypes to dependable, deployable systems.
