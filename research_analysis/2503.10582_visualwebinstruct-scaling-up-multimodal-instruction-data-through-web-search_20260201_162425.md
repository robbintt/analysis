## Executive Summary

The development of advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is currently bottlenecked by a scarcity of high-quality, diverse instruction-tuning data tailored for complex reasoning. While existing models perform well on general perception tasks, they often struggle with domain-specific scientific and mathematical problems that require high-level cognitive reasoning. This limitation stems from the difficulty of manually curating large-scale, exam-like datasets that cover the wide breadth of knowledge needed to truly scale multimodal understanding.

To address this, the authors introduce **VisualWebInstruct**, a scalable, four-stage data-centric pipeline that automates the extraction of multimodal instruction data from the web. The process begins with seed images and employs reverse image search via Google Image Search to retrieve HTML content from over 700,000 unique URLs. Technically, the pipeline utilizes accessibility trees to extract clean content and employs **GPT-4o** to synthesize candidate solutions for instances where ground-truth answers are missing (a frequent occurrence in >50% of cases), filtering these outputs based on consistency. This results in a robust dataset of approximately **900,000 QA pairs**—comprising 40% visual and 60% text-based data—focused on human-created, scientific problems.

Fine-tuning existing models with the VisualWebInstruct dataset yielded substantial performance gains across multiple benchmarks. The Llava-OV-mid model observed an absolute performance increase of 10–20 percentage points, while the base MAmmoTH-VL model gained five absolute points. The best-performing model, **MAmmoTH-VL2** (7B parameters), achieved state-of-the-art performance within the 10B parameter class, securing scores of 40.7% on MMMU-Pro-std, 42.6% on MathVerse, 55.7% on Dyna-Math, and 64.5% on MMVet, thereby surpassing competitors such as InternVL2.5 and Phi-4-Mini.

This work demonstrates that leveraging diverse, web-sourced instruction data is a superior strategy for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs compared to relying solely on static, manually curated datasets. By establishing a new performance standard for models in the 10B class and releasing the MAmmoTH-VL2 model, the authors provide a reproducible blueprint for scaling multimodal data acquisition. This approach significantly lowers the barrier to creating domain-specific expert models, signaling a shift toward data-efficient methodologies for achieving high-level visual reasoning.
