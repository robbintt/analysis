## 📋 Executive Summary

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) face critical challenges regarding efficiency and knowledge currency. Existing approaches often rely on massive parameter counts and static training data, leading to high token consumption and outdated knowledge bases. Furthermore, traditional training paradigms heavily depend on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which struggles to instill complex, adaptive reasoning capabilities required for deep research tasks. There is a pressing need for architectures that can perform high-level reasoning and information retrieval without the prohibitive computational costs of scaling model size or the limitations of static knowledge distillation.

This paper introduces **MARS** (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Co-evolving Dual-System Deep Research), a novel framework that utilizes a "System 1" (fast, intuitive) and "System 2" (slow, deliberate) architecture to co-evolve reasoning capabilities. Technically, the authors employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach with a "Zero RL" paradigm, optimizing the model exclusively through reinforcement signals without any SFT. The core technical contribution is an Extended Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which features Decoupled Gradient Computation, Bin-packing Optimization for efficient training, and Advantage-weighted Balanced Sampling. This allows the two systems to adapt via a Shared Reward Mechanism, shifting information distillation from a static process to a dynamic, adaptive interaction.

The MARS model demonstrates exceptional parameter efficiency and performance. Using only an 8 Billion (8B) parameter architecture, MARS outperformed the significantly larger WebThinker (32B) model on the HLE benchmark, achieving a performance gain of +8.17% with 4x parameter efficiency. Additionally, the model realized an average improvement of +8.9% across seven knowledge-intensive tasks. These results validate the efficacy of the Zero RL training methodology, proving that high-performance reasoning can be achieved without relying on supervised fine-tuning, while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to larger baselines.

The findings of this paper represent a significant shift in LLM research, demonstrating that sophisticated reasoning does not require scaling model size but can be achieved through better training dynamics and architectural design. By validating the "Zero RL" approach, the authors challenge the industry's reliance on SFT, suggesting a path toward more autonomous and adaptable AI agents. The successful implementation of a dual-system co-evolution via MARL provides a blueprint for future research into efficient, cost-effective deep research agents capable of dynamic knowledge acquisition and complex problem-solving.
