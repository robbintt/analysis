## Executive Summary

This research addresses the computational and architectural challenge of model selection within compound AI systems—architectures composed of multiple interconnected modules, such as multi-agent debates or self-refinement loops. While intuitively, different modules may require different large language models (LLMs) to maximize specific capabilities, the search space for optimal model allocation grows exponentially with the number of modules. Consequently, engineers often default to using a single, uniform LLM across the entire system, a strategy that is computationally efficient but frequently yields suboptimal quality. The paper tackles the difficulty of efficiently identifying the best combination of models for specific modules without resorting to exhaustive and prohibitively expensive end-to-end testing.

The authors introduce **LLMSelector**, a generalized framework designed to optimize static compound AI systems modeled as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Technically, LLMSelector employs a greedy optimization algorithm that iteratively selects one module at a time, utilizing a "Module Nominator" and "Model Updater." A core innovation is the use of an **LLM-as-a-judge** to estimate the performance of candidate models on specific modules without executing the full system. This approach relies on the theoretical assumption of monotonicity—specifically that end-to-end system performance improves as individual module performance improves. By leveraging this assumption and LLM-based estimation, LLMSelector reduces the search complexity from exponential to linear, making the optimization of complex systems tractable.

The framework was validated across three distinct architectures (*Self-refine, Multi-agent-debate,* and *Locate-solve*) and six diverse datasets, including LiveCodeBench, SimpleQA, and FEVER. When compared against baseline systems utilizing a single uniform model (including state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5), LLMSelector consistently demonstrated superior performance. Empirical results showed accuracy improvements ranging from **5% to 70%** depending on the specific task and complexity. These metrics highlight that the framework not only successfully navigates the model selection space but does so by achieving substantial gains in reasoning accuracy and execution quality.

## Key Findings

*   **Impact of Module Choice:** The choice of LLM for specific modules significantly affects overall quality; however, identifying the optimal combination involves an exponentially large search space.
*   **System Monotonicity:** End-to-end system performance generally exhibits monotonic behavior regarding individual module performance, allowing for simplified optimization strategies.
*   **Efficient Estimation:** An LLM can accurately estimate the performance of individual modules without requiring end-to-end execution for every configuration.
*   **Performance Gains:** The proposed framework demonstrates empirical accuracy improvements ranging from **5% to 70%** compared to using a single identical LLM for all modules.

## Methodology

The authors propose **LLMSelector**, an optimized framework for model selection in compound AI systems. The approach is defined by the following characteristics:

1.  **Iterative Selection:** The framework iteratively selects one module at a time and allocates the model estimated to have the highest performance.
2.  **LLM-as-a-Judge:** To determine the best model without exhaustive testing, LLMSelector uses an LLM to estimate candidate model performance for specific modules.
3.  **Greedy Optimization:** This process reduces complexity, scaling linearly with the number of modules.
4.  **Validation:** The methodology was validated on compound systems like multi-agent debate and self-refine using state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5.
