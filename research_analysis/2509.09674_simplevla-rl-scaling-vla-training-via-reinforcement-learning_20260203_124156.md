## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using large-scale human demonstration datasets. This dependency creates critical bottlenecks for robotics, including the high cost of data collection, data scarcity, and poor generalization when facing distribution shifts or novel environments. Furthermore, SFT approaches often struggle with long-horizon action planning and complex manipulation tasks, limiting the adaptability and autonomy of robotic agents in real-world scenarios.

**Innovation**
To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce SimpleVLA-RL, a scalable reinforcement learning framework built upon the `veRL` library and tailored for VLA architectures. The core innovation lies in shifting from imitation-based SFT to RL, utilizing VLA-specific trajectory sampling, multi-environment rendering, and optimized loss computation to enable efficient training at scale. The framework integrates exploration-enhancing strategies and is applied to models like OpenVLA-OFT, allowing them to learn from environmental interaction rather than static data. This approach optimizes the model for long-horizon planning and generalization across spatial, object, and goal dimensions.

**Results**
SimpleVLA-RL demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming the RDT model on RoboTwin benchmarks and achieving superior results on the LIBERO benchmark. It achieved a **70.4%** success rate on RoboTwin 1.0 and up to **99.1%** on RoboTwin 2.0, surpassing standard baselines which ranged from 38.3% to 48.9%. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency; with only a single trajectory, it achieved a **91.7%** success rate, outperforming SFT-only (17.3%) and even SFT trained on full datasets (86.5%). In real-world evaluations, SimpleVLA-RL maintained success rates of approximately 60–70%, whereas baselines dropped as low as 4%. Additionally, the RL training process unlocked an emergent behavior known as 'pushcut'—a novel manipulation skill not present in the original training data.

**Impact**
This research bridges the gap between Reinforcement Learning and VLA models, validating RL as a superior alternative to SFT for robotic manipulation. By providing a highly scalable infrastructure that reduces dependency on human trajectories, the work addresses fundamental challenges of data scarcity and generalization in the field. The emergence of novel skills like 'pushcut' highlights the potential for RL-driven models to discover creative solutions beyond human demonstration, paving the way for more robust, autonomous, and general-purpose robotic systems.
