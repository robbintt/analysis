## Executive Summary

Declarative AI frameworks offer powerful methods for constructing machine-learning pipelines that can be optimized for cost, latency, and quality. However, these systems typically require significant technical expertise to define schemas, manage relational operators, and construct logical plans. This creates a substantial accessibility barrier, preventing non-expert users who possess domain knowledge but lack programming skills from leveraging high-performance AI analytics for complex tasks such as scientific discovery or data processing.

The authors introduce **PalimpChat**, a hybrid system that bridges a ReAct-based reasoning agent (Archytas) with the existing Palimpzest declarative framework to enable natural language interaction. Technically, the system utilizes Archytas to decompose user prompts into specific tool calls that invoke Palimpzest’s relational operators—such as *Convert*, *Filter*, and *Join*—to construct data pipelines dynamically. This architecture leverages Palimpzest’s optimizer to decouple logical planning from physical execution, allowing the system to automatically generate and rank pipelines based on multi-objective optimization for user-defined preferences regarding output quality, runtime, and cost.

As the paper presents PalimpChat as an early-stage prototype, it does not include a dedicated quantitative evaluation section; consequently, specific metrics regarding latency, accuracy, or cost savings are not reported. Validation is provided through qualitative demonstrations across real-world scenarios, including biomedical data extraction (specifically identifying cancer-related papers), legal discovery, and real estate search. These use cases successfully illustrate the system's capability to translate abstract natural language requests into functional, optimized analytics workflows without requiring manual code.

PalimpChat significantly advances the democratization of declarative AI by abstracting the complexity of pipeline construction behind an intuitive chat interface. By demonstrating a functional architecture where a reasoning agent acts as a translator for a declarative engine, this work establishes a blueprint for future interactive AI systems that combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the optimization rigor of database theory. The public release of the demo system invites further research into agent-driven analytics, potentially broadening the user base for sophisticated machine-learning tools.

## Key Findings

*   **Accessibility for Non-Experts:** Successfully addresses the limitations of existing declarative AI frameworks by enabling non-expert users to create and execute sophisticated machine-learning pipelines using natural language alone.
*   **Hybrid Architecture:** The integration of the **Archytas** ReAct-based reasoning agent with **Palimpzest’s** operators creates a functional chat interface for complex analytics.
*   **Workflow Simplification:** The system simplifies complex AI workflows, such as biomedical data extraction and analysis, by leveraging the Palimpzest optimizer to manage the underlying logic.
*   **Broad Applicability:** Validated through real-world scenarios including scientific discovery, legal discovery, and real estate search.

## Methodology

The authors developed **PalimpChat**, a chat-based interface built on top of the existing **Palimpzest** declarative AI framework. The methodology consists of three main components:

1.  **System Development:** Building a hybrid system where Palimpzest serves as the declarative backend and Archytas serves as the frontend framework.
2.  **Agent Orchestration:** Utilizing a ReAct-based reasoning agent (Archytas) to interpret user natural language inputs and orchestrate Palimpzest’s suite of relational and LLM-based operators to construct data pipelines.
3.  **Optimization & Validation:** Leveraging the Palimpzest optimizer to ensure generated pipelines are optimized and validating the system through real-world use cases (scientific discovery, legal discovery, and real estate search).

## Technical Details

### System Architecture
PalimpChat operates as a hybrid integration of two distinct components:

*   **Palimpzest (Declarative Backend):** Uses a relational algebra data model. Schemas are defined by attributes, types, and descriptions.
*   **Archytas (Frontend Framework):** Implements the ReAct paradigm to decompose natural language requests and interact with Palimpzest tools.

### Core Operators
The system utilizes a variety of operators to manipulate data:
*   **Convert:** Transforms Schema A to Schema B using LLMs.
*   **Filter:** Refines data using natural language or User-Defined Functions (UDFs).
*   **Standard Relational Operators:** Traditional database operations (e.g., Join).

### Optimization Strategy
The system employs a multi-objective optimization approach:
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Logical plans are separated from physical implementations.
*   **Ranking:** Plans are ranked based on user-defined preferences for **Quality**, **Runtime**, and **Cost**.

### Workflow Execution
The operational pipeline follows this sequence:
1.  **User Input:** Natural language request.
2.  **Agent Decomposition:** Archytas breaks down the request.
3.  **Plan Generation:** Optimizer generates execution plans.
4.  **Execution:** The pipeline is run.
5.  **Result Return:** Data is returned to the user.
