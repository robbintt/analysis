## Executive Summary

This research addresses a critical limitation in current Large Language Model (LLM) alignment pipelines: the inability of general-purpose reward models to accurately evaluate tool-based reasoning and execution. Standard reward models, typically trained on natural language preferences, lack the nuanced understanding required to assess the functional correctness of tool calls. This creates a significant barrier to developing capable tool-using agents, highlighted by a substantial performance gap in existing evaluations.

To bridge this gap, the authors introduce **ToolRM**, a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM) designed explicitly for tool-calling scenarios, alongside **FC-RewardBench**, the first systematic benchmark for this domain. ToolRM departs from standard natural language preference modeling by focusing on functional outcomes, utilizing the Bradley-Terry model for pairwise preference modeling and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for training.

Evaluation across seven out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrates that ToolRM significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines (such as "LLM-as-a-Judge" and "Themis"), achieving up to a **25%** improvement in downstream task performance. The introduction of FC-RewardBench sets a new standard for benchmarking tool-use capabilities, while ToolRM’s ability to enable data-efficient fine-tuning addresses practical constraints in model training.
