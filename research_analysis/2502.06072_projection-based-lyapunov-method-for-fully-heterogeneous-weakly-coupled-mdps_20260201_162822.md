## 📑 Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of controlling large-scale, Weakly-Coupled Markov Decision Processes (WCMDPs) with independent, heterogeneous arms under global budget constraints, overcoming the curse of dimensionality and limitations of previous homogeneity assumptions. The core innovation involves a **"projection-based Lyapunov method"** paired with an Index-based policy featuring reassignment, which projects high-dimensional dynamics onto a lower-dimensional representation to bound drift and correct budget violations dynamically.

The proposed method achieves an optimality gap of $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ in long-run average reward, demonstrating asymptotic optimality and polynomial computational complexity as the number of arms increases. As the first proof of asymptotic optimality for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs, this work provides a robust, scalable framework for managing diverse real-world systems such as power grids and communication networks.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Efficient Optimality:** An efficiently computable policy was identified that achieves an **$O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap** in the long-run average reward per arm.
*   **Scalable Performance:** The performance of the policy improves as the system scales; the optimality gap vanishes as the number of arms ($N$) increases, effectively addressing the **curse of dimensionality**.
*   **Heterogeneity Support:** These results are achievable under mild assumptions, even when dealing with **fully heterogeneous settings** where every subproblem has distinct model parameters.
*   **Convergence:** The proposed method ensures that rewards and costs converge to an optimal region in the long run.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The research details a robust theoretical and practical framework for decision-making in complex environments.

*   **System Model:** The system is modeled as a Weakly-Coupled Markov Decision Process (WCMDP) consisting of $N$ arms in a fully heterogeneous setting. Each arm possesses distinct transition probabilities, rewards, and cost functions.
*   **State Representation:** Employs a matrix-based state representation utilizing one-hot vectors.
*   **Constraints:** Imposes global budget constraints for $K$ types that scale linearly with the number of arms ($\alpha_k N$), ensuring feasibility through a zero-cost action.
*   **Policy Mechanism:** Utilizes an **"ID policy with reassignment"** under the planning setting where model parameters are known a priori.
*   **Theoretical Core:** Relies on a projection-based Lyapunov method to construct specific Lyapunov functions used to mathematically certify the stability and performance of the policy.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The research utilizes a novel theoretical framework centered on the construction of **"projection-based Lyapunov functions"**.

These functions serve as a critical tool to mathematically certify the stability and performance of the policy. Specifically, they are used to prove the convergence of rewards and costs to an optimal region, effectively handling the complexity derived from the system's heterogeneity.
