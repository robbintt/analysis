## Executive Summary

The deployment of deep learning models for skin disease classification on edge devices is currently hindered by the prohibitive computational costs and energy consumption of standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative for energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware, the direct conversion of high-accuracy CNNs to SNNs typically suffers from conversion instability and significant performance degradation, particularly on imbalanced medical datasets where rare classes are critical.

To address these challenges, the researchers introduce **QANA** (Quantization-Aware Neuromorphic Architecture), an end-to-end pipeline designed specifically for robust CNN-to-SNN conversion and edge deployment. The architecture utilizes a conversion-stable design that substitutes fragile CNN components with spike-compatible transformations and aligns normalization layers with low-bit quantization. To preserve feature extraction capabilities within limited FLOP budgets, the model employs Ghost-based feature generation alongside hardware-compliant attention mechanisms.

QANA demonstrates superior performance on standard benchmarks, achieving **91.6% Top-1 accuracy** on the HAM10000 dataset. When deployed on BrainChip Akida hardware, the system achieved extreme efficiency, processing images in **1.5 ms** with an energy consumption of just **1.7 mJ**. This work validates the viability of neuromorphic architectures for real-world medical diagnostics by successfully bridging the gap between theoretical model efficiency and practical hardware constraints.
