## Executive Summary

Applying look-ahead reasoning (search) to Imperfect Information Games (IIGs), such as poker, presents a formidable computational challenge because agents must account for hidden information rather than a single known state. While model-based reinforcement learning methods like MuZero have mastered perfect information games (e.g., chess) by learning environment dynamics, they fail to scale in IIGs. The core issue is that the "state space" in these games explodes exponentially due to the vast number of possible histories an opponent might hold. Furthermore, relying on pre-defined game rules is often impossible in complex, real-world environments.

This paper addresses the critical need for a method that enables principled, test-time reasoning in IIGs without requiring an explicit model of the environment, thereby overcoming the tractability issues that limit current approaches. The authors introduce **LAMIR** (Look-ahead Reasoning with a Learned Model in Imperfect Information Games), an algorithm that adapts the model-based learning paradigm to hidden-information domains.

To manage the complexity of unknown states, LAMIR splits the learned representation into two components: the **Public State Representation** (what everyone sees) and the **Information Set Representation** (what a specific agent knows). The key innovation is a **Clustering Function**, which acts as a compression mechanism; it groups similar game states together to create abstractions. This is crucial because searching every possible hand history is computationally infeasible. By clustering states, LAMIR constrains the size of relevant subgames during test time, allowing the agent to perform theoretically sound search over a compressed, manageable space.

Empirical findings demonstrate that with sufficient model capacity, LAMIR is empirically capable of learning the exact underlying structure of the imperfect information game. In the standard Leduc Hold'em benchmark, the algorithm successfully converged to the game's true structural representation. More importantly, in large-scale game variants where the model operated under limited capacity, LAMIR generated valuable abstractions that resulted in significant performance gains over static strategies. Specifically, when tested against a strong baseline agent using Regularized Nash Dynamics (RNaD) without look-ahead, LAMIR achieved a **win rate of 62%**.

This research bridges the gap between theoretical game solving principles and practical, scalable AI. By successfully extending model-based reinforcement learning to imperfect information games, LAMIR provides a robust solution for scenarios where explicit environment models are unavailable or too complex to encode. The shift from static, pre-computed strategies to dynamic, learned models has broad implications beyond game theory. This architecture paves the way for more sophisticated AI agents capable of handling real-world strategic interactions characterized by uncertainty, such as high-stakes business negotiations, cybersecurity defense against hidden attackers, and financial trading where market motives are incomplete.

## Key Findings

*   **Exact Structure Learning:** With sufficient model capacity, the LAMIR algorithm is empirically proven capable of learning the exact underlying structure of the imperfect information game.
*   **Performance via Abstraction:** Even when operating with limited capacity, LAMIR learns valuable abstractions that significantly improve the game-playing performance of pre-trained agents.
*   **Scalability in Large Games:** The method successfully enhances agent performance in large-scale games, overcoming scalability barriers that hinder previous methods.
*   **Tractability of Reasoning:** By limiting subgame size through abstraction, LAMIR makes theoretically principled look-ahead reasoning tractable in complex environments where it was previously infeasible.

## Methodology

The paper introduces **LAMIR**, an algorithm designed to facilitate test-time reasoning without an explicit environment model. LAMIR learns an abstracted model of an imperfect information game directly through agent-environment interactions.

During test time, the agent uses this trained model to perform look-ahead reasoning. The core of the methodology relies on **learned abstraction** to constrain the size of each subgame to a manageable level. This approach addresses the challenge of the vast number of states relevant to individual decisions in imperfect information settings.

## Technical Details

LAMIR is a model-based reinforcement learning approach for imperfect information games that performs look-ahead reasoning without explicit game rules.

### Architecture Components
The system consists of three learnable functions adapted from MuZero:
*   **Representation Functions:**
    *   *Public State Representation:* Maps to L latent abstract sets.
    *   *Information Set Representation:* Captures the agent's specific knowledge.
*   **Dynamics Function:** Predicts next latent states and rewards.
*   **Clustering Function:** Groups similar game states to create abstractions.

### Reasoning & Training
*   **Reasoning Scope:** Performed over all histories consistent with the public state.
*   **Training Algorithm:** Uses single-phase depth-limited solving with multi-valued states.
*   **Key Functions:**
    *   *Strategy Function:* Trained with Regularized Nash Dynamics (RNaD).
    *   *Transformations Function*
    *   *Value Function*

## Contributions

*   **Paradigm Extension:** Successfully extends the model-based learning paradigm (exemplified by MuZero in perfect information games) to the domain of imperfect information games.
*   **Model-Free Environment Solution:** Provides a solution for scenarios where explicit environment models are unavailable or overly complex by enabling the learning of models directly from interaction data.
*   **Theoretical and Practical Bridging:** Bridges the gap between theoretically principled look-ahead reasoning and practical scalability, allowing advanced search techniques to function in large games where previous methods could not scale.

## Results

LAMIR is capable of learning the exact underlying structure of imperfect information games with sufficient model capacity. In limited capacity settings, it learns valuable abstractions that yield significant performance improvements over pre-trained agents without test-time reasoning. The method overcomes scalability barriers in large-scale games, renders theoretically principled look-ahead reasoning tractable in complex environments, and functions without requiring explicit game rules.
