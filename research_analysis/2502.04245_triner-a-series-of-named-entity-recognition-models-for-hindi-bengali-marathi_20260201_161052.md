> ## 📑 Executive Summary
>
> This research addresses the critical scarcity of robust, multilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools for three major Indian languages: Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi. Existing solutions in this domain are often fragmented, relying on disjointed, language-specific isolated models that suffer from significant inconsistencies in entity group definitions and tag nomenclature. This lack of standardization hinders the development of scalable, unified Indic NLP pipelines. The study aims to solve this by moving away from older statistical methods—such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and LSTMs—toward a modern, unified architecture that ensures semantic consistency across these under-represented languages.
>
> The core innovation of TriNER is the deployment of a single, unified Transformer-based multilingual model designed to process Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi simultaneously, rather than treating them as separate silos. Technically, the authors employed a dual-strategy approach involving the training of a custom transformer model from scratch alongside the fine-tuning of existing pre-trained models. The methodology aggregated data from HiNER, MahaNER, and B-NER datasets and standardized them into a cohesive taxonomy of six entity groups: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, NUMEX, TIMEX, and MISC. To ensure data uniformity, the team developed a Python script for automated NUMEX annotation and utilized a specific dataset splitting strategy that combined full training sets with reserved validation and test segments to optimize generalization.
>
> The proposed TriNER model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an aggregate F1 score of 92.11 across the three evaluated languages. This score represents a substantial improvement of approximately 10 points over the IndicNER/Naamapadam baseline, which recorded F1 scores in the 81–83 range. Furthermore, the unified model proved competitive with dedicated state-of-the-art single-language models, matching or exceeding their performance; specific comparison models included HiNER (F1 88.78–92.22), MahaNER (F1 85.3–86.8), and B-NER (F1 86). These results validate the hypothesis that a unified multilingual approach can maintain high accuracy while solving standardization issues.
>
> The significance of this study lies in its provision of a reliable, standardized framework for entity recognition in Indian languages, directly addressing the resource gap in this domain. By reducing inconsistencies in labeling and taxonomy, TriNER facilitates more effective context-aware applications, such as data anonymization and cross-lingual information extraction. The successful unification of these languages into a single high-performance model sets a precedent for future multilingual NER research, offering a scalable solution that enhances the accessibility and capability of NLP technologies for the Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi speaking populations.
