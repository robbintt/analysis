## Executive Summary

The research addresses the critical fragmentation and lack of reproducibility currently plaguing the Large Language Model (LLM) safety and robustness ecosystem. As adversarial attacks (jailbreaks) evolve, the research landscape has become populated with disparate, often buggy tools that make objective comparison and verification of results difficult. This problem is significant because it hinders the development of reliable defenses; without a standardized, bug-free environment, reproducing findings is nearly impossible, leading to unreliable benchmarks and slowing progress in understanding LLM vulnerabilities.

To solve this, the authors introduce **AdversariaLLM**, a unified, modular, and open-source toolbox designed to standardize how researchers evaluate LLM jailbreak robustness. Technically, the framework integrates **12 distinct adversarial attack algorithms** and **7 benchmark datasets** covering harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility into a single architecture. It connects to open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face and implements a custom inference engine to ensure numerical stability in batched generation. Key technical innovations include deterministic result generation through tracking of complete token/embedding sequences and chat templates, compute-resource tracking, and Slurm/submitit integration for scalable parallel job management. Additionally, the system features **"JudgeZoo,"** an integrated judging mechanism that functions both within the toolbox and as a standalone utility for transparent evaluation.

The framework demonstrates significant improvements in both reproducibility and performance metrics. In reproducibility tests on Llama 3.1 8B, AdversariaLLM achieved a **71% reference match rate** compared to just **19%** for existing baselines, with **2.12× better alignment** and longer common prefix lengths. In terms of attack efficacy, the framework outperformed the nanoGCG baseline on the HarmBench dataset using Llama-2-7B-Instruct, achieving a superior cumulative best-of-n Attack Success Rate (ASR) when utilizing the GCG attack algorithm.

AdversariaLLM establishes a new technical standard for rigorous experimentation in LLM safety by mandating reproducibility and correctness. By providing a unified baseline that aggregates diverse algorithms and datasets, the tool effectively reduces result disparity and enables researchers to validate findings with confidence.
