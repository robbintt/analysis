## 📝 Executive Summary

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained hardware, yet current low-bit uniform PTQ methods face a significant bottleneck. The industry standard relies on the Min-Max formula to initialize quantization parameters (scale and zero-point), a heuristic approach that introduces inherent limitations. This restriction prevents models from reaching their full performance potential in low-bit environments—spanning both standard and group-wise quantization—creating a critical need for more robust initialization strategies that do not compromise model accuracy for the sake of compression.

The authors introduce **NeUQI** (Near-Optimal Uniform Quantization Parameter Initialization), a novel framework designed to optimize the initialization process by moving beyond the Min-Max formula. The key technical breakthrough lies in analytically deriving the zero-point for any given scale value. This insight simplifies the joint optimization of scale and zero-point—a traditionally complex multi-variable search—into a single-variable, scale-only optimization problem without sacrificing performance. NeUQI serves as a distinct initialization strategy that, when integrated into a broader PTQ pipeline utilizing a lightweight distillation strategy, achieves superior results with significantly fewer resources than existing methods.

Comprehensive testing on LLaMA and Qwen architectures validates NeUQI’s effectiveness across 3-bit and 4-bit precisions and various group sizes. In a 3-bit, Group Size 128 setting for LLaMA 7B, NeUQI achieved better perplexity than GPTQ while maintaining competitive accuracy. For LLaMA 13B (3-bit), NeUQI significantly outperformed GPTQ, achieving a Wiki2 perplexity of 6.56 compared to GPTQ's 8.45 and an average accuracy of 60.75% versus 57.60%. On LLaMA 70B (Standard), NeUQI improved accuracy by +2.71 points (71.48% vs. 68.77%) and lowered Wiki2 perplexity (3.90 vs. 4.83). Furthermore, the method demonstrated the ability to surpass PV-tuning, a resource-intensive technique, while maintaining competitive performance in group-wise quantization settings (Group Size 128).

This research addresses a fundamental, underexplored gap in low-bit uniform quantization by establishing a new theoretical and practical framework for parameter initialization. By providing a deployment-friendly solution that reduces memory footprint and decoding latency while maintaining high accuracy, NeUQI offers a viable path for the efficient deployment of massive LLMs.
