## Executive Summary

This research addresses the challenge of transfer learning in high-dimensional nonparametric regression, defined by the "quantity-quality trade-off" where practitioners leverage a large but potentially biased source dataset to improve estimation for a small, high-quality target dataset. The core problem is the **"curse of dimensionality,"** which renders traditional global estimation inefficient, compounded by **"negative transfer,"** where assuming global similarity between dissimilar source and target functions degrades performance. This work is critical for applications in high-dimensional spaces where source data cannot be assumed globally representative, necessitating a method that rigorously accounts for heterogeneity between domains.

The key innovation is the **Tessellation Localized Transfer Learning ((TL)$^2$)** framework, a two-layer architecture that replaces global mapping assumptions with localized transfer. Layer 1 ("Localize-Transfer") estimates a global source regression function using a Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator and partitions the feature space into an admissible tessellation. Within each cell, the target function is modeled as $f_T(x) = g^*_\ell(f_S(x))$, where the transfer function $g^*_\ell$ is a Hölder-smooth transformation of the source estimate. Layer 2 ("Tessellation Selection") performs structural model selection using a validation subsample to identify the optimal tessellation, automatically adapting to unknown partition structures and local transfer strengths without prior geometric knowledge.

The paper establishes rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving that the proposed estimators achieve sharp minimax rates of convergence and non-asymptotic oracle inequalities. The analysis decomposes excess risk into distinct estimation (variance) and approximation (bias) terms, with convergence rates that explicitly adapt to the smoothness parameters of the source ($\beta_S$), target ($\beta_T$), and local transfer regularity ($\beta_{loc}$). Characterizing the bounds in this manner demonstrates that the framework mathematically mitigates the curse of dimensionality by reducing functional complexity and adapting to the intrinsic geometric regularity of the partition.

This work significantly advances the field by offering a mathematically rigorous solution to heterogeneous transfer learning that formally eliminates the risk of negative transfer. By restricting knowledge transfer to local regions where the source and target functions are similar, the framework ensures robustness against model misspecification and domain divergence. The derivation of oracle inequalities confirms that the method performs comparably to an oracle with prior knowledge of the true data partition, enabling the safe utilization of large, auxiliary datasets to improve predictions in high-dimensional regression tasks where data is scarce.

## Key Findings

*   **Mitigation of the Curse of Dimensionality:** The proposed local transfer approach effectively reduces functional complexity, allowing for efficient estimation in high-dimensional covariate spaces.
*   **Control of Negative Transfer:** The framework strictly limits negative transfer by restricting transfer to local regions where source and target functions are demonstrated to be similar.
*   **Theoretical Robustness:** The method achieves sharp minimax rates and provides oracle inequalities, ensuring robustness even when the model assumptions are slightly misspecified.
*   **Adaptive Estimation:** Estimators simultaneously learn both local transfer functions and target regression, adapting to unknown partition structures without manual tuning.

## Methodology

The study proposes a nonparametric regression transfer learning framework specifically designed to handle heterogeneity between source and target tasks. It operates on a **"local transfer assumption,"** which postulates that the covariate space can be partitioned into a finite number of cells (a tessellation).

**Workflow:**
1.  **Partitioning:** The covariate space is divided into distinct cells.
2.  **Local Modeling:** Within each cell, the target regression function is modeled as a low-complexity transformation of the source regression function.
3.  **Joint Learning:** The methodologies employed utilize estimators that jointly learn the local transfer functions and the target regression.
4.  **Data-Driven Adaptation:** The procedure is fully data-driven, utilizing validation subsets to adapt to unknown partition structures and transfer strengths automatically.

## Contributions

*   **Novel Localized Transfer Framework:** Introduces a tessellation-based approach that models source-target relationships as piece-wise transformations rather than a single global mapping.
*   **Theoretical Guarantees:** Establishes sharp minimax rates and oracle inequalities that formally prove the method's ability to reduce error rates and handle model misspecification.
*   **Solution to Heterogeneity:** Provides a formalized solution for transfer learning in nonparametric regression that accounts for heterogeneity, ensuring that transfer only occurs when beneficial and is localized to relevant sub-regions of the data.

## Technical Details

### Framework Architecture: (TL)$^2$
The paper proposes **Tessellation Localized Transfer Learning ((TL)$^2$)**, designed to transfer knowledge from a source domain (characterized by large sample size but low quality) to a target domain (small sample size, high quality).

The architecture is composed of two distinct layers:

#### Layer 1: Localize-Transfer (Algorithm 1)
*   **Global Source Estimation:** Estimates a global source regression function using a **Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator**.
*   **Partitioning:** Partitions the feature space into an admissible tessellation.
*   **Alignment:** Estimates local transfer functions on each cell to align the source estimator with target responses.

#### Layer 2: Tessellation Selection (Algorithm 2)
*   **Structural Model Selection:** Performs model selection at the structural level.
*   **Validation:** Uses a validation subsample to select the optimal tessellation that minimizes empirical risk.

### Mathematical Assumptions
The method relies on the core assumption that the target function is a transformation of the source function within spatially localized cells:
$$f_T(x) = g^*_\ell(f_S(x))$$

*   **Smoothness Constraints:** Subject to Hölder smoothness constraints.
*   **Geometric Regularity:** Geometric regularity conditions are applied to the tessellation cells to ensure theoretical stability.
