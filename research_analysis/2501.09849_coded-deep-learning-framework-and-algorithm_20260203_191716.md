## 📝 Executive Summary

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) present substantial computational bottlenecks regarding latency, memory usage, and communication overhead, particularly in distributed training environments. While existing compression techniques effectively optimize models for inference, they largely ignore the inherent computational complexity of the training process itself. Consequently, there is a critical need for frameworks that minimize both the computational load and communication costs during training without significantly sacrificing the accuracy achieved by full-precision floating-point models.

The paper introduces **Coded Deep Learning (CDL)**, a framework that reframes deep learning operations as a source coding problem to optimize for compressibility during training. Unlike standard quantization, CDL employs a probabilistic quantization mechanism that minimizes the entropy (bit-length) of weights and activations directly within the training loop, effectively enforcing rate-distortion optimization. The method utilizes a stochastic quantizer for forward passes and a differentiable soft proxy for backward passes to enable gradient updates. To address the accuracy trade-offs of this strict quantization, the authors propose **Relaxed CDL (R-CDL)**. This variant performs training operations in full precision to maximize accuracy but strictly enforces the entropy constraints on the data distributions, ensuring the final model remains highly compressible for deployment despite using full precision during the learning phase.

Empirical evaluations on ImageNet using ResNet-50 demonstrate that both CDL and R-CDL outperform state-of-the-art compression algorithms, including PACT, LQ-Nets, and LSQ. Across 4-4, 3-3, and 2-2 bit-width configurations, the proposed methods achieved Top-1 accuracies ranging from 64.3% to 70.7%. While this indicates a performance gap compared to the ~76% accuracy of a full-precision baseline, the framework achieved superior compressibility, reducing average bits per activation to approximately 1.5 to 2.0 bits. These results validate the framework's ability to maintain high model performance while drastically reducing bit-rates.

This research establishes a new paradigm for efficient deep learning by treating network operations through the lens of information theory, successfully decoupling training precision from inference efficiency. By demonstrating that entropy constraints can be integrated into the training loop to produce inherently compressible models, CDL and R-CDL provide a viable pathway for deploying complex neural networks on resource-constrained hardware. The findings suggest that future architectures can be designed ground-up for communication efficiency, reducing the barrier for high-performance AI in distributed and edge computing environments.
