## Executive Summary

**Problem**
Deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge hardware requires aggressive quantization to minimize memory and computational demands. However, standard low-precision quantization methods frequently incur accuracy degradation due to sub-optimal quantization thresholds, particularly within non-standard architectures designed specifically for hardware efficiency. The core challenge lies in optimizing the trade-off between weight precision and computational efficiency in architectures that eschew traditional multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations in favor of simpler logic gates, where maintaining high accuracy is difficult without sophisticated quantization strategies.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce Histogram-Equalized Quantization (HEQ), a novel Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) framework designed to optimize linear symmetric quantization. HEQ adaptively determines quantization thresholds and step sizes by analyzing layer-wise weight histograms and utilizing n-quantiles. This mechanism dynamically adjusts parameters based on the data distribution or loss characteristics, ensuring optimal precision retention. This quantization technique is applied to Logic-Gated Residual Networks—specifically ORNet-11 and MUXORNet-11—which replace standard arithmetic operations with OR and 2-input MUX logic gates. By relying on thresholded bitcounts for computation rather than power-intensive multipliers, these architectures drastically reduce hardware complexity while the HEQ method ensures quantization does not become a performance bottleneck.

**Results**
Experimental validation demonstrates that the HEQ-driven MUXORNet-11 model achieved **84.17% accuracy** on the CIFAR-10 dataset, establishing a new state-of-the-art result. This performance outperforms the Learned Step Size Quantization (LSQ) baseline of 83.80% by +0.37%, as well as the plain baseline of 83.3%; additionally, ORNet-11 achieved 83.8%. On the STL-10 dataset, the authors demonstrated that the proposed networks achieve higher accuracy compared to previous works, with MUXORNet-11 reaching 75.18%. Crucially, these performance gains were achieved with operational efficiency defined by the replacement of floating-point multipliers with binary logic gates. This shift to thresholded bitcounts significantly reduces the computational cost per layer, offering marked hardware gains in terms of energy efficiency and area usage.

**Impact**
This research significantly advances the field of efficient deep learning by validating that logic-gated architectures can rival or exceed the performance of standard quantized neural networks. By establishing new benchmarks on CIFAR-10 and outperforming previous works on STL-10, the authors demonstrate that replacing complex arithmetic with simple Boolean logic (OR and MUX gates) does not necessitate a sacrifice in accuracy when paired with an intelligent quantization strategy like HEQ. This work paves the way for deploying highly capable neural networks on ultra-low-power edge devices, offering a superior balance between software-level accuracy and hardware-level implementation costs.
