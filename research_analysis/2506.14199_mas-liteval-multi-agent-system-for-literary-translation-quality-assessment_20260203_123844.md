## Executive Summary

### Problem
This paper addresses the fundamental inadequacy of traditional automated evaluation metrics—such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE—in assessing literary translations. These legacy metrics rely heavily on lexical overlap, which allows them to measure surface-level accuracy but renders them incapable of capturing narrative consistency, stylistic fidelity, or cultural nuance. This limitation presents a significant challenge for the field of Translation Quality Assessment (TQA), as high n-gram overlap does not correlate with the preservation of the artistic and lyrical qualities essential to literature. Consequently, there is a critical evaluation gap where current automated tools fail to distinguish between a technically accurate translation and a high-quality literary one.

### Innovation
To bridge this gap, the authors introduce **MAS-LitEval**, a reference-free Multi-Agent System (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework utilizes a parallel processing architecture comprising three specialized agents:
*   **Terminology Consistency** (employing NER)
*   **Narrative Perspective Consistency**
*   **Stylistic Consistency**

A coordinator agent aggregates the outputs of these agents into an Overall Translation Quality Score (OTQS) using a weighted formula ($OTQS = 0.3 \times S_T + 0.3 \times S_N + 0.4 \times S_S$), assigning the highest priority to stylistic elements. The system processes text in 4096-token chunks with global context management, implemented in Python using spaCy and LLM APIs to ensure scalability and depth of analysis.

### Results
In Korean-to-English translation experiments on *The Little Prince* and *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court*, MAS-LitEval provided a more granular assessment of literary quality than traditional metrics. The **claude-3.7-sonnet** model achieved the highest OTQS (0.890 and 0.880, respectively), followed by gpt-4o, while open-source models like Llama-3.1-8B scored significantly lower (~0.71).

Crucially, the system exposed the limitations of lexical metrics: while gpt-4o achieved a higher BLEU score (0.30) than claude-3.7-sonnet (0.28) on *The Little Prince*, MAS-LitEval ranked claude-3.7-sonnet higher due to its superior lyrical fidelity. The OTQS demonstrated strong correlation with the human-centric WMT-KIWI metric (0.93) but weak correlation with BLEU (0.62), METEOR (0.70), and ROUGE.

### Impact
The introduction of MAS-LitEval represents a paradigm shift in the automated evaluation of literary texts, moving the field beyond rigid lexical matching toward a holistic understanding of translation quality. By providing a scalable tool that effectively measures narrative and stylistic preservation, this framework empowers researchers and translators to rigorously assess cultural nuances in machine-translated literature. This work not only offers a functional solution for current TQA challenges but also sets a new standard for developing LLMs capable of handling the complexities of creative and artistic translation.

## Key Findings

*   **Inadequacy of Traditional Metrics:** Metrics like BLEU and METEOR fail to capture narrative consistency and stylistic fidelity due to their sole focus on lexical overlap.
*   **Superior Performance:** The proposed MAS-LitEval system outperformed traditional metrics in assessing literary translations.
*   **High Achievement:** Top-performing models evaluated by MAS-LitEval achieved scores of up to **0.890** in capturing literary nuances.
*   **Multi-Dimensional Assessment:** The system effectively assesses translations across three critical dimensions:
    *   Terminology
    *   Narrative
    *   Style

## Methodology

The study implements a Multi-Agent System (MAS) utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework evaluates translations based on three specific pillars: terminology, narrative, and style.

**Testing Protocol:**
*   **Corpus:** Translations of two distinct literary works: *The Little Prince* and *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court*.
*   **Source Models:** Translations generated by various LLMs.
*   **Benchmarking:** Performance was measured by direct comparison against traditional lexical overlap metrics.

## Contributions

*   **New Framework:** Introduction of **MAS-LitEval**, a scalable and nuanced framework specifically designed for Translation Quality Assessment (TQA) in literary contexts.
*   **Bridging the Gap:** Addressing the critical oversight in current automated metrics by prioritizing narrative consistency and stylistic fidelity over simple lexical matching.
*   **Functional Tool:** Providing a practical tool for translators and researchers to better assess the preservation of cultural nuances and stylistic elements in machine-translated literature.

## Technical Details

**System Architecture**
*   **Type:** Reference-free, multi-agent system utilizing parallel processing.
*   **Components:** Three specialized agents and one coordinator.
    *   **Terminology Consistency Agent:** Uses NER (Weight: 0.3)
    *   **Narrative Perspective Consistency Agent:** (Weight: 0.3)
    *   **Stylistic Consistency Agent:** (Weight: 0.4)
    *   **Coordinator:** Aggregates agent scores.

**Scoring Formula**
The Overall Translation Quality Score (OTQS) is calculated on a scale of 0 to 1:
$$OTQS = 0.3 \times S_T + 0.3 \times S_N + 0.4 \times S_S$$

**Implementation Specs**
*   **Chunking:** Texts are processed in 4096-token chunks with global context management.
*   **Tech Stack:** Implemented in Python using spaCy and LLM APIs.

## Results

**Model Performance (Korean-to-English)**
*   **claude-3.7-sonnet:** Highest OTQS (0.890 for *The Little Prince*, 0.880 for *A Connecticut Yankee...*).
*   **gpt-4o:** Followed closely as the second-highest performer.
*   **Llama-3.1-8B:** Scored significantly lower, approximately 0.71.

**Metric Correlation**
*   **Strong Correlation:** OTQS vs. WMT-KIWI (**0.93**)
*   **Weak Correlation:**
    *   OTQS vs. BLEU: 0.62
    *   OTQS vs. METEOR: 0.70
    *   OTQS vs. ROUGE: [Low]

**Qualitative Insight**
In *The Little Prince* experiment, gpt-4o achieved a BLEU score of 0.30 compared to claude-3.7-sonnet's 0.28. However, MAS-LitEval ranked claude-3.7-sonnet higher, attributing the success to better **lyrical fidelity** and **poetic nuance**.
