## Executive Summary

Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to reverse-engineer neural network algorithms by identifying causal circuits. However, the field frequently treats circuit discovery as a deterministic process. This paper addresses a critical lack of statistical rigor regarding the reliability of these interpretability methods.

The authors challenge the assumption that methods like Edge Activation Patching with Integrated Gradients (EAP-IG) reveal fixed, reproducible internal structures. Instead, they posit that without assessing statistical variance, findings derived from these techniques are potentially misleading.

Technically, the authors implement a systematic stability analysis of the state-of-the-art EAP-IG method by subjecting it to a comprehensive suite of controlled perturbations (input resampling, prompt paraphrasing, and noise injection). Stability is quantified using the Jaccard Index and Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS).

The empirical analysis reveals that EAP-IG suffers from high structural variance. Quantitatively, Jaccard indices frequently fell below 0.3, and MDS visualizations showed high dispersion across minor configuration changes. The study concludes that no specific EAP-IG configuration mitigates this sensitivity, challenging the scientific reliability of current MI research. The paper advocates for a mandatory paradigm shift, proposing that routine reporting of stability metrics become a requirement for future work.

## Key Findings

*   **High Structural Variance:** The state-of-the-art circuit discovery method, EAP-IG, exhibits high structural variance and instability across runs.
*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The method displays significant sensitivity to changes in hyperparameters, including resampling strategies and aggregation methods.
*   **Questionable Reliability:** The observed instability across diverse models and tasks questions the reliability of current mechanistic interpretability findings that fail to account for statistical variance.
*   **Systemic Instability:** No specific variant of EAP-IG demonstrated lower variance, implying the instability is inherent to the method family rather than specific tasks.

## Methodology

The authors reframed Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) as a statistical estimation problem to evaluate the robustness of circuit discovery.

*   **Framework:** Systematic stability analysis conducted on the EAP-IG method.
*   **Perturbations:** A comprehensive suite of controlled perturbations was applied, including:
    *   Input resampling
    *   Prompt paraphrasing
    *   Hyperparameter variation
    *   Injected noise
*   **Evaluation Scope:** The assessment was performed across a diverse range of models and tasks to accurately measure variance and robustness.

## Technical Details

The study focuses on the technical implementation and evaluation metrics used to determine the stability of interpretability methods.

### Core Concepts
*   **Edge Activation Patching (EAP) & EAP-IG:** Methods combining activation patching with Integrated Gradients to identify edge-level circuits.
*   **Statistical Inference:** Frames MI as a statistical inference problem rather than a deterministic extraction.
    *   **Instability:** Defined as variability resulting from resampling (variance).
    *   **Robustness:** Defined as stability under analytical changes.

### Parameter Variations
The study tested stability by varying five specific parameters:
1.  Resampling strategy
2.  Aggregation method
3.  Intervention type
4.  EAP variant
5.  Pruning strategy

### Evaluation Metrics
*   **Jaccard Index:** Used to measure structure similarity between discovered circuits.
*   **Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS):** Used to visualize the dispersion and clustering of circuit outputs.

## Contributions

The paper makes three primary contributions to the field of Mechanistic Interpretability:

1.  **Conceptual Framework:** Proposes a paradigm shift by viewing interpretability methods as statistical estimators subject to variance, rather than deterministic processes.
2.  **Empirical Analysis:** Provides a rigorous assessment of EAP-IG, revealing significant instabilities under various perturbations that were previously overlooked.
3.  **Best Practices:** Advocates for a new standard in research, recommending the routine reporting of stability metrics to ensure statistically grounded and scientifically rigorous findings.

## Results

Experiments demonstrate that EAP-IG exhibits high structural variance, where small data perturbations or hyperparameter changes yield significantly different circuits.

*   **Jaccard Indices:** Analysis found low overlap between circuits across perturbations, often below **0.3**, indicating minimal structural consistency.
*   **MDS Visualizations:** Confirmed high dispersion, showing that minor input or methodological changes resulted in markedly different structures.
*   **Cross-Architecture Consistency:** Issues were confirmed across three tasks and architectures, suggesting the problem is a systemic property of the method family.
*   **Implication:** The results suggest that many published circuit discoveries may not be statistically replicable if subjected to stability audits.
