## Executive Summary

The paper addresses the critical challenge of training Extremely Low-bit Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically targeting **1.58-bit (ternary) quantization**, which is essential for reducing the memory footprint and computational costs of modern inference. Current Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods struggle with optimization instability caused by a gradient mismatch between latent continuous weights and their quantized discrete counterparts. This issue, often compounded by the non-differentiable nature of hard rounding functions, leads to premature discretization. Consequently, models suffer from a significant loss of representational capacity and performance degradation, making ultra-low-bit quantization difficult to implement effectively.

The authors introduce **HESTIA**, a novel framework designed to overcome optimization barriers through a Hessian-guided differentiable relaxation strategy. Rather than relying on rigid, non-differentiable step functions, HESTIA utilizes a temperature-controlled softmax to maintain gradient flow, employing progressive hardening to transition weights from continuous approximations to discrete states gradually. The key technical advancement is the integration of curvature-aware optimization via tensor-wise Hessian traces, which estimate the curvature of the loss landscape. This "sensitivity-aware discretization" allows the framework to apply a fine-grained, dynamic annealing schedule that adapts to the specific sensitivity of different network layers, ensuring a more robust optimization path.

Experimental evaluations on the Llama-3.2 family demonstrate that HESTIA significantly outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines in zero-shot performance settings. Specifically, the framework achieved a **5.39% improvement on the Llama-3.2-1B model** and a **4.34% improvement on the Llama-3.2-3B model**. These results indicate that the Hessian-guided relaxation strategy successfully recovers the representational capacity typically lost during aggressive quantization, enabling the effective training of 1.58-bit LLMs without the severe accuracy penalties observed in previous methods.

This research establishes a new performance benchmark for ternary quantization in state-of-the-art LLMs, proving that 1.58-bit models can be trained effectively without sacrificing significant model utility. By successfully integrating second-order Hessian information into the quantization process, HESTIA provides a mathematically rigorous solution to the persistent problem of gradient mismatch in low-bit training. The work influences the field by offering a viable path toward deploying highly compressed, generative AI models on resource-constrained hardware, potentially unlocking new levels of efficiency for edge and mobile devices.
