## Executive Summary

Reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics faces critical bottlenecks in high-dimensional control spaces, particularly when navigating sparse reward landscapes typical of complex manipulation tasks. Standard RL algorithms often struggle to learn precise end-effector movements in cluttered environments without prohibitive amounts of interaction time. This paper addresses the challenge of accelerating the learning process for a 7-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic manipulator operating in obstacle-rich scenarios—a setting where purely algorithmic exploration is too sample-inefficient for practical deployment.

The authors propose a hybrid RL architecture that integrates a neural feedback loop using Error-Related Potentials (ErrP) decoded from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Technically, the system utilizes an offline-trained classifier to detect implicit human evaluative signals regarding the robot's performance. These neural signals are incorporated into the RL loop via reward shaping, utilizing a weighted integration strategy. A key innovation is the introduction of a weighting parameter ($\alpha$), which governs the influence of human neural feedback relative to the standard environment reward, allowing the system to balance autonomous exploration with human-guided correction.

Empirical evaluation across **14 participants** demonstrates that the integration of ErrP-based feedback significantly outperforms standard sparse-reward baselines. While the baseline RL algorithm achieved a near **0% success rate** due to the sparsity of rewards, the proposed method with optimal feedback weighting ($\alpha=0.2$) achieved an average task success rate of approximately **66%**. Furthermore, the study observed accelerated convergence rates, with the EEG-guided agent reaching stable policies faster than the standard approach. Leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation confirmed that the optimal group-derived weighting could be consistently applied to new subjects; this cross-subject evaluation yielded a mean success rate of roughly **60%** for unseen participants, proving robustness to inter-individual EEG variability without the need for per-subject recalibration.
