# Speech Translation Refinement using Large Language Models

> ### **Executive Summary**
>
> Speech Translation (ST) systems typically operate in a cascaded manner where Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) generates a transcription that is subsequently translated into a target language. A critical limitation of this pipeline is error propagation, where inaccuracies in the source transcription directly degrade translation quality. Existing refinement methods often attempt to correct only the translation output, overlooking the noisy source text. This paper addresses the need to mitigate error propagation by treating the refinement process as a joint optimization problem involving both the ASR transcription and the ST output.
>
> The authors propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to jointly refine the source-side ASR transcription and the target-side ST output simultaneously. This approach aligns and corrects the source text to better match the translation, ensuring consistency. Technically, the method is implemented through two distinct strategies: a training-free approach using In-Context Learning (ICL) with models like GPT-3.5-turbo, and a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach using open-source models like LLaMA3-8B and Mistral-12B. The PEFT strategy employs a two-stage process—first aligning the ASR and ST representations, then performing refinement—and incorporates document-level context via Chunk-Based Decoding (CBD) to maintain coherence.
>
> Empirical evaluation across MuST-C and CoVoST 2 datasets demonstrates that joint refinement significantly outperforms refining the translation alone. For instance, on the MuST-C En→De task, Mistral-12B achieved 33.39 BLEU with joint refinement compared to 32.60 BLEU when refining only the translation. Furthermore, the PEFT approach proved superior to training-free ICL, with Mistral-12B PEFT scoring 32.75 BLEU versus GPT-3.5 ICL's 30.52 BLEU. Incorporating document-level context (with an optimal context length of K=3) provided further gains, boosting Mistral-12B's performance to 33.39 BLEU.
>
> This research establishes a new state-of-the-art paradigm for ST refinement by demonstrating that correcting the source transcript is as vital as correcting the translation. The findings highlight the versatility of LLMs in this domain, offering effective solutions for both scenarios requiring zero-shot inference and those allowing for lightweight fine-tuning. By providing a reproducible framework and open-sourcing the code, the authors facilitate broader adoption of joint refinement techniques.

## Key Findings

*   **Superiority of Joint Refinement:** Jointly refining both ASR transcription and ST outputs yields significantly better performance than refining the translation alone.
*   **Scenario Versatility:** The proposed approach effectively enhances ST performance in both training-free scenarios and parameter-efficient fine-tuning scenarios.
*   **Impact of Context:** Incorporating document-level context significantly boosts refinement performance.
*   **Broad Generalizability:** The method proves effective across multiple LLM architectures (GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B, Mistral-12B) and diverse datasets (MuST-C and CoVoST 2).

## Methodology

The researchers propose a joint refinement process leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance Speech Translation systems. The methodology utilizes LLMs to simultaneously refine and align the ASR transcription with the ST output. This approach is evaluated through two distinct implementation strategies:

1.  **Training-free In-context Learning:** Utilizes few-shot capabilities without weight updates.
2.  **Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning:** Adapts the LLM with minimal parameter updates.

Furthermore, the methodology investigates the integration of document-level context to assist the model in maintaining coherence.
