> **⚠️ Executive Summary**
>
> Contemporary Spoken Language Models (SLMs) face a fundamental limitation in achieving human-like social awareness, as they typically prioritize textual semantics while neglecting critical paralinguistic and speaker-specific characteristics. Current systems often treat speech simply as an acoustic vehicle for text, failing to model essential nuances such as emotion, dialect, age, and non-speech vocalizations like laughter or coughing. This deficiency prevents AI from engaging in naturally expressive and adaptive communication.
>
> This paper introduces **GOAT-SLM**, a novel architecture built upon the TeleChat2-7B foundation, featuring a "dual-modality head" designed to decouple linguistic modeling from acoustic realization. The system employs a modular structure comprising five components to simultaneously track semantic content and acoustic style. It is trained using a computationally efficient, three-stage strategy to capture 7 distinct emotions, 4 non-speech vocalizations, 3 age groups, and 6 dialect types.
>
> GOAT-SLM achieved superior performance on the TELEVAL benchmark (68.31%), significantly outperforming open-source baselines. The results demonstrate a balanced capability across modalities, maintaining semantic reasoning performance on par with text-only baselines while realizing significant gains in paralinguistic domains.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Superior Performance on Non-Semantic Tasks:** GOAT-SLM outperforms existing open-source models in handling complex vocal attributes, specifically excelling in tasks involving emotion, dialectal variation, and age-sensitive interactions.
*   **Balanced Semantic and Non-Semantic Capabilities:** The model achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic (content-based) and non-semantic (paralinguistic) tasks on the TELEVAL benchmark.
*   **Effective Decoupling of Modalities:** The dual-modality head architecture successfully decouples linguistic modeling from acoustic realization, allowing for robust language understanding while simultaneously supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation.
*   **Importance of Paralinguistic Awareness:** The study validates the significance of modeling speech characteristics beyond textual semantics, demonstrating that incorporating dialect, emotion, and non-speech vocalizations leads to more socially aware AI systems.

## 📚 Research Contributions

1.  **Introduction of GOAT-SLM:** A novel spoken language model (SLM) that extends capabilities beyond text semantics to include deep awareness of paralinguistic and speaker characteristics (e.g., dialect, age, emotion, non-speech vocalizations).
2.  **Architectural Innovation:** The proposal of a dual-modality head that enables the simultaneous tracking of semantic content and acoustic style, addressing the limitation in current SLMs that treat speech merely as a vehicle for text.
3.  **Advancement in Socially Aware AI:** The work pushes the development of spoken language systems toward being more natural, adaptive, and socially aware by effectively integrating rich human speech cues often ignored by traditional end-to-end models.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The authors employ a **dual-modality head architecture** designed to decouple linguistic modeling from acoustic realization. This separation allows the model to process text semantics independently from the nuances of sound production.

The training approach utilizes a **modular, staged strategy** to enhance efficiency and versatility. This process progressively aligns:
*   Linguistic information
*   Paralinguistic information
*   Speaker characteristic information

This alignment is achieved using large-scale speech-text corpora to ensure the model handles both content and style effectively.
