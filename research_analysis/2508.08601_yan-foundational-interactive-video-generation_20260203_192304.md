## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of transforming high-fidelity video diffusion models into real-time, interactive engines capable of simulating complex game environments. Existing generative models typically produce static or pre-computed sequences that lack the low-latency responsiveness required for interactive applications, such as video games or simulators. Bridging the gap between cinematic video quality and the strict, frame-by-frame controllability of interactive mechanics is essential for advancing AI-driven media but remains computationally prohibitive due to the high resource demands of diffusion inference.

The paper introduces **"Yan,"** a foundational framework composed of three distinct modules: **Yan-Sim**, **Yan-Gen**, and **Yan-Edit**. To achieve real-time performance, Yan-Sim employs a highly compressed 3D-VAE alongside a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising process, drastically reducing inference latency. Yan-Gen converts standard video diffusion models into interactive generators by injecting game-specific knowledge through a hierarchical autoregressive captioning method, enabling frame-wise, action-controllable generation. Additionally, Yan-Edit utilizes a hybrid architecture that decouples depth-driven mechanics simulation from text-guided visual rendering, allowing for multi-granularity editing where gameplay mechanics and visual styles can be modified independently.

Yan successfully delivers high-fidelity simulation at 1080P resolution and 60 FPS with nearly delay-free latency, meeting the rigorous demands of real-time interaction. The system is trained on a massive dataset of 400 million interactive video data points, encompassing over 90 scenario styles and an 8-dimensional action space, collected via automated agents in the game "Yuan Meng Star." In comparative benchmarks, Yan significantly outperforms existing baselines—including The Matrix, PlayGen, and GameNGen—by achieving superior resolution and scale while maintaining the strict real-time performance required for interactive play.

This work represents a paradigm shift in AI creation, establishing a comprehensive pipeline that integrates simulation, generation, and editing into a unified system. By demonstrating that open-domain video diffusion models can function as interactive engines, Yan lays the groundwork for a new class of AI-driven creative tools and media. This advancement enables the rapid prototyping of complex interactive experiences where users can manipulate both game mechanics and visual aesthetics via text prompts, fundamentally changing how dynamic digital content is created and consumed.

## Methodology

The Yan framework utilizes a comprehensive three-module pipeline designed to bridge the gap between static video generation and interactive simulation:

1.  **AAA-level Simulation Module (Yan-Sim):**
    Employs a highly-compressed, low-latency **3D-VAE** and **KV-cache-based shift-window denoising** to facilitate real-time inference without sacrificing fidelity.

2.  **Multi-Modal Generation Module (Yan-Gen):**
    Converts Video Diffusion Models into interactive engines. It uses a **hierarchical autoregressive caption method** to inject game-specific knowledge, allowing for prompt-controllable, frame-by-frame generation across domains.

3.  **Multi-Granularity Editing Module (Yan-Edit):**
    Utilizes a hybrid model architecture to disentangle mechanics simulation from visual rendering. This separation enables granular, text-based edits to the video content.
