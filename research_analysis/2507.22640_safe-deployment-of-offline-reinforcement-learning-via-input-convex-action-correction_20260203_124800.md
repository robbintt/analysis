## 📝 Executive Summary

Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a compelling pathway to automating complex industrial systems, such as chemical process control, by deriving optimal policies from historical data without the hazards of online exploration. However, standard offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning and Implicit Q-learning, face significant reliability hurdles when applied to high-stakes environments like exothermic polymerization Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactors (CSTRs). In these settings, conventional methods frequently exhibit steady-state offsets and degraded performance near operational setpoints. These limitations are critical barriers to deployment, as industrial applications demand unwavering stability and safety where even minor control deviations can lead to substantial operational risks.

To bridge the gap between offline training and safe online execution, the authors introduce Input Convex Action Correction (ICAC), a novel deployment-time safety layer. Technically, the method utilizes Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) to learn state-conditioned cost surfaces. During deployment, a pre-trained offline policy proposes an action which is evaluated by the PICNN; if the action is deemed unsafe, the layer performs a real-time, differentiable correction via gradient descent. This non-intrusive approach leverages the convexity properties of PICNNs to enforce safety constraints without requiring model retraining or interaction with the live environment.

The study evaluated the approach using a Gymnasium-compatible simulation of an exothermic polymerization CSTR, benchmarking against datasets generated from suboptimally tuned Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers featuring randomized tunings to ensure robustness. Quantitative results demonstrated that while standard offline RL algorithms failed due to significant steady-state offsets and elevated Integral Absolute Error (IAE), the integration of the ICAC safety layer effectively mitigated these issues. The proposed system outperformed traditional PI controllers across three complex, industrially relevant scenarios—Reactor Startup, Grade Change Down, and Grade Change Up—achieving robust stability and high-performance control with zero online exploration.

This research establishes a practical framework for the reliable application of data-driven automation in safety-critical industrial systems. By demonstrating that convex action correction can resolve the performance instabilities typical of offline RL, the authors provide a viable path to replacing heuristic controllers with high-performance RL policies in sectors where failure is unacceptable. The introduction of a specialized simulation environment and a reproducible dataset further supports the field by providing a standardized benchmark for future research into safe industrial control.
