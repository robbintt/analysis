## Executive Summary

> The rapid expansion of scientific literature has created a bottleneck where human cognitive capacity and resource constraints limit the speed and breadth of discovery. While current AI tools assist with specific tasks like data analysis or literature review, they function as narrow instruments rather than autonomous scientists. This paper addresses the critical need for "Artificial General Science"—systems capable of navigating the entire scientific lifecycle independently. The challenge lies in creating an agentic framework that can move beyond supportive roles to autonomously synthesize knowledge, formulate hypotheses, and manage complex, multi-stage experimental workflows without substantial human oversight.
>
> The authors introduce a domain-agnostic, agentic AI system built on a "master orchestrator" architecture that coordinates specialized autonomous agents (e.g., an idea agent). This system utilizes a recursive learning loop comprising seed initiation, ideation, experimentation, findings, and iteration. Technically, the innovation leverages vector-space interpolation and latent space abstraction of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate novel hypotheses. The system demonstrates full workflow autonomy, engaging in sustained tasks such as executing 8-hour+ coding sessions to build analysis pipelines and managing real-world interactions, effectively closing the loop between conception and publication without human intervention.
>
> In a rigorous proof-of-concept demonstration, the system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies involving 288 human participants. A specific case study investigating Visual Working Memory and Mental Rotation successfully targeted a small-to-medium effect size ($r=0.25$) with 95% power, recruiting a final sample of 287 participants (mean age 28.24 years). The AI managed the entire process, including a 2x2 factorial design, data collection, and statistical analysis. The resulting manuscripts were preregistered and open-sourced, with expert evaluation deeming the output comparable in quality to work produced by experienced human researchers, despite noted limitations in conceptual nuance.
>
> This research marks a significant paradigm shift from narrow AI tools to general-purpose systems capable of agentic discovery, establishing a foundation for Embodied AI that can test hypotheses through physical experimentation. By demonstrating that AI can autonomously manage non-trivial, end-to-end research, this work unlocks the potential to explore regions of scientific space that are currently inaccessible due to human limitations. Furthermore, it initiates a crucial philosophical and ethical discourse regarding the attribution of scientific credit and the definition of understanding in the era of automated discovery.
