## Executive Summary

Despite the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, their efficacy in clinical prognostic tasks compared to established traditional machine learning (ML) methods remains uncertain. Furthermore, while integrating causal features promises improved interpretability and robustness, the practical viability of combining Causal Discovery (CD) with LLMs in complex clinical environments has not been systematically evaluated.

This study introduces **REACT-LLM**, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the integration of LLMs with causal features for clinical risk prediction. The research compares 15 state-of-the-art LLMs (including GPT-o1 and Llama-3.1-405b) against 6 traditional ML models and 3 CD algorithms across 7 distinct clinical outcomes derived from 2 real-world datasets. The methodology incorporates five prompting strategies—In-Context Learning (ICL), Self-Refinement, Role-Playing, Chain-of-Thought, and narrative serialization—to assess how different input configurations affect prognostic performance.

The empirical analysis reveals that traditional ML models, such as XGBoost and Random Forest, consistently outperform LLMs by a significant margin of 10–20%. While proprietary LLMs generally surpassed open-source models and In-Context Learning proved the most effective prompting strategy, the integration of causal features yielded only negligible performance gains. Notably, **Gemini-2-Flash** was the sole exception, slightly exceeding traditional ML performance (AUPRC 0.8540 vs. 0.8473) on the EarlyICU task. The limited success of causal integration is attributed to the violation of strict assumptions required by standard CD algorithms when applied to noisy, real-world clinical data.

REACT-LLM provides a critical reference point for the medical AI community, establishing the first standardized benchmark for causal-enhanced LLMs in clinical decision-making. By demonstrating that the theoretical benefits of causal discovery do not yet translate to practical performance gains in this domain, the study identifies a significant barrier to progress: the incompatibility of current CD assumptions with clinical data complexity. This work effectively redirects future research toward developing more robust causal methods that can handle real-world data variance, while validating that traditional ML remains the superior choice for clinical risk prediction in the immediate term.

## Key Findings

*   **LLM vs. Traditional ML Performance:** While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable competence in clinical prognostic tasks, they currently do not outperform traditional machine learning (ML) models.
*   **Limited Gains from Causal Integration:** Integrating causal features derived from Causal Discovery (CD) algorithms into LLMs yields only limited performance improvements in clinical risk prediction.
*   **Barrier to Causal Application:** The primary reason for the limited success of causal integration is that the strict assumptions required by many CD methods are often violated when applied to complex, real-world clinical data.
*   **Potential for Synergy:** Despite the lack of immediate performance breakthroughs, the benchmark reveals a promising synergy between LLMs and causal features, suggesting potential for future development in this area.

## Results

The experimental analysis provided the following insights:

*   **Traditional ML Dominance:** Traditional ML models consistently outperformed LLMs by a margin of **10–20%**.
*   **The Outlier:** **Gemini-2-Flash** was the only model to exceed traditional ML performance (AUPRC 0.8540 vs 0.8473 on EarlyICU).
*   **Model Hierarchy:** Larger models generally outperformed smaller ones, and proprietary LLMs outperformed open-source models.
*   **Best Prompting Strategy:** In-Context Learning (ICL) was identified as the most effective prompting strategy.
*   **Causal Feature Impact:** Integrating causal features resulted in limited performance gains due to the strict assumptions of Causal Discovery methods in clinical data.
