## 📌 Executive Summary

The current internet infrastructure, designed primarily for human-centric interaction, is fundamentally misaligned with the emerging **"Agentic Web,"** where autonomous AI agents are superseding mobile applications as the primary digital entities. This legacy architecture creates significant inefficiencies for AI, including data silos, unfriendly visual interfaces, and high collaboration costs, as existing protocols lack the native capabilities required for large-scale agent interconnection. The authors identify four core trends driving this evolution:

1.  Replacement of traditional software by agents.
2.  Universal agent interconnection.
3.  Native protocol-based connections.
4.  Autonomous agent organization.

To address this infrastructural gap, the paper introduces the **Agent Network Protocol (ANP)**, a modular, AI-native communication framework designed to enable universal agent interoperability while maintaining backward compatibility with existing standards. The architecture is structured into three distinct layers:

*   **Identity and Encrypted Communication Layer:** Utilizing Multi-DID to technically decouple human control from agent identity.
*   **Meta-Protocol Negotiation Layer:** Allows agents to dynamically establish interaction rules (e.g., using natural language to agree upon specific data formats like JSON-RPC prior to execution).
*   **Application Protocol Layer:** Handles agent description and discovery.

By shifting focus from visual data to structured semantics, ANP facilitates de-platformized, point-to-point connections where agents can self-organize and authenticate autonomously. As this work is a conceptual whitepaper and architectural blueprint, it does not present experimental data or performance benchmarks. The "results" are theoretical definitions and specifications, providing a complete technical roadmap for implementing the proposed system and establishing the foundational infrastructure layer for the next generation of the internet.

The research employs a structured approach to designing the next-generation protocol stack:

*   **AI-Native & Compatible Design:**
    *   Proposes the **Agent Network Protocol (ANP)** using an AI-native design philosophy.
    *   Maintains backward compatibility with existing internet protocols to ensure smooth transition.
*   **Modular Architecture:**
    *   Utilizes a modular, composable architecture.
    *   Based on minimalist yet extensible principles to allow for future growth.
*   **Three-Layer Protocol System:**
    Structures the solution into three distinct layers to systematically address technical challenges:
    1.  **Identity and Encrypted Communication Layer**
    2.  **Meta-Protocol Negotiation Layer**
    3.  **Application Protocol Layer**

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Architecture Overview
The paper proposes ANP to create an AI-native 'Agentic Web'. The architecture features a multi-layered protocol stack designed to move away from visual interfaces toward structured data and semantics.

### Protocol Stack Layers

| Layer | Function & Components |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Identity & Secure Communication** | Focuses on agent identity and encrypted channels. Implements a **Multi-DID strategy** to distinguish between Human and Agent authorization. |
| **2. Meta-Protocol** | Defines interaction rules. Enables self-organization via **natural language negotiation** to agree on protocols dynamically. |
| **3. Application Protocol** | Includes the **Agent Description Protocol** and **Agent Discovery Protocol**. Manages how agents present themselves and find one another. |

### Core Mechanisms
*   **Communication Shift:** Moves from visual-based interaction to direct protocol-based communication.
*   **Interconnection:** Enables universal de-platformized point-to-point interconnection.
*   **Self-Organization:** Agents use natural language to negotiate and organize autonomously.

### Security & Privacy
*   **Multi-DID Strategy:** distinct Decentralized Identifiers for humans vs. agents.
*   **Authorization:** Separation of Human and Agent authorization flows.
*   **Privacy:** Implementation of privacy-preserving measures within the communication layer.
