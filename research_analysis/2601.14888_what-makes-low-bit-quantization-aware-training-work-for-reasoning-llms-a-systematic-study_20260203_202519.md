## Executive Summary

Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced reasoning capabilities is computationally expensive, driving a need for extreme low-bit quantization (e.g., 3-bit or 2-bit) to improve inference efficiency. However, standard Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods, which calibrate models without retraining, suffer severe performance degradation on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics and logic. While Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) offers a potential solution by fine-tuning the model to adapt to quantization noise, the mechanisms for successfully applying QAT to reasoning models—particularly those trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL)—remain poorly understood. This paper addresses the critical challenge of maintaining high reasoning accuracy in quantized models, a prerequisite for the cost-effective deployment of state-of-the-art reasoning agents.

The authors introduce **"Reasoning-QAT,"** a unified training pipeline derived from a systematic empirical study of QAT variables. The key technical innovation lies in the identification and combination of three specific mechanisms: the use of Knowledge Distillation (KD) with KL divergence as the primary objective function rather than standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT); the initialization of QAT using a PTQ checkpoint (specifically GPTQ or RTN) to reduce training costs and improve convergence; and the alignment of calibration data domains between the PTQ and QAT stages.

The study demonstrates that standard 3-bit PTQ results in catastrophic accuracy loss, dropping performance by **11.67%** on AIME-120 and **12.80%** on MATH-500. In contrast, the Reasoning-QAT pipeline significantly mitigates this degradation. For models originally trained with SFT, using KD as the QAT objective limited the average performance drop to **8.06%**, outperforming QAT with SFT objectives. The benefits were even more pronounced for RL-trained models; QAT + KD achieved a **9.26%** average drop, whereas QAT + SFT suffered a massive **21.40%** drop. Overall, Reasoning-QAT achieved a **44.53%** improvement over the GPTQ baseline on the MATH-500 dataset.

This research provides a definitive recipe for enabling efficient inference of reasoning LLMs without sacrificing their problem-solving capabilities. By validating Knowledge Distillation as a robust objective for both SFT and RL-trained models, the study resolves the instability often associated with quantizing complex reasoning policies.

## Key Findings

*   **Robustness of Knowledge Distillation:** KD serves as a robust objective function for reasoning models, applicable to those trained via both SFT and RL, consistently yielding smaller accuracy drops than standard SFT objectives.
*   **PTQ Initialization Benefits:** Utilizing PTQ to initialize QAT significantly reduces training costs and improves final accuracy compared to training from scratch.
*   **RL Viability:** Reinforcement learning remains a viable strategy for quantized models and can be effectively cold-started within the QAT framework.
*   **Data Domain Alignment:** Aligning the data domain for PTQ calibration with QAT training accelerates convergence and enhances overall accuracy.

## Methodology

The authors conducted a systematic empirical study on quantization-aware training (QAT) specifically tailored for reasoning LLMs. Their research design involved:

1.  **Variable Isolation:** Rigorous testing of individual variables including training objectives (SFT vs. KD vs. RL), initialization strategies (RTN vs. GPTQ), and data domain alignment.
2.  **Workflow Consolidation:** Integrating successful insights into the optimized **'Reasoning-QAT'** workflow.
3.  **Validation:** Benchmarking the unified pipeline against state-of-the-art baselines across multiple LLM backbones (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen, Qwen3) and diverse reasoning datasets.
