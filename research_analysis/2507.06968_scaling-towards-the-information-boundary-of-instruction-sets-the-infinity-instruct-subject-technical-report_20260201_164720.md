## 📋 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical limitation of current Large Language Model (LLM) instruction-tuning datasets, which frequently fail to generalize effectively across complex tasks and rare domains due to insufficient coverage and depth. The authors argue that the prevailing approach of simply increasing data volume is inadequate, as existing datasets often lack the qualitative structure necessary to push models toward their information boundary. This gap hinders model performance on specialized knowledge and complex reasoning, creating a need for a more systematic approach to data curation that prioritizes information density over raw scale.

The core innovation is a novel, closed-loop instruction data construction framework designed to maximize coverage and depth through an iterative, diagnostic process. Technically, the system integrates four key components: a Hierarchical Multilingual Tagging System (utilizing Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct) for bottom-up categorization; an Informative Seed Selection Algorithm (using Llama-2-7B-base) that filters data based on specific criteria such as "Hard-to-Follow," "Long-Tail," "Multi-Skill," and "Undertrained"; an adapted Evolutionary Data Synthesis Process that evolves samples along diversity and depth dimensions; and a Deficiency Diagnosis mechanism that employs an Oracle Model to identify missing skills for targeted defect-driven generation.

The framework yielded the **Infinity Instruct Subject dataset**, a high-quality corpus of 1.5 million instructions distilled from an initial pool of approximately 7 million samples. The seed selection process identified roughly 1.2 million seeds using quantitative thresholds. This work signifies a paradigm shift in LLM data strategy, transitioning from quantity-based expansion to qualitative improvement and efficient evolution. By demonstrating that data structure and targeted synthesis are superior to blind scaling, the authors provide a reproducible blueprint for constructing high-value instruction sets that approach the model's information boundary.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The researchers developed a systematic instruction data construction framework using an **iterative closed-loop process**. This framework integrates four distinct stages designed to maximize coverage and depth:

1.  **Hierarchical Tagging System:** Organizes data structure.
2.  **Informative Seed Selection Algorithm:** Identifies high-value starting data points.
3.  **Evolutionary Data Synthesis Process:** Expands and evolves the data.
4.  **Model Deficiency Diagnosis:** Identifies and fixes weak points in the model.
