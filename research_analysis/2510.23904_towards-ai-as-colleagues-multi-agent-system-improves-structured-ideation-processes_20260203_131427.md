## Executive Summary

Current AI-powered ideation tools typically function as solitary assistants or passive task managers, failing to replicate the nuanced social dynamics and collaborative interplay found in high-performing human teams. This limitation restricts the potential of AI in creative contexts, where social presence, intent sharing, and diverse perspectives are critical drivers of innovation. This paper addresses the challenge of transitioning AI from a tool-based utility to an active "colleague" that can participate in the structured ideation process, specifically investigating how multi-agent interactions can bridge the gap between automated generation and genuine collaboration.

The core innovation is **"MultiColleagues,"** a multi-agent conversational system designed to emulate team dynamics through role-based orchestration and persona-driven agents. Technically, the system utilizes multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) assigned distinct roles—such as planner, critic, and explainer—operating on a hybrid interaction model that blends divergent and convergent thinking. Built upon frameworks like AutoGen and CrewAI, the architecture employs shared memory and autonomous turn-taking logic, allowing agents to converse not only with the user but also with one another. This inter-agent dialogue creates a collaborative environment where the AI agents actively discuss and refine ideas before presenting them to the user.

In a within-subjects experiment with 20 participants, MultiColleagues was compared against a single-agent baseline to evaluate performance in collaborative ideation. The results demonstrated that the multi-agent system fostered significantly stronger perceived social presence among users. Furthermore, participants rated the outcomes generated by MultiColleagues as superior in both quality and novelty compared to the baseline. The study also found that the multi-agent environment promoted more detailed elaboration during the ideation process, with agents successfully transitioning from task managers to active colleagues by sharing intent and strengthening group dynamics.

This research provides critical empirical evidence validating the efficacy of multi-agent systems in enhancing human-AI collaboration, specifically within creative domains. By demonstrating that inter-agent conversation can improve specific metrics of creativity and social experience, the paper challenges the prevailing single-agent paradigm. The findings suggest that future AI systems should be designed not just as powerful generators, but as social collaborators capable of simulating team dynamics, thereby offering a new pathway for designing AI that feels less like a tool and more like an integrated partner in the problem-solving process.

## Key Findings

*   **Enhanced Social Presence:** The multi-agent system (MultiColleagues) fostered significantly stronger perceived social presence compared to a single-agent baseline.
*   **Superior Ideation Quality:** Participants rated the outcomes generated by the multi-agent system as higher in both quality and novelty.
*   **Increased Elaboration:** The multi-agent environment promoted more detailed elaboration during the ideation process.
*   **Collaborative Shift:** AI agents can effectively transition from task managers to active colleagues by sharing intent and strengthening group dynamics through inter-agent and user-agent conversation.
