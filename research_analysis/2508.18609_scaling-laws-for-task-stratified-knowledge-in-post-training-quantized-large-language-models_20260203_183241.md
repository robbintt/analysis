### 📝 Executive Summary

Current scaling laws for Large Language Models (LLMs) predominantly focus on full-precision models, failing to account for the performance dynamics introduced by Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), a critical technique for reducing the computational costs of deployment. As LLMs are increasingly compressed to lower bit-widths, existing theoretical models struggle to predict performance accurately because they treat all knowledge capabilities as uniform. This is a significant gap because quantization impacts different cognitive functions unevenly; without a precise understanding of these task-specific sensitivities, practitioners cannot reliably predict how a compressed model will perform or how to best allocate resources during the quantization process.

This paper introduces a novel framework for establishing task-stratified scaling laws specifically for PTQ LLMs. The key innovation lies in disentangling LLM knowledge into distinct categories based on Bloom's Taxonomy: Knowledge Memorization (KM), Knowledge Application (KA), and Knowledge Reasoning (KR). The authors develop a unified quantitative model that integrates standard scaling parameters (Model Size, $N$) with quantization-specific hyperparameters: Effective Bit-width ($B$), Calibration Set Size ($C_b$), and Group Size ($G$). By utilizing the GPTQ algorithm and second-order optimization information, the study isolates how these specific parameters influence the reconstruction error and subsequent performance across the different knowledge strata.

The empirical analysis, conducted on Qwen models ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters, reveals distinct scaling behaviors for different cognitive tasks. While accuracy generally follows power-law trends with model size, the study identified a "sharp recovery" phenomenon where performance at 2-bit precision hovers near a random baseline of 0.25, but jumps significantly at 3-bit and saturates near FP16 levels at $\ge$4-bit precision. The results demonstrate that Knowledge Memorization is highly sensitive to quantization parameters, whereas Application and Reasoning capabilities remain robust. Furthermore, the study found an inverse relationship between accuracy and Group Size, with smaller groups (32, 64) significantly outperforming larger groups (1024) in mitigating performance loss. Increasing Calibration Set Size was shown to yield diminishing returns with non-linear saturation.

This work significantly bridges the gap between theoretical scaling laws and the practical realities of model deployment. By identifying that memorization capabilities are the bottleneck in quantized models, the authors provide actionable guidance for developing "knowledge-aware" quantization strategies. This enables researchers and engineers to prioritize the preservation of sensitive cognitive functions during compression, offering a roadmap for optimizing the trade-off between model efficiency and performance retention. The findings suggest that future quantization methods must move beyond global optimization to task-specific tuning to maintain high utility in resource-constrained environments.
