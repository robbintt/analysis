## 📋 Executive Summary

Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained hardware presents a persistent dilemma where traditional compression techniques typically force a trade-off between model size and inference accuracy. Standard quantization methods often introduce parameter noise and variance, degrading performance just as significantly as they reduce memory footprint. This paper addresses that critical challenge by proposing a framework capable of optimizing model complexity for limited environments without sacrificing the precision required for high-stakes applications.

The core innovation is a **"Safety-Guided Self Compression"** framework, an architecture-agnostic approach that integrates systematic pruning with a safety-driven quantization technique. Utilizing "preservation sets," the method guides the optimization process to identify and retain essential weights while actively eliminating parameter noise. By rigorously defining which network components must be preserved, the framework manages to reduce variance during the compression phase, thereby maintaining the integrity of the model's decision boundaries more effectively than conventional quantization alone.

Experimental results validate the framework’s efficacy across specific architectural paradigms, demonstrating robust performance on both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and attention-based language models. The approach successfully compressed models to **60% of their initial size** while simultaneously achieving a **2.5% enhancement in test accuracy** compared to original, unquantized baselines. Furthermore, the method exhibited superior generalization relative to standard quantization techniques, proving that significant size reduction need not come at the cost of predictive capability.

This work significantly influences the field by breaking the conventional trade-off between compression and performance, enabling the deployment of high-accuracy AI models on hardware with strict resource limitations. By demonstrating that models can be made smaller and more accurate simultaneously through safety-guided pruning and quantization, the authors provide a viable path forward for edge computing applications. To ensure reproducibility and facilitate further adoption, the study includes a comprehensive release of the framework's implementation via GitHub.
