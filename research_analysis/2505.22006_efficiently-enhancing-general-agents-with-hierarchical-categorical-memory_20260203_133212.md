## Executive Summary

Current general AI agents face a critical trade-off between adaptability and computational efficiency. Existing approaches typically rely on either expensive end-to-end training, which requires significant resources for parameter updates, or static tool-use mechanisms, which lack the flexibility to handle complex, evolving environments. This paper addresses the challenge of enabling general agents to learn continuously and handle multi-modal tasks effectively without the prohibitive cost of full model retraining, a necessity for practical, scalable deployment.

The authors introduce the **EHC** framework, a parameter-free learning paradigm centered on a Hierarchical-categorical Memory structure. The system utilizes a dual-module architecture: the **Hierarchical Memory Retrieval (HMR)** module enables rapid, unconstrained storage and retrieval of information for scalability, while the **Task-Category Oriented Experience Learning (TOEL)** module classifies experiences to extract cross-category patterns. By employing this non-end-to-end approach, EHC facilitates dynamic tool usage based on contextual understanding, allowing the agent to adapt without altering its core parameters.

The EHC agent achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, establishing new benchmarks across multiple standard datasets. It demonstrated superior effectiveness in complex multi-modal tasks, specifically outperforming strong baselines such as **ReAct**, **Reflexion**, and **FireAct**. The results show significant improvements in **Success Rate** alongside reduced **Inference Latency** and lower API costs, validating the framework's ability to balance computational cost with adaptability.

## Methodology

The research introduces the **EHC** agent, a general agent designed to learn without parameter updates. The system relies on a novel dual-module architecture to process information and adapt to new tasks:

*   **Hierarchical Memory Retrieval (HMR) Module:**
    *   Focuses on rapid, unconstrained memory storage and retrieval.
    *   Enables scalable information management by organizing data hierarchically.
*   **Task-Category Oriented Experience Learning (TOEL) Module:**
    *   Classifies experiences based on task categories.
    *   Extracts patterns from these classifications to enhance task comprehension.
    *   Facilitates cross-category pattern extraction for better generalization.

The system operates on a **non-end-to-end basis**, avoiding expensive full retraining. It employs dynamic tool usage based on context rather than relying on static mechanisms, allowing it to balance computational cost with adaptability.
