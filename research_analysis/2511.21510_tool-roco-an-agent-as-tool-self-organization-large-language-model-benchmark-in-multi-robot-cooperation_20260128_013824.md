## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of achieving **scalable, decentralized cooperation** in dynamic multi-robot systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional multi-agent systems (MAS) typically rely on centralized controllers or rigid, hard-coded communication protocols that fail to adapt effectively in unstructured, real-world environments. The paper emphasizes the urgent need for robust evaluation frameworks where LLMs can self-organize, shifting the paradigm to treat peer agents not merely as independent entities, but as dynamic, functional tools that can be orchestrated to solve complex cooperative tasks without prohibitive computational overhead.

### Core Innovation: Tool-RoCo
The proposed framework operationalizes the **'Agent-as-Tool'** paradigm. Technically, it implements a self-organizing architecture featuring an LLM-based planner that parses environmental states and the state vectors of peer agents to generate precise tool-use commands.

*   **Functional API Integration:** Enables agents to model peers as functional APIs.
*   **Orchestration over Negotiation:** Focuses on functional orchestration rather than conversational negotiation.
*   **Dynamic Binding:** Facilitates the dynamic binding of actions to the specific utilities offered by peers.

### Evaluation & Impact
The study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the Tool-RoCo benchmark, measuring **Task Success Rate**, **Communication Efficiency**, and **Coordination Robustness** across varying agent densities.

*   **Performance:** Significantly reduces communication overhead compared to communication-heavy baselines (e.g., AutoGen) while maintaining high success rates.
*   **Trade-offs:** Effectively quantifies the trade-offs between reasoning depth and execution speed.
*   **Industry Standard:** Represents a significant advancement toward standardizing the evaluation of LLM-driven robotics, shifting focus from single-agent capabilities to complex, cooperative tool use.
