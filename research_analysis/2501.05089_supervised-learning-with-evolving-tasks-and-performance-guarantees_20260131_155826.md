## 🗞️ Executive Summary

Current supervised learning paradigms for sequential tasks—such as multi-task learning, continual learning, and concept drift—are characterized by significant fragmentation, often relying on techniques tailored to specific scenarios rather than a unified framework. A fundamental limitation of existing approaches is the reliance on the unrealistic assumption that tasks are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) or that task order is irrelevant. This oversight is critical because real-world data streams are non-stationary; tasks evolve over time, typically exhibiting higher degrees of similarity between consecutive tasks than between distant ones. Without modeling this "evolving" nature, standard methods fail to leverage the inherent structure of sequential data, leading to suboptimal performance and a lack of robust theoretical guarantees.

The authors introduce a unified learning methodology grounded in Minimax Risk Classifiers (MRC) and Distributionally Robust Learning (DRL). The key technical innovation is the **"Evolving Assumption" (Evo-A)**, which formalizes the intuition that consecutive tasks are more similar by modeling changes between tasks as independent events where variance grows over time. This approach minimizes the worst-case error probability over an uncertainty set defined by expectation estimates of a feature mapping. Utilizing a Kronecker product structure ($\Phi(x, y) = e_y \otimes \Psi(x)$), the mapping supports diverse feature types—from scalar to RKHS features—resulting in a classifier based on linear-affine combinations. This mechanism allows the framework to adapt to non-stationary data distributions while remaining computationally tractable, bridging the gap between theoretical robustness and practical application.

Experimental validation on benchmark datasets **'Airlines'** and **'UTKFaces'** provided specific empirical evidence for the framework's superiority. Partial autocorrelation metrics demonstrated significant correlation strictly at lag 1, confirming the model's adequacy over i.i.d. baselines, while analysis of the 'Airlines' dataset quantified multidimensional drift in task evolution. The methodology proved exceptionally efficient, analytically characterizing an increase in effective sample size that enabled accurate classification with fewer than 100 samples per task. This capability allows for high-accuracy performance with significantly reduced data requirements compared to standard methods, while empirical trials confirmed that the method's theoretical performance guarantees remain tight and reliable across tested benchmarks.

This research significantly advances the field by unifying disjointed supervised learning scenarios—Multi-source Domain Adaptation, Multi-Task Learning, Concept Drift, and Continual Learning—under a single theoretically rigorous umbrella. By providing computable, tight performance guarantees and an analytical framework for effective sample size, the study addresses a critical gap in the theoretical analysis of non-stationary environments. The introduction of the Evolving Assumption offers a realistic mathematical model for task sequences, enabling the development of future algorithms that can efficiently handle sequential learning problems with provable reliability and reduced data dependency.
