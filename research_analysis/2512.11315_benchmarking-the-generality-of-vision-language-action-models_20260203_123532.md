> ### 📝 Executive Summary
>
> This research addresses the critical discrepancy between the theoretical aspirations of generalist intelligence in foundation models and their actual performance in uncontrolled environments. While state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) exhibit strong in-distribution capabilities, they fail to generalize effectively to unseen domains.
>
> The study identifies that current architectures suffer from specific failure modes when facing cross-domain task shifts or unfamiliar modalities, specifically pinpointing **Modality Misalignment**, **Output Format Instability**, and **Catastrophic Knowledge Degradation** as persistent barriers to true generalist intelligence.
>
> To quantify these limitations, the authors introduce **MultiNet v1.0**, a unified benchmark designed to evaluate cross-domain generality across six foundational capability regimes. The evaluation reveals that all tested models, including GPT-5, Pi0, and Magma, experience substantial degradation when operating outside their training distributions. The public release of code, data, and leaderboards offers the community the necessary resources to guide the development of truly adaptable generalist agents.

## 🔍 Key Findings

*   **Failure to Generalize:** State-of-the-art models (GPT-5, Pi0, and Magma) fail to demonstrate consistent generality on unseen domains despite strong in-distribution performance.
*   **Three Distinct Failure Modes:** The inability to generalize manifests specifically through:
    1.  **Modality Misalignment**
    2.  **Output Format Instability**
    3.  **Catastrophic Knowledge Degradation** under domain transfer.
*   **Cross-Domain Degradation:** All evaluated models exhibited substantial degradation when facing unfamiliar modalities or cross-domain task shifts.
*   **The Aspiration Gap:** There is a persistent discrepancy between the aspiration of generalist intelligence and the actual capabilities of current foundation models.

## 🧪 Methodology

The researchers utilized **MultiNet v1.0**, a unified benchmark explicitly designed to measure the cross-domain generality of VLMs and VLAs.

*   **Objective:** To test robustness across diverse real-world domains outside of training distributions.
*   **Six Capability Regimes:** The methodology evaluates models across the following foundational capabilities:
    *   Visual Grounding
    *   Spatial Reasoning
    *   Tool Use
    *   Physical Commonsense
    *   Multi-Agent Coordination
    *   Continuous Robot Control
*   **Target Models:** The framework was applied to assess **GPT-5**, **Pi0**, and **Magma**.

## 📊 Results

*   **Performance Drop:** State-of-the-art models fail to generalize to unseen domains despite strong in-distribution performance.
*   **VLA Behavior:** Comparative findings indicate action-trained VLAs transfer better to discrete environments but fail on out-of-distribution shifts.
*   **Decoding Strategies:** Decoding strategies (diffusion vs. autoregressive) influence prediction collapse patterns, highlighting architectural sensitivity.
*   **Scale vs. Generalization:** Increased training volume (e.g., Pi0's 903M timesteps or OpenVLA's 7B parameters) did not resolve generalization bottlenecks.

## 🚀 Contributions

*   **Benchmark Introduction:** Introduced MultiNet v1.0, a unified benchmark addressing the fragmentation of current evaluation practices by providing a common substrate for assessing cross-domain generality.
*   **Capability Regimes:** Established six distinct capability regimes (ranging from perception to continuous control) necessary for evaluating true generalist multimodal agents.
*   **Bottleneck Identification:** Identified specific technical bottlenecks (catastrophic knowledge degradation, modality misalignment) to provide a clear path for future research.
*   **Open Resources:** Public release of code, data, and leaderboards to facilitate standardized comparison and guide the development of future generalist agents.
