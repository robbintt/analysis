## 📑 Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental challenge of integrating discrete quantization into machine learning models, a task critical for computational efficiency but hindered by non-convex, combinatorial constraints that standard gradient-based methods struggle to optimize. The difficulty lies in maintaining the trainability of models via continuous optimization while enforcing the hard discreteness required for compression. Solving this disconnect is essential for deploying highly compressed models without sacrificing the performance gains of modern deep learning.

The key innovation is **Piecewise-Affine Regularization (PAR)**, a continuous optimization framework designed to inherently promote discrete solutions. The authors formulate the problem as minimizing $F_\lambda(x) := f(x) + \lambda \Psi(x)$, where $\Psi$ is a symmetric, coordinate-wise piecewise-affine regularizer. A critical technical contribution is the derivation of closed-form proximal mappings for PAR across convex, quasi-convex, and non-convex settings. These mappings act as "soft quantizers," performing either exact quantization or shrinkage depending on the input magnitude, which enables standard algorithms like the Proximal Gradient Method (PGM) and ADMM to solve the optimization problem effectively.

The results provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, specifically within the context of linear regression. The authors prove that in overparameterized regimes ($d \ge n$), any Clarke critical point of the PAR-regularized loss achieves a **Quantization Rate ($qr$)** satisfying $qr(x^*) \ge 1 - n/d$. This specific metric indicates that as the model dimension grows relative to the sample size, the quantization rate approaches 100%. Consequently, the framework achieves high-dimensional compression while maintaining statistical performance comparable to classical non-quantized regularizers.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Inherent Quantization:** In the overparameterized regime, every critical point of the PAR-regularized loss function naturally exhibits a high degree of quantization.
*   **Closed-Form Solutions:** Closed-form proximal mappings can be derived for Piecewise-Affine Regularization (PAR) across convex, quasi-convex, and non-convex settings, enabling efficient optimization.
*   **Classical Approximation:** In linear regression problems, PAR can approximate classical regularization formulations (such as $l_1$, squared $l_2$, and nonconvex regularizations) while maintaining similar statistical guarantees.
*   **Bridging the Gap:** The framework successfully bridges the gap between continuous optimization and discrete quantization, producing quantized solutions without sacrificing theoretical performance.

## 📊 Results

**Primary Metric:**
The study utilizes the **Quantization Rate ($qr$)**, representing the fraction of parameters exactly on the target discrete set.

**Theoretical Guarantee (Theorem 1):**
For Generalized Linear Models in the overparameterized regime ($d \ge n$), any critical point satisfies:

*   The bound is nearly tight for moderate regularization strengths.
*   The method connects to classical regularizations like $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ while maintaining statistical guarantees.
