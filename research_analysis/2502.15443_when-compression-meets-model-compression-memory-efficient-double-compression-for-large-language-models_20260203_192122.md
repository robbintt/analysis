## Executive Summary

Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices remains a significant challenge due to their massive memory requirements. While existing techniques like quantization (e.g., INT8) reduce model size, the resulting memory footprint often exceeds the capacity of limited hardware. The core issue addressed in this paper is the necessity for further size reduction beyond standard quantization without incurring the heavy computational penalties or accuracy degradation typically associated with aggressive compression. The authors highlight that simply applying lossless data compression to quantized models is insufficient due to the random distribution of weights, necessitating a more sophisticated approach to enable LLM inference on memory-limited devices.

The authors propose a **"Double Compression" (DC)** framework that applies lossless compression to already quantized models through a multi-stage pipeline. The key technical innovation is **"compression-aware quantization,"** a pre-processing step that re-scales parameters using a per-channel scaling factor before quantization. This transformation optimizes the weight distribution to maximize compressibility. The pipeline further increases compression ratios by pruning weights based on the L∞-norm of activations to increase the occurrence of zero-valued weights—raising near-zero values to 58% compared to a 6% baseline—followed by Zstd lossless compression. To address the critical trade-off between memory savings and latency, the authors introduce a speed-adaptive method that dynamically manages the decompression workload within a CPU-GPU architecture, ensuring that high compression does not bottleneck inference speed.

Empirical validation demonstrates that the framework achieves an approximate **2.2x compression ratio** on top of standard quantization, resulting in a **40% reduction in memory footprint** during inference. In tests on the OPT-1.3B model, the proposed method achieved a scaled weight compression ratio of 2.46 compared to a baseline of 1.54. Crucially, this efficiency is gained with negligible loss in accuracy; whereas naive scaling methods caused accuracy to collapse (dropping from 0.57 to 0.32), the DC framework maintained performance stability, retaining accuracy near the original 0.57 baseline. Additionally, the speed-adaptive mechanism effectively resolved the decompression bottleneck, enabling substantial memory savings without the significant inference speed degradation usually associated with deep compression.

2.  **Pruning:** A pruning method is applied following quantization to further increase compression.
3.  **Bottleneck Analysis:** To address latency issues arising from decompression, the authors conducted a detailed analysis of the trade-off between memory usage and speed.
4.  **Optimization:** Implementation of a speed-adaptive method to optimize real-time performance based on the bottleneck analysis.
