## Executive Summary

Continual Learning (CL) is fundamentally hindered by **catastrophic forgetting**, a phenomenon where neural networks degrade performance on previous tasks upon learning new ones. Current state-of-the-art solutions typically rely on rehearsal strategies, necessitating the storage and reprocessing of raw data from past tasks. This dependency creates prohibitive barriers in privacy-sensitive sectors like healthcare (due to regulations like HIPAA/GDPR) and imposes heavy computational burdens on resource-constrained hardware. Furthermore, existing CL methodologies frequently lack robust **uncertainty quantification**, rendering them unreliable for high-stakes decision-making environments where assessing prediction confidence is as critical as the prediction itself.

This paper introduces **CL-BRUNO**, a novel framework for Continual Learning via Probabilistic Exchangeable Sequence Modelling. Grounded in Neural Processes (NPs) and exchangeable sequence modeling, the approach treats tasks as draws from a latent stochastic process. This architecture allows the model to share statistical strength across tasks and capture uncertainty inherently. The technical core employs a **dual regularization strategy**: distributional regularization aligns the model's predictive distribution with the underlying data-generating process, while functional regularization preserves the mapping learned from previous tasks via tractable Bayesian updates. This mechanism enables the posterior over latent functions to be updated sequentially without a data buffer, providing a unified architecture capable of handling both Task-Incremental Learning (Task-IL) and Class-Incremental Learning (Class-IL).

The proposed framework was benchmarked against leading rehearsal-free baselines, including Gradient Projection Memory (GPM) and Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), on standard natural image datasets (Split MNIST, Split CIFAR-100) and biomedical datasets (PathMNIST). In rigorous Class-IL scenarios on Split CIFAR-100, the model achieved an average accuracy of **65.7%**, significantly outperforming the GPM baseline at **52.8%** and EWC at **18.1%**. This represents a substantial reduction in forgetting margins while maintaining competitive performance on current tasks.

The significance of this work lies in delivering a practically viable solution for deployment in constrained and sensitive real-world environments. By eliminating the rehearsal buffer, the framework provides a compliant solution for medical applications where long-term storage of raw training samples is restricted. Moreover, the integration of tractable Bayesian uncertainty quantification allows these models to be reliably deployed in clinical decision support systems.
