## Executive Summary

This research addresses the fundamental bottleneck in autonomous Radio Access Networks (RAN): the semantic gap between high-level, abstract business intents and low-level control actions. Current heuristic approaches lack the cognitive flexibility to interpret diverse service requirements or resolve conflicts between competing objectives (e.g., maximizing throughput versus minimizing energy). This limitation forces network operators to rely on manual intervention, preventing the realization of fully autonomous systems that can dynamically adapt to complex, heterogeneous service demands. The inability to automatically translate intent into action is a critical barrier to operational efficiency and service agility in modern networks.

The authors propose a **"Triadic Agentic AI System,"** a novel hybrid architecture that synergizes Large Language Models (LLMs), mathematical optimization, and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL). The framework operates on distinct timescales via three collaborative agents:

1.  **Supervisory Interpreter Agent (Cognitive Layer):** Powered by LLMs for lexical parsing and strategy refinement.
2.  **Optimizer Agent (Analytical Layer):** Utilizes Preference-Aligned eXploration Bayesian Optimization (PAX-BO) to convert parsed intent templates into rigorous optimization problems and derive specific preference weights.
3.  **Preference-driven Controller Agent (Execution Layer):** Uses MORL to execute actions near the Pareto frontier.

This design ensures the system maintains semantic understanding of natural language while applying rigorous mathematical reasoning to trade-offs.

Validation through an Agentic Radio Resource Management case study (specifically Link Adaptation) demonstrated the system's efficacy across Component, Loop, and System levels. The experiments yielded concrete empirical data: the system achieved **near-perfect parsing accuracy** in interpreting natural language intents. On the control side, the Preference-driven Controller successfully operated on the Pareto frontier, maintaining link stability—keeping Block Error Rates (BLER) strictly within target thresholds—while optimizing spectral efficiency. Furthermore, the loop-level validation confirmed the system’s ability to handle conflicting intents (e.g., switching between "maximize throughput" and "minimize power") by dynamically adjusting control actions to satisfy shifting preference weights without manual tuning.

This work provides a concrete architectural blueprint for closing the intent-to-action gap in autonomous networks, moving beyond theoretical concepts to a demonstrable, validated workflow. By successfully integrating LLMs with rigorous optimization and control theory, the paper establishes a foundational model for "cognitive" networks capable of autonomous conflict resolution. This capability is critical for the evolution of network operations, as it enables systems to self-manage heterogeneous service requirements with high autonomy, significantly reducing operational overhead and improving the agility of service delivery in complex environments.

## Key Findings

*   **Limitations of Current Systems:** Existing heuristic approaches are incapable of effectively transforming high-level intents into low-level network control actions.
*   **Cognitive Adaptation:** The proposed Agentic AI system enables autonomous networks to interpret, reason about, and adapt to diverse and conflicting service intents.
*   **Optimization Performance:** By leveraging a preference-driven controller based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, the system operates near the **Pareto frontier**.
*   **Hybrid Processing:** The integration of language models with mathematical optimization allows for lexical parsing of intents and cognitive refinement of strategies.
