## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical challenge of compressing large-scale Transformer models to enable deployment on resource-constrained hardware without sacrificing accuracy. As models grow in size and complexity, traditional compression methods often struggle to balance the trade-off between reducing memory footprint and maintaining performance. Specifically, applying quantization and low-rank approximation in isolation often leads to sub-optimal results or compounding errors.

This work is vital because it provides a pathway to run state-of-the-art Vision and NLP Transformers in production environments where strict memory limits are required. The authors introduce **MLoRQ**, a novel framework that unifies low-rank approximation and mixed-precision quantization into a single cohesive optimization process. The methodology relies on a two-stage search architecture:

1.  **Intra-layer optimization:** Identifies Pareto-optimal compression candidates for individual layers.
2.  **Inter-layer optimization:** Allocates global resources by assigning specific bit-widths and ranks to meet strict memory constraints.

A key technical contribution is the development of **"Low Rank Aware Adaptive Rounding,"** a technique that refines weight rounding decisions to specifically mitigate the errors induced when quantization is applied to low-rank approximated weights. MLoRQ achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating significant resilience at high compression rates. The significance of MLoRQ lies in its ability to bridge the gap between two distinct compression techniques, proving that their joint optimization yields superior results compared to applying them sequentially or independently.

## Key Findings

*   **State-of-the-Art Performance:** MLoRQ achieves up to a **15% performance improvement** over existing methods, setting a new benchmark for compressed transformers.
*   **Broad Validation:** Successfully validated across multiple Vision Transformer (ViT) tasks, including image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation.
*   **Constraint Adherence:** The approach effectively determines optimal bit-width and rank assignments for each layer while strictly adhering to predefined memory constraints.
*   **Seamless Integration:** MLoRQ is compatible and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing quantization algorithms.

## Methodology

MLoRQ combines low-rank approximation and mixed-precision quantization into a single unified framework. The core process involves a sophisticated optimization strategy:

1.  **Intra-layer Optimization:** This stage identifies potentially optimal compression solutions for individual layers by analyzing local trade-offs.
2.  **Inter-layer Optimization:** Following the local analysis, this stage assigns specific bit-width precisions and ranks to each layer to ensure global memory constraints are met.
3.  **Sequential Optimization (Optional):** A final step utilizes a sequential optimization process with a modified adaptive rounding technique to mitigate errors induced by the joint application of low-rank approximation and quantization.

## Technical Details

MLoRQ proposes a hybrid compression framework combining Low-Rank Approximation and Quantization using a three-stage optimization process.

### Optimization Stages

*   **Stage 1: Intra-layer Search**
    *   Conducts a local search to identify the Pareto frontier of optimal candidates for each individual layer.
*   **Stage 2: Inter-layer Search**
    *   Performs global resource allocation to determine the optimal rank and bit-width assignments across the entire network.
*   **Stage 3: Quantization Integration**
    *   Compatible with Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) schemes, ensuring the method can be applied without retraining.

### Core Innovations

*   **Objective Function:** Minimizes the reconstruction error between the original weight matrix and approximated low-rank factors, subject to regularization.
*   **Low Rank Aware Adaptive Rounding:** Refines weight rounding decisions to minimize total error by accounting for both quantization noise and low-rank approximation errors simultaneously.
