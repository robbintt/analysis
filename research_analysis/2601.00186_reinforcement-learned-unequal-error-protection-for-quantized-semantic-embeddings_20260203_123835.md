## Executive Summary

**Problem**
This research addresses the inherent inefficiency of applying traditional channel coding techniques to semantic communication systems, particularly within resource-constrained environments like Edge Computing and IoT. Conventional methods, such as LDPC and Reed-Solomon codes, treat data as uniform bitstreams, failing to account for the varying importance of specific semantic features within an embedding. This misalignment results in suboptimal reconstruction of meaning at the receiver, especially under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, where preserving critical semantic information is more vital than maintaining bit-level accuracy.

**Innovation**
The authors propose a Reinforcement-Learned Unequal Error Protection (RL-UEP) framework designed to optimize the transmission of quantized semantic embeddings by aligning error protection with semantic granularity. Technically, the system employs a Reinforcement Learning agent to dynamically assign Per-Dimension Unequal Error Protection using adaptive repetition coding. This optimization is guided by a Composite Semantic Distortion Metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, ensuring that channel resources are allocated context-aware to protect the most semantically significant dimensions of the data.

**Results**
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the RL-UEP framework significantly outperforms standard channel coding benchmarks in maintaining semantic fidelity. Operating at a challenging 1 dB SNR, the proposed method achieved a **6.8% increase in chrF scores** and a **9.3% improvement in entity preservation** compared to conventional techniques. These results validate that adaptive repetition coding, when driven by reinforcement learning, surpasses established codes like LDPC and Reed-Solomon in preserving the integrity of transmitted meaning.

**Impact**
This work significantly influences the field of semantic communication by establishing that effective channel codes must mirror the semantic structure of the data rather than relying on traditional bit-error correction models. It offers a practical solution for enabling semantic-aware networking in bandwidth and power-limited environments, bridging the gap between theoretical semantic fidelity and real-world deployment constraints. By introducing a context-aware resource allocation method, the study paves the way for more intelligent communication protocols that prioritize the preservation of meaning and entity information over raw data accuracy.
