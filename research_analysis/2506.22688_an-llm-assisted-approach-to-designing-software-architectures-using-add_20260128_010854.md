## 📑 Executive Summary

> **Problem**  
> Software architecture design is a complex, labor-intensive phase that traditionally relies on rigorous methods like Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) to ensure systems meet intricate quality requirements. Applying these formal methods demands substantial expertise and documentation effort, and the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in high-level architectural reasoning—beyond simple code generation—remains largely unproven. This paper addresses the challenge of integrating generative AI into the architectural design process to reduce workload while ensuring the resulting structures are robust, compliant with quality attributes, and aligned with business goals.

> **Innovation**  
> The key innovation is a structured prompting framework that utilizes GPT-4 as an architectural assistant within the ADD methodology. Technically, the approach employs a sequential, step-by-step prompting strategy where the LLM executes specific ADD outputs—such as selecting architectural drivers and defining module views—iteratively. The method establishes an "Architect-in-the-Loop" workflow: while the LLM proves effective at handling **tactical pattern selection**, the study identified that it requires human oversight to navigate **strategic pattern selection**, validate constraints, and resolve conflicting options to ensure alignment with business objectives.

> **Results**  
> The approach was validated through a comprehensive case study involving a system design, benchmarked against published reference studies. The LLM achieved **100% accuracy** in associating Quality Attributes with functional user stories and successfully replicated key architectural decisions found in the baseline. A Lightweight ATAM evaluation conducted by **two professional software architects** assessed the generated architecture across **10 dimensions**, confirming that it satisfied the required drivers and demonstrated high qualitative fidelity. The generated solution covered a broader scope than the manual reference, producing comprehensive documentation including system structure, components, and domain models.

> **Impact**  
> This research provides significant empirical evidence that LLMs can reliably handle high-level architectural reasoning when guided by structured methodologies rather than generic querying. By specifically identifying the distinction between tasks suitable for automation—from brainstorming to tactical view generation—and those requiring human strategic intervention, the paper offers a practical roadmap for hybrid human-AI workflows. The findings bridge the gap between formal software engineering practices and modern AI capabilities, suggesting that AI can act as a force multiplier for architects, enabling faster iteration without sacrificing adherence to quality standards.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **LLMs are effective architectural assistants:** The study demonstrates that Large Language Models (specifically GPT-4) can successfully execute the steps of the Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) method, moving from quality attribute scenarios to concrete architectural patterns and structures.
*   **Architect-in-the-loop is required:** While capable, the LLM cannot operate entirely autonomously; it requires human oversight to validate constraints, select between conflicting options, and ensure the alignment of the generated architecture with business goals.
*   **Quality attribute sensitivity:** The LLM-assisted approach proved capable of generating architectures that are sensitive to specific quality attributes (such as modifiability or performance) when prompted correctly, though it sometimes struggles with the strategic selection of patterns versus well-known tactical patterns.
*   **Efficiency gains:** The approach significantly reduces the time required to document architectural views and brainstorm candidate architectural solutions compared to traditional manual methods.

## 🛠️ Methodology

1.  **Framework:** The research utilizes the Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) method, a standard architecture design method, as the skeleton for the LLM interaction.
2.  **Prompt Engineering Strategy:** The methodology involves a structured step-by-step prompting strategy where the LLM is tasked with specific ADD outputs (e.g., "Select architectural drivers," "Choose architectural patterns," "Define module views") sequentially.
3.  **Case Study:** The approach is validated through a case study involving the design of a specific software system (the Hotel Pricing System), allowing for a concrete evaluation of the generated architecture.
4.  **Evaluation:** The resulting architecture is evaluated using the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) or similar quality assessment frameworks to measure how well the LLM addressed the specified quality attribute scenarios.
