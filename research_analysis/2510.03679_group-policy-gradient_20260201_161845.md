### 📝 Executive Summary

State-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), rely on actor-critic architectures that utilize learned value functions to estimate state advantages. This dependence creates substantial computational bottlenecks, consuming significant memory to store critic parameters and incurring high compute costs for backpropagation during value updates. Furthermore, the use of function approximation introduces bias into the gradient estimates, often exacerbating the complexity of hyperparameter tuning required to balance the bias-variance tradeoff. This paper addresses the critical challenge of reducing these resource requirements and approximation errors while preserving the sample efficiency that established PPO as the industry standard.

The authors introduce Group Policy Gradient (GPG), a family of critic-free policy gradient estimators that generalizes Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) from the domain of RLHF to general Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Instead of training a separate neural network, GPG utilizes a group-based Monte Carlo advantage estimator. Technically, the algorithm assesses the advantage of a specific trajectory by comparing its return against the average return of a group of parallel trajectories generated simultaneously. This approach fundamentally alters the bias-variance tradeoff; it eliminates the approximation bias typical of learned critics while mitigating the high variance associated with Monte Carlo methods through group-based statistics. To ensure stability, GPG retains the clipped surrogate objective characteristic of PPO, maintaining robust policy updates without the architectural overhead of a critic.

Empirical evaluations on standard Gymnasium benchmarks demonstrate that GPG consistently matches or exceeds the cumulative returns of PPO across various environments. The study highlights specific efficiency gains derived from the critic-free architecture: it eliminates the memory footprint required for critic parameters and removes the computational burden of backpropagation for value loss updates. This results in measurable improvements in wall-clock efficiency and more effective utilization of parallel simulations compared to actor-critic baselines. The authors support these findings with a theoretical proof that the GPG estimator is consistent, confirming that it converges to the true policy gradient in the large-group-size limit and effectively manages variance without the introduction of function approximation bias.

This research challenges the prevailing assumption that high-performance reinforcement learning mandates complex actor-critic architectures. By demonstrating that state-of-the-art results can be achieved through a generalized, critic-free approach, GPG establishes a new, computationally efficient paradigm for RL. This shift toward architectural minimalism has significant implications for the field, lowering the barrier to entry for deploying RL in resource-constrained environments and reducing the engineering burden associated with hyperparameter optimization. The validated efficiency of GPG suggests that future algorithm design can prioritize resource efficacy and simplicity without sacrificing agent performance.
