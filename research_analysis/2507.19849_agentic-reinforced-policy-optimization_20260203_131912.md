## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the critical challenge of effectively aligning Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that utilize external tools in dynamic, multi-turn environments. A core issue identified is that LLMs exhibit highly uncertain behavior immediately following interactions with external tools, characterized by significant spikes in token entropy 10–50 tokens after a tool call. Current Large-scale Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) algorithms predominantly rely on trajectory-level optimization, which fails to account for this localized, step-level uncertainty. This limitation results in inefficient training and poor integration of tool-use capabilities, hindering the model's ability to balance intrinsic reasoning with external interaction.

To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce **Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO)**, a reinforcement learning algorithm specifically designed for multi-turn, tool-using agents. ARPO technically operates through two primary components: an **Entropy-based Adaptive Rollout Mechanism** and **Advantage Attribution Estimation**. The rollout mechanism dynamically balances global trajectory sampling with targeted step-level sampling at high-entropy points (post-tool interaction), allowing the model to focus learning on areas of maximum uncertainty. Concurrently, the Advantage Attribution Estimation decomposes the optimization objective to internalize advantage differences at the stepwise level of tool-use interactions, maximizing expected reward under a KL constraint.

ARPO was evaluated across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and deep search domains. The results demonstrate that ARPO consistently outperforms existing trajectory-level RL baselines, including GRPO and DAPO, in terms of accuracy. Crucially, it achieves this superior performance while requiring only 50% of the tool-use budget utilized by existing methods. This work represents a significant advancement in agentic AI, providing a scalable solution for aligning LLMs with real-time dynamic environments without excessive computational overhead.
