## 📋 Executive Summary

Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a powerful tool for quantifying uncertainty in engineering design, particularly for Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) and optimization under uncertainty. However, the computational cost of generating posterior samples—typically requiring the manipulation and decomposition of large covariance matrices—often renders GPs impractical for high-fidelity engineering simulations. The authors identify a critical disconnect where the engineering community lacks efficient frameworks for leveraging these probabilistic models, limiting practitioners' ability to make informed decisions based on robust uncertainty quantification.

This work presents a unified, tutorial-style framework that bridges the gap between machine learning theory and engineering application by introducing two low-rank approximation strategies: **Random Fourier Features (RFF)** and **Pathwise Conditioning (PC)**. The approach views GPs through both function-space (using Squared Exponential and Matérn kernels) and weight-space (treating GP as a Bayesian GLM) perspectives. By utilizing Matheron’s Rule for conditional sampling and optimizing matrix inversion via the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) formula, the authors decouple the sampling process from the heavy computational dependencies of standard Cholesky decompositions. This technical synthesis allows for the pathwise representation of GPs, significantly reducing the computational barrier for sampling.

The paper provides quantitative analysis demonstrating that standard matrix inversion in a weight-space inference framework scales with $\mathcal{O}(N_\phi^3)$, where $N_\phi$ is the number of features. By applying the optimized SMW formula, the complexity is reduced to $\mathcal{O}(\min\{N_\phi^3, N^3\})$. This is a crucial efficiency gain, as it ensures that when feature dimensions are large (necessary for high accuracy), the computational cost scales instead with the typically smaller data dimension $N$. While the provided text focuses on the theoretical and methodological foundations, the authors validate these methods qualitatively, confirming successful application in Global Sensitivity Analysis, single-objective optimization, and multi-objective optimization.

This research serves as a practical implementation guide, equipping the engineering optimization community with established machine learning sampling techniques that were previously underutilized in the field. By detailing the mathematical formulations and offering a tutorial on applying GP posterior samples to sensitivity analysis and optimization, the paper expands the feasibility of using probabilistic surrogate models for large-scale, expensive design problems. The demonstrated reduction in computational complexity enables engineers to apply high-fidelity uncertainty quantification to workflows where traditional GP methods were computationally prohibitive.
