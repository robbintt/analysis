> **Executive Summary**
>
> This research addresses the pervasive conceptual ambiguity between 'AI Safety' and 'AI Security,' a confusion that poses significant risks to the development and deployment of AI systems. The authors argue that without a rigorous demarcation between these domains, efforts to ensure reliability in critical infrastructure are undermined by blurred responsibilities and misapplied mitigation strategies. This lack of clarity is particularly detrimental in high-stakes sectors such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles, where the failure to correctly identify the source of risk—whether unintended error or malicious intent—can lead to catastrophic outcomes and ineffective regulatory frameworks.
>
> The core innovation is a theoretical framework that distinguishes the two domains based on the **intent of harm**: AI Safety focuses on avoiding unintended harm stemming from uncertainty, while AI Security targets intentional harm from malicious adversaries. To concretize this abstract distinction, the authors utilize two heuristic analogies: the **Shannon-Weaver communication model** (contrasting stochastic noise management vs. adversarial manipulation) and a 'building construction' analogy (structural resilience vs. intrusion prevention).
>
> Technically, the work formalizes AI Safety through categories such as non-adversarial robustness and value alignment, explicitly excluding adversarial attacks. Furthermore, the authors elucidate a **bidirectional dependency**, demonstrating how security breaches can induce safety failures. The research successfully creates a taxonomic classification of safety failure modes while formally reclassifying malicious adversarial attacks exclusively under AI Security. Ultimately, the paper provides the prerequisite conceptual clarity needed to guide the safe and secure deployment of AI in critical fields where reliability is paramount.

## Key Findings

*   **Conceptual Delineation:** Establishes rigorous definitions to resolve confusion between 'AI Safety' and 'AI Security'.
*   **Systemic Interdependency:** Identifies a critical bidirectional relationship where security breaches can lead to safety failures and vice versa.
*   **Pedagogical Clarity:** Uses analogies from message transmission and building construction to illustrate the distinction.
*   **Strategic Necessity:** Asserts that clear distinctions are fundamental for academic accuracy, research guidance, collaboration, and policy effectiveness.
*   **Trustworthy AI Deployment:** Determines that clarifying boundaries is a prerequisite for successful AI deployment in critical sectors like healthcare and autonomous vehicles.

## Methodology

The study employs a theoretical approach to deconstruct the semantics of AI risks:

*   **Conceptual Analysis:** Employs a theoretical framework to define and demystify the semantics of AI Safety versus AI Security.
*   **Comparative Definition:** Outlines respective research focuses to contrast objectives and scopes.
*   **Analogical Modeling:** Utilizes heuristic analogies, specifically referencing 'message transmission' and 'building construction' paradigms, to concretize abstract distinctions.
*   **Dependency Mapping:** Explores interconnections between domains to map how failures in one area trigger failures in another.

## Technical Details

The paper proposes a conceptual framework distinguishing AI Safety from AI Security based on the **intent of harm** (unintentional vs. intentional).

*   **Shannon-Weaver Model Application:**
    *   **Safety:** Addresses stochastic channel noise using error-detection codes like CRC.
    *   **Security:** Addresses intelligent adversarial manipulation using cryptographic measures like MAC or encryption.
*   **AI Safety Domains:**
    *   Non-adversarial robustness.
    *   Value alignment.
    *   Monitoring.
    *   Ethical behavior.

## Contributions

*   **Standardization of Terminology:** Provides rigorous definitions for AI Safety and AI Security to reduce conceptual ambiguity.
*   **Boundary Establishment:** Delineates precise limits and research scope to help avoid scope creep and misapplication of methods.
*   **Holistic Risk Framework:** Contributes to a holistic understanding of AI risk by formally analyzing the interdependency between safety and security.
*   **Facilitation of Policy and Collaboration:** Offers a foundational framework to support effective policy development and encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration.

## Results

As this is a conceptual and theoretical paper, no empirical experiments, datasets, or quantitative metrics are presented. The analytical outcomes include:

*   A formal definition of **AI Safety** as the property of avoiding unintended harm despite uncertainties.
*   The identification of specific **safety failure classes**:
    *   System malfunctions.
    *   Goal misalignment.
    *   Emergent behaviors.
*   A taxonomic reclassification of AI risks that **excludes malicious adversarial attacks** from AI Safety.
