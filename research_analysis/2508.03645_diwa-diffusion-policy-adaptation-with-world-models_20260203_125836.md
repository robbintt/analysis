## 📝 Executive Summary

Fine-tuning robotic policies, particularly those based on diffusion models, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a significant challenge due to extreme sample inefficiency. Standard model-free RL methods typically require millions of environment interactions to achieve effective performance, rendering them impractical for real-world robotics where physical trial-and-error is time-consuming, costly, and potentially unsafe.

The authors introduce **DiWA** (Diffusion Policy Adaptation with World Models), a novel framework that decouples policy fine-tuning from the real world by leveraging a learned world model. DiWA operates by training a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) on a dataset of offline play interactions to simulate environment dynamics. This world model creates a latent-space Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which a diffusion policy can be fine-tuned using RL. Technically, the system integrates a conditional denoising diffusion policy with a reward classifier, enabling the agent to maximize cumulative reward entirely offline.

In empirical evaluations across eight distinct tasks on the CALVIN benchmark, DiWA demonstrated superior performance compared to standard imitation learning and model-free baselines such as DPPO. The framework achieved effective adaptation using only a few hundred thousand offline play interactions, representing an improvement in sample efficiency by orders of magnitude. By removing the necessity for physical interaction during the adaptation process, DiWA significantly enhances the safety and feasibility of deploying advanced robotic systems in unstructured environments.

## 🧠 Methodology

The proposed framework, DiWA, utilizes a model-based approach to address the inefficiencies of fine-tuning diffusion policies with Reinforcement Learning. Instead of relying on direct environment interaction, DiWA leverages a world model trained on a dataset of offline play interactions.

This world model simulates environment dynamics, allowing the RL agent to fine-tune diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline. This bypasses the need for continuous real-world data collection during the update phase, solving the issue of high sample complexity in physical spaces.
