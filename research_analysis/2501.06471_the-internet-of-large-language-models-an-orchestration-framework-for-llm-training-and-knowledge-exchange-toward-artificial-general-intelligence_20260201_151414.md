## 📝 Executive Summary

**Problem**
Current Large Language Model (LLM) development is approaching a saturation point where progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is hindered by four critical bottlenecks:
*   The massive scale of parameters and file sizes.
*   The complexity of configuring development environments.
*   The functional singularity of isolated models.
*   The prohibitive cost of computational resources.

These factors create high technical friction and resource barriers, limiting innovation to well-funded entities and preventing the collaborative, internet-level scaling of AI capabilities.

**Innovation**
The authors introduce the "Internet of Large Language Models" (IoLLM), a comprehensive orchestration framework designed to transition from isolated model deployment to a connected ecosystem. Technically, IoLLM consists of four core modules:
1.  An **LLM Sharing Protocol** for interoperability.
2.  An **LLM Universal Environment Framework** for standardization.
3.  An **Agent Optimal Path Module** for optimizing automated interactions.
4.  A **Joint Mining Mechanism** for collaborative resource exchange.

A key technical contribution is the integration of a **bilateral value-sharing economic model** which aligns the incentives of computing power providers with model designers, effectively distributing both *breakthrough rewards and long-term profits*. To further reduce barriers to entry, the framework applies **Cognitive Load Theory** to its usability design, employing one-click deployment and debugging features to minimize the cognitive overhead associated with environment configuration.

**Results**
It is important to note that this paper is primarily conceptual and does not include experimental results, quantitative metrics, performance benchmarks, or empirical data. The authors provide no numerical comparisons regarding latency, throughput, or cost-efficiency, nor are there specific evaluation methodologies or datasets presented. Instead, the "results" are qualitative, focusing exclusively on the articulation of the architectural blueprint and the theoretical validation of the mechanisms intended to lower user cognitive load and enhance computational efficiency.

**Impact**
The significance of this research lies in its proposal of a standardized pathway for "Internet-scale" AI cooperation, which addresses the growing disparity between the demand for computational power and its availability. By incentivizing resource sharing through economic mechanisms, IoLLM has the potential to advance **"Greener AI"** initiatives and democratize access to high-performance resources. This framework offers a sustainable and collaborative roadmap for achieving AGI, transforming the current landscape of isolated silos into an integrated, cooperative network of intelligence.
