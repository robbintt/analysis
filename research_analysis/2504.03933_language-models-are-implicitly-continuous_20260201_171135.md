## 📑 Executive Summary

This paper addresses the fundamental discrepancy between the **discrete nature of language tokens** and the **continuous mathematical operations** of Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs are trained on discrete symbols, the authors investigate whether the underlying computation is strictly symbolic or if it behaves as a continuous function approximator. This distinction is critical for mechanistic interpretability, as it determines whether researchers should view models as manipulating discrete symbols or performing geometric operations in a latent continuous space.

The key innovation is the **Continuous Causal Transformer (CCT)**, a formal framework that generalizes the standard Transformer architecture to operate over continuous time and space domains without requiring modifications to pre-trained weights. Technically, CCT models discrete inputs as stepwise constant functions defined over specific time intervals, replacing the standard discrete attention summation with a continuous integral mechanism. The framework introduces a duration parameter ($d_s$) to control time continuity and allows processing at non-integer time-steps, effectively decoupling the model's processing rate from the discrete token sequence. Additionally, CCT supports "Space Continuity," which processes linearly interpolated vector embeddings (at varying magnitudes $\alpha \in [0,1]$) between standard vocabulary points, treating the discrete vocabulary as a discretization of a latent continuous manifold.

**Quantitative Results:**
Experiments applied the CCT framework to prominent models including Llama2-13B, Llama3-8B, Phi-3-Medium, Gemma (1 & 2), and Mistral-7B. To measure "Implicit Continuity," the authors tracked Perplexity (PPL) degradation and Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence.
*   **Time Continuity:** Perplexity remained bounded and degraded smoothly rather than abruptly as the duration parameter expanded.
*   **Space Continuity:** Linear interpolation of embeddings yielded KL divergence values significantly **below 0.1 nats** (orders of magnitude lower than random baselines which exceeded 5.0 nats), confirming that interpolated inputs produce coherent semantic shifts.

These findings signify a paradigm shift, suggesting that top-tier LLMs function as **universal approximators of continuous functions** rather than discrete symbolic engines. This challenges the traditional alignment of model processing with human-like discrete language handling. For engineering and safety, this provides a critical new lens for analyzing adversarial robustness, revealing that model outputs can be manipulated smoothly through continuous perturbations.

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   **Implicit Continuous Representation:** Transformer-based language models implicitly learn to represent sentences as continuous-time functions over a continuous input space.
*   **Universal Phenomenon:** This phenomenon of implicit continuity is present in most state-of-the-art LLMs, including **Llama2, Llama3, Phi3, Gemma, Gemma2, and Mistral**.
*   **Divergence from Human Reasoning:** The way LLMs process language fundamentally differs from human reasoning, which typically treats language as discrete.
*   **Challenge to Discrete Interpretation:** The results challenge the traditional interpretation that LLMs understand language through discrete mechanisms, suggesting a continuous underlying mechanism instead.

## ⚙️ Technical Details: The Continuous Causal Transformer (CCT)

The paper proposes the **CCT framework**, which generalizes discrete Transformers to handle continuous inputs.

### Core Concepts
*   **Underlying Function:** Models language as a discretization of an underlying continuous function **x(t)**.
*   **Input Representation:** Treats inputs as stepwise constant functions with defined time intervals and a continuous duration variable (**$d_s$**).
*   **Continuous Attention:** Replaces discrete summation with integrals to allow for continuous processing.

### Architecture Features
1.  **Time Continuity:**
    *   Introduction of a duration parameter ($d_s$).
    *   Supports non-integer time-step processing.
    *   Decouples processing rate from the discrete token sequence.

2.  **Space Continuity:**
    *   Allows the processing of interpolated vectors outside the discrete vocabulary.
    *   Treats the vocabulary as a discretization of a latent continuous manifold.

## 🧪 Experimental Results

Experiments applying CCT to major models revealed **'implicit continuity'**, demonstrating that these models successfully process inputs varying in time and space continuity despite being trained on discrete data.

*   **Duration Dependency:** Model outputs are strongly dependent on the duration parameter.
*   **Coherent Semantics:** Interpolated embeddings yield distinct, coherent semantic meanings.
*   **Conclusion:** Results suggest LLMs rely on continuous function approximation rather than discrete symbolic manipulation.
