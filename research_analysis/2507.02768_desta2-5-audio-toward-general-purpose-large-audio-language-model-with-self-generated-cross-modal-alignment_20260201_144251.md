## Executive Summary

Training Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) to understand and process audio signals presents a critical dilemma: acquiring robust auditory capabilities often comes at the cost of the model's native language proficiency, a phenomenon known as **catastrophic forgetting**. Existing methods typically rely on task-specific instruction tuning, which limits a model's ability to generalize to new tasks without explicit retraining.

This paper addresses the challenge of creating a general-purpose LALM that can seamlessly integrate audio understanding with advanced reasoning and instruction-following abilities, without compromising the text-based skills inherent in the underlying Large Language Model (LLM).

The authors introduce **"DeSTA"** (Self-generated Cross-Modal Alignment), a novel framework that eliminates the need for external human annotators by having the backbone LLM generate its own training targets derived from audio metadata and prompts. This self-supervised approach was used to construct **DeSTA-AQA5M**, a massive, task-agnostic dataset comprising 5 million samples and 7,000 hours of audio across 50 diverse datasets (speech, environmental sounds, and music).

DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves **state-of-the-art** performance across multiple benchmarks. Notably, it significantly outperforms competitors like Qwen2-Audio-Instruct in Dynamic-SUPERB and demonstrates exceptional instruction-following adherence. This research validates the critical importance of data construction pipelines in developing robust LALMs and provides a scalable pathway to bridge the gap between audio perception and high-level cognitive reasoning.

## Key Findings

*   **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves top-tier results on Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA, Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench.
*   **Mitigation of Catastrophic Forgetting**: Successfully retains the LLM's native language proficiency while aligning audio and text modalities.
*   **Zero-Shot Generalization**: Enables effective generalization to new tasks without requiring strict task-specific audio instruction-tuning.
*   **Superior Capabilities**: Outperforms existing methods specifically in auditory perception and instruction-following tasks.

## Methodology

The core proposed method is **DeSTA** (Self-generated cross-modal alignment).

*   **Self-Generated Targets**: Unlike traditional methods that rely on external annotators, the backbone LLM generates its own training targets using audio metadata and specific prompts.
*   **Dataset Construction**: This approach resulted in **DeSTA-AQA5M**, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million samples.
*   **Data Diversity**: The training data covers 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets, including speech, environmental sounds, and music.
*   **Training Objective**: The model is trained to act as a general-purpose LALM without relying on task-specific tuning during the alignment phase.
