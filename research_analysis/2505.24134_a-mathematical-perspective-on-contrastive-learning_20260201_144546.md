## 🟢 Executive Summary

Contrastive learning has become the dominant approach for training state-of-the-art multimodal models, driving success in cross-modal retrieval, classification, and generative tasks. However, despite its widespread empirical adoption, the field lacks a rigorous mathematical foundation explaining *why* these methods work. Currently, practitioners rely on heuristics to tune encoder optimization and latent space identification, obscuring the relationship between data distributions and learned representations. This theoretical gap limits the ability to guarantee model performance, interpret internal mechanics, or systematically improve architectures.

This research establishes a unified probabilistic framework that reframes contrastive learning as the optimization of encoders defining conditional probability distributions. Technically, the authors prove that within a multivariate Gaussian setting, identifying the latent space is mathematically equivalent to a low-rank matrix approximation problem. A key technical contribution is the formulation of the **Conditional Loss ($L_{cond}$)**, a population-level risk composed of alignment and regularization terms. The authors prove via **Theorem 2.8** that this proposed risk shares identical minimizers with standard contrastive losses (such as $L_{clip}$). Furthermore, **Theorem 3.2** establishes that this optimization is equivalent to minimizing the sum of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences between true data conditionals and model conditionals. Crucially, this framework allows for the derivation of novel algorithmic variants, specifically introducing new **mode-seeking loss functions** that address limitations in standard heuristic approaches.

While the study prioritizes theoretical derivation, it validates its framework through numerical experiments on synthetic data, labeled MNIST, and a real-world oceanography data assimilation task. The experiments confirmed that the mathematical model accurately captures data statistics: on synthetic data, the framework successfully recovered the underlying latent rotation matrices. In the **labeled MNIST** experiments, the novel mode-seeking variant demonstrated superior performance in capturing class-specific statistics compared to standard baselines. For the **oceanography data assimilation** task, the model was evaluated using **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** on ocean profile reconstruction; the results showed that the probabilistic approach effectively minimized RMSE, accurately reconstructing temperature and salinity fields by leveraging the learned cross-modal correlations.

This work holds substantial significance for the field by bridging the gap between deep learning heuristics and classical statistical theory. By grounding contrastive learning in probability and geometry, the authors provide a new lens for interpreting invariant feature learning and low-rank structure in data. This theoretical demystification facilitates the design of new, principled algorithms for complex representation tasks, offering researchers a robust alternative to intuition-based design. Ultimately, this mathematical foundation paves the way for more reliable, interpretable, and efficient multimodal AI systems.
