## Executive Summary

**The Problem**
3D medical image segmentation imposes significant computational burdens due to the high dimensionality of volumetric data and the complexity of state-of-the-art models. While model quantization is a widely recognized solution for reducing memory footprint and accelerating inference, existing research has predominantly relied on "fake quantization" simulations. These theoretical simulations fail to accurately reflect the performance characteristics of actual hardware, creating a "simulation-to-reality gap" that obscures the true latency and memory savings achievable in clinical environments.

**The Solution**
This study addresses the critical need for practical deployment strategies that realize the theoretical benefits of low-bit precision on physical inference engines. The key innovation is a **practical framework for deploying true 8-bit Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)** on modern NVIDIA GPUs using the TensorRT engine.

**The Approach**
Unlike prior simulation-based approaches, this method employs a two-step pipeline:
1.  Utilizing TensorRT for fake quantization and calibration on an unlabeled dataset to determine optimal scaling factors.
2.  Converting the model into a real quantized format for physical deployment.

The framework converts weights and computations to INT8 while retaining FP32 precision for input and output tensors, ensuring compatibility with standard clinical workflows. This approach is validated across a diverse spectrum of seven leading architectures, including both CNN-based (e.g., nnU-Net, U-Net) and Transformer-based (e.g., SwinUNETR, TransUNet) models.

**The Impact**
The deployment of true INT8 quantization yielded significant efficiency gains without compromising segmentation accuracy. Across all evaluated models and datasets—including BTCV, TotalSegmentator V2, and Whole Brain Segmentation—the quantized models maintained the same mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (mDSC) as their FP32 counterparts, with zero observed degradation.

Practically, the framework achieved a model size reduction of **2.42x to 3.85x** and an inference latency speedup of **2.05x to 2.66x**. Furthermore, GPU memory consumption during inference was drastically reduced, decreasing by **3.57x for U-Net** and **3.37x for TransUNet** compared to standard FP32 PyTorch baselines.

This study represents the first practical exploration of deploying real 3D low-bit quantization on modern GPUs for complex medical segmentation tasks, successfully bridging the gap between theoretical simulation and clinical application.
