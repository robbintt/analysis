## Executive Summary

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are critical tools for mechanistic interpretability, allowing researchers to decompose complex neural network activations into interpretable features. Recently, researchers have attempted to scale SAEs using Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures to balance high dimensionality with computational constraints. However, this paper identifies a fundamental failure mode in current MoE-SAE implementations: **experts fail to specialize**. Instead of learning distinct features, these models frequently exhibit "feature redundancy," where multiple experts learn overlapping or identical representations. This redundancy nullifies the theoretical benefits of MoE architectures and hinders the accurate interpretation of model components.

To address the specialization failure, the authors propose the **Scale Sparse Autoencoder (Scale SAE)**, a framework built upon two core technical innovations:

1.  **Multiple Expert Activation:** Routes inputs to $e \geq 2$ experts simultaneously, utilizing a Global Top-K selection to force feature competition across all experts rather than within isolated silos.
2.  **Feature Scaling:** Utilizes trainable parameters to amplify high-frequency components within the activation vectors. This prevents activation collapse and oversmoothing, ensuring experts capture diverse patterns.

The proposed architecture was validated on GPT-2 (Layer 8) using OpenWebText and HLE-Biomedical datasets. Scale SAE significantly outperformed standard baselines, including TopK, Gated, and Switch SAEs, achieving a **24% lower reconstruction error** and **99% reduction in feature redundancy**.

## Key Findings

*   **Fundamental Failure Identified:** Existing MoE approaches applied to SAEs suffer from a failure in specialization, where experts frequently learn overlapping or identical features rather than distinct ones.
*   **Significant Error Reduction:** The proposed Scale SAE method achieves a **24% lower reconstruction error** compared to current MoE-SAE baselines.
*   **Elimination of Redundancy:** The approach demonstrates a massive **99% reduction in feature redundancy** among experts.
*   **Bridging the Trade-off:** The work successfully bridges the gap between model interpretability (usually requiring high dimensionality) and computational feasibility (usually requiring low dimensionality).

## Methodology

The research utilizes a **Multi-Expert Sparse Autoencoder** framework specifically designed to enforce diversity and specialization across experts. The architecture relies on two primary innovations:

*   **Multiple Expert Activation:** A mechanism that simultaneously engages semantically weighted subsets of experts. By activating multiple experts at once, the system encourages focus on specific, distinct features.
*   **Feature Scaling:** A technique utilizing adaptive high-frequency scaling to enhance feature diversity. This prevents experts from converging on identical representations, ensuring they learn unique aspects of the data.
