## Executive Summary

Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have demonstrated superior performance in image generation tasks, but their deployment on edge devices is severely hindered by massive parameter sizes and prohibitive computational costs. While quantization is a standard technique for model compression, existing integer-based quantization methods struggle to maintain the high fidelity required for generative tasks, often resulting in significant degradation of image quality. Consequently, there is a critical need for a compression framework that bridges the gap between the resource constraints of edge hardware (specifically FPGAs) and the precision requirements of high-resolution autoregressive generation.

This paper introduces **FPQVAR**, a novel algorithm-hardware co-design framework that leverages low-bit floating-point (FP) quantization rather than traditional integer schemes. Algorithmically, the authors propose **Dual Format Quantization** to manage imbalanced input activations and utilize **Group-wise Hadamard Transformations (GHT)** combined with GHT-Aware Learnable Transformations to suppress time-varying outlier channels. On the hardware side, the study implements the first FPGA-based accelerator for VAR models, featuring custom low-bit FP arithmetic components (quantizers and multipliers) built using lookup tables (LUTs) and a specialized two-level pipeline architecture to maximize throughput.

The FPQVAR framework demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both generative quality and hardware efficiency. Under 4-bit quantization, the model achieved a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of **3.58** (a reduction from the SOTA 10.83) and an Inception Score (IS) of **241.5** (an increase from 175.9). Furthermore, the 6-bit quantized model achieves performance comparable to a full-precision FP16 baseline. On the hardware front, the FPGA accelerator attains a throughput of **1.1 images per second**, representing a 3.1x speedup over existing integer-based accelerators, while delivering 3.6x higher energy efficiency than integer baselines and 2.8x higher efficiency than GPU implementations.

This research represents a paradigm shift in the deployment of generative AI on edge devices by validating that low-bit floating-point quantization can outperform integer-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency for autoregressive vision tasks. By enabling the first practical FPGA acceleration of VAR models, FPQVAR opens the door for high-quality, energy-efficient image generation on resource-constrained platforms.
