## Executive Summary

The research addresses the critical challenge of automatically generating **Systems Modeling Language version 2 (SysML v2)** models from natural language specifications, a task currently bottlenecked by the language's rigorous syntax and the extreme scarcity of training corpora. As SysML v2 is a specialized standard, generic Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the domain-specific exposure required to produce syntactically correct and semantically valid outputs. This limitation creates a significant barrier to adoption in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), where accurate modeling is essential for system design and verification.

To overcome these constraints, the paper introduces **SysTemp**, a novel Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture that employs a hybrid generation strategy combining agent orchestration with template-based logic. Technically, the system utilizes a single underlying **GPT-4** model, decomposing the generation task into four specialized agents: the `SpecificationGeneratorAgent` converts natural language into a structured Python dictionary; the `TemplateGeneratorAgent` creates a SysML v2 skeletal structure using template substitution; the `WriterAgent` fills in model details; and the `ParserAgent` validates syntax and iteratively corrects errors. The core innovation lies in the `TemplateGeneratorAgent`, which enforces structural integrity and constrains the generation space, thereby compensating for the lack of training data.

The system's performance was evaluated using an ablation study on a dataset of **10 natural language requirements**, designed to isolate the contribution of the template-based approach. This study compared the full SysTemp architecture against a baseline configuration where the `WriterAgent` received the raw Python dictionary directly, bypassing the template generation step. The evaluation relied on the **Syntactic Error Count** detected by the `ParserAgent` as the primary metric. The results demonstrated that while the baseline approach consistently produced syntax errors, the full SysTemp architecture successfully generated **syntactically valid models with zero errors**. This quantitative outcome confirms that the inclusion of the `TemplateGeneratorAgent` is necessary to ensure structural compliance and valid output generation.

SysTemp represents a significant advancement in systems engineering by demonstrating a viable method for generating complex, standards-compliant models from natural language inputs without requiring massive, domain-specific training datasets. By successfully lowering the technical barrier to model creation through a hybrid multi-agent and template strategy, this approach allows engineers to leverage natural language for rapid prototyping and specification. Furthermore, the methodology provides a generalizable blueprint for applying generative AI to other specialized domains suffering from data scarcity, potentially accelerating the integration of AI into standard engineering workflows.

## Technical Details

SysTemp is a multi-agent framework that utilizes a single LLM to generate SysML v2 concrete syntax from natural language. The architecture consists of four specialized agents:

*   **SpecificationGeneratorAgent:** Converts natural language inputs into a structured Python dictionary via few-shot prompting.
*   **TemplateGeneratorAgent:** Creates a SysML v2 skeleton structure using a tool for template substitution.
*   **WriterAgent:** Completes the model details based on the skeleton provided.
*   **ParserAgent:** Validates syntax and provides iterative feedback to the WriterAgent to ensure correctness.

## Methodology

The research employs a **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** architecture designated as SysTemp. This approach centers on decomposing the model generation task into agents, with a specific emphasis on a template generator component. This component is utilized to structure the transformation of input data (natural language specifications) into output data (SysML v2 models), thereby mitigating issues related to syntax complexity. The methodology includes a rigorous evaluation phase to assess the system's advantages and limitations.

## Results

The evaluation protocol utilizes an **ablation study** to measure the contribution of the `TemplateGeneratorAgent` by comparing the system against a baseline where the `WriterAgent` receives the Python dictionary directly.

*   **Metric:** The primary metric for success is the **Syntactic Error Count** detected by the `ParserAgent`.
*   **Outcome:** While the specific numerical values for the baseline are not detailed in the provided text, the full SysTemp architecture achieved a state of **zero syntax errors**, validating the structural necessity of the template agent.
