## Executive Summary

### Problem
The paper identifies a critical disconnect between dominant Global North AI safety frameworks and the technological realities of the African continent. Global debates frequently overlook regional risks such as data colonial dependency, severe compute scarcity, labor disruption, and the weaponization of deepfakes for electoral interference. Furthermore, a significant governance void exists: while Computer Incident Response Teams (CIRTs) are present, there is no dedicated AI Safety Institute or office. This absence leaves African stakeholders marginalized and exposes the region to unchecked AI deployments that ignore local contexts.

### Innovation
To bridge this gap, the authors employ a risk mapping and landscape analysis approach, combined with an institutional gap analysis of existing CIRTs. The primary innovation is a proposed multi-layered governance architecture anchored by a **five-point action plan**. This includes a human-rights-centric policy framework, a dedicated African AI Safety Institute, and a technical early warning system featuring inclusive benchmark suites for over 25 African languages. This operates alongside the African Union’s dual-use framework (Area 11) to ensure agile regulation.

### Results
Quantitative assessment via the Global Index on Responsible AI reveals that Africa holds the lowest global average score for AI Safety. Only 26.8% of African states demonstrate concrete activity in this domain. Infrastructure metrics are stark: Africa possesses less than 1% of the world’s supercomputers and hosts only 2% of global data centers. Regulatory gaps in environmental stewardship are also evident, with only 11 African countries having national e-waste legislation.

### Impact
This research shifts the focus of AI safety from abstract global risks to immediate regional realities like resource scarcity and data colonialism. By providing a roadmap for an African AI Safety Institute and an AU-level AI Safety & Security Forum, the paper empowers regional stakeholders to shape policy proactively. The findings serve as a foundational directive for future African Union strategies, aiming to integrate the continent's unique linguistic and infrastructural needs into the development of safe AI systems.

## Key Findings

*   **Distinctive Risk Profile:** Africa faces a unique set of AI risks, specifically data colonial dependency, compute scarcity, deepfake-fueled electoral interference, labor disruption, and climate-driven environmental costs.
*   **Marginalization:** African perspectives are currently side-lined in global AI safety debates, severely limiting stakeholder influence and representation.
*   **Governance Void:** Despite the presence of Computer Incident Response Teams (CIRTs), there is a complete absence of a dedicated AI Safety Institute or office on the continent.
*   **Infrastructure Deficit:** There is a severe lack of technical infrastructure required to support safety monitoring and enforcement.

## Methodology

The study utilizes a two-pronged analytical approach:

1.  **Risk Mapping & Landscape Analysis:** This method is used to define and categorize the specific AI risk profile unique to the African continent, distinguishing it from Global North priorities.
2.  **Institutional Gap Analysis:** The authors evaluate existing technical infrastructure—specifically assessing the role and capabilities of CIRTs—to identify deficits in current governance capabilities.

## Technical Details

### Proposed Governance Architecture
The paper proposes a multi-layered governance architecture defined by a **5-point action plan**:
1.  **PolicyFramework:** Establishment of human-rights-centric policies.
2.  **Institution Creation:** Formation of a dedicated African AI Safety Institute.
3.  **Public Literacy:** Promotion of public AI literacy initiatives.
4.  **Technical Infrastructure:** Development of an early warning system inclusive of benchmark suites for 25+ African languages.
5.  **Diplomatic Forum:** Creation of an annual AU-level AI Safety & Security Forum.

### Strategic Alignment
*   **AU Continental AI Strategy:** Utilizes a dual-use framework across 15 policy areas.
*   **Area 11 Mandate:** Focuses specifically on technical standards and agile regulatory instruments.

### Evaluation Metrics
*   **Global Index on Responsible AI:** Used as the primary methodology to assess evidence across government frameworks, government actions, and non-state actors.

## Results

### Quantitative Findings
*   **Lowest Global Score:** Africa ranks lowest globally for AI Safety, Accuracy, and Reliability.
*   **Low Engagement:** Only 26.8% of African states (11 out of 41 countries) showed concrete activity in AI safety.
*   **No Evidence of Effort:** 30 countries showed no evidence of local efforts in this domain.
*   **Outlier:** Kenya is the only country demonstrating activity across all three assessment pillars (Government Frameworks, Government Actions, Non-State Actors).

### Infrastructure & Environmental Metrics
*   **Compute Disparity:** The Global North hosts ~75% of the world's supercomputers vs. Africa's <1%.
*   **Data Centers:** Africa accounts for only 2% of global data centers.
*   **E-Waste Legislation:** Only 11 African countries have national e-waste legislation.
*   **Language Representation:** Proposed benchmarks currently target 25+ African languages to address linguistic inclusivity.

## Contributions

*   **Advocacy:** The study strongly advocates for the establishment of a dedicated African AI Safety Institute.
*   **Action Plan:** Provides a detailed five-point action plan to guide regional policy and infrastructure.
*   **Contextual Framework:** Offers a safety framework that shifts focus from abstract global risks to regional realities, specifically addressing data colonialism and resource scarcity.
*   **Technical Standards:** Promotes the development of technical infrastructure for safety via early warning systems and inclusive benchmarking.
