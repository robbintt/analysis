## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the RetrieveAll framework, which addresses critical challenges in multilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) by mitigating language interference and shifting the paradigm from inference-based to learning-based prompting.

#### **Problem**

Multilingual NER struggles with **language interference**, where high-resource languages suppress low-resource languages, causing feature conflicts and degraded performance. Existing solutions often rely on computationally expensive dedicated models per language or external knowledge bases, limiting scalability. Furthermore, current "prompt-guided inference" strategies fail to fully exploit the intrinsic potential of training data, resulting in suboptimal efficiency.

#### **Innovation**

The authors introduce **RetrieveAll**, a novel framework built on **dynamic LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation). It transitions NER methodology to "prompt-driven learning" via an input-aware LoRA retrieval mechanism that dynamically selects language-specific adapters. The architecture features:
*   **Dynamic Feature Decoupling:** Prevents task-specific conflicts.
*   **Cross-Granularity Knowledge Augmented Learning (CKAL):** Injects entity and context-level knowledge via hierarchical prompts without external resources.

#### **Results**

Evaluations on the **PAN-X dataset** across eight languages using LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2.5 base models demonstrate RetrieveAll's superiority. The framework achieved an **average F1 score improvement of 12.1%** over baselines like XLM-RoBERTa, LS-unLLaMA, and PromptNER. Results confirm successful mitigation of language interference while maintaining high resource efficiency.

#### **Impact**

RetrieveAll provides a scalable, parameter-efficient solution that eliminates the need for external knowledge bases or language-specific models. By introducing cross-granularity knowledge augmentation, this research sets new performance benchmarks for low- and medium-resource languages and significantly influences future developments in dynamic adaptation and universal NER systems.

## Key Findings

*   **Significant Performance Gain:** RetrieveAll outperforms existing baselines with an average **F1 score improvement of 12.1%** on the PAN-X dataset.
*   **Mitigation of Language Interference:** The framework successfully resolves feature conflicts and the competitive suppression of low-resource languages by high-resource languages.
*   **Self-Sufficient Learning:** Achieves high performance by exploiting the intrinsic potential of data, removing reliance on external knowledge bases or resources.
*   **Paradigm Shift:** Advances NER methodology from "prompt-guided inference" to "prompt-driven learning" through a novel hierarchical prompting mechanism.

## Methodology

RetrieveAll is a universal multilingual NER framework built on dynamic LoRA. The methodology comprises three core components:

1.  **Dynamic Feature Decoupling**
    *   Decouples task-specific features across different languages.
    *   Prevents feature conflicts that typically degrade performance in multilingual settings.

2.  **Cross-Granularity Knowledge Augmentation**
    *   Exploits the intrinsic potential of the training data.
    *   Eliminates the need for external knowledge bases by utilizing internal data structures.

3.  **Hierarchical Prompting Mechanism**
    *   Guides the injection of knowledge into the model.
    *   Facilitates the transition from inference-based strategies to learning-based prompting strategies.

## Technical Details

RetrieveAll utilizes a sophisticated architecture designed to handle multilingual complexities efficiently.

*   **Dynamic LoRA Decomposition:**
    *   Maintains a pool of **language-specific Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs)**.
    *   Enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning without dedicated models for each language.

*   **Input-Aware LoRA Retrieval:**
    *   Dynamically selects the appropriate language-specific LoRA based on the input.
    *   Selection is inferred from the top-k retrieved contextual examples.

*   **Cross-Granularity Knowledge Augmented Learning (CKAL):**
    *   Injects knowledge at two levels: **Entity-level** and **Context-level**.
    *   Uses hierarchical prompts to integrate this knowledge without requiring external resources.

## Contributions

The research makes three primary contributions to the field of Natural Language Processing:

*   **Scalable Solution:** Resolves the scalability issue of language interference by handling feature conflicts and high computational costs without dedicated models per language.
*   **Novel Framework:** Introduces **RetrieveAll**, a dynamic LoRA-based framework specifically designed to handle the complexities of low- and medium-resource languages.
*   **Innovation in Knowledge Utilization:** Pioneers cross-granularity knowledge augmentation and hierarchical prompting, leveraging internal data structures to set new performance benchmarks.
