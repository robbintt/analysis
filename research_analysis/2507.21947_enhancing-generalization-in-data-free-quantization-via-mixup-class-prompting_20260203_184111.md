## 📋 Executive Summary

Data-free quantization (DFQ) is essential for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices without access to original training data, often due to privacy or storage constraints. Current state-of-the-art DFQ methods rely on text-conditioned generative models, such as Latent Diffusion Models, to synthesize calibration data. However, the authors identify a critical limitation in these approaches: the reliance on "single-class prompts."

Because text labels often suffer from **polysemy**—where a single word can have multiple meanings or contexts—prompting a generator with a single class label (e.g., "box") tends to produce synthetic data that lacks diversity and fails to capture the full feature distribution of the target domain. This results in poor generalization and degraded quantization accuracy.

To overcome the limitations of polysemy and sparse feature representation, the paper proposes a **"mixup-class prompting" strategy**. This innovation fuses multiple class labels at the text prompt level before inputting them into the generative model. Conceptually similar to mixup data augmentation, this approach prompts the Latent Diffusion Model to generate synthetic images that represent a linear combination of classes, rather than distinct, isolated examples. By creating calibration data with softer decision boundaries and richer intra-class variations, the method enhances the robustness of the Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) process.

The proposed mixup-class prompting method demonstrates comprehensive performance improvements across both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). It consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art DFQ methods, including GenQ, particularly in challenging low-bit regimes. In the extreme **W2A4** configuration, the approach achieved state-of-the-art accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in aggressive compression scenarios.

Beyond raw accuracy, the study reported improved training stability, evidenced by reduced variance in quantization performance and an analysis of gradient norms showing better convergence characteristics. This research significantly advances the practicality of data-free quantization by establishing a new performance boundary for low-bit model compression.
