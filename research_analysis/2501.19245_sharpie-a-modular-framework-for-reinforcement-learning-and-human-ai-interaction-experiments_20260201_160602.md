## Executive Summary

The research addresses a critical fragmentation in tools available for studying Human-AI Interaction (HAI) within the context of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Currently, researchers face a significant barrier: generic RL frameworks lack the necessary interfaces for human participation, while standard behavioral experiment platforms lack support for sophisticated AI agents and real-time interaction. This absence of a unified, generic tool forces researchers to build custom, one-off infrastructures for every experiment, stifling reproducibility and limiting the scope of study to specific, often constrained, scenarios such as unidirectional communication or single-agent interactions.

The authors introduce **SHARPIE** (Shared Human-AI Reinforcement Learning Platform for Interactive Experiments), a modular, open-source framework designed as middleware between standard RL environments and human participants. Technically, SHARPIE utilizes versatile wrappers that interface with standard RL environments (e.g., PettingZoo, Gym) without requiring modifications to the underlying code. The system features a React-based web interface for real-time human interaction and a robust backend that manages experiment logic, data logging, and cloud deployment. This architecture supports a wide range of interaction modalities, including teaching via demonstrations, action delegation, text-based task specification, policy visualization, and intention sharing for teaming.

The framework’s versatility was empirically validated through seven diverse experimental configurations that demonstrate its capacity to handle complex, multi-agent scenarios. These experiments ranged from Multi-agent Teaching in "Simple Spread" and Action Delegation in "Mountain Car" to Task Specification in "Minecraft" and Shared Decision Support in "Water-reservoir management." Comparative analysis highlights SHARPIE's superiority over existing tools: it successfully overcomes the single-agent restriction of HIPPO-GYM, the one-way communication limitations of platforms like Knierim et al., and the lack of AI entities in standard behavioral tools, thereby successfully enabling complex, bidirectional, and multi-agent interactions.

SHARPIE represents a significant advancement in the standardization of human-RL research methodologies. By providing a generic, end-to-end interface, it empowers researchers to investigate intricate questions regarding human-AI collaboration, delegation, and teaming without the overhead of developing custom infrastructure. This framework lowers the barrier to entry for rigorous experimentation in human-AI synergy, allowing the research community to focus on algorithmic and behavioral insights rather than software engineering, ultimately accelerating the development of AI systems that can effectively collaborate with humans in complex environments.
