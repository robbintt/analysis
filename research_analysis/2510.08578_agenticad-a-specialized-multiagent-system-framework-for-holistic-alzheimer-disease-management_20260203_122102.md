## Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical fragmentation currently plaguing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) management, where interventions, clinical data, and caregiver support tools typically operate in isolated silos. This disjointed approach creates a heavy administrative and emotional burden on caregivers and hinders the delivery of adaptive, patient-centric care.

The paper argues that the current landscape of single-purpose applications is insufficient for managing the complexities of AD, establishing the necessity for a holistic ecosystem capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve overall disease management and patient outcomes. To bridge this gap, the authors propose **"AgenticAD,"** a specialized Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework designed to unify clinical interpretation, research synthesis, and daily care.

The architecture organizes eight interoperable AI agents into three functional clusters:
1.  **Caregiver and Patient Support**
2.  **Data Analysis and Research**
3.  **Advanced Multimodal Workflows**

Technically, the system leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (OpenAI GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Google Gemini) as core reasoning engines, augmented by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for precise context handling. The implementation prioritizes modularity and scalability, utilizing a robust tech stack—including AutoGen for swarm orchestration, ScrapegraphAI for web data acquisition, and DuckDB for structured analysis—to enable the real-time processing of heterogeneous data within a unified Streamlit interface.

This study focuses on the architectural design and technical feasibility of the proposed framework, establishing a comprehensive blueprint for integrating complex AI agents into a cohesive system. Consequently, the findings validate the successful integration of heterogeneous data streams and the viability of collaborative agent workflows rather than reporting quantitative performance metrics. While specific measures such as latency, F1-scores, or clinical efficacy are identified as targets for future empirical validation, the research demonstrates the technical capability of the system to perform advanced multimodal tasks and coordinate specialized utilities effectively.

The significance of this work lies in its establishment of a foundational architecture that marks a paradigm shift from siloed applications to collaborative, adaptive healthcare systems. By defining a structure that connects clinical needs with research synthesis and multimodal processing, AgenticAD facilitates the development of systems capable of evolving with patient needs.
