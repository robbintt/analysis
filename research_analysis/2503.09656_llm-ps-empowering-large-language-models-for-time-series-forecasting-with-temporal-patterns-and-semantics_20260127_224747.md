## 📝 Executive Summary

> This research addresses the fundamental challenge of adapting Large Language Models (LLMs), which are primarily trained on discrete textual data, to the continuous and numerical domain of time series forecasting (TSF). While LLMs possess superior reasoning capabilities, mapping raw time series data into the embedding space of these models is non-trivial due to the distinct nature of temporal dynamics compared to natural language.

The paper seeks to bridge this gap by creating a framework that effectively translates temporal numerical patterns into semantic representations that pre-trained LLMs can process without sacrificing the intricate details of time series data.

The core innovation is the **LLM-PS framework**, which introduces a dual-pronged approach to data representation:
1.  **Temporal Pattern Decoupling:** Utilizing Wavelet Transform to isolate short-term fluctuation patterns from long-term trend components, outperforming traditional Fourier Transform and average pooling techniques.
2.  **Semantic Integration:** Augmenting the decoupled numerical patterns with contextual information.

By mapping these transformed, semantically enriched patterns into the input space of powerful LLM backbones (such as **GPT** and **Llama**), LLM-PS allows the model to leverage its inherent reasoning capabilities for forecasting tasks. The proposed method was rigorously evaluated across seven diverse datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines and traditional deep learning methods. Notably, the model achieved an OWA score of approximately **0.839**, confirming a measurable improvement in forecasting accuracy over existing solutions.
