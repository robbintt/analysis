## 📝 Executive Summary

This research addresses the critical need to re-evaluate automated test generation techniques in light of the rapid release of new Large Language Model (LLM) versions, specifically GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek V3, and LLaMA 3.3. As models evolve with distinct capabilities and cost structures, it is unclear whether complex, heuristic-heavy State-of-the-Art (SOTA) tools retain their advantage over simpler prompting strategies. The study investigates this gap on a benchmark of real-world Java projects, assessing whether sophisticated tooling is still necessary to achieve high coverage or if newer models can achieve comparable results through basic, cost-effective prompting.

The key innovation is a cost-optimized Hybrid generation strategy implemented via the ChatUniTest framework. This technique technically adopts a two-phase process: Phase 1 performs broad class-level generation to capture general system behavior, while Phase 2 selectively targets remaining coverage gaps by applying method-level prompting only to specific uncovered branches. This approach is benchmarked against established SOTA tools (HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, CoverUp) and strict baseline configurations, specifically Plain (Class) and Plain (Method) prompting, to isolate the impact of prompt granularity on economic feasibility.

Results indicate that method-level prompting significantly outperforms class-level generation, achieving 49.95% line coverage compared to 33.53%. While aggregated suites reached 53.67% line and 38.74% branch coverage, the proposed Hybrid approach proved highly efficient, matching this efficacy with 52.30% line and 38.84% branch coverage while reducing API requests by approximately 20% (10,548 vs 13,228), translating to direct cost savings. DeepSeek V3 emerged as the strongest performer in the Plain (Method) configuration with 59.82% line coverage, while the study observed robust compilation rates of 78.89% (class) and 82.17% (method), with passing rates hovering around 50%.

The findings highlight a paradigm shift in LLM-based test generation: newer models enable simpler prompting strategies to rival complex SOTA tools regarding effectiveness, while the Hybrid strategy offers superior cost efficiency. This research encourages the software engineering community to re-evaluate existing tooling architectures, suggesting that prioritizing selective, cost-aware generation strategies can significantly reduce testing expenditures without sacrificing software quality.
