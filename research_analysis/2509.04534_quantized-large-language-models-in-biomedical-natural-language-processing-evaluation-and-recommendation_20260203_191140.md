## Executive Summary

High-performance Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, and clinical question answering. However, the deployment of massive models, particularly those in the 70-billion-parameter range, is hindered by prohibitive GPU memory requirements. This creates a significant "clinical translation gap," where strict data privacy regulations necessitate local, on-premise deployment, yet healthcare environments often lack the enterprise-grade hardware required to run full-precision models. This paper addresses the critical challenge of enabling secure, local inference of state-of-the-art biomedical LLMs using resource-constrained hardware.

To bridge this gap, the study presents a systematic evaluation of model quantization as a deployment strategy, reducing numerical precision from FP32/FP16 to lower-bit formats (W8A16 and W4A16). The researchers assessed 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both general-domain architectures (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B, Qwen2.5-72B) and biomedical-specific models (e.g., Meditron-70B, ClinicalCamel-70B). The technical rigor lies in the comprehensive analysis across eight benchmark datasets covering four critical tasks: Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction, Multi-label Classification, and Question Answering. The study specifically investigates the trade-offs between memory efficiency and the retention of domain-specific knowledge, including the impact on few-shot learning and KV cache memory demands.

The evaluation demonstrates that quantization effectively enables the deployment of 70B-parameter models on consumer-grade GPUs with approximately 40GB VRAM, achieving memory reductions of up to 75%. Specifically, the Qwen2.5-72B model saw its memory footprint drop from 136.41 GB to 41.0 GB using W4A16 quantization. Crucially, performance degradation was generally negligible across most tasks; for instance, the Qwen2.5-72B NER F1 score fell marginally from 0.842 to 0.833. However, the study identified specific sensitivities, noting that the Llama-3.3-70B exhibited significant performance degradation in 8-bit formats (HoC F1 dropping to 0.343). While inference latency increased compared to full precision (e.g., rising from 2.75s to 3.48s for the HoC task on Qwen2.5-72B), the results confirm that domain-specific capabilities remain largely intact.

This research provides actionable, evidence-based recommendations for implementing quantization to facilitate secure local LLM deployment in healthcare environments. By validating that high-capacity models can retain domain knowledge and task-specific accuracy on limited hardware, the authors offer a pragmatic roadmap for healthcare institutions to adopt advanced AI tools without compromising patient data privacy or investing in prohibitively expensive infrastructure. This work is significant as one of the first comprehensive assessments of quantization effects on a wide range of biomedical LLMs, effectively democratizing access to state-of-the-art biomedical intelligence and accelerating the integration of AI into real-world clinical workflows.
