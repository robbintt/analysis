## Executive Summary

This paper addresses the theoretical disconnect between formal linguistic theorizing—specifically the Minimalist Program’s operation 'Merge'—and the architecture of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). As the concluding contribution to a scholarly debate within the *Italian Journal of Linguistics*, the work confronts the difficulty of mapping discrete, hierarchical syntactic operations onto the continuous, high-dimensional vector spaces of neural networks. This problem is critical because, without a rigorous theoretical bridge, formal linguistics risks losing explanatory relevance in the era of deep learning, while neural architectures remain opaque regarding the structural constraints that define human language learnability and systematicity.

The core innovation is a comprehensive meta-commentary and rebuttal that synthesizes the author’s position following critical engagement from peers, defending a theoretical framework where the syntactic operation 'Merge' is explicitly mapped onto Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures via computational graphs. The author refines the proposal that linguistic structure can be modeled using vector representations where specific dimensions encode discrete grammatical features—such as categorial status, phi-features, and selectional properties. Unlike end-to-end learned embeddings, this approach utilizes manually provided, static vectors to isolate the structural logic of 'Merge,' arguing that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can subsequently be used to interpret the geometric interaction of these feature dimensions during syntactic tree construction.

Consistent with its nature as a final statement in a sequence of academic exchanges, this paper reports no quantitative experimental results, performance metrics, or benchmark scores, offering no numerical evaluations regarding model accuracy or perplexity. The primary "result" is the formal closure of the debate section, resulting in a consolidated stance that clarifies the author’s theoretical position. While the work establishes a testable hypothesis for visualizing 'Merge' operations within vector spaces—referenced in the context of the BabyLM 2024 initiative—it does not provide empirical data or model outputs to validate this hypothesis.

The significance of this work lies in its contribution to the discourse on "neuro-syntax," providing a formalized defense of the view that core linguistic operations must be explicitly represented in neural architectures. By serving as the concluding synthesis of the debate, the paper acts as a foundational reference for researchers attempting to integrate rigid syntactic theory into probabilistic language models. It influences the field by advocating for architectures grounded in interpretable feature geometry rather than opaque representations, potentially guiding future research, such as the BabyLM 2024 initiative, toward designs that are more neuro-linguistically plausible.
