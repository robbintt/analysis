## Executive Summary

Biomedical data discovery often involves complex, multi-entity datasets that require sophisticated visual analysis to uncover hidden patterns. Traditional visualization tools typically demand high technical expertise to configure effectively, while standard Large Language Model (LLM) interfaces often generate static, isolated charts that lack the interactivity and linkage necessary for deep exploratory analysis.

This paper addresses the critical gap between the accessibility of natural language interfaces and the functional rigor required for interactive, linked-data analysis. The authors introduce a novel **multi-agent system architecture** that integrates a fine-tuned LLM with a proprietary grammar-based visualization framework. Technically, the system interprets natural language prompts to generate precise visualization specifications and dynamically constructs interactive dashboards progressively as the interaction unfolds, rather than outputting static images.

A key innovation is the automatic generation of specific interactive widgets—**quantitative (Filter-Q), categorical (Filter-C), and Entity-Relationship (Filter-ER)**—which allow users to resolve ambiguity, refine parameters, and filter data in real-time. Validation of the system was conducted through a biomedical case study, confirming the system's practical utility, highlighting its capacity to support the discovery of edge cases, and demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing natural language accessibility with functional utility.
