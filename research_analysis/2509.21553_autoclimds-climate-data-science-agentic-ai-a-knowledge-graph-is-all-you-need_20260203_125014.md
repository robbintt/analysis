## 📑 Executive Summary

Climate data science faces a critical bottleneck due to the immense complexity and heterogeneity of cloud-native datasets, which require high levels of technical expertise to navigate. Researchers are often hindered by slow discovery processes and low reproducibility, as disparate data sources, tools, and workflows remain siloed. This paper addresses the urgent need to bridge the gap between these complex repositories and human users, aiming to democratize access to climate discovery by removing the steep technical barriers that currently limit scientific inquiry to specialized domains.

The authors introduce **AutoClimDS**, a novel framework that posits a curated Knowledge Graph (KG) as the sole unifying layer required to drive agentic AI workflows. Built on a cloud-native architecture utilizing Amazon Neptune Analytics with OpenCypher, the system employs a hybrid KG that combines structural, ML-assisted, and procedural relationships. Key technical mechanisms include a dual-format fusion strategy (D_JSON and D_UMM) for ingesting NASA CMR metadata, a three-stage geospatial pipeline to standardize spatial inputs into valid polygonal representations, and deterministic content-hashing for unique entity identification. Generative AI agents leverage this semantic backbone to interpret natural language objectives and orchestrate autonomous scientific analysis.

The proof-of-concept validation yielded highly quantifiable improvements in data standardization and semantic alignment. The dual-format merge process successfully generates a schema comprising approximately **60 standardized attributes** per record. Most notably, a fine-tuned ClimateBERT classifier achieved **99.17% semantic accuracy** in mapping raw text metadata to CESM variable labels, effectively bridging the semantic gap between observational data and model vocabularies. Furthermore, the system successfully demonstrated the capability to autonomously reproduce results from published climate studies using only natural language prompts as the initiating input.

This research establishes a validated, reproducible pathway for human-AI collaboration in scientific inquiry, demonstrating that a Knowledge Graph is sufficient to unlock scalable, agentic workflows. By releasing an open-source, extensible framework designed as a shared commons, the authors provide a foundational infrastructure that invites community contribution and standardization. This approach significantly lowers the barrier to entry for climate science, promising a shift toward more democratized, efficient, and automated research processes.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The researchers developed a proof-of-concept system, **AutoClimDS**, which operates on a cloud-native architecture. The methodology relies on two core components:

1.  **Curated Knowledge Graph:** Acts as the semantic backbone to organize disparate elements.
2.  **Generative AI Agents:** Leverage the KG to facilitate natural language interactions and automated analysis.

The system utilizes existing cloud-ready API data portals to validate that the KG is sufficient to drive these agentic scientific workflows.
