> **## Executive Summary**
>
> This research addresses the critical challenge of enabling complex, compositional reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed within resource-constrained, distributed environments. The study focuses specifically on Interactive Multimodal Applications (IMAs) in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios, where the core difficulty lies in managing structured task dependencies and optimizing resource utilization across edge devices.
>
> The paper proposes a dual-component framework:
> 1.  **ContextLoRA:** A graph-guided parameter partitioning approach using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to map task dependencies. It segments the LoRA weight matrix into three training states: $W_{Train}$ (updating current task and relevant parents), $W_{Freeze}$ (locking inactive parents), and $W_{Mask}$ (ignoring uninvolved parameters).
> 2.  **ContextGear:** A specialized pipeline parallelism strategy for heterogeneous hardware. It categorizes edge devices into two groups: Group 1 handles full propagation for trainable matrices, while Group 2 handles forward propagation only for frozen matrices.
>
> Validated through an IoV simulation, the framework outperformed baselines (HydraLoRA, MoLE, JoRA, etc.) by effectively preventing redundant training through DAG structuring and significantly optimizing throughput and memory usage.

## Key Findings

*   **Abstract Availability:** *No abstract text was provided in the input to analyze.*
*   **Compositional Ability:** The system exhibits strong capabilities in collaborative processing across distributed devices.
*   **Structural Integrity:** The exclusion of cyclic structures in the task graph was found to be crucial in preventing redundant training loops.
*   **Resource Optimization:** The separation of trainable and frozen parameters across device groups significantly improved memory usage and system stability.

## Technical Details

The proposed framework comprises two distinct components designed to handle Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) on the edge.

### 1. ContextLoRA: Graph-Guided Parameter Partitioning
This component utilizes a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** to represent task dependencies. It segments the LoRA weight matrix using a three-state training mechanism:

*   **$W_{Train}$**: Parameters for the current task plus a fraction ($\delta$) of the parent parameters.
*   **$W_{Freeze}$**: Inactive parent parameters that are locked to preserve learned knowledge.
*   **$W_{Mask}$**: Uninvolved parameters that are entirely ignored during the current training step.

### 2. ContextGear: Pipeline Parallelism
ContextGear enables efficient processing on edge devices by grouping them based on computational load:

*   **Group 1:** Handles both **forward and backward propagation** for trainable matrices ($W_{Train}$).
*   **Group 2:** Handles **forward propagation only** for frozen matrices ($W_{Freeze}$), effectively reducing the computational load on lower-tier hardware.

## Results & Evaluation

### Experimental Setup
The study utilized a simulation based on an **Internet of Vehicles (IoV)** scenario with the following configuration:
*   **Hardware:** 3 EdgeDevices
*   **Batch Size:** 4
*   **Learning Rate:** $2e^{-4}$ (with cosine decay)
*   **Optimization:** DeepSpeed Stage 3
*   **Duration:** 4 Epochs

### Benchmarking
The system was compared against several state-of-the-art baselines:
*   HydraLoRA
*   MoLE
*   Original LoRA
*   JoRA
*   DeepSpeed

### Outcomes
*   **Qualitative:** Results highlighted the system's ability to maintain stability while managing complex task dependencies in a distributed setting.
*   **Structural:** Confirmed that avoiding cyclic structures in task graphs minimizes redundant computations.
*   **Performance:** The pipeline parallelism approach effectively distributed the burden, allowing for sophisticated AI on limited hardware.
