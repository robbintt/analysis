## Executive Summary

Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently struggle with complex, long-form reasoning, often relying on standard forward passes that fail to synthesize fragmented information or connect disparate concepts. Addressing these deficiencies typically necessitates resource-intensive procedures such as knowledge distillation or reinforcement learning, which require significant computational overhead and parameter updates. This paper addresses the challenge of unlocking advanced visual reasoning capabilities in existing, non-reasoning VLMs without the prohibitive costs and complexity associated with additional training or supervision.

The core innovation is **"Socratic-MCTS,"** a test-time reasoning framework that conceptualizes reasoning as a search process rather than a generative task. The method utilizes a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm that treats the generation of subquestions as latent decisions within a search tree. During inference, the algorithm dynamically injects subquestion-subanswer pairs into the model's output stream, decomposing complex problems into manageable steps. The process employs Selection, Expansion, Simulation (via compositional rollouts), and Backpropagation phases, optimized with mechanisms like a Direct Exit Node and adaptive computation, to guide the model toward the correct answer without modifying its underlying weights.

Evaluations across three benchmarks demonstrated that the Socratic-MCTS approach consistently outperforms standard baselines. On the MMMU-PRO benchmark, the method achieved a 2% overall improvement in performance. Notably, in the Liberal Arts category of MMMU-PRO, the technique yielded a significant 9% gain. Qualitative analysis further revealed that the search-based process enables non-reasoning models to effectively connect fragmented knowledge and reduces errors in scene analysis compared to standard chain-of-thought prompting.

This research establishes a new paradigm for enhancing VLM capabilities by proving that advanced reasoning can be induced purely at test time, eliminating the need for expensive retraining or reinforcement learning. By offering a mechanism to salvage and extend the utility of legacy or deployed non-reasoning models, the work provides a cost-effective alternative to current training-intensive methods. The findings suggest that framing reasoning as a dynamic search process is a viable strategy for accessing latent knowledge within large models, potentially influencing future developments in test-time computation and search-based AI architectures.
