## Executive Summary

Continual learning (CL) faces the dual challenge of catastrophic forgetting and the prohibitive computational cost of gradient-based backpropagation. While state-of-the-art methods rely on gradient descent, they incur high latency and memory footprints due to backward passes and data rehearsal, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge environments. This paper addresses the critical need for a computationally efficient framework that decouples the learning process from backward propagation, enabling high-performance CL without the overhead of traditional optimization.

The authors introduce **FoRo (Forward-Only Continual Learning)**, a gradient-free framework designed for frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs). FoRo replaces backpropagation with two core components: a **Lightweight Prompt Tuning Strategy** utilizing the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to optimize prompt embeddings, and a **Knowledge Encoding Mechanism** using Nonlinear Random Projection (NRP) and Recursive Least Squares (RLS) for incremental classifier updates. By combining Cross Entropy and Feature Discrepancy in a fitness function, FoRo minimizes cumulative expected risk strictly through forward propagation, preserving the pre-trained backbone while avoiding data rehearsal.

Evaluations on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet demonstrate that FoRo achieves competitive accuracy, often surpassing prompt-based baselines like L2P and DualPrompt, while maintaining lower forgetting measures. Crucially, the framework delivers substantial quantitative efficiency improvements: by eliminating the backward pass, FoRo reduces training time by approximately 50% and significantly cuts memory usage by obviating the need for gradient storage and rehearsal buffers. These results validate that plasticity and stability can be balanced effectively without gradient-based updates.

FoRo represents a paradigm shift in CL, proving that high-performance, rehearsal-free learning is achievable without backpropagation. Its mathematical foundation—using evolutionary strategies for prompt tuning and RLS for classification—provides a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for on-device AI. This work opens new avenues for deploying sophisticated continual learning on edge devices and in real-time multimedia applications where computational resources are strictly limited.

## Methodology

The paper proposes **FoRo**, a forward-only and gradient-free continual learning framework designed specifically for frozen pre-trained models. The methodology is built upon two primary pillars:

1.  **Lightweight Prompt Tuning Strategy**
    *   Replaces traditional gradient-based backpropagation with evolutionary optimization.
    *   Utilizes the **Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)** to optimize prompt embeddings, ensuring the pre-trained backbone remains frozen.

2.  **Knowledge Encoding Mechanism**
    *   Enables incremental updates to classifiers without data rehearsal.
    *   Employs **Nonlinear Random Projection** and **Recursive Least Squares** to accumulate knowledge efficiently over a sequence of tasks.

## Technical Details

The following table outlines the specific technical components and architectural decisions within the FoRo framework:

| Component | Technique/Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Optimization Paradigm** | **Forward-Only:** Eliminates error backpropagation and gradient-based updates; relies solely on forward propagation. |
| **Model Backbone** | **Frozen Vision Transformer (ViT):** The backbone parameters remain static throughout the training process. |
| **Prompt Optimization** | **CMA-ES:** Uses the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy instead of gradient descent for tuning prompts. |
| **Knowledge Encoding** | **Historical Statistics:** Encodes knowledge using the mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$) of features. |
| **Classification Head** | **Least Squares:** Utilizes a Least Squares mechanism optimized by a fitness function combining Cross Entropy and Feature Discrepancy. |
| **Feature Processing** | Extracts the `[CLS]` token embedding and utilizes **Neural Random Projection (NRP)**. |
| **Objective** | Mathematical goal is to minimize the cumulative expected risk across a sequence of tasks. |
