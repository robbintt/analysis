## 📝 Executive Summary

### **Problem**
As deep learning models grow in size, compression techniques such as sparsity and quantization have become essential for efficient deployment. However, the field lacks a unified theoretical framework to predict how these diverse compression methods impact model performance. Currently, evaluating the efficiency of different compressed representations relies heavily on expensive, iterative experimentation. This paper addresses the need for a generalized scaling law that can accurately forecast model behavior across a wide spectrum of compression formats, removing the need for resource-intensive trial-and-error in model selection.

### **Innovation**
The core innovation is the introduction of a unified scaling law formulation that integrates a novel "capacity" metric, denoted as $\rho(R)$. Technically, this metric is derived by measuring a representation's ability to fit random Gaussian data (GMSE), which serves as a robust proxy for the parameter efficiency of the compressed format. The proposed scaling law is formulated as $Loss(N, D) \sim A \cdot (N \cdot \rho(R))^{-\alpha} + B \cdot D^{-\beta} + E$, where $N$ is parameter count and $D$ is data size. Crucially, the authors demonstrate that this capacity metric is multiplicative; when compression formats are combined (e.g., sparsity plus quantization), the total capacity is the product of individual capacities ($\rho(R_{combined}) = \rho(R_1) \cdot \rho(R_2)$). This property allows the framework to scale composably.

### **Results**
The proposed unified scaling law demonstrates high precision, achieving fit errors of $4.7 \times 10^{-4}$ for sparsity and $2.1 \times 10^{-3}$ for quantization, which is comparable to or better than prior specialized laws. Experimental validation confirmed the multiplicative property of capacity with approximation errors generally around $10^{-2}$. Additionally, the framework successfully predicted algorithmic optimality, showing that Quantization-Aware Training runs align with noise injection predictions and that the QuEST algorithm operates near the information-theoretic lower bound. The analysis also revealed that backward pruning heuristics generally outperform magnitude pruning baselines.

### **Impact**
This research provides a significant theoretical advancement by offering a standardized, low-cost method to compare the inherent accuracy potential of disparate compressed representations. By establishing that scaling laws govern compressed models both individually and compositionally, the authors enable the derivation of optimized training algorithms for complex formats, such as sparse-quantized models. The ability to predict performance via a simple capacity metric allows practitioners to make more informed architectural decisions, ultimately reducing the computational overhead associated with training and deploying state-of-the-art compressed networks.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The paper proposes a unified scaling law and a novel method for calculating representation capacity.

**The Scaling Law Formula:**
`Loss(N, D) ~ A * (N * ρ(R))^-α + B * D^-β + E`

**Capacity Metric:**
The capacity term `ρ(R)` is derived from the representation's ability to fit random Gaussian data (GMSE(R)). It is modeled via the parametric function:
`e^ρ(GMSE(R)) = L * tanh(F * log_{1/4}(GMSE(R)))^C`

**Optimization & Composition:**
*   **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer with the Straight-Through Estimator (STE).
*   **Composability:** Representation capacity is multiplicative across different compression types:
    `ρ(R_combined) = ρ(R_1) * ρ(R_2)`
