# Cueless EEG imagined speech for subject identification: dataset and benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.09700
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09700
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: EEG Conformer achieves 97.93% accuracy for subject identification from cueless EEG imagined speech

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a cueless EEG imagined speech paradigm for subject identification, addressing the limitations of prior methods that rely on external visual or auditory cues. The dataset includes over 4,350 trials from 11 subjects across five sessions, where participants naturally select and imagine pronunciation of predefined words without cues. A session-based hold-out validation strategy ensures robust evaluation. The study evaluates traditional machine learning methods (SVM, XGBoost) and deep learning architectures (EEGNet, Shallow ConvNet, EEG Conformer) for subject identification. The EEG Conformer achieves the highest accuracy of 97.93%, demonstrating the potential of cueless EEG paradigms for secure and reliable subject identification in real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The study collected EEG data from 11 subjects performing cueless imagined speech tasks across five sessions on the same day. Subjects naturally selected and imagined pronunciation of five Persian words without external cues. The data was preprocessed with notch filtering, bandpass filtering, bad channel detection/interpolation, and re-referencing. Multiple machine learning approaches were evaluated including traditional methods (SVM, XGBoost with statistical and wavelet features) and deep learning architectures (EEGNet, Shallow ConvNet, EEG Conformer). A session-based hold-out validation strategy was employed where sessions 1-3 were used for training, session 4 for validation, and session 5 for testing. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using Optuna.

## Key Results
- EEG Conformer achieves the highest accuracy of 97.93% for subject identification
- Wavelet-based features outperform statistical features (94.17% vs 84.40% with SVM)
- Shallow ConvNet provides stable performance with limited data (96.43%) compared to EEG Conformer
- Session-based hold-out validation prevents data leakage and ensures temporal generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Removing external cues reveals more stable subject-specific neural signatures for identification.
- Mechanism: Without visual/auditory cues, subjects must internally select and prepare imagined speech, engaging motor imagery and semantic access pathways that vary consistently across individuals. The cueless design forces reliance on endogenous neural patterns rather than cue-evoked responses.
- Core assumption: Subject-specific neural signatures persist across imagined speech trials independent of external triggers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "subjects imagine the pronunciation of semantically meaningful words without any external cues... requiring subjects to select and imagine words from a predefined list naturally"
  - [section III]: "This approach ensures that the imagined speech process is more aligned with real-world scenarios"
  - [corpus]: Related work (Transfer Learning for Covert Speech) notes imagined speech decoding faces onset identification challenges—cueless paradigm may shift this burden to endogenous preparation.
- Break condition: If neural patterns are primarily driven by cue processing rather than speech imagery itself, cueless conditions would reduce discriminability.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Session-based holdout validation captures temporal stability and prevents inflated estimates from session-specific artifacts.
- Mechanism: By training on sessions 1-3, validating on session 4, and testing on session 5, models must learn features that generalize across time gaps. This filters out same-session noise correlations and tests genuine biometric persistence.
- Core assumption: Individual EEG signatures for imagined speech have stable characteristics across sessions within a single day.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A session-based hold-out validation strategy was employed to ensure reliable evaluation and prevent data leakage"
  - [section V]: "This procedure ensures better robustness over time variations and improves the model's generalization ability"
  - [corpus]: Neighbors on cross-subject generalization (MultiDiffNet, Subject-Independent Imagined Speech) highlight variability challenges; this design tests intra-subject temporal stability instead.
- Break condition: If training sessions lack sufficient diversity or if session 5 differs systematically (e.g., fatigue effects), test accuracy would underestimate true generalization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hybrid convolution-transformer architectures integrate local spectral-spatial features with long-range temporal dependencies.
- Mechanism: Convolution layers extract time-localized frequency and spatial patterns across electrodes; self-attention then models global correlations across the trial. This may capture both articulation-related dynamics and sustained individual neural signatures.
- Core assumption: Subject identity is encoded in both fine-grained temporal dynamics and longer-range sequential dependencies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV.B]: "EEG Conformer incorporates a self-attention module that enables the model to capture long-range dependencies"
  - [Table 6]: EEG Conformer achieves 97.93% vs. Shallow ConvNet 96.43% and EEGNet 75.56%
  - [corpus]: Transformer-based speech decoding (Decoding EEG Speech Perception with Transformers) supports attention mechanisms for EEG temporal modeling.
- Break condition: If discriminative features are purely local, the transformer overhead provides no benefit; conversely, with limited training data, transformer complexity may overfit (Figure 4 shows EEG Conformer degrades more with fewer sessions).

## Foundational Learning

### EEG Signal Properties
- Why needed here: The preprocessing pipeline (notch filter, bandpass, bad channel detection, re-referencing) targets specific EEG characteristics; understanding these guides design choices.
- Quick check question: Why does EEG have poor spatial resolution but high temporal resolution compared to fMRI?

### Session-Based vs. K-Fold Cross-Validation
- Why needed here: This paper deliberately avoids k-fold to prevent data leakage; understanding why is critical for valid biometric evaluation.
- Quick check question: What specific problem does shuffling trials across sessions cause in EEG biometric studies?

### Time-Frequency Representations
- Why needed here: Wavelet-based features outperform statistical features (94.17% vs. 84.40%); wavelets capture both spectral and temporal dynamics relevant to imagined speech.
- Quick check question: Why might wavelet energy be more discriminative than simple statistical moments (mean, variance) for EEG?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Input (30-channel EEG, 250Hz, 2-second trials) → Preprocessing (notch, bandpass, bad channel detection, re-referencing) → Feature extraction (statistical, wavelet, MOMENT embeddings) → Classification (SVM, XGBoost, EEGNet, Shallow ConvNet, EEG Conformer)

### Critical path:
1. Data loading and epoching (2-second imagination window)
2. Preprocessing pipeline (automated via MNE/pyprep)
3. Model selection (start with Shallow ConvNet for data efficiency, scale to EEG Conformer if data permits)
4. Hyperparameter tuning (Optuna on validation set)
5. Session-based evaluation

### Design tradeoffs:
- Shallow ConvNet: More stable with limited data, faster training, slightly lower peak accuracy (96.43%)
- EEG Conformer: Higher capacity, achieves best accuracy (97.93%) but degrades with fewer sessions
- Manual features + SVM: Interpretable, competitive with wavelet features (94.17%), but requires domain expertise

### Failure signatures:
- Poor test accuracy despite high validation accuracy → session-specific overfitting; increase regularization or reduce model complexity
- Large gap between Shallow ConvNet and EEG Conformer → insufficient data for transformer; use Shallow ConvNet or collect more sessions
- MOMENT embeddings underperforming manual features → pre-training domain mismatch; consider fine-tuning or domain-specific pre-training
- Subject confusion matrix shows specific pair confusions → investigate electrode coverage or feature separability for those subjects

### First 3 experiments:
1. Baseline reproduction: Run Shallow ConvNet on preprocessed data with session-based split (train: 1-3, val: 4, test: 5) to establish baseline near reported 96.43%.
2. Ablation on session count: Train on 1, 2, and 3 sessions respectively to replicate Figure 4 degradation patterns and understand data efficiency tradeoffs.
3. Feature comparison: Compare wavelet-based SVM vs. MOMENT-small embeddings vs. end-to-end EEG Conformer to validate the reported performance hierarchy and select the best approach for your constraints.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does the high classification accuracy of cueless imagined speech persist when training and testing sessions are separated by days or weeks rather than being restricted to a single day?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors note that data was collected in "five sessions on the same day," which addresses short-term intra-subject variance but leaves long-term non-stationarity in EEG signals unexplored.
- **Why unresolved:** Biometric systems require stability over long periods; high accuracy within a single day does not guarantee robustness against the long-term signal drift known to occur in EEG.
- **Evidence to resolve it:** A longitudinal study benchmarking the EEG Conformer or Shallow ConvNet on data collected from the same subjects over multiple weeks or months.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does the performance of the cueless paradigm degrade as the number of subjects scales up to sizes typical of commercial biometric systems?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The study validates the paradigm on a small cohort of 11 subjects (labeled Sub-01 to Sub-11), whereas real-world applications would require discriminating among significantly larger populations.
- **Why unresolved:** Multiclass classification problems generally become more difficult as the number of classes increases; it is unclear if the learned features are sufficiently distinct to separate hundreds or thousands of individuals.
- **Evidence to resolve it:** Benchmarking the proposed models on a dataset with a substantially larger subject pool (e.g., N > 100) to observe the accuracy scaling curve.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the cueless imagined speech models generalize to an "open-set" authentication scenario where the system must reject subjects not present in the training set?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper explicitly distinguishes between "subject identification" (multiclass) and "subject authentication" (binary) in the Introduction, but the experiments only evaluate the closed-set identification task.
- **Why unresolved:** Practical security systems must verify a claimed identity or reject impostors; the current 97.93% accuracy only proves the model can select the correct label from a known list of 11 options.
- **Evidence to resolve it:** Evaluating the models using metrics like Equal Error Rate (EER) in a scenario where the test set includes data from subjects completely excluded from the training phase.

## Limitations
- Single-day data collection limits assessment of long-term biometric stability across weeks or months
- Small subject pool (11 subjects) may not reflect performance in larger-scale commercial biometric systems
- Closed-set identification only; no evaluation of open-set authentication or rejection of unknown subjects

## Confidence

- High confidence: Session-based hold-out validation prevents data leakage (supported by explicit methodology and neighbor literature on cross-subject variability)
- Medium confidence: Cueless paradigm reveals more stable neural signatures (mechanism is plausible but direct comparison to cued conditions would strengthen claim)
- Medium confidence: EEG Conformer architecture superiority (results show improvement but limited to this specific dataset and task)
- Low confidence: Generalization to other word sets and longer temporal scales (no external validation or multi-day testing)

## Next Checks

1. Test temporal generalization by holding out not just sessions but entire days or weeks to assess biometric persistence over extended periods
2. Compare cueless vs. cued paradigms on the same subjects to directly validate the claim about endogenous neural signature stability
3. Evaluate model performance on out-of-distribution word sets or languages to test ecological validity beyond the predefined Persian words
