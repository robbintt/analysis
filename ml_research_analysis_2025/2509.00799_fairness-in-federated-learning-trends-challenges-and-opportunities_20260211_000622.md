# Fairness in Federated Learning: Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.00799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00799
- Reference count: 40
- Comprehensive survey examining fairness challenges and solutions in federated learning systems

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines fairness challenges in federated learning (FL), identifying data, client, and model biases as primary sources that undermine system effectiveness. The authors categorize state-of-the-art fairness-aware algorithms into pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing approaches, providing detailed analysis of their strengths and limitations across different fairness notions. The survey explores multidisciplinary FL applications across edge computing, healthcare, industrial IoT, intelligent transportation systems, and wireless networks, highlighting the integration challenges of fairness in these domains.

The survey evaluates current fairness metrics including Statistical Parity Difference, Equal Opportunity Difference, and Jain's Fairness Index for quantitative assessment of FL systems. It identifies critical open research directions focusing on balancing fairness with accuracy, privacy, utility, and model generalization while addressing algorithmic disparities and standardizing fairness benchmarking frameworks. The comprehensive analysis provides researchers and practitioners with a structured understanding of fairness challenges and potential solutions in federated learning environments.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review methodology, analyzing 40 references across federated learning fairness research. The authors categorize fairness-aware algorithms into three main approaches: pre-processing (data transformation before model training), in-processing (algorithmic modifications during training), and post-processing (adjustment of model outputs). They evaluate fairness metrics and examine multidisciplinary applications, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding fairness challenges in FL. The analysis identifies bias sources, algorithmic disparities, and open research directions while considering the trade-offs between fairness, privacy, and utility in federated learning systems.

## Key Results
- Systematic categorization of fairness-aware algorithms into pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing approaches with detailed analysis of their effectiveness
- Identification of three primary bias sources (data, client, model) that undermine FL system effectiveness and fairness
- Evaluation of current fairness metrics (Statistical Parity Difference, Equal Opportunity Difference, Jain's Fairness Index) for quantitative assessment in heterogeneous FL environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive systematic approach to categorizing fairness challenges and solutions in federated learning. By identifying specific bias sources and organizing fairness-aware algorithms into clear methodological categories, the framework provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners. The multidisciplinary application analysis reveals how fairness challenges manifest differently across domains, while the evaluation of fairness metrics offers practical guidance for quantitative assessment. The identification of trade-offs between fairness, privacy, and utility helps practitioners make informed decisions when implementing fair FL systems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Data Heterogeneity in FL**: Why needed - Understanding how non-IID data distribution across clients creates fairness challenges; Quick check - Verify client data distributions are statistically similar
- **Fairness Notions (Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity)**: Why needed - Different fairness definitions require different algorithmic approaches; Quick check - Test model outputs against multiple fairness metrics
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques (Differential Privacy, Secure Aggregation)**: Why needed - Fairness interventions must not compromise FL's privacy guarantees; Quick check - Measure privacy-utility-fairness trade-offs empirically
- **Statistical Parity Difference**: Why needed - Quantifies demographic group representation disparities; Quick check - Calculate SPD between sensitive attribute groups
- **Equal Opportunity Difference**: Why needed - Measures true positive rate disparities across groups; Quick check - Compare TPR for different demographic groups
- **Jain's Fairness Index**: Why needed - Provides normalized fairness measure for resource allocation; Quick check - Calculate index values between 0 and 1 for resource distribution

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Collection -> Bias Detection -> Fairness Algorithm Selection -> Model Training -> Fairness Evaluation -> System Deployment

**Critical Path**: Data Collection -> Bias Detection -> Fairness Algorithm Selection -> Model Training -> Fairness Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The survey highlights critical tradeoffs between fairness and accuracy (improving fairness may reduce overall model performance), privacy and utility (fairness interventions must preserve data privacy), and computational overhead versus fairness gains (more complex fairness algorithms require additional resources).

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Persistent performance gaps across demographic groups despite fairness interventions
- Privacy violations when attempting to correct data or client biases
- System instability when implementing post-processing adjustments on streaming FL data
- Reduced model accuracy beyond acceptable thresholds when enforcing fairness constraints

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Implement pre-processing bias correction on synthetic non-IID data to verify demographic parity improvements
2. Apply in-processing fairness constraints during FL training to measure Equal Opportunity Difference reduction
3. Test post-processing output adjustment on a federated healthcare dataset to evaluate fairness-accuracy trade-offs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several critical open research directions: how to balance fairness with accuracy, privacy, utility, and model generalization in federated learning systems; addressing algorithmic disparities that emerge from heterogeneous client populations; developing standardized fairness benchmarking frameworks for FL; understanding the impact of dynamic client participation on fairness guarantees; creating adaptive fairness mechanisms that respond to changing data distributions; and investigating the relationship between fairness in FL and broader ethical considerations in AI systems.

## Limitations
- Empirical validation of fairness metrics and algorithms across diverse real-world FL scenarios remains limited
- Assumes availability of ground truth labels and reliable statistical measures, which may not hold in privacy-constrained FL deployments
- Proposed open research directions lack empirical validation and may face practical implementation challenges in heterogeneous federated environments

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical studies comparing fairness metrics' effectiveness across heterogeneous FL environments with varying privacy requirements and data distributions
