# LAVQA: A Latency-Aware Visual Question Answering Framework for Shared Autonomy in Self-Driving Vehicles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11840
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11840
- Reference count: 0
- Proposed latency-aware VQA framework reduces collision rates by up to 8.98x in simulated driving scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LA VQA, a shared autonomy framework that integrates Visual Question Answering with spatiotemporal risk visualization to address decision-making under network latency in autonomous driving. The core innovation is the Latency-Induced Collision Map (LICOM), which dynamically represents collision risk evolution with response delay, enabling remote operators to make spatially and temporally informed decisions. Evaluated in CARLA closed-loop simulation across three traffic scenarios, LA VQA demonstrated significant improvements in driving safety compared to latency-agnostic baselines.

## Method Summary
The framework augments VQA queries with visual overlays of time-varying safe regions derived from motion prediction and collision probability estimation. The Latency-Induced Collision Map (LICOM) serves as the core component, dynamically representing how collision risk evolves with network response delay. This spatiotemporal risk visualization enables remote operators to understand both where and when collisions might occur based on current latency conditions. The system was evaluated in three driving scenarios (merge, right turn, left turn) within the CARLA simulation environment, comparing performance against a baseline without latency awareness.

## Key Results
- LA VQA reduced collision rates by up to 8.98x compared to latency-agnostic baseline
- Most significant improvements observed at lower latencies (200ms)
- Demonstrated effectiveness across three distinct traffic scenarios in CARLA simulation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework addresses a critical gap in shared autonomy systems where network latency creates uncertainty in remote operator decision-making. By explicitly visualizing how collision risk evolves with latency through LICOM, operators can make informed decisions that account for both spatial and temporal dimensions of risk. This transforms abstract latency metrics into actionable visual information, enabling operators to understand not just where risks exist but when they will materialize based on response delays.

## Foundational Learning
- Latency-induced collision mapping: Represents how response delays translate to collision probabilities over space and time; needed to convert abstract latency into actionable risk information
- Spatiotemporal risk visualization: Combines spatial (where) and temporal (when) risk dimensions into unified visual overlays; needed because operators must understand both dimensions simultaneously
- Motion prediction integration: Uses vehicle trajectory forecasting to anticipate future states; needed to estimate collision likelihood before events occur
- Closed-loop simulation validation: Tests system performance in realistic driving scenarios with feedback loops; needed to capture dynamic interactions between decisions and outcomes
- Shared autonomy operator interface: Designs information presentation for remote human-in-the-loop control; needed to ensure operators can effectively interpret and act on risk information

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Operator Input -> VQA Processing -> LICOM Generation -> Risk Visualization -> Operator Decision

Critical Path:
1. Operator inputs question through interface
2. VQA system processes visual scene and generates semantic understanding
3. Motion prediction and collision probability estimation creates LICOM
4. Risk visualization overlays are generated and displayed
5. Operator makes decision based on augmented visual information

Design Tradeoffs:
- Visual complexity vs. cognitive load: More detailed risk information provides better decision support but may overwhelm operators
- Prediction horizon vs. accuracy: Longer prediction horizons capture more future risk but increase uncertainty
- Update frequency vs. network bandwidth: More frequent updates improve responsiveness but consume more bandwidth
- Static vs. dynamic risk thresholds: Fixed thresholds are simpler but may not adapt well to varying traffic conditions

Failure Signatures:
- Overconfident risk predictions leading to false security in high-latency conditions
- Operator information overload causing delayed responses
- Misalignment between visual overlays and actual risk due to prediction errors
- Latency underestimation resulting in insufficient safety margins

First 3 Experiments:
1. Baseline comparison: Run identical scenarios with and without LICOM visualization to isolate its impact
2. Latency sweep: Test across multiple latency values (50ms to 1000ms) to identify performance boundaries
3. Operator study: Compare decision quality and response times between novice and experienced operators using the system

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Simulation-based evaluation may not capture real-world traffic complexity and human behavioral variability
- Single driving scenario per experiment limits external validity of findings
- Predefined motion models may not generalize to highly dynamic or non-compliant traffic participants
- Framework effectiveness at higher latencies (500ms+) not robustly demonstrated

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical implementation of LICOM and VQA-latency integration logic
- Medium confidence in quantitative collision rate improvements due to simulation dependency
- Low confidence in subjective metrics about operator workload and usability

## Next Checks
1. Real-world pilot testing with human operators in mixed traffic conditions to validate simulation findings
2. Ablation studies isolating the impact of LICOM visualization versus baseline VQA without risk overlays
3. Stress testing the framework under extreme latency conditions (1000ms+) and network disruptions to assess robustness boundaries
