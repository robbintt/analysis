core_contribution: The authors introduce the Stored Household Item Challenge, a new
  benchmark for evaluating commonsense reasoning about hidden household objects. Given
  a kitchen scene and an item name, models must predict the most likely storage container
  (e.g., drawer or cabinet) where the item is stored, despite being out of view.

# Break Out the Silverware -- Semantic Understanding of Stored Household Items

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23739
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23739
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: NOAM model achieves 23% accuracy on hidden household object storage prediction, outperforming baselines and approaching human performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Stored Household Item Challenge, a benchmark for evaluating commonsense reasoning about hidden household objects. The task requires predicting where a household item is stored based on visual scene context and item name. The authors propose NOAM (Non-visible Object Allocation Model), which converts visual descriptions into text prompts for LLMs, achieving 23% accuracy on real-world evaluation data compared to baseline models.

## Method Summary
The approach involves converting kitchen scene images into structured text descriptions that capture visible storage containers and their contents. These descriptions are combined with item names to create prompts for large language models. The system ranks potential storage locations based on LLM responses, addressing the challenge of reasoning about objects not directly visible in the scene.

## Key Results
- NOAM achieves 23% accuracy on the 100-pair real-world evaluation set
- Outperforms Grounding-DINO (13%), Kosmos-2 (4%), and Gemini (3%)
- Demonstrates the importance of structured text-based reasoning for commonsense visual inference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging LLMs' ability to reason about everyday commonsense knowledge through structured natural language prompts. By converting visual scenes into detailed textual descriptions, the system taps into LLMs' understanding of typical household organization patterns and object relationships.

## Foundational Learning
- Kitchen layout semantics: Understanding typical kitchen organization patterns
- - Why needed: Provides context for plausible storage locations
- - Quick check: Does the model know that knives are typically stored in drawers near food prep areas?

- Object-container relationships: Knowledge of which items belong in which storage types
- - Why needed: Core reasoning required for the task
- - Quick check: Can the model distinguish between items stored in drawers vs. cabinets?

- Visual-to-text conversion: Translating scene information into structured descriptions
- - Why needed: Enables LLM reasoning on visual data
- - Quick check: Does the text capture all relevant storage containers and their visible contents?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Image -> Visual Description -> Text Prompt -> LLM Ranking -> Storage Location

**Critical Path:** Visual scene analysis → Structured text generation → LLM inference → Ranking → Output prediction

**Design Tradeoffs:** Text-based reasoning vs. direct visual reasoning, structured descriptions vs. raw image input, LLM reliance vs. learned models

**Failure Signatures:** Incorrect visual descriptions leading to wrong prompts, LLM biases affecting commonsense reasoning, missing relevant storage containers in text conversion

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare accuracy when providing full visual descriptions vs. partial descriptions
2. Test different LLM models and prompt structures
3. Evaluate performance on synthetic vs. real kitchen scenes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Small evaluation set size (100 pairs) limits statistical power
- 23% accuracy still indicates significant room for improvement
- Reliance on LLM-based reasoning introduces potential biases from training data

## Confidence
The methodology is sound but limited evaluation size and low absolute performance reduce confidence.

## Next Checks
1. Expand the real-world evaluation set to at least 500 pairs and test on multiple households to assess robustness and generalizability
2. Conduct human baseline experiments to quantify the gap between model and human performance on the same tasks
3. Systematically evaluate the impact of the visual-to-text conversion step by comparing direct visual reasoning approaches with the proposed text-based method on a subset of the data
