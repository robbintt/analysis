# Data Augmentation Techniques for Chinese Disease Name Normalization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.01195
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01195
- Reference count: 15
- The paper proposes DDA, achieving up to 80% of full fine-tuning performance without training data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of disease name normalization in Chinese clinical text, where the same disease can be expressed in numerous ways. The core problem is a severe shortage of training data, particularly for rare or unseen diseases. To tackle this, the authors propose a novel data augmentation approach called Disease Data Augmentation (DDA) that combines axis-word replacement and multi-granularity aggregation strategies to generate high-quality synthetic training examples.

The DDA approach significantly improves performance on the CHIP-CDN dataset, achieving up to 80% of full fine-tuning performance even without any training data. The method outperforms baseline models and general augmentation techniques across multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing data scarcity challenges in Chinese medical text normalization.

## Method Summary
The authors propose Disease Data Augmentation (DDA), a two-pronged approach to address data scarcity in Chinese disease name normalization. The first component, Axis-word Replacement (AR), exploits the structural invariance of disease names by identifying and replacing axis words (disease center, anatomical region, or disease characteristic) with similar words. The second component, Multi-Granularity Aggregation (MGA), leverages the hierarchical structure of the ICD system to create additional training pairs by aggregating diseases at different granularity levels. The augmented data undergoes semantic similarity filtering to maintain quality, using cosine similarity with embeddings from a pre-trained Chinese clinical language model.

## Key Results
- DDA achieves up to 80% of full fine-tuning performance without any training data
- Outperforms all other augmentation approaches across multiple metrics on the CHIP-CDN dataset
- Significant improvements observed especially when training data is limited

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DDA works by addressing the fundamental challenge of data scarcity in Chinese disease name normalization. The axis-word replacement strategy exploits the consistent structural patterns in disease names, allowing the model to learn from semantically similar variations. The multi-granularity aggregation leverages the hierarchical nature of medical classification systems to create meaningful training pairs at different levels of specificity. Together, these strategies generate diverse, high-quality synthetic examples that capture the variability in disease name expressions while maintaining semantic consistency.

## Foundational Learning
- Disease Name Normalization: The process of mapping varied expressions of the same disease to a standard form. Why needed: Clinical systems require standardized terminology for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Quick check: Verify mapping accuracy by testing synonym resolution.
- ICD Hierarchy: The International Classification of Diseases provides a structured taxonomy of diseases. Why needed: Enables systematic aggregation of related diseases at different specificity levels. Quick check: Confirm hierarchy depth and branching factor.
- Semantic Similarity Filtering: Using embedding-based measures to validate augmented data quality. Why needed: Prevents generation of semantically inconsistent examples. Quick check: Measure cosine similarity distribution between original and augmented pairs.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Disease Name -> Axis-word Identification -> Axis-word Replacement -> Semantic Filtering -> Augmented Dataset
                    \-> Multi-granularity Aggregation -> Semantic Filtering -> Augmented Dataset

Critical Path: Original disease names → Axis-word identification → Replacement with similar words → Semantic similarity filtering → Final augmented dataset

Design Tradeoffs: The approach balances data diversity (through replacement and aggregation) against quality (through semantic filtering). The main tradeoff is computational cost versus augmentation quality - more aggressive filtering ensures higher quality but reduces dataset size.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance when axis-word identification fails for diseases with non-standard naming patterns, or when semantic filtering is too strict and eliminates useful variations.

First Experiments:
1. Test axis-word replacement on diseases with clear structural patterns vs. those without
2. Measure the impact of different similarity thresholds on augmentation quality
3. Compare MGA performance at different hierarchy levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly mentioned in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability to other languages or medical domains beyond Chinese clinical text
- Effectiveness may be constrained for diseases without clear structural naming patterns
- Heavy dependence on ICD hierarchy quality and pre-trained language model accuracy

## Confidence
- High: Overall improvement in disease name normalization performance using DDA on CHIP-CDN dataset
- Medium: Superiority of DDA over general augmentation techniques and baseline models
- Medium: Effectiveness of axis-word replacement and multi-granularity aggregation strategies
- Low: Generalizability to other languages, medical domains, or different ICD classification systems

## Next Checks
1. Test DDA's performance on disease name normalization tasks in other languages (e.g., English, Japanese) and different medical domains (e.g., radiology reports, pathology reports) to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of axis-word replacement and multi-granularity aggregation to overall performance improvements.
3. Evaluate the computational efficiency and resource requirements of DDA compared to baseline models, including time and memory costs for generating and filtering augmented data.
