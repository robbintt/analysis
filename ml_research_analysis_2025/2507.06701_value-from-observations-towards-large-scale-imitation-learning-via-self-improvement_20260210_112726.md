# Value from Observations: Towards Large-Scale Imitation Learning via Self-Improvement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06701
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06701
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves 50-100% of oracle offline RL performance using only observation data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of imitation learning from observation (IfO) in large-scale settings where agents must learn from expert demonstrations without action labels and non-expert background data. The proposed Value from Observation (VfO) method adapts offline reinforcement learning techniques to the IfO setting by learning a state-value function that can distinguish between expert and background data. By leveraging either binary rewards or discriminator-based rewards, VfO enables agents to iteratively improve their policies using only observation data, achieving performance close to oracle offline RL algorithms across various tasks.

## Method Summary
The Value from Observation (VfO) method addresses imitation learning from observation by learning a state-value function that can distinguish between expert demonstrations and background data. The approach uses offline reinforcement learning techniques adapted to the IfO setting, where the agent has access to expert demonstrations without action labels and additional non-expert data. The method employs either a simple binary reward scheme (1 for expert, 0 for background) or a more sophisticated discriminator-based reward to transfer knowledge from expert demonstrations to background data. This enables the agent to learn which states are valuable without requiring expert action annotations.

## Key Results
- VfO achieves 50-100% of oracle offline RL algorithm (AWR) performance across various tasks
- The method successfully learns from observations alone, demonstrating effective policy improvement
- VfO performs well across the full spectrum of background data quality in the Self-Improvement Benchmark (SIBench)
- Experimental results show strong correlation between VfO performance and iterative self-improvement capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the value function's ability to distinguish between good and bad states, effectively transferring expert knowledge to background data without requiring action labels. The binary or discriminator-based rewards provide a signal that guides learning toward expert-like behavior, while the offline RL framework ensures stable learning from the combined dataset.

## Foundational Learning
- **Imitation Learning from Observation (IfO)**: Learning from expert demonstrations without action labels - needed because real-world expert data often lacks action annotations; quick check: verify the expert dataset contains only states and rewards
- **Offline Reinforcement Learning**: Learning from fixed datasets without environment interaction - needed to handle large-scale pre-collected data; quick check: confirm the algorithm doesn't require online environment interactions
- **State-Value Function**: Estimating expected return from each state - needed to distinguish valuable states from non-valuable ones; quick check: verify the value function converges during training
- **Discriminator-Based Rewards**: Using learned models to generate rewards - needed for more nuanced state similarity assessment; quick check: ensure discriminator loss decreases during training
- **Self-Improvement Benchmark (SIBench)**: Evaluation framework for iterative improvement - needed to test long-term learning capabilities; quick check: verify benchmark distributions are properly separated

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Expert Demonstrations -> State Encoder -> Value Function -> Policy Network -> Environment
Background Data -> State Encoder -> Value Function -> Policy Network -> Environment
Discriminator (optional) -> Reward Generator -> Value Function -> Policy Network

**Critical Path:**
Expert data → state encoding → value function learning → policy improvement → background data evaluation → iterative refinement

**Design Tradeoffs:**
Binary rewards vs. discriminator-based rewards: simplicity and stability vs. more nuanced state similarity assessment

**Failure Signatures:**
- Value function fails to distinguish expert from background states
- Policy overfits to expert demonstrations without generalizing
- Discriminator collapse in reward generation mode

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify value function can distinguish between expert and background states in a simple task
2. Test policy improvement using only binary rewards before adding discriminator
3. Evaluate performance degradation when background data quality decreases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance gap compared to oracle offline RL with action labels (50-100% of AWR's performance)
- Evaluation relies on synthetic background data distributions that may not capture real-world complexity
- Binary reward formulation may oversimplify nuanced quality differences in real demonstrations
- Limited evaluation of long-term learning dynamics in iterative self-improvement experiments

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- The core technical contribution of adapting offline RL to IfO settings is sound and well-supported by experimental results

**Medium confidence:**
- The performance claims across different background data qualities are reliable, but real-world generalization remains uncertain
- The Self-Improvement Benchmark's representativeness for real-world scenarios, though it represents a meaningful advancement over existing benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Test VfO on real-world datasets with naturally occurring background data to evaluate robustness beyond synthetic distributions
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing binary vs. discriminator-based rewards across different task complexities and data quality levels
3. Implement extended iterative self-improvement experiments (10+ iterations) to assess long-term learning stability and convergence properties
