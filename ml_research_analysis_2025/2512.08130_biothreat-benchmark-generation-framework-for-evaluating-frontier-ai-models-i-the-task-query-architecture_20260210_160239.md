# Biothreat Benchmark Generation Framework for Evaluating Frontier AI Models I: The Task-Query Architecture

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08130
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08130
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Hierarchical framework mapping biothreat tasks to queries for AI uplift measurement

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a hierarchical Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework to evaluate biosecurity risks from AI models. The framework addresses gaps in existing benchmarks by mapping real-world biothreat tasks and queries across different adversary capabilities and operational-technical domains. It was piloted for bacterial threats, resulting in a Bacterial Biothreat Schema with 9 categories, 27 elements, 117 tasks, and 1,361 refined queries. The structure enables multi-dimensional risk assessment, better alignment with actual threat pathways, and differentiation of AI uplift across actor types.

## Method Summary
The framework was developed through SME collaboration (10 biosecurity experts) to create a schema of 9 Categories and 27 Elements, followed by identification of 117 Tasks with metadata tags. Mixed SME and non-SME teams generated 2,991 initial queries, which were filtered down to 1,361 by removing easily answerable items, duplicates, and non-bioattack-specific queries. The hierarchical structure (Categories → Elements → Tasks → Queries → Prompts) enables traceable risk aggregation and multi-level evaluation.

## Key Results
- Created Bacterial Biothreat Schema: 9 Categories, 27 Elements, 117 Tasks, 1,361 refined queries
- Framework addresses AI uplift measurement by filtering queries answerable via traditional search
- Mixed SME/non-SME query generation captures differential adversary capability patterns
- Hierarchical architecture enables aggregation and prioritization of highest-risk components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Task-Query Architecture Enables Traceable Risk Aggregation
Structuring benchmarks hierarchically allows evaluators to trace model performance back to specific threat pathway components and aggregate results at multiple levels. Each query is explicitly mapped to a task, element, and category, creating a proto-ontology that identifies where along the threat chain uplift occurs.

### Mechanism 2: Non-SME Inclusion Captures Low-Capability Adversary Query Patterns
Including non-experts in query generation better emulates the questions low-capability adversaries would ask, who may benefit most from AI uplift. Low-capability actors lack technical expertise and would ask different questions than experts.

### Mechanism 3: Uplift Filtering via Traditional Search Baseline
Queries easily answerable with traditional search tools are removed, ensuring remaining queries measure AI-specific uplift rather than baseline information accessibility. This filtering identifies capabilities beyond traditional search tools.

## Foundational Learning

- **AI "Uplift" in Risk Assessment**: Why needed here: The framework measures incremental capability gain an AI model provides over existing information tools, not absolute knowledge. Quick check: If an AI accurately answers a bioweapon-related question also easily found via Google, does this represent meaningful uplift?

- **Dual-Use Information Problem**: Why needed here: Biological knowledge is inherently dual-use; the same information can serve benign research or malicious purposes. This complicates benchmark design. Quick check: How would you design a benchmark that distinguishes malicious intent when queries are structurally identical to legitimate research questions?

- **Multicollinearity in Benchmark Design**: Why needed here: Disparate question sets may have latent factors driving many prompts. Without task-aligned design, model improvements on a single underlying capability can artificially inflate scores. Quick check: Why might improving a model's score on 20 different biosecurity questions actually reflect improvement on just one underlying capability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Categories (9) → Elements (27) → Tasks (117) → Queries (1,361) → Prompts (TBD) → Bioweapon Determination through OPSEC

- Critical path:
  1. Schema generation with SME validation
  2. Task identification with metadata tagging
  3. Query generation by mixed SME/non-SME teams
  4. Filtering for non-AI-answerable queries
  5. [Future] Prompt generation via incentive-based process
  6. [Future] Diagnosticity assessment and benchmark implementation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Comprehensiveness vs. information hazard: Detailed task lists could serve as attack blueprints
  - Stability vs. adaptability: Tasks designed for ~5-year relevance trade immediate precision for longevity
  - SME depth vs. adversary realism: Pure SME input may miss low-capability actor question patterns

- Failure signatures:
  - High query counts but low diagnosticity
  - Schema becomes obsolete rapidly
  - Multicollinearity persists despite hierarchical design
  - Non-SME queries don't reflect actual adversary behavior

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline search validation: Test random sample of filtered queries with traditional search tools
  2. Inter-rater reliability on task-to-category mapping: Have independent experts map queries back to tasks
  3. Pilot uplift measurement: Run subset of queries through frontier models and compare to search baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What empirical metrics and validation procedures will determine whether a generated prompt has sufficient "diagnosticity" to serve as a valid benchmark? The paper states that "follow-on efforts" will address "metrics for determining the diagnosticity of these prompts for use as benchmarks," but these are not yet developed.

### Open Question 2
How can the framework be validated to confirm that SME-generated queries accurately reflect the information-seeking behavior of actual biological adversaries? The authors acknowledge that no experts involved have executed actual biological weapons attacks, creating reliance on "proxy knowledge."

### Open Question 3
To what extent does the Bacterial Biothreat Schema generalize to other biological threat categories such as viruses, toxins, or protozoa? The paper notes the current framework is focused on bacterial pathogens but expansion to other threats is envisaged.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends heavily on accuracy of threat pathway decomposition
- Representativeness of non-SME participants for actual adversary behavior remains uncertain
- Withheld Categories 6-9 details prevent independent assessment of complete threat model

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Hierarchical architecture design principles and their theoretical value for traceability and aggregation
- **Medium Confidence**: Query filtering methodology for identifying AI-unique uplift
- **Low Confidence**: Representativeness of non-SME participants for actual adversary behavior and completeness of 117-task schema

## Next Checks
1. Conduct independent expert review of the full 117-task schema to assess completeness and accuracy
2. Validate the query filtering process by having independent teams attempt to answer filtered queries using only traditional search tools
3. Pilot the complete framework with multiple frontier models to measure actual uplift differentials across capability levels
