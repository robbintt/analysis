# Temporal Causal-based Simulation for Realistic Time-series Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.02084
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02084
- Reference count: 19
- Introduces TCS framework achieving AUC scores around 0.85 on real data and 0.75 on synthetic data for time-series generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Temporal Causal-based Simulation (TCS), a novel framework for generating realistic time-series data with corresponding temporal causal graphs. The method estimates lagged causal structure, functional dependencies, and noise distributions in three phases, using Min-max optimization with AutoML techniques to select optimal causal models. TCS was evaluated against state-of-the-art methods like CausalTime using optimized Classifier 2-Sample Tests and MMD metrics, demonstrating competitive performance while highlighting the ongoing challenges in realistic causal time-series generation.

## Method Summary
TCS operates through a three-phase approach: first estimating lagged causal structure between time-series variables, then modeling functional dependencies, and finally characterizing noise distributions. The framework employs Min-max optimization combined with AutoML techniques to automatically select the best-performing causal model configuration. The generated data maintains temporal dynamics and causal relationships, aiming to produce synthetic time-series that closely resemble real-world data while preserving underlying causal structures.

## Key Results
- Achieved AUC scores around 0.85 on real-world datasets, demonstrating competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods like CausalTime
- Scored approximately 0.75 on synthetic datasets, indicating reasonable fidelity in capturing temporal causal patterns
- Showed that realistic causal time-series generation remains challenging despite methodological advances

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TCS works by systematically decomposing the causal generation problem into three learnable components: lagged causal structure estimation identifies temporal dependencies between variables, functional dependency modeling captures the mathematical relationships governing these dependencies, and noise distribution characterization accounts for stochastic elements in the data. The Min-max optimization with AutoML then iteratively refines these components to maximize the realism of generated time-series while maintaining causal coherence.

## Foundational Learning

**Lagged Causal Structure Estimation**
*Why needed:* Temporal data often exhibits delayed dependencies where causes precede effects over time
*Quick check:* Verify that estimated lags align with known temporal relationships in benchmark datasets

**Functional Dependency Modeling**
*Why needed:* Time-series variables are connected through mathematical relationships that must be accurately captured
*Quick check:* Test generated data against known functional forms in controlled synthetic environments

**Noise Distribution Characterization**
*Why needed:* Real-world data contains inherent randomness that affects temporal patterns
*Quick check:* Compare empirical and theoretical noise distributions using statistical goodness-of-fit tests

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Phase 1 (Lagged Causal Estimation) -> Phase 2 (Functional Dependencies) -> Phase 3 (Noise Distributions) -> Min-max Optimization -> AutoML Selection -> Generated Time-series

**Critical Path**
The sequence from lagged causal estimation through to AutoML model selection represents the critical path, as each phase builds upon the previous one's outputs to progressively refine the generated time-series quality.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The framework balances model complexity against computational efficiency, with AutoML providing automated hyperparameter tuning at the cost of increased training time. The three-phase decomposition allows for modular improvement but may miss cross-phase interactions.

**Failure Signatures**
Poor performance typically manifests as unrealistic temporal patterns, weak causal structure preservation, or inadequate noise modeling. These issues often stem from insufficient training data or suboptimal parameter choices in earlier phases.

**3 First Experiments**
1. Validate phase 1 lagged causal estimation on datasets with known temporal delays
2. Test phase 2 functional dependency modeling using synthetic data with prescribed relationships
3. Evaluate phase 3 noise distribution characterization on benchmark stochastic time-series

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the results imply several: how to improve causal structure fidelity in high-dimensional settings, what evaluation metrics best capture temporal causal realism, and how to scale the framework to larger, more complex time-series domains.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability due to evaluation on a narrow set of datasets with specific temporal dynamics
- Min-max optimization lacks transparency in hyperparameter selection and convergence criteria
- Evaluation metrics may not fully capture quality of generated causal structures in non-linear settings

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods | Medium |
| Realistic causal generation remains challenging | High |
| TCS enriches the field of causal-based temporal data generation | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of each TCS phase on final performance
2. Evaluate TCS on high-dimensional and non-linear time-series datasets to test scalability
3. Compare generated causal graphs against ground truth in semi-synthetic datasets with known causal structures
