# Modeling Non-Ergodic Path Effects Using Conditional Generative Model for Fourier Amplitude Spectra

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.19909
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19909
- **Reference count**: 23
- **Primary result**: Conditional generative model predicts non-ergodic path effects in Fourier amplitude spectra with 10,000x faster computation than Gaussian process methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CGM-FAS, a conditional generative model that predicts non-ergodic path effects in seismic Fourier amplitude spectra (FAS) for ground motion prediction. The model leverages a conditional variational autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlations directly from earthquake and station location data, eliminating the need for prescribed correlation functions used in traditional Gaussian process (GP) approaches. By avoiding explicit physical constraints and instead learning patterns from data, CGM-FAS achieves comparable accuracy to GP-based methods while providing substantial computational advantages. The model successfully captures complex spatial dependencies and frequency correlations across the 2-15 Hz range, generating path effect maps that match empirical variability estimates.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a conditional generative model that predicts non-ergodic path effects by training a conditional variational autoencoder on earthquake and station location pairs. The model takes earthquake-station coordinates as input and outputs Fourier amplitude spectra path effects across multiple frequencies simultaneously. Unlike traditional approaches that require explicit correlation functions or physical models, CGM-FAS learns spatial patterns and interfrequency correlations directly from the data through a variational autoencoder framework. The model incorporates noise injection during generation to produce diverse outputs, addressing the inherent variability in seismic wave propagation. Training uses empirical FAS data from the San Francisco Bay Area, with the model learning to predict path effects without requiring detailed subsurface velocity structures or prescribed spatial correlation models.

## Key Results
- Computational speedup of 10,000x compared to Gaussian process methods (10 seconds vs 10 hours for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies)
- Generates path effect maps with smoother spatial patterns than GP-based approaches
- Successfully captures interfrequency correlations across 2-15 Hz range
- Matches empirical variability estimates with standard deviation of 0.40 ln units

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model works by leveraging the conditional variational autoencoder's ability to learn complex spatial dependencies and interfrequency correlations directly from data. By conditioning on earthquake and station locations, the model captures the spatial patterns of path effects without requiring explicit physical models or prescribed correlation functions. The variational autoencoder architecture allows the model to learn a probabilistic representation of path effects, enabling it to generate diverse outputs through noise injection that reflects the natural variability in seismic wave propagation. The direct learning approach is particularly effective because it can capture subtle spatial patterns and frequency dependencies that may be difficult to model with physics-based approaches or simple correlation functions.

## Foundational Learning

**Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS)**: The magnitude of the Fourier transform of ground motion acceleration time series, representing the amplitude of different frequency components in the seismic signal. Why needed: FAS is the fundamental quantity being predicted and represents the frequency-domain characteristics of ground motion. Quick check: FAS can be computed by taking the absolute value of the complex Fourier transform of acceleration time series.

**Non-ergodic path effects**: Site-specific modifications to ground motion caused by the unique path between earthquake source and receiver, rather than average regional effects. Why needed: These effects are crucial for accurate site-specific ground motion prediction and vary spatially based on local geology and wave propagation paths. Quick check: Non-ergodic effects capture deviations from regional average ground motion predictions that depend on specific source-station geometry.

**Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)**: A generative model that learns to produce outputs conditioned on input variables through an encoder-decoder architecture with probabilistic latent space. Why needed: CVAE enables learning complex spatial patterns and generating diverse outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Quick check: CVAE learns a probability distribution over latent variables and uses this to generate outputs that match input conditions.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Earthquake coordinates -> CVAE encoder -> Latent space -> CVAE decoder -> Path effects -> FAS

Critical path: Input coordinates are encoded into latent space representation, which is then decoded to predict path effects across all frequencies simultaneously. The model operates in a single forward pass without iterative optimization.

Design tradeoffs: The model sacrifices explicit physical constraints for computational efficiency and the ability to learn complex patterns directly from data. This approach may miss some physical phenomena that physics-based models would capture, but gains significant speed and flexibility in learning spatial patterns.

Failure signatures: Poor performance on data outside the training region, inability to capture physical phenomena not present in training data, and potential overfitting to local patterns that may not generalize to other seismic regions.

Three first experiments:
1. Test model predictions on held-out earthquake-station pairs from the same region to evaluate generalization within the training domain.
2. Compare model-generated path effects against independent physical models that incorporate detailed subsurface velocity structures.
3. Evaluate the model's ability to capture extreme path effects by testing on earthquake-station pairs with challenging geometries.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations

- Limited geographical scope restricted to the San Francisco Bay Area, raising questions about generalizability to other tectonic settings
- Relatively small dataset of 84 earthquakes and 311 stations may limit the model's ability to capture full variability in seismic wave propagation
- The data-driven approach may miss important physical constraints that traditional physics-based models enforce

## Confidence

- **Computational efficiency claim**: High - 10,000x speedup is clearly demonstrated through direct timing comparison
- **Model accuracy vs GP methods**: Medium - comparison shows similar patterns but may not capture all physical constraints
- **Generalizability to other regions**: Medium - limited testing outside San Francisco Bay Area suggests uncertainty about broader applicability
- **Variability matching**: Medium - standard deviation match (0.40 ln units) represents only one aspect of model performance

## Next Checks

1. Test the model on seismic data from geographically distinct regions with different geological characteristics to assess generalizability beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.
2. Conduct cross-validation with explicit train-test splits to evaluate predictive performance on unseen earthquake-station pairs, measuring both bias and variance.
3. Compare model outputs against independent physical models that incorporate detailed subsurface velocity structures to assess whether the data-driven approach captures essential wave propagation physics.
