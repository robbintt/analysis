# AI agents may be worth the hype but not the resources (yet): An initial exploration of machine translation quality and costs in three language pairs in the legal and news domains

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.01560
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01560
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Reasoning-enhanced o1-preview consistently outperformed other models in adequacy and fluency, while NMT systems led in automatic metrics

## Executive Summary
This study benchmarks traditional NMT, LLMs, and AI agent workflows for machine translation across three language pairs. Using human evaluation and automatic metrics, reasoning-enhanced o1-preview consistently outperformed other models in adequacy and fluency, while NMT systems (e.g., Google Translate) led in automatic metrics. Multi-agent workflows improved qualitative output but incurred up to 15x more token costs. The results highlight that while AI agents and reasoning models enhance translation quality, their high computational costs and variable performance across languages limit scalability. We advocate for cost-aware, human-centered evaluation frameworks to guide future MT development and deployment.

## Method Summary
The study compares five translation paradigms—Google Translate (NMT), GPT-4o, o1-preview, sequential multi-agent (s-agent), and iterative multi-agent (i-agent)—on two source texts (legal contract and news article) translated into English→Spanish, English→Catalan, and English→Turkish. Evaluation combines automatic metrics (COMET, BLEU, chrF2, TER) with human expert ratings on adequacy and fluency. Token costs are calculated using April 2025 pricing, and both agent workflows use identical prompts powered by GPT-4o. The legal text was sourced from a prior anonymized study, while the news text comes from Andrew Ng's GitHub repository.

## Key Results
- o1-preview produced the most adequate and fluent translations in five of six comparisons, despite underperforming on automatic metrics
- NMT systems (Google Translate) dominated automatic evaluation metrics due to surface-level optimization
- Multi-agent workflows improved qualitative output but incurred up to 15x more token costs, with iterative agents showing high variance across languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reasoning-enhanced LLMs (o1-preview) produce translations rated higher in adequacy and fluency by human experts, despite not leading in automatic metrics.
- Mechanism: Extended chain-of-thought reasoning layers enable deeper semantic processing and contextual alignment before generating output, capturing nuances that surface-level n-gram metrics cannot detect.
- Core assumption: Human expert ratings on 4-point adequacy/fluency scales reliably capture translation quality dimensions that automatic metrics miss.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "o1-preview produces the most adequate and fluent output in five of six comparisons... indicating that reasoning layers capture semantic nuance undervalued by surface metrics." [section 4.2] "o1-preview emerges as the most frequent best-performing system, achieving 5 first-place scores" in human evaluation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-agent sequential workflows can modestly improve qualitative translation output, but iterative workflows show high variance across language pairs.
- Mechanism: Task decomposition into specialized agent roles (translator → reviewer → editor) introduces modular quality control stages that can catch errors, but iterative cycles amplify both corrections and potential drift.
- Core assumption: More processing stages and revision cycles systematically improve output rather than introducing compounding errors.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Multi-agent workflows improved qualitative output but incurred up to 15x more token costs." [section 4.2] "The i-agent system... struggles significantly [in Turkish], recording the lowest scores in both dimensions... tended to deviate from the source text and had more mistranslated sentences."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Automatic evaluation metrics (BLEU, COMET, chrF2, TER) systematically favor NMT systems optimized for surface correspondence over reasoning-based approaches.
- Mechanism: AEMs measure n-gram overlap and semantic similarity to reference translations, penalizing valid translations that use different lexical choices or syntactic structures.
- Core assumption: Reference translations represent the only correct output style and lexical choices.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "NMT systems (e.g., Google Translate) led in automatic metrics." [section 4.1] "GT's dominance in the automatic metrics is consistent with expectations, given its longstanding optimization for surface-level metrics such as BLEU and COMET."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Encoder-Decoder vs. Decoder-Only Architectures**
  - Why needed here: The paper compares traditional NMT (encoder-decoder) against LLM-based approaches (decoder-only). Understanding this distinction explains why NMT excels at surface metrics while LLMs offer more contextual flexibility.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why encoder-decoder models might optimize differently for translation than decoder-only models?

- Concept: **Automatic Evaluation Metrics (BLEU, COMET, chrF2, TER)**
  - Why needed here: The study's central tension is that AEMs and human evaluation produce different rankings. Understanding what each metric measures is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What dimension of translation quality does BLEU capture, and what does it explicitly miss?

- Concept: **Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns**
  - Why needed here: The paper tests sequential (pipeline) vs. iterative (feedback loop) agent workflows. Understanding coordination patterns explains the cost-quality trade-offs observed.
  - Quick check question: In a sequential agent workflow, what happens if an early-stage agent introduces an error—is there a recovery mechanism?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Source text → agent role prompts → GPT-4o API calls → inter-agent communication logs → final translation
- Critical path: Source text → agent role prompts → GPT-4o API calls → inter-agent communication logs → final translation. Token count accumulates at each agent invocation and revision cycle.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Quality vs. Cost: Iterative agents may improve fluency but cost 15x more tokens
  - Reliability vs. Complexity: Sequential agents are more predictable; iterative agents introduce drift risk
  - Language sensitivity: Turkish performance degrades significantly under iterative workflows
- Failure signatures:
  - High token count with no quality gain (especially for simpler texts)
  - Terminological inconsistency across agent outputs (noted in Turkish i-agent)
  - Semantic drift in iterative cycles (deviation from source meaning)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline calibration**: Run GPT-4o single-pass vs. Google Translate on your domain corpus with both AEMs and human spot-checks to establish your own quality baseline.
  2. **Sequential agent cost-quality curve**: Implement s-agent with token logging; plot quality gain (human-rated) against token multiplier to find your acceptable cost threshold.
  3. **Language-pair stress test**: Before deploying multi-agent workflows, test on your lowest-resource language pair with a small sample to detect drift or degradation patterns early.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can leaner coordination strategies, selective agent activation, or hybrid pipelines combining single-pass LLMs with targeted agent intervention reduce the token overhead of multi-agent MT without compromising translation quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly advocate for research into "leaner coordination strategies, selective agent activation, and hybrid pipelines combining single-pass LLMs with targeted agent intervention" to tip the cost-quality balance.
- Why unresolved: This study only tested two agentic architectures (sequential and iterative), both with high token costs (5–15x NMT). No efficiency-optimized variants were explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing token consumption and human-evaluated quality across alternative agent architectures (e.g., on-demand agent invocation, single-pass + selective refinement).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Should evaluation methodologies move beyond traditional AEMs toward metrics that better capture the qualitative strengths of reasoning-enhanced and agentic MT systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors ask: "Should we move beyond AEMs and put a higher emphasis on strengthening HE or developing newer evaluation metrics that do not jeopardise LLM-based MT outputs?"
- Why unresolved: The study found o1-preview led human evaluations but underperformed on AEMs, indicating misalignment between surface metrics and semantic adequacy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation analyses between new evaluation protocols (e.g., pragmatic fit, domain sensitivity) and human judgments across diverse MT paradigms.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust are multi-agent MT workflows across a wider range of language pairs, domains, and text types beyond the three pairs and two domains tested here?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note variable performance by language (e.g., i-agent struggled in Turkish) and limited testing to legal and news domains, acknowledging the i-agent system had technical limitations that may have affected results.
- Why unresolved: Only EN→ES/CA/TR were tested; morphologically rich or low-resource languages may exhibit different failure modes not captured in this sample.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic benchmarking across additional languages, domains, and agent implementations using both human and automatic evaluation.

## Limitations
- Restricted corpus size (two source texts) limits generalizability of findings
- Absence of direct token-cost data for o1-preview forces reliance on comparative inference
- Iterative agent's poor Turkish performance may reflect language-specific complexity rather than general flaw

## Confidence

**High confidence in the cost-quality trade-off**: Token cost scaling (15x for iterative agents) is directly measured and consistent.

**Medium confidence in o1-preview's superiority**: Based on expert ratings across five of six comparisons, but sample size is small.

**Medium confidence in AEM limitations**: Consistent with literature, but direct corpus evidence is weak; the paper's own findings are the main anchor.

**Low confidence in multi-agent workflow reliability**: Turkish i-agent results show high variance; the paper notes potential confounding factors (outdated GPT-4o, system limits).

## Next Checks

1. **Replicate with expanded corpus**: Test the same systems on 10+ additional legal and news texts in each language pair to assess whether o1-preview's human evaluation advantage persists.

2. **Cross-validate metric alignment**: Compute correlation matrices between all AEMs and human adequacy/fluency scores for each system-language pair to quantify misalignment.

3. **Cost-benefit sensitivity analysis**: For each workflow, plot average human rating gain per additional token cost to identify diminishing returns thresholds.
