# Semiconductor Industry Trend Prediction with Event Intervention Based on LSTM Model in Sentiment-Enhanced Time Series Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.15112
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15112
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: LSTM model with event-intervention sentiment analysis accurately forecasts TSMC semiconductor trends from 2024-2029, aligning with 2nm and 1nm product releases.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of predicting semiconductor industry trends by integrating deep learning with sentiment analysis. It uses TSMC as a case study, combining quarterly financial reports and corporate transcripts. Sentiment analysis is enhanced by incorporating both internal events (e.g., wafer process advancements) and external global events (e.g., COVID-19, financial crises). The LSTM model processes sentiment-enhanced time series data to forecast industry trends from 2024 to 2029. Results show accurate alignment with TSMC's product releases (e.g., 2nm and 1nm processes) and global market dynamics. This approach provides valuable insights for decision-making in semiconductor research and business strategy.

## Method Summary
The methodology uses 104 quarterly data points (1998-2023) from TSMC reports, including 8 financial features and textual corporate transcripts. Sentiment analysis via TextBlob is applied to transcripts, then adjusted with event intervention weights (1.1 for positive internal events, 1.2 for positive external events, 0.9 for negative events). The LSTM model in PyTorch processes this sentiment-enhanced data to forecast 2024-2029. Evaluation relies on qualitative alignment of predicted peaks with product release news rather than quantitative error metrics.

## Key Results
- LSTM model forecasts 2024 Q4 peak matching 2nm process release news
- 2027 Q1 peak predicted, aligning with 1nm process product release
- Model captures both internal process advancements and external market dynamics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Event-Intervention Sentiment Calibration
The paper addresses that raw sentiment analysis is insufficient due to neutral corporate tones. A rule-based weighting system overrides baseline sentiment scores, using internal breakthroughs and external shocks as intervention variables. Manual weights (1.2 for COVID-19, 1.1 for process nodes) quantify event impact on future performance.

### Mechanism 2: Multivariate Temporal Feature Fusion
LSTM accuracy improves by combining 8 operational metrics with calibrated sentiment scores rather than raw financial data alone. The model learns dependencies between sentiment shifts and operational lag times across the 104-quarter dataset.

### Mechanism 3: Ex-Ante Technical Milestone Alignment
The model recognizes financial peaks correlate with historical product release cycles. It projects future peaks based on periodicity of past positive events, validated by alignment with known industry roadmaps (2nm, 1nm release dates).

## Foundational Learning

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**: Needed to handle high-variety temporal dependencies in semiconductor data. Quick check: Can you explain how the "forget gate" decides which past financial quarters are irrelevant for predicting the next quarter?

- **Event Intervention Analysis**: Required to model discontinuous market jumps from specific events as exogenous shocks. Quick check: How would you differentiate between a permanent structural break and a temporary intervention effect in time series?

- **Sentiment Analysis Lexicons (e.g., TextBlob)**: Converts unstructured text into numerical time series data. Quick check: Why might standard lexicons fail on financial text, and how does the paper's weighting approach attempt to bypass this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: TSMC Quarterly Reports (1998-2023) → Textual + Numerical → TextBlob (Baseline Sentiment) + Event Table (Intervention Weights) → Sentiment-Enhanced Series → PyTorch LSTM → Forecast (2024-2029) → Validated against external news/roadmaps

- **Critical path**: Transformation of raw text into "Event-Intervention Sentiment Scores" (Figure 3). Flawed manual weighting corrupts LSTM input signals.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Interpretability vs. Accuracy: Manual weight system (0.9, 1.1, 1.2) is highly interpretable but potentially subjective
  - Stationarity: 25-year dataset assumes market fundamentals haven't changed drastically (pre-AI vs. post-AI era)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Model may predict flat period (2027-2029) due to lack of intervention data rather than genuine market plateau
  - Overfitting to tone if intervention logic is too aggressive

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation Study (Sentiment): Run LSTM using only 8 financial features without sentiment score
  2. Sensitivity Analysis: Systematically vary weights (e.g., COVID-19 from 1.2 to 1.0)
  3. Backtesting on Holdout: Retrain using data only up to 2018 to predict COVID-19 volatility period

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the event-intervention LSTM approach generalize effectively to other business sectors or industries beyond semiconductor manufacturing?
- How sensitive is the model to the manual assignment of event intervention weights?
- Do advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) render the manual event intervention step unnecessary?

## Limitations
- Manual intervention weights (1.1, 1.2, 0.9) lack statistical validation
- No quantitative error metrics reported for forecast accuracy
- 25-year dataset assumes market stationarity despite technological shifts

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: LSTM framework for time series forecasting is well-established
- **Medium confidence**: Sentiment analysis pipeline follows logical approach though weight calibration is subjective
- **Low confidence**: Predictive alignment with future product releases lacks independent validation

## Next Checks
1. Calculate and report standard error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) comparing predictions against actual TSMC quarterly results for most recent 8 quarters
2. Systematically vary intervention weights (±10%, ±20%) to test stability of peak predictions
3. Apply identical methodology to another semiconductor company (e.g., Samsung Foundry) to test generalizability
