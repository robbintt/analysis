# The Missing Layer of AGI: From Pattern Alchemy to Coordination Physics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05765
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05765
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Reframes LLM limitations as coordination failures rather than substrate constraints

## Executive Summary
The paper argues that Large Language Models' inability to reason deeply is not due to their pattern-matching nature, but rather the absence of a System-2 coordination layer. It introduces the Unified Coordination-Computation Theory (UCCT) which formalizes reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support, representational mismatch, and an adaptive anchoring budget. The proposed MACI coordination stack implements behavior-modulated debate, Socratic judging, and transactional memory to enable goal-directed behavior from small context amounts.

## Method Summary
The work develops a theoretical framework that models reasoning as a phase transition in coordination space, parameterized by effective support (ρd), representational mismatch (dr), and an adaptive anchoring budget (γ log k). It proposes MACI as a concrete coordination stack implementing three key mechanisms: behavior-modulated debate for collaborative reasoning, CRIT (Critic-Reasoner-Intuitive-Teacher) for Socratic judging, and transactional memory for context management. The approach translates common LLM critiques into testable hypotheses distinguishing substrate limitations from coordination failures.

## Key Results
- Reasoning emerges as a phase transition when context crosses critical thresholds in ρd and dr parameters
- Small amounts of well-coordinated context can shift LLM behavior from ungrounded to goal-directed
- System-2 coordination, not pattern-matching substrate, is identified as the primary bottleneck for AGI

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework treats reasoning as emergent coordination rather than computational substrate. When multiple reasoning processes are properly synchronized through behavior-modulated debate and verified through Socratic judging, the system can maintain goal-directed behavior. The transactional memory provides the necessary context persistence, while the adaptive anchoring budget ensures efficient resource allocation during reasoning tasks.

## Foundational Learning
**Phase Transition Theory**: Reasoning emerges discontinuously when coordination parameters cross critical thresholds - needed because continuous improvements don't explain reasoning emergence, check by measuring behavioral shifts at parameter boundaries.
**System-2 Coordination**: Multiple reasoning processes must be synchronized rather than running independently - needed because isolated reasoning fails to maintain coherence, check by comparing coordinated vs uncoordinated task performance.
**Behavior-Modulated Debate**: Argument quality adjusts based on coordination success metrics - needed because pure debate lacks feedback mechanisms, check by measuring convergence rates.
**CRIT Architecture**: Critic-Reasoner-Intuitive-Teacher structure for Socratic judging - needed because single-perspective evaluation is insufficient, check by comparing multi-perspective vs single-perspective accuracy.
**Transactional Memory**: Context management that supports coordination - needed because traditional attention mechanisms lack coordination awareness, check by measuring context retention across reasoning steps.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Context Management -> Coordination Engine -> Verification Layer -> Behavior Modulation

**Critical Path**
Small context injection -> Phase transition trigger -> Coordinated reasoning activation -> Goal-directed behavior emergence

**Design Tradeoffs**
Coordination overhead vs reasoning quality, context window size vs phase transition reliability, debate complexity vs convergence speed

**Failure Signatures**
- Continuous rather than discontinuous behavior shifts
- Coordination breakdown in multi-step reasoning
- Context forgetting despite transactional memory
- Debate loops without convergence

**3 First Experiments**
1. Test phase transition by varying context amounts and measuring behavioral discontinuities
2. Compare MACI coordination vs baseline approaches on multi-step reasoning tasks
3. Measure anchoring budget efficiency by varying γ log k parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in source material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework lacks empirical validation of UCCT equations
- Phase transition model parameters not quantified for real-world LLMs
- Distinction between substrate limitations and coordination failures not experimentally disambiguated
- MACI implementation complexity and scalability not demonstrated

## Confidence

**High Confidence**
- Reframing LLM critiques as coordination rather than substrate problems
- Identification of System-2 coordination as critical missing layer

**Medium Confidence**
- UCCT mathematical formalization and three-parameter phase transition model
- Theoretical soundness of coordination-based reasoning emergence

**Low Confidence**
- Specific claims about MACI's effectiveness as coordination stack
- Assertion that small context amounts can reliably trigger phase transitions

## Next Checks
1. Design controlled experiments testing whether incremental context increases produce discontinuous behavior shifts as predicted by the ρd and dr parameters.
2. Implement a minimal MACI prototype with behavior-modulated debate and measure its impact on multi-step reasoning tasks versus baseline approaches.
3. Conduct ablation studies on γ log k anchoring budget effects by systematically varying context constraints and measuring goal-directedness emergence.
