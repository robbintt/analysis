# Response Uncertainty and Probe Modeling: Two Sides of the Same Coin in LLM Interpretability?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.18575
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18575
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Probe performance is strongly negatively correlated with LLM response uncertainty, suggesting uncertainty can serve as a lightweight diagnostic for concept encoding quality.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the relationship between linear probe performance and LLM response uncertainty, hypothesizing that these two factors are intrinsically linked through shared feature representations. Through experiments on six datasets and six LLMs, we find a strong negative correlation: improved probe performance consistently corresponds to reduced response uncertainty. Feature importance analysis reveals that higher response uncertainty is associated with relevance signals distributed across more features, making it harder for probe models to achieve good performance. Theoretical analysis based on sparse representation and Lasso oracle inequality supports this finding. Additionally, we identify specific examples—such as brand categories, time representations, and birth years—where LLM embeddings align with human knowledge, demonstrating interpretable reasoning. Our findings suggest that response uncertainty could serve as a lightweight diagnostic tool for evaluating LLM representations, potentially streamlining probing workflows by indicating when a model has effectively encoded target concepts.

## Method Summary
The method involves querying LLMs multiple times per sample with identical prompts to compute response uncertainty, then sorting and binning samples based on uncertainty scores. For each bin, LLM hidden states are extracted and a linear probe is trained to predict the target concept. The correlation between average uncertainty and probe performance is then analyzed. The study uses six datasets from Gurnee & Tegmark covering temporal and spatial concepts, and six instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 8B to 72B parameters. Response uncertainty is measured using variance for continuous targets and entropy for discrete targets, while probe performance is measured using R² and Spearman rank correlation.

## Key Results
- Strong negative correlation between probe performance and response uncertainty across all tested datasets and models
- Feature importance analysis shows higher uncertainty corresponds to relevance signals distributed across more features
- Theoretical analysis based on sparse representation and Lasso oracle inequality supports empirical findings
- Response uncertainty can serve as a lightweight diagnostic for evaluating LLM representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Probe performance is negatively correlated with LLM response uncertainty.
- **Mechanism:** When a concept is more robustly encoded in the LLM's internal representations, the model generates more consistent responses (lower uncertainty) to related prompts. This same robust encoding allows a simpler probe model to more accurately predict the concept from the representation.
- **Core assumption:** The features used by the probe model and the LLM's generation process for a given concept overlap significantly.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We find a strong correlation: improved probe performance consistently corresponds to a reduction in response uncertainty, and vice versa."
  - [section 4.1, Table 1] Reports strong negative Kendall and Spearman correlation coefficients (often below -0.5) across multiple datasets and models.
  - [corpus] Neighbors touch on uncertainty and probing, but do not directly replicate this specific correlation finding.
- **Break condition:** If the probe model and the LLM's generative process rely on largely disjoint sets of features for a concept, the correlation is likely to weaken or disappear.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Higher response uncertainty corresponds to relevance signals being distributed across a larger number of features.
- **Mechanism:** When the LLM produces varied responses to the same query, the generation process is more diffuse, implicating a broader union of features in the latent representation as "important." This spread makes the underlying signal harder for a linear probe to isolate from noise.
- **Core assumption:** LLM representations for a concept are sparse, meaning only a small subset of features is truly important.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Feature importance analysis reveals that higher response uncertainty is associated with relevance signals distributed across more features, making it harder for probe models to achieve good performance."
  - [section 5.1] Experiments show probes trained on high-uncertainty subsets require preserving more features (e.g., top 40%) to maintain performance compared to low-uncertainty subsets (e.g., top 20%).
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is weak for this specific feature distribution claim.
- **Break condition:** If important features are not sparse (highly distributed even in low-uncertainty cases) or if uncertainty does not increase the set of contributing features, this explanation fails.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Response uncertainty can serve as a lightweight, probe-free diagnostic for whether a concept is well-encoded in an LLM.
- **Mechanism:** The strong negative correlation implies that by simply measuring the consistency of an LLM's generated text on a concept, one can infer the "probeability" of that concept within the model's internal representations without training a probe.
- **Core assumption:** The correlation holds across a wide range of tasks, models, and prompts.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Our findings suggest that response uncertainty could serve as a lightweight diagnostic tool for evaluating LLM representations, potentially streamlining probing workflows..."
  - [section 3.2, sensitivity] The correlation is shown to be robust to variations in generation temperature and prompt templates.
  - [corpus] A neighboring paper, "Neural Probe-Based Hallucination Detection for Large Language Models," explores using probes to detect hallucinations, which is conceptually related but a different direction.
- **Break condition:** If the correlation is found to be task-specific (e.g., only for time/space concepts) or model-scale-dependent, its utility as a general-purpose diagnostic tool is limited.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Linear Probing**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the primary method used to test if an LLM's internal representation encodes a concept. The paper's core conclusion is framed around what makes probing effective.
  - **Quick check question:** What does a high R² score for a probe trained on LLM embeddings tell you about the model's representation?

- **Concept: Response Uncertainty**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's main predictor variable. Understanding how it's measured (semantic entropy, variance) is crucial to grasp the proposed diagnostic.
  - **Quick check question:** If an LLM gives completely different answers to the same question 10 times, is its response uncertainty high or low?

- **Concept: Feature Attribution / Importance**
  - **Why needed here:** This provides the mechanistic explanation for *why* the correlation exists by analyzing how many features contribute to a response.
  - **Quick check question:** A method like AttnLRP assigns a score to each input feature. What does a high score imply?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component Map:**
  1. LLM Generator: Instruction-tuned models (Llama, Qwen, etc.) that produce text and intermediate hidden states
  2. Uncertainty Estimator: A module that collects multiple responses for a given prompt and computes a score (e.g., variance, entropy)
  3. Probe Model: A simple linear regressor/classifier trained on LLM hidden states to predict a target concept
  4. Feature Attributor: An interpretability method (e.g., AttnLRP) that maps relevance scores from the response back to hidden state features

- **Critical Path:**
  1. Query the LLM multiple times per sample to compute response uncertainty
  2. Sort and bin samples based on their uncertainty scores
  3. For each bin, extract LLM hidden states and train a separate probe
  4. Analyze the correlation between the bins' average uncertainty and their probe performance

- **Design Tradeoffs:**
  - **Uncertainty Metric:** Variance vs. Entropy. Variance is suited for continuous values, Entropy for discrete.
  - **Probe Complexity:** Paper uses simple linear probes. More complex probes might perform differently.
  - **Layer Selection:** Probes perform best on middle-to-late layers. The exact choice is a hyperparameter.

- **Failure Signatures:**
  - The correlation breaks down if the chosen layer is too shallow
  - The method is not well-suited for datasets where the LLM is already near-perfectly consistent (very low uncertainty), as seen with larger models on the "USA" dataset

- **First 3 Experiments to Replicate:**
  1. Reproduce the core correlation: Pick one dataset (e.g., Figures) and one LLM. Implement the pipeline to compute Spearman correlation between response uncertainty and probe performance (R²)
  2. Test the feature importance hypothesis: For a small subset of data, run an attribution method (like integrated gradients or a simpler proxy) on high vs. low uncertainty responses to see if the number of "important" features differs
  3. Pilot the diagnostic utility: Without training a probe, try to predict which of two new concepts the LLM will be "better at" based solely on generated response consistency. Validate with a small probe experiment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Do natural language prompts function mechanistically analogously to trained probe weights in extracting conceptual information?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7 states the authors "hypothesize that prompts function in a manner analogous to probes" but the mechanism remains poorly understood, calling for concrete evidence.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper empirically observes the link between generation and representation but does not investigate the mathematical or structural similarities between the prompt embedding space and the probe weight space.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Mechanistic interpretability studies comparing the subspaces activated by specific prompts with the weight vectors learned by linear probes for the same concepts.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What specific parameter updates during instruction tuning establish the correspondence between probe performance and response consistency?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7 notes that the strong correlation is observed primarily in instruction-tuned models, whereas base models often generate disorganized responses even when probes fit well.
- **Why unresolved:** The study focuses on instruction-tuned models (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5) and does not perform a comparative analysis of parameter shifts (e.g., changes in specific head weights or layer norms) induced by the tuning process.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis of layer-wise representations and probe performance in base models before and after instruction tuning.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Under what conditions does the correlation between response uncertainty and representation quality become strictly linear?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4.1 notes that linearity depends on the uncertainty estimator (variance vs. entropy) and leaves a "deeper investigation into the conditions under which linearity holds in general cases to future work."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper observes different Pearson correlation coefficients depending on the metric used but lacks a theoretical or empirical model to predict when the relationship is linear versus monotonic.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Theoretical modeling or empirical stress tests across diverse datasets to determine the mathematical boundary conditions for linearity.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Does the correlation between response uncertainty and representation quality extend to other interpretability methods?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7 suggests investigating whether "similar correlations exist across other interpretability methods" to develop a "unified framework for LLM explanation."
- **Why unresolved:** The study strictly links uncertainty to linear probing; it is unknown if high uncertainty also degrades the clarity or stability of other explanation types, such as attention maps or circuit analysis.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments measuring the stability or signal-to-noise ratio of attention-based explanations (e.g., AttnLRP) across high- and low-uncertainty response bins.

## Limitations
- The correlation may be influenced by dataset-specific properties rather than representing universal LLM behavior
- Feature attribution analysis relies on AttnLRP with incomplete implementation details
- Diagnostic utility claim lacks direct empirical validation showing practical workflow improvements

## Confidence

- **High:** The existence of a statistically significant negative correlation between probe performance and response uncertainty across the tested datasets and models
- **Medium:** The mechanistic explanation that uncertainty correlates with feature distribution (Mechanism 2), as the feature attribution results are compelling but the sparsity assumption is not fully validated
- **Medium:** The diagnostic utility claim (Mechanism 3), as it follows logically from the correlation but lacks direct empirical validation showing practical workflow improvements

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Generalization Test:** Apply the pipeline to a new dataset (e.g., a different concept domain like "chemical elements" or "mathematical constants") to verify the correlation holds beyond the original six datasets
2. **Probe Complexity Sensitivity:** Repeat the experiments using a non-linear probe (e.g., a small MLP) to determine if the correlation is specific to linear probes or represents a more general phenomenon
3. **Diagnostic Workflow Validation:** Design a controlled experiment where a subset of concepts is evaluated using both the uncertainty-based "quick check" and traditional probing. Measure if the uncertainty check correctly identifies concepts likely to yield high probe performance and if this reduces total experimental time
