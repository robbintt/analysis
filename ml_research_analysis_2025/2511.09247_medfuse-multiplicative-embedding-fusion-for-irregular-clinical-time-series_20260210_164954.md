## Quick Facts

## Executive Summary
MedFuse introduces MuFuse, a multiplicative embedding fusion module that modulates feature embeddings with numerical values through element-wise scaling, enabling richer value-dependent interactions than additive methods. This approach addresses the challenge of modeling irregular, high-missingness clinical time series by capturing nonlinear feature-value relationships without explicit imputation. Experiments on three real-world datasets (ICU mortality and chronic disease prediction) show MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 0.6574 AUPRC on MIMIC-III and demonstrating effective cross-dataset pretraining. Ablations confirm multiplicative fusion's superiority, and the method's generalizability is supported by its adaptability to heterogeneous clinical tasks. MedFuse establishes a scalable, expressive framework for irregular EHR modeling.

## Method Summary
MedFuse processes irregular clinical time series as (feature, value, timestamp) triplets without imputation. It uses MuFuse to fuse feature embeddings with value embeddings via broadcasted Hadamard product, enabling multiplicative gating of feature dimensions by value. Sinusoidal positional encoding is added to preserve temporal patterns. The fused embeddings are processed by a Transformer encoder for classification. Value embeddings are generated through a nonlinear projector with per-feature affine transformation. The method demonstrates superior performance on ICU mortality and HCC onset prediction tasks across three real-world datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 0.6574 AUPRC on MIMIC-III ICU mortality prediction
- Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three clinical datasets
- Ablation studies confirm multiplicative fusion superiority over additive methods
- Demonstrates effective cross-dataset pretraining with source dataset size matters
- Shows adaptability to heterogeneous clinical tasks (mortality vs. HCC onset prediction)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Value-Conditioned Feature Modulation
- **Claim:** Multiplicative gating captures non-linear, feature-specific dependencies that additive methods miss
- **Mechanism:** MuFuse performs broadcasted Hadamard product ($e_f \odot e_v$) rather than addition, allowing scalar value embeddings to selectively amplify or suppress specific dimensions of feature identity embeddings
- **Core assumption:** Semantic meaning of clinical values depends non-linearly on feature identity
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states multiplicative fusion modulates feature embeddings through element-wise scaling; Section 3.2.3 explains the interaction term; corpus discusses dynamic embeddings for irregular sampling
- **Break condition:** If clinical predictions rely solely on linear combinations of independent effects, multiplicative fusion offers no advantage

### Mechanism 2: Representation Collapse for Clinical Equifinality
- **Claim:** Distinct clinical states with similar risks can be mapped to similar embedding regions via learned masking
- **Mechanism:** Element-wise product allows feature embedding to act as mask, collapsing distinct value embeddings into similar representations
- **Core assumption:** Clinical risk phenotypes are often non-monotonic or multi-modal (U-shaped risks)
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 5.2 explains additive fusion difficulty capturing equivalence; Appendix J provides explicit example of hypokalemia/hyperkalemia masked to represent common arrhythmia risk
- **Break condition:** If all clinical features have strictly monotonic relationships with outcomes, masking capability is unnecessary

### Mechanism 3: Decoupled Temporal Encoding
- **Claim:** Additive time injection preserves temporal patterns better than multiplicative fusion
- **Mechanism:** Time is injected via addition ($e_{f,v} + p_t$) to avoid disrupting AC signal magnitude of sinusoidal positional encodings
- **Core assumption:** Positional information acts as bias or context shift, not dimensional gate on feature itself
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.4 explains additive time injection preserves separation between content and temporal pattern; Appendix F shows multiplicative fusion distorts spectral composition
- **Break condition:** If time is better modeled as dynamic modifier of feature semantics, additive assumption breaks

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Hadamard (Element-wise) Product in Neural Networks**
  - **Why needed here:** Core operation of MuFuse; unlike matrix multiplication, Hadamard product is gating mechanism preserving dimensionality
  - **Quick check question:** If $e_f = [1, -1]$ and $e_v = [0.5, 2]$, what is result of $e_f \odot e_v$? (Answer: $[0.5, -2]$). Notice sign of feature and magnitude of value interact.

- **Concept: The EVAT (Each Value as Token) Paradigm**
  - **Why needed here:** MedFuse builds on this tokenization strategy for irregular time series, treating observations as sparse triplets rather than dense vectors
  - **Quick check question:** How does model handle "missing" lab value in EVAT paradigm? (Answer: Doesn't; no token is created. Imputation is skipped entirely).

- **Concept: AUPRC vs. AUROC in Imbalanced Data**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper claims victory based heavily on AUPRC; in clinical datasets where mortality is rare, AUROC can be misleadingly high
  - **Quick check question:** Why might model with 90% accuracy fail in dataset where only 5% patients are positive? (Answer: Can predict "negative" for everyone and get 95% accuracy. AUPRC forces model to care about minority class).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer -> Embedding Heads (Feature ID, Value, Time) -> MuFuse Module -> Temporal Injection -> Transformer Encoder -> Linear Head
- **Critical path:** Efficacy relies on Broadcasting Logic in MuFuse; if dimensions $d$ (feature) and $d'$ (value) are misaligned or partitioning factor $k$ is set poorly, gating mechanism fails
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Partitioning Factor ($k$): Low $k$ (large $d'$) risks overfitting to noise; high $k$ (small $d'$) is coarse gating; intermediate is best
  - Imputation-free vs. Bias: Avoids imputation bias but loses explicit "missingness" patterns
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Semantic Distortion: Applying MuFuse to Time embeddings instead of addition causes model to fail to converge
  - Negative Transfer: Pre-training on small dataset and transferring to large one results in negative transfer
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Fusion Ablation: Replace Hadamard with Addition on P12/MIMIC; expect AUPRC drop of ~2-4%
  2. Dimension Sweep: Run MedFuse with different partitioning factors ($k$) to find sweet spot
  3. Temporal Injection Test: Attempt to fuse time multiplicatively ($e_fv * p_t$); confirm accuracy drop validates additive design

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can MedFuse be extended to incorporate causal or counterfactual reasoning for clinical interpretability?
- What theoretical principles determine optimal partitioning factor $k$ across different clinical domains?
- Can specialized time encoding scheme be designed to enable multiplicative fusion for temporal features?

## Limitations
- Superiority of multiplicative fusion shown only on clinical datasets with high missingness
- Time encoding claim based on synthetic sinusoidal data, not real clinical signals
- Model robustness to varying partitioning factors tested empirically but optimal $k$ selection remains dataset-specific
- Pre-training benefits conditional on source dataset size, raising transferability questions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Additive vs. multiplicative fusion ablation results; consistency of AUPRC improvements
- **Medium Confidence**: Generalization claims across datasets; interpretability of equifinality masking
- **Low Confidence**: Exact conditions for superiority; scalability to high-cardinality features; robustness to distributional shifts

## Next Checks
1. **Controlled ablation with synthetic data**: Construct synthetic irregular time series with known non-linear feature-value interactions and test whether MuFuse recovers these interactions better than additive fusion
2. **Robustness sweep over partitioning factor k**: Systematically vary k across broader range and dataset sizes to identify overfitting thresholds
3. **Cross-distributional validation**: Retrain and evaluate on held-out clinical subset with shifted value distribution to assess sensitivity to normalization and gating stability
