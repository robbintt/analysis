# A Comprehensive Real-World Assessment of Audio Watermarking Algorithms: Will They Survive Neural Codecs?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.19663
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19663
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Introduces RAW-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation framework for deep learning audio watermarking algorithms, revealing that neural compression poses the greatest challenge to watermark robustness.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RAW-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation framework for deep learning-based audio watermarking algorithms. The framework addresses the challenge of evaluating watermarking systems under real-world conditions by introducing a diverse test dataset spanning music, speech, and environmental sounds, along with a comprehensive attack pipeline simulating 20 real-world distortions including neural compression methods. The study evaluates four existing watermarking models (AudioSeal, SilentCipher, Timbre, and WavMark) under various attack conditions, both in pre-trained and retrained configurations. Key findings reveal that neural compression techniques pose the greatest challenge to audio watermarking systems, with bitwise accuracies generally below 0.5 and full-message accuracies near zero for most approaches.

## Method Summary
The RAW-Bench framework evaluates audio watermarking algorithms through a comprehensive pipeline that includes a diverse test dataset from 9 public collections (Bach10, Clotho, DAPS, FreiSchuetz, GuitarSet, jaCapella, MAESTRO, MoisesDB, PCD), all resampled to target rates (16 kHz for AS/SC/WM, 22.05 kHz for TI). The evaluation employs four pre-trained watermarking models (AudioSeal, SilentCipher, Timbre, WavMark) and applies 20 different attack distortions including noise, compression, reverb, and neural codecs. Imperceptibility is measured using SI-SNR, MCD, and MOS-LQO metrics, while robustness is assessed through bitwise accuracy and full-message accuracy. The study also examines the impact of adversarial training by retraining AudioSeal and SilentCipher with strict attack augmentations using uniform category weighting and spectrogram augmentation.

## Key Results
- Neural compression techniques pose the greatest challenge to audio watermarking systems, with bitwise accuracies generally below 0.5 and full-message accuracies near zero for most approaches.
- Even when algorithms are trained with neural compression, performance remains poor, particularly against Descript Audio Codec (DAC).
- Training with audio attacks generally improves robustness, especially for full-message accuracy, but is insufficient against certain distortions like polarity inversion, time stretching, reverb, and compression.
- There is a fundamental tension between watermarking and neural compression, suggesting that neural codecs may ultimately succeed in removing imperceptible watermarks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Distortion-Aware Adversarial Training
- Claim: Training watermarking models with a comprehensive set of realistic audio distortions (attacks) during the learning process improves their robustness to those same distortions at inference time.
- Mechanism: Data augmentation exposes the model to potential signal degradations (noise, compression, reverb, etc.) during training. The model's loss function penalizes failure to extract the watermark from these augmented signals, forcing the learned embedding to be more resilient to the specific transformations it has seen. This is a form of domain adaptation to the space of distorted audio.
- Core assumption: The distortions encountered in real-world deployment will be sufficiently similar to the distortions used in the training pipeline for the learned robustness to generalize.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...training with audio attacks generally improves robustness, although it is insufficient in some cases."
  - [Page 3, Methodology] "...retrain AS and SC using our audio attack pipeline under the strict parameter settings to examine the impact of adversarial training on watermark robustness."
  - [Page 4, Results] "We also observe that training with adversarial attacks further improves robustness, especially for full-message accuracy."
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks when a novel distortion type or an extreme parameter of a known distortion is applied that was not covered during training, or when the distortion fundamentally alters the signal in a way that destroys the hidden information (e.g., certain neural compression).

### Mechanism 2: Information Hiding in Perceptually Insignificant Signal Components
- Claim: Neural audio watermarking models achieve imperceptibility by embedding the hidden message into parts of the audio signal that are less noticeable to the human auditory system.
- Mechanism: The encoder network learns to identify signal subspaces (e.g., specific frequency bands, phase components, or time-domain features) where additive information is masked by the dominant audio content. The paper notes spectral vs. waveform domains. The decoder is trained to reverse this process and extract the message.
- Core assumption: The distortion caused by embedding information falls below the threshold of human perception, and this threshold holds across various listening conditions and audio content types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 1, Introduction] "It embeds a hidden message within a carrier signal, ensuring inaudibility while enabling reliable detection and extraction..."
  - [Page 2, Table 1] Shows different models operate in Waveform or Spectral domains, suggesting different hiding strategies.
  - [Page 3, Methodology] Lists imperceptibility metrics like SI-SNR, MCD, and MOS-LQO, which quantify the difference between the original and watermarked audio.
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks if the embedding strength is too high, causing audible artifacts, or if the host audio content lacks sufficient "masking" components (e.g., very sparse audio) to hide the watermark effectively.

### Mechanism 3: Signal Reconstruction by Neural Codecs as a Competing Objective
- Claim: Neural audio codecs (e.g., EnCodec, Descript Audio Codec) act as powerful attacks on watermarks because their core function is to discard information deemed perceptually irrelevant to achieve high compression, which often includes the subtle hidden watermark.
- Mechanism: These codecs use an encoder-decoder architecture trained to reconstruct audio that *sounds* similar to the original while operating on a heavily compressed latent representation. The process is lossy and non-linear. The codec's learning objective competes with the watermark's objective: the codec removes imperceptible information to save bits, while the watermark relies on that information for detection.
- Core assumption: The watermark information is treated by the codec's learned model as "imperceptible noise" to be quantized away or discarded during the encoding-decoding process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...neural compression techniques pose the most significant challenge... suggesting that neural codecs may ultimately succeed in removing imperceptible watermarks."
  - [Page 4, Results] "In fact, watermarking algorithms and neural codecs compete for the same space... watermarking algorithms strive to insert imperceptible information... neural codecs strive to remove the imperceptible information..."
  - [corpus] The paper "SoK: How Robust is Audio Watermarking in Generative AI models?" is noted as related work, reinforcing the systemic challenge of robustness against advanced signal processing.
- Break condition: The mechanism would not apply if a watermark is embedded in a way that is *perceptible* (defeating the codec's goal) or if the watermark is embedded in a part of the signal that the specific codec is explicitly trained *not* to discard.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Audio Watermarking Trade-offs (Imperceptibility vs. Robustness vs. Capacity)**
  - Why needed here: This is the core challenge defined in the paper. Understanding that you cannot maximize all three simultaneously is critical. The paper focuses on imperceptibility and robustness while keeping capacity constant.
  - Quick check question: If you make a watermark more robust to a loud noise attack by embedding it at a higher amplitude, which other property are you likely degrading?

- Concept: **Neural Audio Codecs (e.g., EnCodec, DAC)**
  - Why needed here: The paper identifies these as the most significant threat to current watermarking methods. Understanding them as lossy autoencoders that discard perceptually irrelevant information explains *why* they are so effective at stripping watermarks.
  - Quick check question: Why would a neural codec's goal of discarding imperceptible information to compress audio directly conflict with a watermark's goal of hiding information imperceptibly?

- Concept: **Adversarial Data Augmentation**
  - Why needed here: The paper tests the method of "distortion-aware training" or "adversarial training" by applying a pipeline of attacks during model retraining. This is a key technique for attempting to improve model robustness.
  - Quick check question: The paper shows that retraining with attacks helps, but does not solve the problem for all cases (e.g., neural codecs). What does this suggest about the nature of the neural codec attack?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Test Dataset -> Watermark Encoder -> Watermarked Audio -> Attack Pipeline -> Attacked Audio -> Watermark Detector -> Output (bitwise accuracy, message accuracy)
- Critical path: A raw audio file -> **Watermark Encoder** -> Watermarked Audio -> **Attack Pipeline** (e.g., Neural Codec) -> Attacked Audio -> **Watermark Detector** -> Output (bitwise accuracy, message accuracy). The imperceptibility is measured between the raw and watermarked audio.
- Design tradeoffs: The paper highlights a key tradeoff: models with better imperceptibility (SilentCipher) may have different robustness profiles than models with lower imperceptibility (Timbre). There is also the tradeoff between training time complexity and robustness; adding more augmentations helps but is costly and insufficient for some attacks.
- Failure signatures:
    - **Low Bitwise/Message Accuracy on Neural Codecs:** Indicates the watermark information is being destroyed by the codec's latent representation.
    - **High SI-SNR/MCD Degradation:** Indicates the watermark is perceptible.
    - **Poor Performance on Specific Distortions (e.g., Polarity Inversion, Time Stretching):** Indicates the model has a specific architectural or training vulnerability to that type of transformation.
- First 3 experiments:
  1.  **Establish a Baseline:** Select a pre-trained model (e.g., AudioSeal) and run it through the RAW-Bench attack pipeline on a small subset of the test dataset. Measure both perceptual metrics (SI-SNR, MCD) on clean audio and robustness metrics (bitwise accuracy) on attacked audio. This confirms the paper's initial findings.
  2.  **Targeted Adversarial Training:** Take a model that failed on a specific distortion (e.g., reverb) from the first experiment. Implement a training loop that adds that specific distortion as an augmentation. Retrain the model and re-evaluate *only* on that distortion to measure the improvement.
  3.  **Neural Codec Stress Test:** Focus on the most challenging attack: the Descript Audio Codec (DAC). Watermark a set of audio files, pass them through DAC at different quality settings (number of codebooks), and measure the drop in bitwise accuracy. This demonstrates the fundamental tension highlighted in the paper.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Proprietary retraining datasets prevent exact replication of the adversarial training results.
- Limited evaluation of the two retrained models (AudioSeal and SilentCipher) leaves uncertainty about generalizability of findings to all four original architectures.
- The specific implementation details of the MOS-LQO metric and expert listener thresholds for loose/strict settings are not fully documented, potentially affecting reproducibility of perceptual quality assessments.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Neural codecs pose the greatest challenge to audio watermarking systems, and the fundamental tension between watermarking and compression objectives is well-established.
- **Medium Confidence**: The general trend that adversarial training improves robustness, though insufficient for neural codecs, is supported by the presented evidence.
- **Medium Confidence**: The superiority of certain models (e.g., SilentCipher) in specific attack categories is demonstrated, but comprehensive head-to-head comparisons across all conditions are limited.

## Next Checks
1. **Implement a Minimal Retraining Pipeline**: Using a publicly available music dataset (e.g., MAESTRO), replicate the adversarial training procedure for one model (e.g., AudioSeal) on a subset of attacks (e.g., only noise and compression) to verify the mechanism of distortion-aware training.
2. **Neural Codec Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the quality parameters (e.g., number of codebooks for DAC, bitrate for EnCodec) and measure the exact degradation curve of watermark robustness to quantify the severity of this specific attack.
3. **Cross-Modality Robustness Test**: Apply the same RAW-Bench attack pipeline to a video watermarking model (if available) to determine if the observed vulnerability to neural compression is specific to audio or a broader multimedia watermarking challenge.
