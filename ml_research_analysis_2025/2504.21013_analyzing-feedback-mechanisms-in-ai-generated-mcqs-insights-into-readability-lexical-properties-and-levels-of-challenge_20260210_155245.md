# Analyzing Feedback Mechanisms in AI-Generated MCQs: Insights into Readability, Lexical Properties, and Levels of Challenge

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.21013
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21013
- **Reference count:** 12
- **Primary result:** Fine-tuned RoBERTa-based multi-task learning model predicts linguistic properties of AI-generated MCQ feedback with MAE of 2.0 (readability) and 0.03 (vocabulary richness).

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how AI-generated feedback for multiple-choice questions (MCQs) adapts linguistically based on question difficulty and feedback tone. Using a dataset of over 1,200 MCQs across three difficulty levels and three feedback tones (supportive, neutral, challenging), the research reveals significant interaction effects between tone and difficulty on linguistic metrics including readability, vocabulary richness, and feedback length. The findings show that AI dynamically adjusts language complexity and style based on both factors simultaneously, rather than through independent effects. A multi-task learning model built on RoBERTa-base successfully predicts these linguistic properties, demonstrating the potential for developing more personalized and adaptive AI-driven feedback systems in educational settings.

## Method Summary
The research generates MCQs using Gemini 1.5-flash with controlled difficulty levels and feedback tones, creating a dataset of 1,236 questions and 14,832 feedback fields across computer science concepts. Linguistic metrics including Flesch-Kincaid readability scores, vocabulary richness (unique-to-total word ratio), lexical density (content word proportion), and feedback length are computed for each feedback field. Two-way ANOVA tests examine interaction effects between tone and difficulty on these metrics. A multi-task learning model is then developed using RoBERTa-base with separate linear heads for each metric, trained to predict linguistic properties from the text data.

## Key Results
- Significant interaction effects (p < 0.001) between feedback tone and difficulty level across all linguistic metrics, indicating AI adapts language based on both factors simultaneously
- Challenging feedback employs simpler language structures (lower Flesch-Kincaid scores) when questions are easier, compensating for the higher cognitive demand of the challenging tone
- Fine-tuned RoBERTa-based multi-task learning model achieves MAE of 2.0 for readability and 0.03 for vocabulary richness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Interactive Tone-Difficulty Adaptation
- Claim: AI-generated feedback linguistically adapts based on the *interaction* between intended tone and question difficulty, not through independent effects.
- Mechanism: The LLM integrates both constraints simultaneously during generation, producing linguistic profiles that differ from what either factor would produce alone (e.g., challenging feedback on easy questions uses simpler language than challenging feedback on hard questions).
- Core assumption: The model has internalized pedagogical patterns where linguistic complexity and cognitive demand are managed jointly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "significant interaction effects between tone and difficulty, showing that the AI dynamically adapts its language complexity and style based on both factors"
  - [section] IV.D: "Two-way ANOVAs showed significant interactions (p < 0.001) between feedback tone and difficulty level for all examined linguistic metrics... feedback length (F(4, 14823) = 15.2), readability (F(4, 14823) = 21.7)"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct corpus support; neighbor papers focus on AI text detection and persuasion rather than pedagogical adaptation mechanisms.
- Break condition: If ANOVA interaction terms were non-significant (p > 0.05), or if tone effects were consistent across all difficulty levels.

### Mechanism 2: Compensatory Simplification for Cognitive Load Management
- Claim: Challenging feedback employs simpler language structures (lower Flesch-Kincaid scores) when questions are easier, compensating for the higher cognitive demand of the challenging tone.
- Mechanism: The AI avoids compounding difficulty—when the pedagogical intent is already demanding (challenging tone on simple content), it reduces linguistic complexity to maintain comprehensibility.
- Core assumption: The model has implicitly learned that combining challenging framing with complex syntax reduces pedagogical effectiveness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "examining how feedback tone and question difficulty affect readability, vocabulary richness, and length"
  - [section] IV.B: "challenging feedback has a lower average Flesch-Kincaid score (10.2) than both supportive (11.8) and neutral feedback (11.5)... the AI model appears to compensate for the inherent difficulty of a challenging question by employing clearer, less complex sentence structures"
  - [section] IV.D: "for easy questions, challenging feedback is presented using language with a lower Flesch-Kincaid score... This suggests the AI prioritizes clarity in challenging feedback for less complex topics"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for this compensatory mechanism; neighbor papers do not address cognitive load balancing in AI feedback.
- Break condition: If challenging feedback consistently showed higher readability scores across all difficulty levels, indicating no compensatory behavior.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Task Shared Representation for Linguistic Prediction
- Claim: A fine-tuned RoBERTa backbone with separate task-specific heads can jointly predict multiple correlated linguistic properties by learning shared textual representations.
- Mechanism: The pre-trained language model encodes general linguistic patterns; task-specific linear layers project these representations to individual metrics (length, readability, vocabulary richness, lexical density), leveraging correlations between features.
- Core assumption: Linguistic metrics share underlying textual features that benefit from joint optimization rather than independent models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A fine-tuned RoBERTa-based multi-task learning (MTL) model was trained to predict these linguistic properties, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.0 for readability and 0.03 for vocabulary richness"
  - [section] IV.E: "The model builds upon a pre-trained RoBERTa-base model... A dropout layer (dropout probability = 0.1) is applied to the RoBERTa's pooled output... Each metric has its own linear layer"
  - [section] V: "The convergence of the model's training and validation losses... suggests that the model learned generalizable patterns without significant signs of overfitting"
  - [corpus]: PUCMetrix paper provides related linguistic analysis tooling (182 metrics) but not MTL prediction architectures.
- Break condition: If validation loss diverged significantly from training loss (overfitting), or if single-task models substantially outperformed MTL.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**
  - Why needed here: This is the primary readability metric used throughout the study to quantify linguistic complexity; understanding its scale and limitations is essential for interpreting results (e.g., MAE of 2.0 means predictions are within ~2 grade levels).
  - Quick check question: If a feedback text scores 11.1 on Flesch-Kincaid, what does this numerically represent, and what are two limitations of this metric for short educational feedback?

- **Concept: Two-Way ANOVA Interaction Effects**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core claim rests on significant interaction effects between tone and difficulty; you must understand what an interaction means (effect of one factor *depends on* the level of another) versus main effects.
  - Quick check question: If tone affects length the same way at all difficulty levels, would you expect a significant interaction term? Explain with a concrete example from the data.

- **Concept: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) with Shared Representations**
  - Why needed here: The predictive model uses a shared RoBERTa backbone with multiple output heads; understanding why this works (shared features, implicit regularization) versus training separate models is critical for architecture decisions.
  - Quick check question: What are two potential advantages and one risk of using a shared backbone for predicting both readability and vocabulary richness simultaneously?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Critical path:**
  1. Generate/obtain MCQ dataset with controlled difficulty and tone annotations (1,200+ questions minimum for statistical power)
  2. Compute all four linguistic metrics per feedback field using consistent tokenization
  3. Run two-way ANOVA to validate interaction effects before investing in predictive modeling
  4. Fine-tune RoBERTa-MTL with early stopping based on validation loss convergence

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Shared vs. separate encoders:** Shared backbone reduces parameters and may improve generalization, but task interference could degrade individual metric accuracy
  - **Dropout rate (0.1):** Lower dropout preserves more information from pre-trained weights but increases overfitting risk on small datasets; the paper reports successful convergence, but dataset was 14,832 samples
  - **Metric selection:** The four metrics (length, F-K, vocab richness, lexical density) are correlated; adding more metrics may not improve utility and could complicate loss balancing

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Validation loss diverging from training loss after epoch 5 → overfitting; increase dropout or reduce model capacity
  - MAE for readability > 3.0 → model not capturing structural features; consider adding syntactic features or longer fine-tuning
  - Non-significant ANOVA interactions (p > 0.05) → tone/difficulty may not be meaningful control variables in your domain; reassess dataset construction

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline single-task comparison:** Train four separate RoBERTa models (one per metric) and compare MAE against MTL to validate the shared-representation hypothesis
  2. **Cross-domain generalization test:** Evaluate the trained model on MCQs from a different subject domain (not computer science) to assess transfer; expect MAE degradation
  3. **Tone-control intervention:** Use the predictive model to filter/regenerate feedback that falls outside target linguistic ranges (e.g., F-K > 14 for "easy" questions) and measure impact on student comprehension in a small user study

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent do the specific linguistic adaptations (such as reduced readability in challenging feedback for easy questions) correlate with actual improvements in student cognitive load and learning outcomes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states future work must "consider the cognitive load and effectiveness of different tone," and Section V notes that current metrics represent only a facet of properties and a "qualitative assessment would help."
- Why unresolved: The study relies on computational linguistic metrics (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid, lexical density) as proxies for quality but does not include user studies or experimental trials with students to measure educational efficacy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical data from student trials measuring retention rates, subjective cognitive load scores, and performance improvements when using feedback generated with these specific linguistic parameters.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do the significant interaction effects between feedback tone and difficulty level persist when generating feedback for academic domains outside of computer science?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section V.B explicitly identifies "Dataset Scale and Diversity" as a limitation, noting the dataset is "limited in size and domain (computer science MCQs)" and stating "Future work is needed to investigate this concept more."
- Why unresolved: The findings are derived exclusively from a dataset of computer science concepts; it is unknown if the model's adaptation strategies (e.g., increasing length for hard questions) are universal or domain-specific.
- What evidence would resolve it: A replication of the analysis using datasets from distinct domains (e.g., humanities, social sciences) to determine if the same correlations between tone, difficulty, and linguistic metrics hold true.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can strategies for mitigating bias and ensuring transparency be effectively integrated into the fine-tuning process of the RoBERTa-based predictive model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section V.B lists "Ethical Considerations" as a challenge, stating, "Future work should address strategies for mitigating potential biases and ensuring transparency."
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that the model can predict linguistic properties, it does not investigate how training data might embed pedagogical biases or how the "black box" nature of the transformer model affects explainability.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study analyzing the model for bias across different demographic contexts or the implementation of explainability frameworks (e.g., attention visualization) to verify that predictions are based on pedagogically sound features.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can reinforcement learning-based approaches provide a qualitative improvement in feedback generation compared to the current multi-task learning model's ability to predict linguistic properties?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section V.B suggests that challenges in the current approach present "opportunity for new discoveries, like adding a reinforcement based deep learning for feedback... that allows a qualitative improvement."
- Why unresolved: The current work focuses on a supervised multi-task learning approach to predict properties; it does not explore generative reinforcement learning methods that might optimize the feedback content itself rather than just analyzing it.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating the quality and adaptability of feedback generated by a reinforcement learning agent versus the predictive accuracy of the current RoBERTa-MTL model.

## Limitations
- Dataset is domain-specific (computer science), limiting generalizability to other subjects
- Exact prompt structure used to generate MCQs and feedback is only partially shown, making exact reproduction difficult
- No comparison with simpler baseline models (e.g., linear regression or single-task learning) to demonstrate the added value of multi-task learning

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The ANOVA interaction effects between tone and difficulty are statistically significant (p < 0.001) and the observed compensatory simplification mechanism is directly supported by the data.
- **Medium Confidence:** The RoBERTa-MTL model's MAE scores are well-defined, but the advantage over simpler models is not demonstrated. The linguistic adaptation mechanisms are plausible but rely on indirect evidence.
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about pedagogical effectiveness and learning outcomes are not empirically tested in this study.

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce interaction effects:** Re-run the two-way ANOVA on the provided dataset to verify the significance of interaction terms between tone and difficulty for all linguistic metrics.
2. **Baseline model comparison:** Train single-task RoBERTa models for each metric and compare their MAE scores against the multi-task model to assess the benefit of shared representations.
3. **Cross-domain generalization:** Test the trained model on MCQs from a different subject domain (e.g., biology or history) to evaluate its transferability and identify potential overfitting.
