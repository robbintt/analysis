# ARTIS: Agentic Risk-Aware Test-Time Scaling via Iterative Simulation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01709
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01709
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Iterative simulation substantially improves agent reliability on multi-turn and multi-step agentic benchmarks by decoupling exploration from commitment and emphasizing failure-inducing actions

## Executive Summary
ARTIS introduces iterative simulation for agentic test-time scaling, enabling exploration through simulated interactions prior to real-world execution. It decouples exploration from commitment, improving action-level reliability by allowing additional inference-time computation without environmental risk. The framework employs a risk-aware tool simulator that emphasizes failure-inducing actions via targeted data generation and rebalanced training, addressing limitations of average-case accurate simulators. Experiments on multi-turn and multi-step agentic benchmarks (BFCL-v3, ACEBench) show that iterative simulation substantially improves agent reliability, with risk-aware simulation being essential for consistent gains. Sequential iteration outperforms parallel, and larger models demonstrate greater robustness to simulation noise. Results validate iterative simulation as an effective form of test-time scaling for agentic settings.

## Method Summary
ARTIS performs iterative simulation before real execution: the action agent generates candidate tool calls, the risk-aware simulator predicts outcomes, the self-evaluator assesses trajectory quality, and the summarizer produces execution guidance. This process repeats N times sequentially, with each attempt conditioning on prior simulated attempts. The simulator is fine-tuned with failure-driven rebalancing that weights training samples inversely to outcome frequency, emphasizing rare failure modes. At inference, the system performs N simulated attempts, evaluates each, summarizes the best guidance, and executes once in the real environment.

## Key Results
- Sequential iteration consistently outperforms parallel iteration across all model sizes and benchmarks
- Risk-aware simulator training improves high-fidelity ratio from 93.4% to 95.4% and accuracy from 27.0% to 29.5%
- Larger models show greater robustness to simulation noise and achieve higher gains from iterative simulation
- ARTIS achieves substantial improvements on BFCL multi-turn-base (47.6%→65.3%) and ACEBench multi-step (49.6%→65.8%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Iterative simulation enables safe exploration of action trajectories before irreversible commitment. The agent generates candidate action plans, executes them in a simulated environment, receives outcome feedback, and refines subsequent attempts. This decouples exploration (in simulation) from commitment (in real execution). Core assumption: Simulated outcomes are sufficiently faithful to real environment dynamics to provide useful learning signal. Evidence: [abstract] "enabling test-time exploration through simulated interactions prior to real-world execution...without incurring environmental risk" [section 4.2] "for each task, the agent performs multiple simulated attempts before producing a single committed execution" Break condition: If simulator fidelity drops below threshold, simulated feedback becomes misleading and performance degrades.

### Mechanism 2
Risk-aware simulator training improves detection of rare, high-impact failure modes critical for decision utility. Training data is rebalanced to upweight rare failure cases and downweight redundant successful executions. Each sample's weight is inversely proportional to outcome frequency: w(a,o) ∝ 1/freq(tool(a), type(o)). Core assumption: Average-case simulator accuracy is insufficient; decision-useful simulation requires emphasis on failure-inducing actions. Evidence: [abstract] "risk-aware tool simulator that emphasizes fidelity on failure-inducing actions via targeted data generation and rebalanced training" [table 2] Failure-driven training improves high-fidelity ratio from 93.4% to 95.4% and accuracy from 27.0% to 29.5% Break condition: If failure modes are too rare to sample adequately, or if rebalancing overfits to synthetic failures, simulator generalization may suffer.

### Mechanism 3
Sequential iteration outperforms parallel because it enables adaptive refinement based on prior attempt outcomes. Each attempt conditions on all prior simulated trajectories, evaluations, and suggestions, allowing progressive error correction. Self-evaluation produces binary correctness + natural-language feedback; summarization distills N attempts into one execution guidance. Core assumption: Agent can reliably self-evaluate simulated trajectories and extract useful refinements. Evidence: [section 4.2.2] "sequential iteration encourages diverse and non-redundant attempts, leading to more effective coverage of the action space" [table 1] ARTIS (Sequential) consistently outperforms ARTIS (Parallel) across all model sizes [figure 4] Ablation shows both self-evaluation and summarization are essential; removal causes performance collapse Break condition: For smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B, Llama3.1-8B), self-evaluation is unreliable, causing unstable gains or degradation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Test-Time Scaling (TTS)
  - Why needed here: ARTIS extends TTS from reasoning-centric settings to action-centric agentic settings. Without this foundation, the core contribution (simulated exploration before commitment) won't be interpretable.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why standard TTS methods (tree search, parallel decoding) assume intermediate steps are reversible?

- Concept: World Modeling / Environment Simulation
  - Why needed here: The risk-aware simulator is essentially a learned world model. Understanding how models predict environment dynamics is prerequisite to understanding why naive simulators fail.
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between optimizing a simulator for average-case accuracy vs. decision utility?

- Concept: Multi-Turn Agentic Tool Use
  - Why needed here: ARTIS targets multi-step, environment-interactive tasks where actions have lasting consequences. Single-turn function calling intuition doesn't transfer.
  - Quick check question: Why does action irreversibility change the design requirements for inference-time computation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Action Agent -> Tool Simulator -> Self-Evaluator -> Summarizer -> Real Environment
- Critical path: 1) Data generation → heterogeneous agents + targeted failure invocation → raw (action, outcome) pairs; 2) Rebalancing → weight by 1/freq(tool, outcome_type) → ~50K training samples; 3) Simulator SFT (LoRA, rank 16, α=32, 3 epochs max); 4) Inference: generate N sequential simulated attempts → evaluate each → summarize → execute once
- Design tradeoffs: Sequential vs. Parallel (Sequential gives better performance but higher latency; Parallel enables batched inference but risks redundant exploration); Self-evaluation vs. external verifier (Self-evaluation is cost-effective but requires minimum model capability; external verifier improves pass rate but adds dependency); Simulator base model (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct outperforms Qwen3-8B for simulator role despite comparable similarity scores)
- Failure signatures: Performance below baseline (likely simulator quality issue; check high-fidelity ratio should be >95%); Unstable scaling with N (check if summarization is being bypassed; raw trajectory context overwhelms smaller models); No gains on single-turn tasks (expected; simulation provides marginal benefit for simple one-step actions)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Simulator sanity check: Run tool simulator on held-out validation set; report similarity score and high-fidelity ratio vs. perfect simulator. Target: >95% HF ratio; 2) Ablation by N: With Qwen3-8B action agent, sweep N∈{0,3,5,8} on BFCL multi-turn-base; plot accuracy trend. Confirm sequential ARTIS outperforms baseline at N≥3; 3) Evaluator swap test: Fix action agent to Qwen3-8B; try Qwen3-8B vs. Qwen3-32B as evaluator/summarizer. Report evaluation pass rate correlation with final accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the minimum model capability threshold required for agentic TTS methods to yield consistent gains, and can this threshold be quantified across different model architectures? Basis: [explicit] The paper states "agentic TTS requires a minimum level of reasoning and self-critique capability to be effective, and that insufficient model capacity can limit or negate its benefits," noting that smaller models like Qwen3-4B and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct show unstable or negative improvements. Why unresolved: The experiments show inconsistent behavior across model sizes but do not isolate which specific capabilities (self-evaluation, refinement, etc.) are necessary nor establish a principled threshold. What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation across model scales with controlled capability assessments, measuring performance deltas relative to baseline reasoning and critique abilities.

### Open Question 2
How can the fidelity gap between risk-aware simulators and perfect simulators be further reduced without access to real environment execution during training? Basis: [explicit] Figure 4 shows persistent gaps between the full ARTIS method and the perfect simulator baseline, particularly for smaller models where "cumulative simulation noise maintains a gap relative to the perfect simulator." Why unresolved: While failure-driven data generation improves simulator quality, the fundamental challenge of predicting rare failure modes without exhaustive real-world coverage remains. What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies on alternative simulator training objectives, scaling laws for simulator model size, or hybrid approaches combining learned simulation with formal verification.

### Open Question 3
Can hybrid sequential-parallel iteration strategies achieve near-sequential performance with near-parallel efficiency? Basis: [explicit] The paper finds "Sequential iteration outperforms parallel" but notes parallel iteration's efficiency advantages in enabling "efficient parallel computation and avoiding context-length growth." Why unresolved: The tradeoff between performance and efficiency is characterized but not optimized; no intermediate strategies were explored. What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with adaptive scheduling (e.g., parallel first-pass exploration followed by sequential refinement, or early stopping based on confidence thresholds).

## Limitations

- Simulator fidelity remains a central bottleneck with persistent gaps to perfect simulation, particularly for smaller models where cumulative simulation noise maintains accuracy differences
- The sequential iteration mechanism assumes reliable self-evaluation, yet smaller models (<8B) show unstable gains due to insufficient model capability for effective self-critique
- The rebalancing scheme assumes failure types are adequately sampled and categorized, but no analysis shows whether rare failures remain underrepresented after weighting

## Confidence

- High confidence: Sequential iteration consistently outperforms parallel; simulator rebalancing improves high-fidelity ratio; risk-aware simulation is essential for consistent gains
- Medium confidence: Larger models show greater robustness to simulation noise; performance gains are stable across different model sizes when using appropriate evaluators
- Low confidence: Self-evaluation reliability thresholds; exact impact of summary quality on final accuracy; generalizability to non-tool-use agentic settings

## Next Checks

1. **Simulator error characterization**: Profile simulator failures by tool type and action pattern to identify systematic weaknesses. Test whether adding targeted failure examples for worst-performing tools improves overall fidelity.

2. **Alternative evaluator architectures**: Replace self-evaluation with external verification (Qwen3-32B) across all model sizes to test whether evaluation reliability drives performance gains. Measure correlation between evaluator pass rate and final accuracy.

3. **Summary quality analysis**: Implement automated summary quality metrics (e.g., information coverage, action suggestion relevance) and test whether summary quality predicts final execution success across different task complexities.
