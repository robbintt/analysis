# InsightEval: An Expert-Curated Benchmark for Assessing Insight Discovery in LLM-Driven Data Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22884
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22884
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: InsightEval is a high-quality benchmark for evaluating insight discovery in LLM-driven data agents, demonstrating superior accuracy and depth over existing methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces InsightEval, a meticulously curated benchmark designed to evaluate insight discovery capabilities in LLM-driven data agents. The authors identify critical flaws in prior datasets like InsightBench, such as format inconsistencies, vague goals, and redundant insights. To address these issues, they develop a rigorous data-curation pipeline and construct a new dataset with 1000 high-quality insights across six types. They also propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines Insight F1 Score with a novelty metric to provide a more accurate and in-depth assessment of agents' insight discovery capabilities.

## Method Summary
InsightEval is constructed through a four-step pipeline: goal refinement, question generation/validation, answer and insight generation, and summary synthesis. The dataset comprises 100 instances derived from InsightBench, each containing a table, a refined goal, 10 validated questions, and 1000 ground-truth insights across six types. The evaluation framework computes Insight Recall, Precision, F1 Score, and a novelty metric using multi-LLM voting. Two agent frameworks (Pandas Agent, Agent Poirot) are tested with different backbone LLMs to benchmark performance.

## Key Results
- InsightEval demonstrates more accurate and in-depth assessment of agents' insight discovery capabilities compared to existing methods.
- Agents exhibit limited breadth in insight exploration and varying performance across insight types.
- The comprehensive evaluation framework, including the novelty metric, provides a balanced view of agent performance beyond recall-only approaches.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: A rigorous data-curation pipeline can systematically reduce format inconsistencies, vague goals, and redundant insights in a benchmark for insight discovery.
- Mechanism: The pipeline enforces a four-step process: (1) Goal Refinement (validating goals against table schema and feasibility), (2) Question Generation/Validation (ensuring questions align with data and cover six defined insight types), (3) Answer & Insight Generation (using LLM-based code execution and manual de-duplication), and (4) Summary Synthesis (with human verification). Each step combines automated checks and expert review.
- Core assumption: Combining LLM-assisted generation with manual verification can correct for systematic errors in prior datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we develop a data-curation pipeline to construct a new dataset named InsightEval"
  - [section 4.2] Details the four-step construction process with manual checks.
  - [corpus] Related work (e.g., DataSage) shows LLMs can aid insight discovery but lacks focus on benchmark quality control.
- Break condition: If the manual review phase scales poorly or introduces reviewer bias, quality gains may not hold for larger datasets.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: An evaluation framework using Insight F1 Score and a novelty metric provides a more comprehensive assessment of an agent's insight discovery capability than recall-only approaches.
- Mechanism: The framework computes recall (coverage of ground-truth insights) and precision (accuracy of generated insights), combines them into an F1 score, and adds a novelty metric. Novelty uses a multi-LLM voting process (three models, majority rule) to identify valuable insights not in the ground-truth, mitigating single-evaluator bias.
- Core assumption: A balance of recall and precision, plus explicit novelty recognition, better reflects human judgment of insight quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We further introduce a novel metric to measure the exploratory performance of agents."
  - [section 6.2] "Insights F1 Scores exceeded Insight Recall Scores across all agents, and were closer to the Human Evaluation Scores."
  - [corpus] FIRE-Bench addresses similar evaluation challenges in scientific discovery using "LLM-as-judge" approaches, but InsightEval's multi-model novelty voting differs.
- Break condition: If the novelty metric's voting mechanism is too strict or too lenient, it may not correlate with actual human-perceived novelty.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Benchmarking on InsightEval reveals specific agent limitations, such as limited exploratory breadth and variable performance across insight types.
- Mechanism: By testing two agent frameworks (Pandas Agent, Agent Poirot) with different backbone LLMs (GPT-4o, Deepseek-V3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet) on InsightEval, performance differences are measured across dimensions like category, difficulty, and insight type (e.g., Descriptive, Exploratory). The controlled setup allows for comparative analysis.
- Core assumption: The benchmark's quality (clear goals, high-quality questions/insights) makes performance differences interpretable as agent capabilities rather than dataset noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experiments on InsightEval demonstrate that our benchmark provides a more accurate and in-depth assessment"
  - [section 6.2] Finding 1: "Agents Exhibit Limited Breadth in Insight Exploration"; Finding 3: Agents show higher scores in Prescriptive/Exploratory types.
  - [corpus] MedInsightBench and other related benchmarks also use multi-step evaluation but focus on specific domains (medical data).
- Break condition: If the benchmark's difficulty levels or category distributions are not representative of real-world tasks, findings may not generalize.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Insight Discovery Task Formulation**
  - Why needed here: Understanding the input-output paradigm (table + goal → questions → answers → insights → summary) is fundamental to using InsightEval.
  - Quick check question: Given a table and a goal, can you list the four components a benchmark instance must contain?

- Concept: **Insight Types Taxonomy**
  - Why needed here: InsightEval categorizes insights into six types (Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive, Evaluative, Exploratory). Agents are evaluated on their performance across these types.
  - Quick check question: Which insight type focuses on recommending specific actions? (Answer: Prescriptive)

- Concept: **Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1, and Novelty**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core evaluation innovation is the combination of these metrics. Understanding what each measures is critical for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: If an agent generates many correct but repetitive insights, which metric would be most affected? (Answer: Precision would be high, but Recall might be limited if it misses other ground-truth insights. Novelty would be low.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. **Dataset Construction Pipeline**: Goal Refinement → Question Gen/Validation → Answer/Insight Gen → Summary Synthesis.
  2. **Evaluation Framework**: Insight Recall → Insight Precision → Insight F1 Score → Novelty Metric → Summary Evaluation.
  3. **Benchmarking Harness**: Agent Wrappers (Pandas Agent, Agent Poirot) → Execution on InsightEval instances → Metric Calculation → Analysis.

- Critical path: The most critical path for a new engineer is understanding the evaluation framework (Section 4.3), as it is the primary contribution for assessing agents. The dataset construction (Section 4.2) is secondary but essential for understanding the data quality.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Automation vs. Manual Verification**: The pipeline uses LLMs for generation but requires human checks at each step. This improves quality but limits scalability.
  - **Single vs. Multi-Model Evaluation**: Using three LLMs for novelty evaluation reduces bias but increases computational cost and potential for disagreement.
  - **Comprehensiveness vs. Practicality**: The benchmark covers many dimensions (6 insight types, 8 categories, 4 difficulty levels) but is limited to 100 instances.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Redundant Insights**: If the de-duplication process fails, evaluations will be skewed. The paper reports low TF-IDF similarity and Self-BLEU scores as quality indicators.
  - **Biased Novelty Scores**: If the voting LLMs share biases, novel insights may be incorrectly rejected.
  - **Goal Misalignment**: If refined goals are still too broad, insights will be diffuse, making evaluation difficult.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce Baseline Scores**: Run the provided Pandas Agent and Agent Poirot (with GPT-4o) on a subset of InsightEval (e.g., 10 instances) and calculate Recall, Precision, F1, and Novelty. Compare with Table 4 results.
  2. **Ablate Evaluation Components**: Compute scores using only Recall, only F1, and then including Novelty to observe the impact on agent rankings and human-evaluation alignment (referencing Figure 5).
  3. **Analyze Per-Type Performance**: Use the Claude-3.7-Sonnet based Agent Poirot results to plot performance across the six insight types (as in Figure 7) to identify specific strengths and weaknesses.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can specialized multi-agent frameworks be architected to enhance the breadth and depth of automated insight discovery beyond the capabilities of current iterative agents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "In the future, we will investigate other multi-agent frameworks to enhance insight discovery performance."
- Why unresolved: Current experiments show that even advanced agents like Agent Poirot suffer from limited exploration breadth and high redundancy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking diverse multi-agent architectures on InsightEval that demonstrate statistically significant improvements in Insight F1 and Novelty scores.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What prompting strategies or architectural modifications can mitigate the tendency of agents to generate redundant, high-confidence insights rather than exploring uncertain or novel patterns?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] "Finding 1" notes that agents exhibit limited breadth, preferring high precision (redundancy) over exploratory recall.
- Why unresolved: The current agent design optimizes for safe, correct answers, leading to a "conservative" analysis behavior that misses latent insights.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing a shift in the precision-recall trade-off, specifically an increase in Insight Recall and Novelty scores without a loss of factuality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the novelty of an insight be evaluated objectively by LLMs without the assessment being biased by the specific training data or temporal context of the evaluator model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section notes that "novelty assessments remain time- and context-dependent as reference knowledge evolves."
- Why unresolved: An insight deemed novel by an LLM today may be considered common knowledge later, or vice versa, making longitudinal evaluation difficult.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study correlating LLM-based novelty scores with a static, external knowledge base or longitudinal human expert evaluation.

## Limitations
- The dataset size (100 instances) and scope (tabular data only) limit generalizability to other data modalities and real-world complexity.
- The manual verification steps in the curation pipeline, while improving quality, create a bottleneck that may hinder scalability.
- The novelty metric's reliance on LLM consensus, while mitigating bias, may not fully capture nuanced human judgment of insight value.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The dataset construction methodology (precision, recall, and F1 metrics) and the core findings about agent limitations (limited breadth, varying performance across insight types) are well-supported by the data and analysis.
- **Medium Confidence**: The novelty metric's effectiveness in identifying truly valuable insights beyond the ground truth requires further validation against diverse human evaluators.
- **Medium Confidence**: The benchmark's difficulty levels and category distributions may not be fully representative of real-world data analysis tasks, potentially limiting the generalizability of the agent performance findings.

## Next Checks
1. **Human Evaluation Expansion**: Conduct a blind human evaluation study on a larger sample of InsightEval instances to validate the alignment between the multi-LLM novelty scores and human judgment of insight value.
2. **Modality Generalization**: Test the agents and evaluation framework on a small dataset of non-tabular data (e.g., time-series or text) to assess the benchmark's applicability beyond the current scope.
3. **Longitudinal Performance Tracking**: Re-evaluate the agents on InsightEval after a period of fine-tuning or architectural improvements to track the benchmark's sensitivity to agent advancements and identify persistent bottlenecks.
