## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on compositional visual reasoning (CVR), a rapidly emerging research direction in multimodal AI. The authors systematically review over 260 papers from top venues spanning 2023-2025, tracing the evolution from monolithic vision-language models to advanced compositional approaches that explicitly decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step logical inference. They identify five key paradigm stages, from prompt-enhanced language-centric methods through tool-enhanced LLMs and VLMs to chain-of-thought reasoning and unified agentic VLMs. The survey catalogs 60+ benchmarks and evaluation metrics across various dimensions including grounding accuracy and chain-of-thought faithfulness. The authors highlight CVR's advantages in cognitive alignment, interpretability, robustness, and data efficiency, while identifying key challenges including LLM limitations, hallucination, dataset biases, and evaluation contamination. They outline future directions such as world-model integration and human-AI collaborative reasoning.

## Method Summary
This survey synthesizes literature from 260+ papers across top AI venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL) from 2023-2025. The authors categorize compositional visual reasoning methods into five evolutionary stages: (I) Prompt-Enhanced Language-Centric, (II) Tool-Enhanced LLMs, (III) Tool-Enhanced VLMs, (IV) Chain-of-Thought VLMs, and (V) Unified Agentic VLMs. They catalog 60+ benchmarks and evaluation metrics, systematically reviewing architectural innovations, training methodologies, and performance characteristics. The survey focuses on identifying patterns, challenges, and future directions rather than proposing new methods, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding CVR's current state and trajectory.

## Key Results
- CVR represents a fundamental shift from monolithic vision-language models to systems that explicitly decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step logical inference
- The field has evolved through five distinct paradigm stages over three years, with each stage introducing increasingly sophisticated compositional reasoning capabilities
- CVR offers advantages in cognitive alignment, interpretability, robustness, and data efficiency compared to traditional end-to-end approaches
- Key challenges include LLM limitations, hallucination, dataset biases, and evaluation contamination that hinder real-world deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: IF visual reasoning tasks are decomposed into explicit intermediate steps with grounding verification, THEN models may exhibit improved accuracy and reduced hallucination compared to monolithic approaches.
- Mechanism: The system breaks complex visual queries into sub-questions or reasoning steps, where each step is anchored to visual evidence (bounding boxes, segmentation masks, or spatial coordinates). This creates verifiable intermediate representations rather than implicit end-to-end mappings.
- Core assumption: Intermediate reasoning steps can be faithfully grounded in visual content without accumulating errors across the decomposition chain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "compositional approaches that explicitly decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step logical inference"
  - [section 3.5]: "compositional reasoning mitigates this by enforcing explicit grounding: intermediate reasoning steps, such as object detection, relation extraction, or visual token selection, compel the system to anchor its inferences in actual visual content"
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus evidence; related work (Griffon-R, VoCoT) shows mixed results on grounding faithfulness
- Break condition: When grounding modules are imprecise for small/occluded objects, or when semantic mismatches occur between visual inputs and symbolic reasoning representations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: IF reinforcement learning is applied to vision-language models with outcome-based rewards, THEN the model distribution may shift toward mode-seeking behavior that prioritizes correctness over diversity.
- Mechanism: RL optimization (e.g., GRPO) reshapes the output distribution from forward KL divergence (distribution matching) toward reverse KL divergence (mode-seeking), concentrating probability mass on consistently correct outputs rather than broad coverage of plausible but incorrect responses.
- Core assumption: Reward signals accurately capture reasoning quality and are not gamed by superficial patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4.2]: "RL shifts the objective toward mode-seeking via reverse KL divergence (KL(Qθ∥Pdata)), training the model to concentrate specifically on generating outputs that are consistently correct or optimal"
  - [section 4.4.2]: "RL can encourage VLMs to actively search for correct answers"
  - [corpus]: "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for eliciting reasoning chains before generating final answers" (From Sight to Insight paper)
- Break condition: When reward signals are sparse, noisy, or fail to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficial pattern matching.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: IF external visual tools are integrated with VLMs through learned coordination policies, THEN systems may achieve better fine-grained perception than relying solely on internal vision encoders.
- Mechanism: A central planner (VLM) dynamically selects and invokes specialized tools (detectors, OCR, segmenters) based on task requirements, receiving tool outputs as feedback for subsequent reasoning steps. This bypasses information bottlenecks in static vision encoders.
- Core assumption: The planner has sufficient tool-awareness to select appropriate tools and interpret their outputs correctly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3]: "Large-scale VLMs are dynamically augmented with external tools, enabling selective invocation of specialized systems"
  - [section 6.2.5]: "Vision encoders introduce information bottlenecks by projecting low-resolution inputs into limited token spaces"
  - [corpus]: "Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models" survey notes high computational costs as a limitation of tool-enhanced approaches
- Break condition: When tool outputs are noisy, when the planner lacks tool-awareness training, or when computational overhead makes real-time deployment impractical.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Visual Grounding and Attention Mechanisms**
  - Why needed here: CVR systems require explicit spatial references (bounding boxes, segmentation) to anchor reasoning steps to image regions; understanding cross-modal attention is essential for interpreting how language queries map to visual evidence.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a vision-language model determines which image region corresponds to "the red car next to the tree"?

- Concept: **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Paradigms**
  - Why needed here: Stages IV-V of CVR rely on explicit reasoning traces; understanding CoT structure (decomposition, intermediate steps, synthesis) is necessary to evaluate reasoning faithfulness versus post-hoc rationalization.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a faithful chain-of-thought from a plausible but ungrounded explanation?

- Concept: **Reinforcement Learning from Human/AI Feedback (RLHF/RLAIF)**
  - Why needed here: Multiple CVR approaches (Vision-R1, Ground-R1, Reason-RFT) use RL to optimize reasoning quality; understanding policy optimization and reward shaping is critical for training these systems.
  - Quick check question: How does reverse KL divergence differ from forward KL divergence in shaping model output distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Perception layer (vision encoder → visual tokens) → Reasoning core (LLM/VLM) → Grounding modules (detectors, segmenters, OCR) → Coordination layer (planner/agentic controller) → Memory/context (visual working memory) → Feedback loop (verification mechanisms)

- Critical path: Input image + query → vision encoder → visual tokens → query decomposition by LLM/VLM → grounding action → tool execution → visual evidence extraction → synthesis of intermediate results → final answer → (optional) reflection/verification pass

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Modularity vs. latency**: Tool-enhanced systems offer flexibility but introduce sequential execution overhead
  - **Grounding granularity vs. computational cost**: High-resolution perception improves accuracy but increases token counts and processing time
  - **RL supervision vs. data requirements**: RL-based methods reduce annotation needs but require carefully designed reward functions and curriculum
  - **Single-pass vs. iterative**: CoT VLMs are faster but may lack error correction; agentic systems enable refinement at higher latency

- Failure signatures:
  - **Hallucination cascade**: Incorrect early grounding step propagates errors through subsequent reasoning
  - **Tool selection errors**: Planner invokes inappropriate tools for task type (e.g., OCR for spatial reasoning)
  - **Grounding drift**: Intermediate steps reference visual evidence that doesn't match the original query intent
  - **Shortcuts in reasoning chains**: Model generates plausible-looking steps that don't causally connect to the answer

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline comparison**: Evaluate monolithic VLM (e.g., LLaVA) vs. compositional approach (e.g., VIREO) on compositional generalization benchmarks (GQA, CLEVR) to measure grounding accuracy and hallucination rates.
  2. **Ablation on grounding granularity**: Compare bounding-box grounding vs. segmentation-based grounding on fine-grained perception tasks (V*Bench) to quantify the tradeoff between precision and inference latency.
  3. **Tool-awareness probing**: Test whether a tool-enhanced VLM correctly selects tools across varying query types, measuring tool selection accuracy and error recovery rates when tool outputs are intentionally corrupted.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can explicit internal world models be integrated into compositional visual reasoning systems to support spatial transformations and counterfactual inference?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6.2.1 identifies the lack of an internal world model in LLM-based reasoning as a central limitation, noting that models rely on linguistic priors rather than perceptual evidence.
- **Why unresolved:** Current architectures are optimized for next-token prediction (System 1 reasoning) rather than iterative self-correction or causal inference required for physical simulation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Agents capable of successfully predicting physical object reconfigurations or spatial outcomes (e.g., "will the cup fit?") without prior exposure to specific visual configurations.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can benchmarks be redesigned to evaluate the faithfulness and coherence of intermediate reasoning steps rather than just final answer accuracy?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5.3 and Section 6.2.6 highlight that current benchmarks fail to evaluate explicit intermediate reasoning steps, often allowing models to exploit shortcuts to correct answers.
- **Why unresolved:** Traditional metrics like BLEU or grounding scores provide only indirect assessments and fail to measure causal consistency within the reasoning chain.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The adoption of benchmarks with detailed annotations for step-level consistency and difficulty-aware scoring that differentiate reasoning capabilities.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can CVR systems be advanced to incorporate inductive, abductive, and analogical reasoning to improve robustness against noisy or biased inputs?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6.2.3 notes a prevalent bias toward deductive reasoning, which produces errors when initial premises are flawed, and suggests alternative paradigms as future directions.
- **Why unresolved:** Current models struggle with generalizing patterns from observation (inductive) or generating plausible explanations from ambiguity (abductive), limiting their adaptability.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Models demonstrating superior performance on tasks requiring generalization from few instances or explanation generation in visually ambiguous scenarios.

## Limitations

- The survey relies on published papers which may exhibit publication bias toward positive results and overstate methodological advances
- Claims about CVR's advantages in cognitive alignment and data efficiency are theoretically sound but lack systematic empirical validation across all application domains
- Predictions about future directions (world-model integration, human-AI collaborative reasoning) are speculative and lack concrete implementation roadmaps or performance benchmarks

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The five-stage paradigm framework is well-supported by clear architectural distinctions and representative model examples. The catalog of 60+ benchmarks and evaluation metrics appears comprehensive based on the cited literature.
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about CVR's advantages in cognitive alignment, interpretability, and data efficiency are theoretically sound but lack systematic empirical validation across all application domains. The identified challenges (LLM limitations, dataset biases) are well-documented but their relative impact remains context-dependent.
- **Low confidence**: Predictions about future directions (world-model integration, human-AI collaborative reasoning) are speculative and lack concrete implementation roadmaps or performance benchmarks.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic ablation studies comparing monolithic VLMs versus compositional approaches across multiple reasoning tasks to quantify grounding accuracy improvements and hallucination reduction rates.
2. Evaluate the computational overhead of tool-enhanced CVR systems in real-time deployment scenarios to assess the modularity vs. latency tradeoff empirically.
3. Test reward function design in RL-based CVR training to determine whether optimization captures genuine reasoning quality versus superficial pattern matching.
