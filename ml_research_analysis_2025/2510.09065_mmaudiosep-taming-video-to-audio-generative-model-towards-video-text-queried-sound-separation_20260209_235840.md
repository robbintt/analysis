# MMAudioSep: Taming Video-to-Audio Generative Model Towards Video/Text-Queried Sound Separation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.09065
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09065
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** MMAudioSep fine-tunes pretrained video-to-audio generation models for sound separation, achieving superior performance over existing models while retaining generation capabilities.

## Executive Summary
MMAudioSep presents a novel approach that adapts pretrained video-to-audio generation models for video/text-queried sound separation by leveraging their multimodal knowledge through fine-tuning. The method introduces channel-concatenation conditioning, where mixture audio latents are concatenated with Gaussian noise as additional input, enabling the model to separate target sounds from mixtures while conditioning on video or text queries. MMAudioSep outperforms state-of-the-art separation models across multiple datasets and maintains its original generation functionality, demonstrating the potential of foundational sound generation models as adaptable frameworks for downstream audio tasks.

## Method Summary
MMAudioSep fine-tunes the pretrained MMAudio model for sound separation by modifying the audio input projection layer to concatenate mixture audio latents with Gaussian noise along the channel dimension. The model uses Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) as its training objective, where the conditioning input includes both the original video/text queries and the mixture audio information. During training, target audio clips are mixed with interference clips at random SNR levels (-15 to 15 dB), and the model learns to extract the target source conditioned on the multimodal query and mixture content. The fine-tuning process selectively updates only the audio projection layer and MM-DiT blocks while freezing other parameters, preserving the model's generation capabilities.

## Key Results
- MMAudioSep outperforms existing separation models including AudioSep and FlowSep across multiple evaluation datasets (VGGSound-Clean and MUSIC).
- The model achieves superior separation performance when fine-tuned from pretrained MMAudio weights compared to scratch training.
- MMAudioSep retains its original video-to-audio generation capabilities after fine-tuning, successfully generating coherent audio from video and text queries when random noise is used as the mixture input.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Channel-Concatenation Conditioning
- **Claim:** Concatenating mixture audio latents with Gaussian noise enables separation without architectural restructuring.
- **Mechanism:** The mixture mel-spectrogram is encoded to latent vectors x_m via a VAE, then concatenated with noise x_0 before projection into the transformer. The flow matching process transforms only the target latent dimension while the mixture channel remains unchanged, providing parallel conditioning.
- **Core assumption:** The mixture latent contains sufficient information about the target source that the model can learn to extract it when guided by video/text queries.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.2 describes the concatenation process, Figure 3 shows the diagram, and DGMO paper explores similar pretrained model transfer approaches.

### Mechanism 2: Pretrained Multimodal Knowledge Transfer
- **Claim:** Knowledge learned from video-to-audio generation transfers to sound separation, reducing training requirements and improving performance over scratch training.
- **Mechanism:** MMAudio's pretrained weights encode relationships between visual features (CLIP semantic + Synchformer temporal), text embeddings, and audio latents. Fine-tuning selectively updates audio projection layer and transformer blocks while freezing other parameters.
- **Core assumption:** The multimodal alignment learned during generation—mapping video frames and text to corresponding audio features—is relevant for identifying which components of a mixture correspond to the query.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states the efficiency claim, Table 1 shows quantitative improvements, Table 2 demonstrates V2A capability retention, and DGMO/Training-Free papers provide convergent evidence.

### Mechanism 3: Flow Matching for Unified Generation-Separation
- **Claim:** Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) provides a single mathematical framework that naturally extends from audio generation to separation by changing only the conditioning input.
- **Mechanism:** CFM learns a velocity field v_θ(t, C, x_t) that defines trajectories from noise x_0 to data x_1 in latent space. For generation, C = {video, text}; for separation, C = {video, text, mixture_latent}.
- **Core assumption:** The optimal transport path from noise to separated audio can be learned with the same architecture as noise-to-generated-audio.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.1 defines the CFM objective, section 3.2 states the objective is identical to MMAudio, and FlowSep/Frieren papers validate flow-based approaches for audio separation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Conditional Flow Matching / Rectified Flow**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire training objective and inference procedure depends on understanding how flow models construct data from noise via learned velocity fields.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a velocity field v_θ and starting noise x_0, can you trace how Euler integration would produce x_1 over 25 steps with guidance strength 4.5?

- **Variational Autoencoders for Audio (Audio VAEs)**
  - **Why needed here:** The model operates in a 40-dimensional latent space at 43 fps rather than raw audio. Understanding compression/reconstruction tradeoffs is critical for interpreting FAD and quality metrics.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a 44.1 kHz audio signal encoded to 40-dim latents at 43 fps potentially lose information relevant to separation, and how does BiGVGAN vocoding affect the final output?

- **Multimodal Transformers with Adaptive Layer Normalization (adaLN)**
  - **Why needed here:** The MM-DiT architecture uses adaLN to inject pooled video/text features as global conditioning, and frame-aligned Synchformer features for temporal synchronization.
  - **Quick check question:** How does adaLN differ from cross-attention for conditioning, and what might be the implications for which features the model attends to during separation vs. generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input Stage: Video (CLIP + Synchformer) + Text (CLIP tokenizer) + Audio (Mixture waveform → Mel-spectrogram → VAE encoder → 40-dim latents) → Concatenated with Gaussian noise
  Projection Stage: Video/text → Linear → hidden dim h; Audio (noise + mixture) → Modified Linear → hidden dim h
  Transformer Stage: N₁ × MM-DiT blocks (multimodal attention) + N₂ × Audio-only transformer blocks + adaLN injection of pooled video/text
  Output Stage: Generated latents → VAE decoder → Mel-spectrogram → BiGVGAN vocoder → 44.1 kHz waveform

- **Critical path:** The channel-concatenation in the audio projection layer is the single architectural change. If this layer's weight initialization is incorrect or the concatenation dimension mismatches, the entire separation capability fails while generation (with noise-only input) may still work.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Frozen vs. full fine-tuning: Table 2 shows frozen parameters achieve better V2A retention (IS 14.99) than full fine-tuning (IS 13.47), but Table 1 shows mixed separation results.
  - 44.1 kHz vs. lower sample rates: Higher fidelity captures fine spectral details but increases computational cost and may introduce high-frequency artifacts.
  - Scratch vs. pretrained: Scratch training underperforms across all metrics, confirming pretrained knowledge is essential.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - White noise leakage: Section 4.3 notes white noise occurrences in V2A mode after separation training.
  - Catastrophic forgetting of generation: Aggressive fine-tuning degrades V2A capability.
  - FlowSep performance gap on MUSIC: FAD 18.87 vs. 1.14 for MMAudioSep suggests deployment/versioning issues.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation on freezing strategy: Compare frozen-only, feature-extractor-frozen, and full fine-tuning variants across separation and generation tasks.
  2. Channel-concatenation vs. cross-attention conditioning: Implement and compare both mechanisms to evaluate scalability and disentanglement.
  3. SNR sensitivity sweep: Evaluate separation performance at fixed SNR points from -20 dB to +15 dB to identify operational boundaries.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can MMAudioSep be enhanced to support universal sound separation for categories outside the current training distribution?
- What methodologies are required to eliminate white noise occurrences and ensure stable video-to-audio generation post-fine-tuning?
- To what extent do the multimodal representations learned by MMAudioSep transfer to downstream tasks like sound event detection?

## Limitations
- The channel-concatenation conditioning mechanism's effectiveness at extreme SNR conditions (< -15 dB) remains unproven.
- The exact parameter initialization for the modified audio projection layer is underspecified.
- The frozen vs. full fine-tuning tradeoff shows inconsistent results across metrics and datasets.

## Confidence
- **High:** Pretrained knowledge transfer mechanism is strongly supported by quantitative comparisons and convergent evidence from related work.
- **Medium:** Flow matching framework's suitability for separation is plausible but requires validation of linear flow assumptions at low SNR.
- **Medium:** Channel-concatenation's simplicity is demonstrated but cross-attention alternatives remain unexplored for scalability.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies comparing frozen-only, feature-extractor-frozen, and full fine-tuning variants across both separation and generation tasks.
2. Implement and evaluate channel-concatenation versus cross-attention conditioning mechanisms for scalability and disentanglement performance.
3. Perform controlled SNR sensitivity experiments at fixed points from -20 dB to +15 dB to identify operational boundaries where separation fails.
