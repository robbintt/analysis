# Do LLMs have a Gender (Entropy) Bias?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.20343
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20343
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: No significant gender entropy bias at category level; localized question-level disparities revealed by LLM-as-judge; prompt-based debiasing increases information richness in 78% of cases.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether Large Language Models exhibit gender entropy bias—systematic differences in information content of responses based on gender attributes of input queries. Using a curated dataset of 870 real-world questions across education, jobs, investment, and health domains, the authors test four LLMs (ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, ChatGPT 4 Turbo, Llama3, and DeepSeek-R1) for both male and female perspectives. While aggregate entropy metrics show no significant bias at the category level, deeper qualitative analysis reveals localized question-level disparities. A simple, model-agnostic debiasing approach is proposed that merges gendered responses to produce higher-entropy outputs in 78% of cases, improving both fairness and information richness.

## Method Summary
The study uses a newly curated "RealWorldQuestioning" dataset (HuggingFace: SonalPrabhune/RealWorldQuestioning) containing 870 gender-attributed questions from discussion forums (Reddit, Quora, MarketWatch). Four LLMs are queried with male/female variants of each question, generating responses at temperature=1 with isolated contexts. Shannon entropy, CTTR, and Maas metrics measure lexical diversity; Welch's t-tests assess statistical significance. An LLM-as-judge (ChatGPT-4o) evaluates information content by comparing anonymized response pairs. A prompt-based iterative merging strategy combines male/female responses to maximize entropy and reduce bias.

## Key Results
- Category-level entropy metrics show no significant gender bias (p > 0.05 across most categories).
- 1.12%–38.20% of individual questions show significant entropy differences (p < 0.05).
- LLM-as-judge reveals directional preferences, with Llama3 favoring male responses in 70–80% of cases.
- Debiased responses exceed entropy of both original gendered variants in 77–90% of cases.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Aggregate-level statistical tests may mask localized gender-based disparities in LLM response information content.
- Mechanism: Shannon entropy, CTTR, and Maas metrics capture lexical diversity at the response level; t-tests compare male vs. female attributed responses across categories. Disparities at the question level can offset when aggregated (e.g., some favor male, others female).
- Core assumption: Lexical diversity metrics serve as valid proxies for information richness in recommendation contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Entropy and lexical richness metrics show no significant gender bias at the category level. However... question-level disparities" which "cancel each other out often."
  - [Section 5.1, Table 4] T-tests across categories mostly show p > 0.05; Table 5 shows 1.12%–38.20% of questions with significant differences (p < 0.05).
  - [corpus] Related work (MALIBU Benchmark, LFTF) confirms bias can be context-localized and benefit from fine-grained probing.
- Break condition: If response length correlates weakly with actual utility, entropy-based bias detection loses validity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: An LLM-as-judge can surface qualitative information disparities not captured by entropy metrics alone.
- Mechanism: ChatGPT-4o compares anonymized male/female response pairs (labeled "text1"/"text2") and judges which contains more information. This reveals directional preferences at the question level.
- Core assumption: The judge LLM evaluates information content consistently and without its own gender biases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLM-as-judge evaluations reveal localized question-level disparities."
  - [Section 5.2, Table 6] LLM-as-judge favored one response in 93–100% of cases, often favoring male responses (e.g., Llama3: 70–80% male-favored).
  - [corpus] LLM-as-judge is widely adopted (Zheng et al., 2024), though its own biases warrant caution.
- Break condition: If the judge model exhibits systematic preference for longer responses regardless of quality, results conflate length with information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A prompt-based iterative merging strategy can debias responses while improving information richness.
- Mechanism: For a given query, generate male- and female-attributed responses separately. Then use a three-stage prompt chain (combine → refine → format) to merge them, selecting the output with highest Shannon entropy.
- Core assumption: Merged responses preserve and integrate the strongest content from both gendered variants.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A simple, model-agnostic debiasing approach... produces responses with higher information content than both gendered variants in 78% of cases."
  - [Section 6, Table 7] Across categories, debiased responses exceeded entropy of both originals in 77–90% of cases; t-tests between debiased male/female versions show p = 0.72–0.90.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific merging approach; similar debiasing via fine-tuning (LFTF) exists but requires model access.
- Break condition: If merging prompts inadvertently introduce new stereotypes, the debiasing may be superficial.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Shannon entropy for text (H = -Σp(x)log p(x))
  - Why needed here: Quantifies vocabulary diversity; higher entropy suggests richer information content.
  - Quick check question: If two responses have identical word counts but one uses more unique words, which has higher entropy?

- Concept: Corrected Type-Token Ratio (CTTR) and Maas measures
  - Why needed here: Length-normalized lexical diversity metrics reduce confounding from response length.
  - Quick check question: Why might raw type-token ratio be misleading for comparing responses of different lengths?

- Concept: Statistical significance testing (Welch's t-test) for bias detection
  - Why needed here: Distinguishes systematic bias from random generation variance across multiple runs.
  - Quick check question: If p = 0.15 for male vs. female entropy differences, can we claim no bias exists at the individual question level?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset curation (RealWorldQuestioning) -> gender attribute injection -> LLM response generation (ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, 4 Turbo, Llama3, DeepSeek-R1) -> metric computation (Shannon entropy, CTTR, Maas) -> statistical analysis (t-tests) -> LLM-as-judge evaluation -> debiasing pipeline (iterative merging)

- Critical path: Question curation → gender attribute injection → LLM response generation → metric computation → evaluation → debiasing. Each step must preserve traceability to original gender attribution.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Binary gender scope simplifies analysis but excludes non-binary perspectives (acknowledged by authors).
  - Shannon entropy captures lexical diversity but not semantic coherence.
  - LLM-as-judge scales evaluation but introduces another model's potential biases.
  - Prompt-based debiasing is model-agnostic but requires additional inference cost (3× per query).

- Failure signatures:
  - Aggregate statistics show no bias but individual questions show 30–40% significant disparities (Table 5).
  - LLM-as-judge consistently favors male responses (e.g., Llama3: 70–80%) despite entropy metrics showing parity.
  - Debiasing produces merged responses with lower entropy than originals (should be rare per Table 7).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproducibility check**: Run the same 870 questions through ChatGPT-3.5-turbo with temperature=1, compute Shannon entropy for male/female pairs, verify t-test results match Table 4.
  2. **Metric sensitivity**: Replace Shannon entropy with semantic-aware entropy (e.g., WordNet-based) on a 50-question subset to test whether lexical vs. semantic measures yield different bias conclusions.
  3. **Debiasing ablation**: Test whether single-prompt merging (P1 only) achieves similar entropy gains compared to the full three-prompt chain (P1→P2→P3) on 20 questions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does gender entropy bias manifest differently or persist when evaluating non-binary gender identities compared to the binary male/female attributes tested in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly restrict the scope to binary genders, stating, "we leave the non-binary analyses to future work (the nuances there warrant separate and careful consideration)."
- Why unresolved: The current experimental design and dataset modification only account for male and female attributes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the RealWorldQuestioning dataset to include non-binary pronouns and identities, then measuring entropy differences across these attributes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do semantic-based entropy metrics (e.g., using WordNet) capture gender bias in information content more accurately than the lexical metrics (Shannon Entropy, CTTR, Maas) used in this study?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge limitations in their chosen metrics, noting, "future research might suggest a better choice of metrics for measuring information content in LLM-generated responses."
- Why unresolved: Shannon Entropy and CTTR measure lexical variety and frequency but may not fully capture the semantic value or relevance of the information provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis applying semantic similarity metrics to the dataset to determine if they reveal significant biases that lexical metrics missed.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the proposed prompt-based debiasing method effective across all tested LLMs (specifically Llama3 and DeepSeek-R1) or is it overfitted to ChatGPT-3.5-turbo?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors limited the demonstration of their debiasing approach to ChatGPT-3.5-turbo, noting they "used only the ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo for demonstrating the debiasing approaches because we saw higher variations... with that LLM."
- Why unresolved: The efficacy of the iterative merging strategy was not explicitly quantified for the open-source models tested in the paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running the iterative debiasing pipeline (Algorithm 4) on Llama3 and DeepSeek-R1 outputs and reporting the percentage of cases with higher entropy.

## Limitations

- Binary gender framing excludes non-binary perspectives despite acknowledgment in discussion.
- Shannon entropy measures lexical diversity but not semantic coherence or practical utility.
- LLM-as-judge introduces potential circularity if judge model has its own gender biases.
- Debiasing prompts are conceptually described but not provided verbatim, affecting reproducibility.
- Aggregate "no bias" findings may mask meaningful disparities in specific question types (1.12%–38.20% show p < 0.05).

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Category-level entropy metrics show no significant gender bias (p > 0.05 across most categories, Table 4).
- **Medium confidence**: Question-level disparities exist but cancel out at aggregate level (Table 5 shows 1.12%–38.20% of questions with p < 0.05 differences).
- **Medium confidence**: LLM-as-judge reveals directional preferences favoring male responses in 70–80% of cases (Llama3, Table 6).
- **Medium confidence**: Debiasing approach produces higher-entropy responses in 78% of cases and achieves p = 0.72–0.90 for debiased male vs. female comparisons (Table 7).

## Next Checks

1. **Judge model bias audit**: Run the LLM-as-judge pipeline on 100 question pairs where response lengths are explicitly matched (truncate longer responses to match shorter ones). Compare whether directional preferences persist when length is controlled, isolating whether judge preferences reflect information content or length bias.

2. **Semantic vs. lexical diversity**: Apply semantic-aware lexical diversity measures (e.g., WordNet-based semantic entropy) to 50 randomly selected questions from the dataset. Compare whether semantic measures reveal different bias patterns than Shannon entropy, testing whether lexical diversity adequately captures information richness.

3. **Debiasing prompt ablation**: Test the debiasing pipeline on 30 questions using only the first merge prompt (P1) versus the full three-prompt chain (P1→P2→P3). Measure entropy differences and determine whether the iterative refinement adds meaningful improvement or if simple merging suffices.
