# Causal-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.02910
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02910
- **Authors**: Geonwoo Cho; Jaegyun Im; Doyoon Kim; Sundong Kim
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposes a curriculum learning framework using ensemble disagreement to detect causally distinct tasks without requiring known causal structures

## Executive Summary
Causal-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL) introduces a curriculum learning framework that guides agents toward causally underexplored tasks using ensemble disagreement as a proxy for structural causal model differences. Unlike prior methods requiring known causal structures, CP-DRL approximates these differences through modular ensemble models of state, action, transition, and reward, combined with reward-based learnability. The method integrates this causal misalignment signal into an optimal transport-based curriculum update, achieving faster convergence and higher returns than strong baselines on Point Mass and Bipedal Walker benchmarks, particularly in structurally diverse environments.

## Method Summary
CP-DRL trains modular ensemble models (state VAE, action VAE, transition predictor, reward predictor) on interaction data and uses their disagreement as a proxy for causal misalignment between tasks. This signal is combined with reward gain to form a unified objective that balances exploration of novel causal structures with exploitation of learnable tasks. The unified cost is incorporated into a constrained optimal transport framework that updates the task distribution toward the target while maintaining feasibility constraints. The method operates without requiring ground-truth causal graphs, making it applicable to environments where structural causal models are unknown.

## Key Results
- Achieves faster convergence and higher returns than strong baselines on Point Mass and Bipedal Walker benchmarks
- Particularly effective in structurally diverse or infeasible settings where traditional methods struggle
- Demonstrates limitations in uniform structural settings like Sparse Goal Reaching where causal differences are absent
- Provides a practical, structure-aware approach to curriculum design without requiring explicit causal models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Ensemble disagreement serves as a viable proxy for Structural Causal Model (SCM) differences when ground-truth causal graphs are unavailable.
- **Mechanism**: The system trains modular ensembles on interaction data. High variance across ensemble members for a specific task indicates the task's underlying dynamics deviate from the agent's current internal model, signaling high "Causal Misalignment."
- **Core assumption**: Assumes differences in causal structure manifest as prediction errors or uncertainty in transition and reward functions, and ensemble variance captures this epistemic uncertainty.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "...framework aware of SCM differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation."
  - [section 3.1]: "...estimate the differences... by measuring the disagreement across modular ensemble models... A high level of disagreement indicates that the task's causal structure significantly differs..."
  - [corpus]: Neighbor papers support integrating causal inference to improve generalization, but do not validate this specific disagreement proxy.
- **Break condition**: If the environment is stochastic or reward signal is sparse, ensemble disagreement may reflect noise rather than structural causal difference.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Combining structural novelty signal (Causal Misalignment) with learnability signal (Reward Gain) stabilizes curriculum progression.
- **Mechanism**: Calculates unified objective score. "Causal Misalignment" drives agent toward tasks with unlearned structural properties (exploration), while "Reward Gain" ensures focus on tasks where actual progress is made (exploitation/learnability).
- **Core assumption**: Assumes high causal difference alone is insufficient for learning; tasks must also be solvable enough to provide gradient signal.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "...signal captures task novelty, which is combined with the agent's learnability, measured by reward gain, to form a unified objective."
  - [section 3.1]: "To balance novelty with learnability, we combine the causal misalignment score with the agent's reward improvement..."
  - [corpus]: Standard curriculum learning often uses competence or progress, but explicit weighting of "causal novelty" is specific to this architecture.
- **Break condition**: If reward shaping is poor or task is infeasible, reward gain signal may collapse, causing curriculum to stall or rely entirely on noisy novelty.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Using unified objective as cost constraint in Optimal Transport problem creates smooth, structure-aware curriculum.
- **Mechanism**: Extends CURROT (Constrained Optimal Transport). Minimizes Wasserstein distance to target distribution while constraining step size based on combined cost of unified objective. Ensures task distribution shifts toward goal without jumping to tasks that are causally too distinct or unrewarding.
- **Core assumption**: Assumes task space is continuous and Wasserstein distance effectively measures "effort" required to move between task distributions.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 2.3]: Describes minimization of $W_2$ distance subject to return constraints.
  - [section 3.1]: "This unified signal is then incorporated into an optimal transport-based curriculum optimization framework... enabling the curriculum to prioritize tasks..."
  - [corpus]: "Realistic Curriculum Reinforcement Learning" and others validate curriculum pacing, but do not specifically confirm Optimal Transport mechanism's superiority for causal pacing over other methods.
- **Break condition**: If "cost" (unified objective) is mis-specified, optimal transport solver may find degenerate path or fail to converge to target distribution.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Structural Causal Models (SCMs) in RL
  - **Why needed here**: Paper frames RL tasks as SCMs ($U, V, F, P$). Understanding that $S_{t+1}$ and $R_t$ are endogenous variables determined by structural functions $F$ of $S_t$ and $A_t$ is required to grasp what "causal difference" represents.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain why knowing the SCM of a task helps predict the transferability of a policy to a new task?

- **Concept**: Epistemic Uncertainty (Ensemble Disagreement)
  - **Why needed here**: Core novelty involves using standard deviation of ensemble predictions as proxy for "unknown" causal structures.
  - **Quick check question**: Why does a random ensemble initialization fail to agree on predictions for data points far from training distribution?

- **Concept**: Optimal Transport (Wasserstein Distance)
  - **Why needed here**: CP-DRL builds upon CURROT, which uses Wasserstein distance to define geometry of curriculum.
  - **Quick check question**: How does Wasserstein distance differ from KL-Divergence when moving probability mass between two non-overlapping task distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  - **Teacher**: Solves Constrained Optimal Transport problem to output context distribution $p(c)$
  - **Student**: RL agent (e.g., PPO or SAC) interacting with environment
  - **Model Zoo**: Four sets of ensemble networks (State VAE, Action VAE, Transition Predictor, Reward Predictor)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Sample tasks from current distribution
  2. Collect trajectories and train/update Model Zoo (ensembles)
  3. Compute Disagreement (std dev) for each component
  4. Aggregate into Causal Misalignment (CM) Score
  5. Combine CM score with episodic reward to form cost
  6. Update context distribution via Optimal Transport

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Weighting ($w_i$)**: Section 3.1 mentions weighting component disagreements. Paper sets some weights (like state/action) to 0 in Point Mass (Table 1), suggesting relevance of specific causal components varies by environment
  - **Deterministic Assumption**: Method assumes deterministic transitions (Section 2.2). Applying to stochastic environments requires validating that ensemble disagreement tracks causal structure rather than aleatoric noise

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Low Structural Variation**: Appendix F (SGR environment) shows that if tasks differ only by goal position (constant causal structure), disagreement signal is just noise, causing CP-DRL to underperform simpler baselines
  - **Sparse Rewards**: Section 5 and Appendix E note that reward disagreement is unreliable in sparse settings, requiring weighting $w_{reward}$ to be adjusted or ignored

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Toy Validation**: Implement CausalWorld experiment (Section 3.2). Train ensembles on Task T1 and verify disagreement increases monotonically from T1 to T4 to confirm proxy works
  2. **Point Mass Reproduction**: Replicate "gate width" curriculum (Figure 6c) to verify agent prioritizes narrowing gates based on CM score
  3. **Ablation on SGR**: Run Sparse Goal Reaching task (Appendix F) to observe exactly how method degrades when causal differences are absent, ensuring can detect when not to use this architecture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes deterministic environments for causal misalignment to be meaningful, limiting applicability to stochastic domains where ensemble disagreement may reflect aleatoric uncertainty rather than structural differences
- Weighting scheme for ensemble components (Table 1) appears tuned per environment rather than derived from principled criteria, raising questions about generalizability
- CURROT constraint threshold δ is described only as "decreasing over time" without specifying schedule, making exact reproduction challenging

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Core mechanism of using ensemble disagreement as proxy for causal structure differences is well-supported by empirical results across multiple benchmarks
- **Medium confidence**: Combination of causal misalignment with reward gain provides stable curriculum progression, though specific weighting appears heuristic
- **Low confidence**: Optimal transport formulation's superiority over simpler curriculum pacing methods is not rigorously established

## Next Checks
1. Test CP-DRL on stochastic variant of Bipedal Walker environment to verify whether ensemble disagreement still tracks causal structure when aleatoric uncertainty is present
2. Implement ablation study varying ensemble disagreement weights systematically rather than environment-specific tuning to assess robustness
3. Compare CP-DRL's optimal transport curriculum against simpler progress-based curriculum on same benchmarks to quantify benefit of OT formulation
