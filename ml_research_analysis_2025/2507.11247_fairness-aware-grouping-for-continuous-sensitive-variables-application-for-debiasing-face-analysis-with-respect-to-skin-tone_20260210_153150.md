# Fairness-Aware Grouping for Continuous Sensitive Variables: Application for Debiasing Face Analysis with respect to Skin Tone

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.11247
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11247
- Authors: Veronika Shilova; Emmanuel Malherbe; Giovanni Palma; Laurent Risser; Jean-Michel Loubes
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces a method to partition continuous sensitive attributes (like skin tone) into groups that maximize inter-group variance in discrimination, improving fairness assessment and mitigation.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of fairness evaluation for continuous sensitive attributes, which are often oversimplified into predefined groups like the Fitzpatrick scale. The authors propose a method that identifies partitions maximizing inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby isolating the most critical subgroups for a given classification task. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, they demonstrate that their approach uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than traditional methods and can be used for effective debiasing with minimal impact on accuracy.

## Method Summary
The method defines a fairness measure Φ(k) = P(Y=1|SP=k) - P(Y=1) for each potential group, then searches for partitions P that maximize Var(Φ(SP)). When fairness is monotonic with respect to the sensitive attribute, K-Means clustering on local discrimination estimates provides an efficient approximation. The approach includes an optional post-processing step using optimal transport to reduce dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes while minimizing accuracy loss.

## Key Results
- FairGroups partition identifies more nuanced discrimination patterns than predefined groupings like Fitzpatrick scale
- The method is stable across different population distributions, with high Rand Index agreement between partitions trained on different datasets
- Post-processing with optimal transport achieves improved fairness (HGR reduced from 0.126 to 0.039) with only 1.2% accuracy loss
- Partitions vary significantly across different attributes, confirming the need for task-specific grouping rather than one-size-fits-all approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Partitioning continuous sensitive attributes by maximizing inter-group variance in discrimination isolates the most affected subgroups more effectively than predefined groupings.
- **Mechanism:** The method defines a fairness measure Φ(k) = P(Y=1|SP=k) - P(Y=1) for each potential group, then searches for partitions P maximizing Var(Φ(SP)). This variance decomposition weights each group by its probability, ensuring identified groups are both highly discriminated and sufficiently large to matter.
- **Core assumption:** Discrimination manifests as systematic differences in outcome rates across regions of the sensitive attribute space; these differences can be captured by connected partitions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "identifies the partition that maximizes a novel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby isolating the most critical subgroups"
  - [Section 4.1, Equation 8]: Shows variance = Σ P(SP=k)[Φ(k) - E[Φ(SP)]]²
  - [Section 4.3, Proposition 1]: For K=2, variance = π(1-π)DI², balancing disparate impact and group size
  - [corpus]: Weak direct validation; related papers (FairUDT, Continuous Fair SMOTE) address fairness in different contexts but don't test variance-maximizing partitions
- **Break condition:** If P(Y=1|L) is highly non-monotonic or multi-modal, connected segments may not capture discrimination structure; K-Means produces disconnected clusters (see Appendix B).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** When fairness is monotonic with respect to the sensitive attribute, K-Means clustering on local discrimination estimates produces valid connected partitions as an efficient approximation.
- **Mechanism:** Compute ψⱼ = P(Y=1|L∈[λⱼ₋₁,λⱼ]) on a grid, then apply K-Means. Monotonicity ensures cluster assignments correspond to contiguous segments in L-space.
- **Core assumption:** The conditional probability P(Y=1|L) is monotonic in L; skin tone discrimination exhibits this property.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 5.1, Definition 1]: "fairness is monotonic w.r.t. L if P(Y=1|L=l) is monotonic w.r.t. l"
  - [Section 5.1, Proposition 2]: Proves monotonicity guarantees connected segments
  - [Section 6.2]: Empirically observed monotonic fairness for "Attractive" attribute on CelebA
  - [corpus]: No external validation of monotonic fairness assumption
- **Break condition:** If discrimination is non-monotonic, K-Means may assign distant L-values to same cluster, breaking the connected partition requirement.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Post-processing with optimal transport using the discovered partitions reduces dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes while minimizing accuracy loss.
- **Mechanism:** For each group Pₖ, transform score distributions to align with a Wasserstein barycenter target. This enforces Statistical Parity across groups while minimizing W₁ distance from original distributions.
- **Core assumption:** The sensitive attribute L is available at inference time for group assignment; post-processing can be applied per-group without destroying model utility.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 7, Equation 16]: min Σₖ P(L∈Pₖ)²W₁(ηₖ, gₖ) subject to ||gₖ - gₖ'||∞ < α
  - [Table 4]: HGR reduced from 0.126 to 0.039 with FairGroups partition; accuracy drops only 1.2%
  - [corpus]: No independent replication of the optimal transport debiasing results
- **Break condition:** If groups are mis-specified or sensitive attribute unavailable at inference, post-processing cannot be applied; accuracy-fairness tradeoff degrades if α is poorly tuned.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Disparate Impact and Statistical Parity**
  - **Why needed here:** The fairness measure Φ(k) extends DI to multiple groups; understanding DI is prerequisite for interpreting the variance objective.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why Var(Φ(SP)) = π(1-π)DI² for two groups, and what role the π(1-π) term plays?

- **Concept: K-Means clustering**
  - **Why needed here:** Used as an efficient approximation when fairness is monotonic; requires understanding how cluster centroids relate to the variance objective.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does K-Means on ψⱼ values not guarantee connected partitions without the monotonicity assumption?

- **Concept: Wasserstein distance and optimal transport**
  - **Why needed here:** The debiasing post-processing uses W₁ distance and Wasserstein barycenters to align score distributions.
  - **Quick check question:** How does W₁ differ from total variation distance for aligning cumulative distribution functions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input dataset (X, L, Y) where L is continuous sensitive attribute -> Grid discretization on L -> Precalculation matrix UΨ via dynamic programming -> Partition search (Exhaustive FairGroups or K-Means) -> Output partition maximizing Var(Φ(SP)) -> Optional post-processing via optimal transport per group

- **Critical path:** The precalculation matrix UΨ (Algorithm 2) is rate-limiting for FairGroups; complexity O(M²) for M grid points. K-Means path is O(MKI) where I is iterations.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - K vs. granularity: More groups capture finer discrimination patterns but reduce statistical power per group
  - Grid resolution M: Finer grids increase accuracy but computational cost grows quadratically
  - Post-processing α: Lower α enforces stronger fairness but increases accuracy loss

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Empty/tiny groups: Indicates K too large or grid too fine for data density
  - High variance in Φ confidence intervals: Group too small for reliable discrimination estimates
  - K-Means producing disconnected segments: Monotonicity violated; use FairGroups instead
  - Post-processing destroys accuracy: α too strict or partition poorly matched to actual discrimination structure

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce synthetic data experiment (Section 6.1):** Generate L ~ U(0,100) with ground truth partition boundaries at {20, 30, 55, 88}; verify FairGroups recovers boundaries (target Rand Index > 0.95) while K-Means degrades on non-uniform L distributions.
  2. **Ablate K parameter on CelebA:** Test K ∈ {2, 4, 6, 8} for ITA partitioning; plot Var(Φ(SP)) vs. K and observe where gains plateau. Check confidence interval width as K increases.
  3. **Cross-dataset stability check (Section 6.3 protocol):** Train partition on CelebA, apply to FFHQ, compute Rand Index between partitions. Target: Rand Index > 0.85 indicating stability under distribution shift.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- The monotonic fairness assumption (Mechanism 2) lacks external validation - the paper only tests this empirically on one CelebA attribute. If discrimination is non-monotonic, the K-Means approximation could produce disconnected clusters that violate the connected partition requirement.
- The method's effectiveness depends on sufficient data density to support reliable discrimination estimates within each group; sparse regions may yield unstable partitions.
- The optimal transport debiasing results show promising tradeoffs but lack independent replication and assume sensitive attribute availability at inference.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The variance maximization framework (Mechanism 1) is mathematically sound and the synthetic data experiment provides strong validation of core algorithm correctness
- **Medium confidence:** The monotonic fairness assumption and K-Means approximation (Mechanism 2) work well on tested datasets but need broader validation across different tasks and domains
- **Medium confidence:** The optimal transport debiasing results (Mechanism 3) show promising tradeoffs but lack independent replication and assume sensitive attribute availability at inference

## Next Checks

1. Test partition stability when training data distribution shifts significantly (e.g., train on CelebA, test on demographic groups underrepresented in training)
2. Validate the monotonic fairness assumption across multiple datasets and attributes beyond the single CelebA experiment shown
3. Compare partition quality against alternative approaches like recursive partitioning or decision tree methods that don't require monotonicity assumptions
