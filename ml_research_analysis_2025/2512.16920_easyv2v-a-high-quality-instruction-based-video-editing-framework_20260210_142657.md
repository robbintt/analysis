# EasyV2V: A High-quality Instruction-based Video Editing Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.16920
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16920
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves VLM score of 7.73/9 on EditVerse benchmark, surpassing published methods and commercial systems

## Executive Summary
EasyV2V addresses the challenge of instruction-based video editing, which lags behind image editing in consistency, control, and generalization. The framework combines curated data, simplified architecture, and flexible control mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art video editing results. It introduces innovations like composable video editing experts with fast inverses, lifting high-quality image edit pairs into videos via affine transformations, and temporal control through single mask videos. The architecture employs a lightweight design with zero-init patch embeddings, frozen VAE reuse, and LoRA fine-tuning, supporting multiple input modalities including video+text, video+mask+text, and video+mask+reference+text.

## Method Summary
EasyV2V is a video editing framework that addresses instruction-based editing challenges through three key innovations: curated data creation using affine transformations and pseudo video pairs from high-quality image edits, a simplified architecture with zero-init patch embeddings and frozen VAE reuse, and flexible control mechanisms including temporal control via single mask videos. The framework uses composable video editing experts with fast inverses and leverages densely captioned text-to-video datasets for action edits. It supports various input combinations (video+text, video+mask+text, video+mask+reference+text) and employs LoRA fine-tuning for efficient adaptation.

## Key Results
- Achieves VLM score of 7.73/9 on EditVerse benchmark, outperforming published methods and commercial systems
- Demonstrates superior performance in video editing tasks through composable experts and flexible control mechanisms
- Supports multiple input modalities while maintaining high-quality outputs and temporal consistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EasyV2V works by combining high-quality curated data with a simplified, efficient architecture that enables flexible control over video editing tasks. The framework leverages composable video editing experts that can be inverted quickly, allowing for precise modifications while maintaining temporal consistency. By lifting image edit pairs into videos through affine transformations and pseudo video pairs, the system creates robust training data that captures both spatial and temporal aspects of video editing. The temporal control mechanism using a single mask video provides precise control over when edits should occur in the video sequence, while the lightweight architecture with zero-init patch embeddings and frozen VAE reuse ensures efficient processing without sacrificing quality.

## Foundational Learning

**Composable Video Editing Experts**: Modular components that can be combined to perform different editing tasks. Why needed: Allows flexible combination of editing capabilities for diverse instructions. Quick check: Can be stacked or sequenced for complex edits.

**Pseudo Video Pairs**: Synthetic video sequences created from image edit pairs using affine transformations. Why needed: Generates training data when real video edit pairs are scarce. Quick check: Maintains spatial and temporal consistency during transformation.

**Temporal Control via Single Mask Video**: Uses a binary mask video to specify when edits should occur. Why needed: Provides precise temporal control without requiring complex multi-frame inputs. Quick check: Correctly aligns edits with specified time intervals.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Video -> Feature Extraction -> Composable Experts -> Temporal Control -> Output Video

**Critical Path**: Video input → Feature extraction (frozen VAE) → Composable experts processing → Temporal control (mask video) → Final output generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Lightweight architecture with zero-init patch embeddings and LoRA fine-tuning reduces computational overhead but may limit maximum editing complexity compared to fully fine-tuned models. Frozen VAE reuse improves efficiency but constrains feature extraction capabilities.

**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent edits across frames when temporal control mask is poorly aligned; artifacts at object boundaries when composable experts conflict; degraded quality when input video resolution exceeds training data specifications.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test single-object removal with temporal mask on short videos; 2) Validate image-to-video transformation consistency across frame sequences; 3) Evaluate multi-expert composition for complex editing instructions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily relies on EditVerse benchmark, which may not capture full diversity of real-world video editing scenarios
- Claims of "high-quality" results based on subjective VLM metrics rather than objective human perceptual studies
- Computational efficiency claims lack thorough validation against baselines in terms of inference times and memory usage

## Confidence
High: Technical soundness of architectural innovations (composable experts, zero-init patch embeddings, frozen VAE reuse) and clear demonstration of multi-modal input handling
Medium: State-of-the-art claims on EditVerse benchmark supported by quantitative metrics but require independent verification across diverse tasks
Low: Assertion of significant advancement in instruction-based video editing lacks comparative analysis against emerging non-benchmark approaches

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies comparing EasyV2V outputs with commercial systems across diverse real-world video editing scenarios, measuring both qualitative preferences and task completion times
2. Test framework performance on long-duration videos (30+ seconds) with significant scene transitions to evaluate temporal consistency and editing coherence
3. Benchmark computational efficiency of EasyV2V against traditional video editing software and recent neural approaches, measuring inference latency, memory footprint, and GPU utilization across different video resolutions and lengths
