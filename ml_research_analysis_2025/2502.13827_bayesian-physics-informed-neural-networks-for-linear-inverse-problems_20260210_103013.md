# Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Networks for Linear Inverse problems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.13827
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13827
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Presents Bayesian framework for Physics Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) for linear inverse problems, handling both supervised and unsupervised training scenarios with uncertainty quantification.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Bayesian framework for Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) applied to linear inverse problems. The approach, called BPINN, integrates Bayesian inference with PINN methodology to provide uncertainty quantification while recovering deterministic PINNs as a special case via MAP estimation. The framework handles both supervised training (with labeled input-output pairs) and unsupervised training (using only measurement data with physics constraints). The Bayesian approach naturally incorporates prior knowledge and quantifies uncertainty in solutions through posterior distributions.

## Method Summary
The BPINN framework combines Bayesian inference with PINN methodology for linear inverse problems. It defines a forward model g = Hf + ε and assigns Gaussian likelihood p(g|f) and prior p(f). A neural network maps observations g to estimates f_NN, trained by minimizing a physics-informed loss function that combines data fidelity, physics constraints, and prior terms. The framework includes both supervised training (using paired data {g_i, f_i}) and unsupervised training (using only measurements {g_i} with physics constraints). The Bayesian approach yields posterior distributions of unknowns and network parameters, with MAP estimation recovering deterministic PINNs.

## Key Results
- BPINN framework generalizes deterministic PINNs as a special case through MAP estimation
- Handles both supervised (labeled data) and unsupervised (measurement-only) training scenarios
- Provides natural uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions
- Combines data fidelity with physics constraints in a unified loss function

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Integrating Bayesian inference with PINNs enables uncertainty quantification while recovering deterministic PINNs as a special case via MAP estimation. The framework assigns prior distributions p(f) and p(ε), derives likelihood p(g|f) from the forward model g = Hf + ε, then applies Bayes' rule to obtain posteriors p(f|g) and p(w|data). When using MAP estimation instead of full posterior sampling, the optimization reduces to the standard PINN loss. Core assumption: The forward model H and noise statistics are sufficiently known to specify meaningful likelihood functions.

### Mechanism 2
Physics-informed loss terms enable unsupervised training when labeled input-output pairs are unavailable. The loss J(w) = ∑[1/v_ε ||g - Hf_NN(w)||² + γ||Df_NN(w)||^β] uses the forward model H as supervision signal—observations g must be reproducible through H applied to network outputs. Sparsity-enforcing priors (Tikhonov, Total Variation) regularize the ill-posed inverse. Core assumption: The forward operator H is differentiable (or approximately so) to enable gradient-based training through the physics term.

### Mechanism 3
The neural network serves as a learnable surrogate inverse operator, amortizing inference cost across multiple observations. Once trained on data {g_i}, the NN parameters w encode an approximate inverse mapping. New observations g_j are mapped to estimates f̂_j via forward pass, avoiding repeated optimization or MCMC sampling per query. Core assumption: Training data distribution adequately covers the space of observations encountered at deployment.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bayesian Inference (priors, likelihoods, posteriors)**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework builds on Bayes' rule p(f|g) ∝ p(g|f)p(f). Without understanding how priors regularize ill-posed problems and how posteriors quantify uncertainty, the method appears as arbitrary loss terms.
  - Quick check question: Given likelihood p(g|f) = N(g|Hf, σ²I) and prior p(f) = N(f|0, τ²I), can you derive the posterior mean and covariance?

- **Concept: Linear Inverse Problems and Ill-Posedness**
  - Why needed here: Inverse problems lack existence, uniqueness, or stability. Understanding why regularization (via priors or penalty terms) is necessary explains the framework's structure.
  - Quick check question: Why does minimizing ||g - Hf||² alone fail when H is ill-conditioned, and how does adding ||f||² help?

- **Concept: Gradient-Based Optimization for Neural Networks**
  - Why needed here: Training requires backpropagation through both the network and the physics-informed term involving H. Understanding automatic differentiation and loss landscapes is essential.
  - Quick check question: If your loss includes ||g - H·f_NN(w)||², what gradients must be computed, and how does H affect optimization dynamics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** g (input) -> NN(f_NN) -> H(f_NN) -> physics loss + data loss + prior loss -> w (parameters)
- **Critical path:**
  1. Define forward model H and verify differentiability
  2. Specify noise variance v_ε and prior parameters (v_f, γ, β)
  3. Initialize NN with appropriate input/output dimensions
  4. Construct combined loss J(w) per equations 12 (supervised) or 20 (unsupervised)
  5. Train via gradient descent; validate on held-out observations

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Supervised vs. unsupervised: Supervised requires labeled pairs {g,f} but yields more constrained training; unsupervised needs only g but relies heavily on prior quality and H accuracy
  - Prior choice: Gaussian priors yield tractable posteriors but may over-smooth; sparsity priors (β < 2) preserve edges but complicate optimization
  - Network capacity: Deeper networks approximate complex inverses but risk overfitting and harder optimization

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Loss decreases but physics residual ||g - H·f_NN|| remains large → H may be rank-deficient or prior too weak
  - Predictions collapse to prior mean f̄ → Data term overwhelmed by prior (check variance ratios λ = v_ε/v_f)
  - Training instability with sparsity priors → Use iteratively reweighted optimization or surrogate smooth approximations

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement for small-scale problem (e.g., 1D deconvolution with known H). Use supervised case with synthetic {g,f} pairs. Verify posterior mean matches analytical solution Eq. 4.
  2. Vary λ = v_ε/v_f and plot reconstruction error vs. uncertainty calibration. Confirm high λ produces over-regularized solutions.
  3. Train with only {g_i} on same toy problem. Compare convergence speed and final accuracy to supervised baseline; diagnose where physics term alone suffices.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Question:** How does the proposed BPINN framework perform empirically compared to existing Bayesian inference methods (MCMC, variational inference) and deterministic PINN approaches on benchmark linear inverse problems?
  - Basis: The paper states "However, their real efficiency for inverse problems have still to be proved" and presents only theoretical derivations without experimental validation.
  - Why unresolved: No numerical experiments, benchmarks, or comparative studies are included in the current work.
  - Evidence needed: Empirical results on standard inverse problem benchmarks showing reconstruction accuracy, uncertainty quantification quality, and computational cost comparisons.

- **Question:** What principled approaches can guide the selection of neural network architecture (depth, width, activation functions) and optimization hyperparameters for BPINN in specific inverse problem domains?
  - Basis: "In both supervised and unsupervised cases, we still have to choose an appropriate structure for the NN, its depth, its number of hidden variable, as well as choosing appropriate optimization algorithms... These difficulties make the implementation of such methods not very easy."
  - Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as a major challenge but defers to other works without providing domain-specific guidance.
  - Evidence needed: Systematic ablation studies showing sensitivity to architecture choices, or theoretical results linking problem structure to optimal network configurations.

- **Question:** Can the BPINN framework be extended to nonlinear inverse problems while maintaining tractable posterior expressions and practical optimization procedures?
  - Basis: The theoretical development is restricted to linear forward models (g = Hf + ε), and the paper notes that optimization becomes "more difficult if the NN contains nonlinear activation function."
  - Why unresolved: Nonlinear forward operators would break the Gaussian conjugacy that enables closed-form posterior expressions in the linear case.
  - Evidence needed: Derivation of posterior expressions for nonlinear forward models, or demonstration of approximate inference schemes that handle nonlinearity effectively.

## Limitations
- Practical implementation details remain underspecified, particularly neural network architecture choices and hyperparameter settings
- The unsupervised case heavily depends on accurate forward operator H and well-chosen sparsity-promoting priors, which may be challenging to specify in real applications
- No empirical validation or benchmark comparisons are provided to demonstrate practical effectiveness

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The Bayesian formulation correctly generalizes deterministic PINNs via MAP estimation (supported by mathematical derivation in Section 2)
- **Medium confidence**: Physics-informed unsupervised training can work when H is sufficiently well-behaved and prior knowledge is accurate
- **Low confidence**: The amortized inference approach (using trained NN as proxy inverse) will generalize well across distribution shifts without additional safeguards

## Next Checks
1. Systematically vary prior variances (v_f, v_ε) across several orders of magnitude and measure effects on posterior uncertainty calibration versus reconstruction accuracy
2. Introduce controlled errors into the assumed H operator and quantify degradation in BPINN performance compared to standard PINN approaches
3. Compare reconstruction quality and uncertainty quantification when training with full labeled pairs versus measurement-only data on identical problems
