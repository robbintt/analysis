core_contribution: The paper introduces SSLfmm, an R package for semi-supervised learning
  with finite mixture models under a mixed-missingness mechanism combining MCAR and
  entropy-based MAR. The core method models both class membership and label-missingness
  via an ECM algorithm, explicitly accounting for entropy-driven missingness rather
  than ignoring it.

# SSLfmm: An R Package for Semi-Supervised Learning with a Mixed-Missingness Mechanism in Finite Mixture Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03322
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03322
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Semi-supervised classifier with mixed-missingness mechanism can outperform fully supervised classifier

## Executive Summary
SSLfmm is an R package that implements semi-supervised learning using finite mixture models under a mixed-missingness mechanism. The method explicitly models both class membership and label-missingness through an ECM algorithm, distinguishing between missing-at-random (MAR) due to entropy and missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) components. The package supports data simulation, parameter estimation, prediction, and error-rate computation. In two-class Gaussian settings, the approach demonstrates that semi-supervised classifiers trained on partially labelled data can achieve lower misclassification rates than fully supervised classifiers with complete labels, with classification efficiency approaching 1.5 times that of traditional methods.

## Method Summary
The core methodology combines finite mixture modeling with a mixed-missingness mechanism that accounts for both MCAR and entropy-driven MAR missingness patterns. The approach uses an ECM (Expectation/Conditional Maximization) algorithm to simultaneously estimate mixture parameters and missingness mechanisms. Unlike traditional semi-supervised approaches that ignore missingness mechanisms, this method explicitly models entropy-based label missingness, where samples with ambiguous class membership are more likely to have missing labels. The framework is specifically designed for two-class Gaussian mixture settings, where the mixture components represent the classes and the missingness mechanism depends on posterior probabilities of class membership.

## Key Results
- Semi-supervised classifier with mixed-missingness mechanism achieves lower misclassification rate than fully supervised classifier in two-class Gaussian settings
- Classification efficiency (ARE) approaches 1.5 times that of traditional methods under entropy-based missingness
- Simulation study demonstrates substantial practical benefits of explicitly modeling the mixed-missingness mechanism
- Method successfully handles scenarios where label missingness is driven by uncertainty in class membership

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by recognizing that label missingness is not random but systematically related to the difficulty of classification. When samples fall near the decision boundary between classes, their posterior probabilities are similar, creating high entropy. This uncertainty makes it more likely that labels are missing for these ambiguous cases. By explicitly modeling this relationship through the mixed-missingness mechanism, the method can leverage the information in partially labelled data more effectively than approaches that ignore the missingness pattern or treat all missingness as MCAR.

## Foundational Learning
- **Finite Mixture Models**: Why needed - provide probabilistic framework for modeling multiple underlying populations; Quick check - verify component proportions sum to 1 and each component has valid density function
- **Missing Data Mechanisms**: Why needed - distinguish between ignorable and non-ignorable missingness; Quick check - assess whether missingness depends on observed data, missing data, or both
- **Entropy in Classification**: Why needed - quantifies uncertainty in class membership predictions; Quick check - calculate entropy from posterior probabilities and verify it increases near decision boundaries
- **ECM Algorithm**: Why needed - efficient optimization for models with latent variables and missing data; Quick check - monitor log-likelihood convergence across iterations
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Why needed - leverage both labelled and unlabelled data for improved classification; Quick check - compare performance on labelled-only versus combined data

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data Simulation -> Parameter Estimation (ECM) -> Prediction -> Error Rate Computation
**Critical Path**: Simulation generates test data → ECM algorithm estimates parameters using mixed-missingness mechanism → Prediction uses estimated parameters → Error rate computed from predictions
**Design Tradeoffs**: Explicit missingness modeling increases accuracy but requires correct specification of mechanism; Two-class Gaussian assumption simplifies implementation but limits applicability
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance when missingness mechanism is misspecified; Convergence issues with degenerate mixture components; Overestimation of efficiency when assumptions violated
**First Experiments**: 1) Simulate data with known parameters and verify parameter recovery; 2) Test classification accuracy under varying levels of label missingness; 3) Compare performance against standard EM algorithm ignoring missingness mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Method assumes correct specification of the mixed-missingness mechanism, which is often unknown in practice
- Performance advantage depends on accurate modeling of entropy-driven missingness patterns
- Package currently limited to two-class Gaussian mixture settings
- Real-world data complexity may reduce the reported classification efficiency advantage

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Package provides functional tools for semi-supervised learning with mixed-missingness mechanisms and supports simulation, estimation, prediction, and error computation
- **Medium Confidence**: Theoretical framework for combining MCAR and entropy-based MAR is sound, but robustness to misspecification remains uncertain
- **Medium Confidence**: Reported ARE of 1.5 is promising but may not generalize across all real-world scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test the package on real-world datasets with partially labelled data to validate performance outside controlled simulations
2. Evaluate method robustness when the missingness mechanism is misspecified or unknown
3. Extend the approach to multi-class or non-Gaussian settings to assess broader applicability
