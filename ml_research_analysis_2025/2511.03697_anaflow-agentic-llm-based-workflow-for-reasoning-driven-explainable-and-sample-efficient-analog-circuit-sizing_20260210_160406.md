# AnaFlow: Agentic LLM-based Workflow for Reasoning-Driven Explainable and Sample-Efficient Analog Circuit Sizing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.03697
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03697
- **Authors**: Mohsen Ahmadzadeh; Kaichang Chen; Georges Gielen
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Primary result**: Agentic LLM-based workflow achieves better sample efficiency (9-64 simulations) than pure Bayesian optimization and RL for analog circuit sizing while providing human-interpretable reasoning

## Executive Summary
AnaFlow presents a novel agentic LLM-based workflow for analog circuit sizing that combines specialized LLM agents to interpret circuit topology, understand design goals, and iteratively refine design parameters through human-interpretable reasoning. The framework achieves superior sample efficiency compared to traditional optimization methods while maintaining explainability throughout the design process. The method successfully sizes two-stage Miller opamps in 9 simulations and differential folded-cascode opamps in 64 simulations total, demonstrating practical applicability for real-world analog design challenges.

## Method Summary
AnaFlow employs a multi-agent architecture where specialized LLM agents collaborate to handle different aspects of analog circuit sizing. The workflow begins with circuit topology interpretation, followed by design goal analysis and iterative parameter refinement. Each agent contributes specific expertise: one focuses on understanding circuit constraints and specifications, another handles parameter sensitivity analysis, and a third manages trade-off optimization. The agents communicate through structured reasoning steps, allowing for transparent decision-making and human oversight. The iterative refinement process uses simulation feedback to guide parameter adjustments, with each iteration building on previous reasoning to converge toward optimal designs.

## Key Results
- Achieves 9 simulations total for two-stage Miller opamp sizing versus typical 50-100 simulations for traditional methods
- Successfully sizes differential folded-cascode opamp in 64 simulations, demonstrating scalability to more complex topologies
- Provides human-interpretable reasoning throughout the design process, allowing designers to understand parameter choices and trade-offs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AnaFlow leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to break down complex circuit sizing problems into interpretable steps, where each agent handles specific aspects of the optimization process. The collaborative agent architecture enables distributed problem-solving, with each agent contributing domain-specific knowledge while maintaining overall design coherence. The iterative refinement approach allows the system to learn from simulation feedback and progressively improve design parameters, combining the pattern recognition strengths of LLMs with the precision of numerical optimization. The human-interpretable reasoning provides
