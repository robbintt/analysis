# GeoOutageKG: A Multimodal Geospatiotemporal Knowledge Graph for Multiresolution Power Outage Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.22878
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22878
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GeoOutageKG integrates high-resolution nighttime light satellite data with county-level power outage records into a unified, semantically rich knowledge graph.

## Executive Summary
GeoOutageKG addresses the challenge of analyzing power outages by integrating heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets into a unified knowledge graph. The system combines high-temporal-resolution county-level outage records from EAGLE-I with high-spatial-resolution nighttime light satellite imagery from NASA's Black Marble, overcoming the limitations of each modality alone. Through a custom ontology and semantic mapping, the knowledge graph enables granular, context-aware analysis of outage events across multiple spatial and temporal scales, supporting applications from disaster impact assessment to grid decision support.

## Method Summary
The method involves acquiring raw data from NASA Black Marble (VNP46A2) and EAGLE-I sources, then curating this data by filtering for Florida counties, segmenting NTL images using county bounding boxes, and generating outage maps by comparing daily radiance against 3-month baselines. The FAIRification process assigns unique IRIs following the GeoOutageOnto ontology structure, mapping instances to classes like OutageRecord, NTLImage, and OutageMap. The final graph is serialized as RDF Turtle files and loaded into GraphDB, containing over 10.9 million instances and 88.9 million RDF triples.

## Key Results
- GeoOutageKG contains over 10.9 million outage records, 313,702 NTL images, and 15,544 outage maps
- The knowledge graph integrates 89 million RDF triples across three primary datasets
- Supports SPARQL-based cross-modal querying for applications like Hurricane Ian analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Integrating high-temporal-resolution outage records with high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery enables more granular outage analysis than either modality alone. County-level EAGLE-I records provide 15-minute temporal granularity but limited spatial resolution; NTL satellite imagery provides sub-county spatial detail but only daily observations. The knowledge graph semantically links these through shared geographic identifiers (county FIPS codes) and temporal coordinates, allowing analysts to query across both resolutions simultaneously.

### Mechanism 2
Ontology-driven semantic mapping enables reusable, extensible integration of heterogeneous spatiotemporal data sources. GeoOutageOnto defines three core classes—`OutageRecord`, `NTLImage`, `OutageMap`—each linking to external ontologies (DBpedia for counties, GEOSatDB for satellite/sensor metadata, Ontology for Media Resources for images). The `representsCounty` predicate provides a common spatial anchor across all modalities.

### Mechanism 3
Unified RDF representation enables SPARQL-based cross-modal querying for downstream analytical tasks. All instances are serialized as Turtle files with globally unique IRIs encoding spatiotemporal coordinates. GraphDB provides a SPARQL endpoint supporting federated queries across modalities.

## Foundational Learning

- **RDF/OWL Knowledge Graphs**: Why needed here - GeoOutageKG is implemented in OWL2 and serialized as RDF Turtle files; understanding triples, predicates, and SPARQL is prerequisite to querying or extending the graph. Quick check: Can you write a SPARQL query that retrieves all `OutageRecord` instances for a given county where `numberOfOutages` exceeds 100?

- **Spatiotemporal Data Alignment**: Why needed here - The core value proposition is aligning datasets with different spatial (county vs. pixel) and temporal (15-min vs. daily) resolutions; understanding coordinate systems and temporal aggregation is essential. Quick check: If you have a daily NTL image and 15-minute outage records, how would you aggregate the outage records to match the image's temporal granularity?

- **Power Grid Outage Metrics**: Why needed here - The `customers_out` field in EAGLE-I records represents customer count, not power loss (MW); interpreting severity requires understanding utility reporting conventions. Quick check: What is the difference between `customers_out` (EAGLE-I) and radiance loss (NTL-derived outage maps) as measures of outage severity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Acquisition (BlackMarblePy, EAGLE-I) -> Data Curation (county masks, VST-GNN) -> Ontology Layer (GeoOutageOnto) -> Knowledge Graph (RDF triples, GraphDB) -> Access Layer (OSF, GitHub, API)

- **Critical path:** 1) Download raw NTL (HDF5) and EAGLE-I (CSV) data 2) Apply county masks to NTL images; save as .pkl files 3) Generate outage maps by comparing daily vs. 3-month baseline radiance 4) Map each instance to GeoOutageOnto; assign unique IRIs 5) Serialize to Turtle; load into GraphDB

- **Design tradeoffs:** Spatial scope vs. dataset size (current Florida-only vs. national expansion), daily NTL vs. 15-min outage records temporal mismatch, external ontology dependencies (DBpedia/GEOSatDB) improving interoperability but introducing availability risks

- **Failure signatures:** Missing NTL images for specific dates (cloud cover, sensor gaps) → incomplete outage map coverage, EAGLE-I reporting delays → stale OutageRecord instances, county boundary misalignment between NTL masks and FIPS codes → spatial join errors

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline query validation: Run the Figure 4a SPARQL query for Lee County during Hurricane Ian; verify results match Table 1 outage counts 2) Cross-modal correlation: For a single hurricane event, compute correlation between customers_out (EAGLE-I) and radiance loss (NTL-derived) across all 67 counties; assess whether high-outage counties show high NTL drop 3) Scalability test: Query all OutageRecord instances for a single year across all counties; measure query latency and identify bottlenecks in GraphDB configuration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines effectively leverage GeoOutageKG to answer natural language queries regarding historical outage patterns with high accuracy? The authors state they are exploring "potential applications in Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarking and retrieval," specifically citing OG-RAG methods. While the structure supports semantic querying, the paper does not yet demonstrate or evaluate an interface connecting the graph to LLMs.

### Open Question 2
How does the modular architecture of GeoOutageKG scale regarding query performance and semantic consistency when expanded from a state-level (Florida) to a national or global scope? The paper notes that the current data is limited to Florida but that the "modularity permits its spatial resolution to expand... across the entire US." The computational overhead and triple store performance for 50 states have not been tested.

### Open Question 3
Does internalizing geospatial coordinates via geohashing improve query efficiency compared to the current method of linking to external DBpedia resources? The authors mention that accessing geospatial data currently relies on external DBpedia links and that "utilization of geohashing is also being explored." The trade-off between the storage overhead of internal geohashes and the latency of dereferencing external URIs has not been quantified.

### Open Question 4
To what extent can daily satellite modalities reliably validate sub-hourly outage records given the temporal mismatch between NTL images and EAGLE-I data? The paper highlights that NTL data is daily while EAGLE-I data is 15-minute intervals, yet they are linked semantically without discussing the loss of temporal fidelity during validation.

## Limitations
- Cross-modal correlation between NTL-derived outage maps and EAGLE-I customer counts remains empirically untested
- Ontology interoperability claims lack validation experiments showing reduced integration friction
- SPARQL scalability claims are not benchmarked with realistic analytical workloads

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Data collection methodology and KG construction pipeline are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium confidence:** Semantic integration approach is logically sound but cross-modal validation and query performance are not demonstrated
- **Low confidence:** Claims about improved outage severity evaluation and decision support benefits lack empirical substantiation

## Next Checks
1. Cross-modal correlation analysis: For Hurricane Ian and two additional events, compute Pearson/Spearman correlation between EAGLE-I customers_out and NTL-derived radiance loss across all 67 Florida counties
2. SPARQL performance benchmarking: Execute the Figure 4a query and progressively complex joins while measuring query latency with documented GraphDB configuration
3. External data integration test: Integrate a small external outage dataset using GeoOutageOnto ontology and measure integration time compared to custom approach
