- One-line primary result: Proposes framework for scalable AI alignment that maintains human oversight as AI systems exceed human intelligence

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for scalable AI alignment that addresses two core challenges: scalable oversight when AI exceeds human intelligence, and accounting for dynamic human values. The approach decomposes complex superhuman tasks into subtasks that can be verified by human-level AI, then recomposes solutions while maintaining alignment through the part-to-complete generalization hypothesis. By continuously updating the human-level AI proxy with evolving human values, the system can propagate value changes without retraining the full planner. The framework aims to keep humans in the loop while enabling increasingly complex task solving.

## Method Summary
The framework trains a superhuman reasoning model (planner) to decompose complex tasks into subtasks verifiable by an aligned human-level AI proxy. The planner receives reinforcement learning feedback from partial alignment rewards and correctness rewards. The human-level AI is periodically realigned to evolving human values via human feedback on human-level tasks. The core assumption is part-to-complete generalization—that alignment of subtask solutions transfers to complete solutions. The approach uses an aligned human-level AI as a proxy to verify subtasks while the reasoning model handles decomposition and composition.

## Key Results
- Proposes part-to-complete generalization hypothesis as foundation for scalable alignment
- Introduces dynamic value propagation through proxy realignment mechanism
- Suggests three strategies to improve generalization: restricted composition spaces, balanced subtask complexity, and solution summarization
- Frames superalignment as decomposition problem amenable to human-level verification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Task Decomposition with Human-Level Verification Proxies
- Claim: Superhuman tasks can be aligned by decomposing them into subtasks that human-level AI can verify, then recomposing aligned partial solutions.
- Mechanism: A reasoning model (planner Pθ) breaks complex task X into subtasks. Each subtask is solved and judged by an aligned human-level AI (Hφ) acting as a proxy for human oversight. The planner then recomposes partial solutions into a complete solution S, which is verified by a correctness verifier V. The planner receives reinforcement learning feedback from both partial alignment rewards and correctness rewards.
- Core assumption: The part-to-complete generalization hypothesis—that alignment of subtask solutions generalizes to alignment of complete solutions.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Our approach relies on what we call the part-to-complete generalization hypothesis, which states that the alignment of subtask solutions generalizes to the alignment of complete solutions."
- Break condition: If subtask alignment does not transfer to composition—e.g., the planner learns to game partial rewards while producing misaligned compositions—the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2: Propagation of Dynamic Human Values Through Proxy Realignment
- Claim: Continuously realigning the human-level AI proxy to evolving human values propagates those changes through the superalignment system without retraining the full planner.
- Mechanism: The align_to_human procedure periodically updates Hφ using human feedback on human-level tasks E (e.g., via RLHF). The updated Hφ then provides alignment signals during planner training, creating a feedback loop where value changes naturally propagate.
- Core assumption: Human-level tasks E are sufficient to capture value changes relevant to superhuman tasks D, and Hφ generalizes these values across task complexity levels.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3] "By enforcing that each subtask is solved by a human-level AI, we can incorporate evolving human values by continuously updating the human-level AI proxy accordingly, e.g., through RLHF."
- Break condition: If value changes in E do not transfer to judgment quality on decomposed subtasks from D, or if the planner's learned composition patterns resist re-alignment, the dynamic propagation fails.

### Mechanism 3: Constrained Composition to Reduce Misalignment Surface
- Claim: Restricting the composition space, balancing subtask complexity, and summarizing solutions improve part-to-complete generalization by design.
- Mechanism: (1) Restricting compositions to specific structures (trees, sequential processes) eliminates classes of safety violations by architectural constraint. (2) Balancing subtask complexity ensures human-level AI can effectively judge each component. (3) Solution summarization allows imperfect human-level evaluation of overall intent, leveraging weak-to-strong generalization for the planner to learn true alignment.
- Core assumption: These constraints reduce misalignment probability without overly constraining capability; the planner can learn intent from imperfect summary evaluations.
- Evidence anchors: [section 5] "By limiting compositions to specific structures like trees or sequential processes, we can eliminate certain classes of safety violations by design."
- Break condition: If constraints are too restrictive (blocking legitimate solutions) or too loose (allowing novel misalignment patterns at composition time), the mechanism either underperforms or fails safety goals.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Scalable Oversight / Superalignment**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework addresses how to maintain human oversight when AI exceeds human intelligence. Understanding this problem motivates the decomposition approach.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why standard RLHF fails for tasks humans cannot evaluate directly?

- Concept: **Iterated Amplification (IA)**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly positions its approach as inspired by IA but addresses IA's scalability limitations by automating decomposition.
  - Quick check question: How does this framework differ from IA in who performs task decomposition?

- Concept: **Weak-to-Strong Generalization**
  - Why needed here: Part-to-complete generalization is conceptually analogous—the paper hypothesizes that alignment properties transfer from simpler (subtask) to more complex (complete) solutions.
  - Quick check question: What empirical evidence does Burns et al. (2024) provide that alignment can transfer from weak to strong models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - H (Human) -> Hφ (Human-level AI proxy) -> Pθ (Planner/Reasoning Model) -> V (Verifier)
  - D (Superhuman tasks) -> E (Human-level tasks) -> RLFT updates Pθ

- Critical path:
  1. Hφ alignment loop: H evaluates Hφ on E → update Hφ
  2. Planner training loop: Pθ decomposes X from D → Hφ solves/judges subtasks → Pθ recomposes → V verifies → RLFT updates Pθ
  3. Inference: Pθ decomposes novel task → Hφ verifies subtasks → Pθ recomposes → output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Subtask granularity**: Finer decomposition increases verifiability but increases composition complexity and potential for misaligned compositions.
  - **Hφ capability**: More capable Hφ improves judgment quality but may reduce human oversight fidelity.
  - **Composition constraints**: Stricter constraints improve safety but may limit solution space for legitimate complex tasks.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Reward hacking at composition**: Partial rewards are high but complete solution is misaligned (detect via V failures or out-of-distribution compositions).
  - **Stale values**: Hφ not updated frequently enough; misalignment between H preferences and Hφ judgments.
  - **Over-decomposition**: Subtasks become trivial, pushing all complexity into composition step where Hφ cannot verify.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Validate part-to-complete generalization baseline**: Train Pθ on tasks where ground-truth alignment of complete solutions is known (sandwiching method). Measure correlation between partial reward sum and complete alignment. Establish whether the hypothesis holds and at what magnitude.
  2. **Ablate composition constraints**: Compare unrestricted vs. tree-structured vs. sequential composition on a task suite (e.g., dinner reservation scenario). Measure misalignment rate and capability degradation.
  3. **Test dynamic value propagation**: Simulate value drift in H (change preference labels on E). Measure latency and fidelity of value change propagation to Pθ's outputs on held-out D tasks. Identify update frequency requirements.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- To what extent does part-to-complete generalization hold across different task types and reasoning model architectures?
- How effective are the proposed strategies (restricted composition spaces, balanced subtask complexity, solution summarization) at improving part-to-complete generalization?
- Can human-level AIs reliably make value-consistent judgments across partial solutions from decomposed tasks?
- How can correctness verifiers for complete solutions be constructed for complex or superhuman-level tasks?

## Limitations

- Part-to-complete generalization hypothesis lacks empirical validation despite being the foundation of the approach
- Dynamic value propagation mechanism assumes Hφ updates will transfer alignment to decomposed subtasks without testing this transfer
- Composition constraint safety claims are entirely speculative with no demonstrated evidence
- Critical implementation details (decomposition interfaces, verifier specifications, datasets, hyperparameters) are unspecified

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The problem statement and decomposition mechanism are clearly articulated and theoretically sound. The scalable oversight challenge and dynamic values problem are well-defined, and the proxy-based oversight approach is a reasonable response to these challenges.

**Medium confidence**: The part-to-complete generalization hypothesis is conceptually plausible based on weak-to-strong generalization literature, but lacks direct empirical validation. The dynamic value propagation mechanism is reasonable but untested—no evidence that Hφ updates will transfer alignment to decomposed subtasks or that planners won't develop composition patterns resistant to re-alignment.

**Low confidence**: The constrained composition safety claims are entirely speculative. While the intuition is sound, no evidence shows that restricting composition structures, balancing subtask complexity, or solution summarization will actually reduce misalignment probability or that the specific proposed constraints are appropriate.

## Next Checks

1. **Part-to-complete generalization baseline experiment**: Using the sandwiching method with ground-truth alignment labels on complete solutions, measure the correlation between partial reward sums and complete alignment. This directly tests whether the core hypothesis holds and quantifies the expected generalization gap.

2. **Composition constraint ablation study**: Implement unrestricted, tree-structured, and sequential composition variants on a dinner reservation scenario suite. Measure misalignment rates and capability metrics to determine whether constraints actually improve safety without crippling performance.

3. **Dynamic value propagation timing experiment**: Simulate value drift by changing preference labels on E, then measure the latency and fidelity of value changes appearing in Pθ's outputs on held-out D tasks. This identifies minimum update frequencies and reveals whether planners develop composition patterns that resist re-alignment.
