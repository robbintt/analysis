core_contribution: The study presents RusLICA, a Russian-language platform for automated
  linguistic analysis based on LIWC methodology. Instead of direct translation, the
  team built a Russian-specific dictionary using semantic dictionaries, corpora, and
  thesauri, yielding 42 lexical categories plus 54 syntactic, morphological, and statistical
  features (total 96 categories).

# RusLICA: A Russian-Language Platform for Automated Linguistic Inquiry and Category Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20275
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20275
- Reference count: 40
- A Russian-language platform that automatically extracts 96 linguistic and psycholinguistic features from Russian texts using a Russian-specific dictionary and NLP pipeline.

## Executive Summary
RusLICA adapts the LIWC methodology for Russian by building a Russian-specific dictionary from semantic dictionaries, corpora, and thesauri rather than translating English resources. The system extracts 42 lexical categories plus 54 syntactic, morphological, and statistical features, using lemmatization, POS tagging, dependency parsing, and frequency metrics. It also supports emotion classification via a fine-tuned Russian transformer model. The platform is publicly available as a web service for analyzing written Russian texts, enabling researchers to extract psychologically and linguistically relevant features without requiring direct English-to-Russian translation.

## Method Summary
RusLICA constructs a Russian-specific dictionary by extracting words from semantic dictionaries (emotive vocabulary, verb semantic fields, abstract nouns), expanding coverage via RuWordNet relations, and validating entries against Russian National Corpus contexts. Text processing includes preprocessing (lowercase, special token replacement), lemmatization via MyStem, POS tagging and dependency parsing via SpaCy's ru_core_news_lg model, and feature extraction across 96 categories (42 lexical, 27 morphological, 11 syntactic, 15 statistical). Emotion classification uses a fine-tuned rubert-tiny2 model. The system computes percentage scores per category and provides a web interface for uploading Russian text files.

## Key Results
- Built a Russian-specific dictionary (7,492 lemmas, 8,309 entries) across 42 lexical categories instead of translating English LIWC dictionaries
- Integrated 54 additional syntactic, morphological, and statistical features beyond basic word counts
- Achieved hybrid analysis combining dictionary-based scoring with transformer-based emotion classification
- Released as public web service supporting CSV/XLSX uploads with output in 12 hours

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** A Russian-specific dictionary built from semantic dictionaries, corpora, and thesauri may capture psycholinguistic categories more accurately than direct translation of English LIWC dictionaries.
- **Mechanism:** The system constructs lexical categories by extracting words from Russian semantic dictionaries (e.g., emotive vocabulary, verb lexico-semantic fields), expands coverage via RuWordNet relations (hyponymy, meronymy, synonyms), and validates entries against Russian National Corpus contexts—rather than translating English LIWC entries.
- **Core assumption:** Russian lexical semantics and cultural expressions of psychological constructs differ systematically from English, so language-native resources provide better coverage than translation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Rather than applying direct translation to existing thesauri, we built the dictionary specifically for the Russian language based on the content from several lexicographic resources, semantic dictionaries and corpora."
  - [section 3.4.1]: Describes extraction from multiple Russian semantic dictionaries including emotion vocabulary [21], verb semantic fields [22], and abstract nouns [23].
  - [corpus]: Panicheva & Litvinova (2020) showed "dictionaries for English and Russian could differ significantly" and "simple direct transfer of the content without extension and validation remains insufficient."
- **Break condition:** If target texts contain substantial slang, idioms, or domain-specific vocabulary absent from classical semantic dictionaries, coverage will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Combining morphological and syntactic parsing with lexical word-counting may better represent Russian's rich inflectional system than word-counting alone.
- **Mechanism:** SpaCy's `ru_core_news_lg` model provides dependency parsing and morphological analysis; features like verb aspect, voice, tense, and syntactic tree depth are extracted as distinct categories (27 morphological + 11 syntactic), supplementing the 42 lexical categories.
- **Core assumption:** Grammatical features (e.g., passive voice, aspect, clause structure) carry psychological or stylistic signal beyond raw word counts.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "96 categories, integrating syntactic, morphological, lexical, general statistical features."
