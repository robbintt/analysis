# Empowering All-in-Loop Health Management of Spacecraft Power System in the Mega-Constellation Era via Human-AI Collaboration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.12667
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12667
- Authors: Yi Di; Zhibin Zhao; Fujin Wang; Xue Liu; Jiafeng Tang; Jiaxin Ren; Zhi Zhai; Xuefeng Chen
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SpaceHMchat achieves 100% accuracy in logical reasoning, >99% success rate in tool invocation, >90% precision in fault localization, and <3 minute knowledge base search on a 700,000+ timestamp spacecraft power system dataset.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces SpaceHMchat, a Human-AI Collaboration (HAIC) framework for all-in-loop health management of spacecraft power systems. Guided by the principle of aligning underlying capabilities (AUC), the framework integrates prompt engineering, function calling, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation to automate work condition recognition, anomaly detection, fault localization, and maintenance decision-making. Evaluated on the newly released XJTU-SPS dataset containing 700,000+ timestamps and 17 fault types, SpaceHMchat demonstrates expert-level performance across all four health management tasks while maintaining human control authority.

## Method Summary
SpaceHMchat implements the AUC principle by mapping each health management subtask to corresponding LLM capabilities: logical reasoning for work condition recognition, tool-dependent execution for anomaly detection, learning-and-approximation for fault localization, and knowledge-intensive retrieval for maintenance decision-making. The framework employs chain-of-thought prompting for transparent decision-making, function calling for algorithm execution, LoRA fine-tuning for domain adaptation, and RAG for document-based knowledge retrieval. The system operates on telemetry from 33 sensors at 1Hz sampling rate, processing data through a pipeline that identifies work conditions, detects anomalies, classifies faults, and recommends maintenance actions.

## Key Results
- 100% accuracy in logical reasoning for work condition recognition using step-wise chain-of-thought prompts
- >99% success rate in tool invocation for anomaly detection with diverse algorithm selection
- >90% precision in fault localization across 17 fault types using LoRA fine-tuned expert LLM
- Knowledge base search under 3 minutes for maintenance decision-making via RAG retrieval

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Task-capability alignment enables LLMs to replicate domain expert reasoning across heterogeneous health management tasks.
- Mechanism: The AUC principle maps each subtask's intrinsic nature (logical reasoning, tool-dependent, learning-and-approximation, knowledge-intensive) to corresponding LLM capabilities (reasoning, function calling, fine-tuning, RAG), enabling a unified HAIC framework.
- Core assumption: Assumes task nature can be cleanly categorized and that LLM capabilities are sufficiently mature to align with human expert performance in each category.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "proposes a principle of aligning underlying capabilities (AUC principle) and develops SpaceHMchat"
  - [section 1, page 3] "this work proposes the AUC principle... to first identify the intrinsic nature of a given subtask... then determine the underlying human capabilities required... and finally align these human capabilities with the corresponding capabilities of LLMs"
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; related work "Large Language Models for Power System Security" addresses LLMs for anomaly detection but does not validate the AUC alignment principle itself.
- Break condition: If tasks require overlapping or ambiguous capability types (e.g., a task that is both tool-dependent and knowledge-intensive), alignment may degrade; if base model reasoning or tool-use capabilities regress, the alignment fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Chain-of-thought prompt engineering enables transparent, step-wise logical reasoning for work condition recognition.
- Mechanism: Pre-defined decision trees are converted into structured step-wise prompts with explicit if-else branches; the LLM outputs its reasoning chain at each step, ensuring interpretability and correctness.
- Core assumption: Assumes decision trees are complete and correct (human-designed), and that the base model can reliably follow multi-step instructions without skipping or hallucinating steps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2, page 6] "demonstrates that LLMs possess sufficient reasoning and chained thinking capabilities to accurately execute binary tree-based work condition identification tasks"
  - [section 4.1, page 12-13] "Through prompt engineering techniques, the decision tree is perfectly transformed into LLM prompts... the core of this transformation is to convert the branches of the decision tree into step-wise if-else statements"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation for this specific prompting mechanism in aerospace domains.
- Break condition: If decision logic changes frequently (requiring prompt updates), maintenance burden increases; if the model produces redundant or incoherent intermediate steps, trust degrades.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning with domain-specific Q&A datasets enables fault localization by learning fault patterns from historical telemetry.
- Mechanism: Time-series monitoring data is converted to Q&A format with fault type labels; LoRA-based fine-tuning adapts the base model into an "expert LLM" that outputs fault classification with reasoning.
- Core assumption: Assumes sufficient labeled fault data exists and that fault signatures generalize across spacecraft variants; assumes the base model is large enough (≥14B recommended) to capture complex patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.4, page 8] "demonstrates that LLMs possess sufficient learning and approximation capabilities from data to rival human experience accumulation"
  - [section 4.3, page 15] "Through fine-tuning and LoRA techniques, the LLM is fine-tuned into an expert LLM, enabling it to learn from historical monitoring data and judge fault types"
  - [section 2.6, Table 1, page 11] Reports 89.43% accuracy, 90.01% precision on 85,000+ samples for fault localization.
  - [corpus] Weak support; related papers on imitation learning and anomaly detection do not validate fine-tuning for fault localization in this domain.
- Break condition: If novel fault types emerge outside the training distribution, the fine-tuned model may misclassify; if training data has label noise, performance degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**
  - Why needed here: Required for work condition recognition where transparent, step-wise logical inference is critical for human trust and verification.
  - Quick check question: Can you construct a multi-step prompt that forces a model to output each reasoning step before the conclusion?

- Concept: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: Required for maintenance decision-making to query technical documents, maintenance manuals, and expert consultation archives in real-time.
  - Quick check question: Given a fault description, can you retrieve the top-k relevant passages from a vector database and synthesize a maintenance recommendation?

- Concept: **LoRA-based Fine-Tuning**
  - Why needed here: Required for fault localization to adapt a general-purpose LLM to domain-specific fault patterns without full model retraining.
  - Quick check question: Can you prepare a Q&A dataset from time-series telemetry and apply LoRA adapters to a 14B-parameter model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Work Condition Recognition Module: Decision tree -> Step-wise prompt -> CoT reasoning -> Work condition output
  - Anomaly Detection Module: Tool library (MTGNN, Transformer, etc.) -> Function calling/MCP -> Algorithm execution -> Anomaly timestamps
  - Fault Localization Module: Historical telemetry -> Q&A dataset construction -> LoRA fine-tuning -> Expert LLM -> Fault type + reasoning
  - Maintenance Decision-Making Module: Knowledge base (documents, reports) -> Vector DB -> RAG retrieval -> Root cause + risk + strategy

- Critical path:
  1. Data ingestion from telemetry (33 sensors, 1Hz sampling)
  2. Work condition recognition establishes baseline state
  3. Anomaly detection flags suspicious timestamps
  4. Fault localization classifies fault type
  5. Maintenance decision-making provides remediation strategies

- Design tradeoffs:
  - HAIC vs. fully autonomous agent: Paper explicitly rejects full autonomy due to high reliability requirements, non-transferable responsibility, and absolute human control authority in aerospace (Section 1, page 3).
  - Zero-shot vs. fine-tuning: Zero-shot sufficient for logical reasoning; fine-tuning required for fault localization.
  - Local deployment vs. cloud: Knowledge base and models should be locally deployed for information security in aerospace applications.

- Failure signatures:
  - Work condition recognition: Redundant or contradictory steps in CoT output; unstable conclusions across repeated queries.
  - Anomaly detection: Tool invocation syntax errors; algorithm training failures due to data format mismatches.
  - Fault localization: Confusion between similar fault types (see confusion matrix in Appendix G, e.g., Type3 vs Type17 at 31% confusion).
  - Maintenance decision-making: Citation hallucination (26/965 references could not be verified; Section 2.6, page 11).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline CoT validation**: Run 50 work condition recognition tasks with the step-wise prompt; verify 100% conclusion accuracy and step-wise correctness per Table 1.
  2. **Tool invocation stress test**: Execute 50 anomaly detection workflows with varying algorithm selections; measure one-shot success rate (target: >98%) and tool invocation accuracy.
  3. **Fault localization fine-tuning loop**: Train on XJTU-SPS FL sub-dataset (17 fault types); evaluate precision/recall on held-out set; analyze confusion matrix for systematic misclassifications.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can LLMs reliably extract work condition decision rules directly from design documents, eliminating the need for human-predefined decision trees?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states: "Current LLM technology excels at logical reasoning and metric calculation, but it has not yet achieved consistently reliable extraction of work condition decision rules from design documents."
- Why unresolved: The AUC framework depends on human experts manually building decision trees as a prerequisite, creating a bottleneck for scaling to diverse spacecraft configurations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrated extraction of accurate decision trees from raw spacecraft design documentation with accuracy comparable to human-derived trees across multiple spacecraft architectures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can responsibility attribution be formalized for Human-AI collaboration systems in safety-critical aerospace operations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion notes that fully automated agents await resolution of "issues of responsibility attribution," given the domain's requirement for "non-transferable responsibility."
- Why unresolved: Current aerospace liability frameworks assume human decision-making authority; no established legal or regulatory frameworks exist for shared human-AI responsibility in mission-critical failures.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal framework defining responsibility boundaries between human operators and AI systems, validated through simulated failure scenarios with clear attribution criteria.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the AUC-guided Human-AI framework generalize to novel fault types outside the 17 fault categories in the training dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The fault localization model achieves ~90% precision on 17 fault types through fine-tuning, but the paper acknowledges this represents "common fault types" that experts have already encountered.
- Why unresolved: Mega-constellation spacecraft may encounter unprecedented failure modes; the fine-tuning approach inherently limits detection to patterns present in historical data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of SpaceHMchat's fault localization performance on out-of-distribution fault types not represented in the XJTU-SPS dataset, including zero-shot or few-shot generalization metrics.

## Limitations

- The AUC principle assumes clean task categorization and fully mature LLM capabilities across all four capability types, yet real-world tasks often involve overlapping requirements
- The framework relies on static decision trees for work condition recognition, which may not adapt to evolving spacecraft states or emergent fault patterns
- Security and privacy constraints prevent open access to the XJTU-SPS dataset, creating a barrier to independent verification

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Work condition recognition (100% logical reasoning accuracy via step-wise CoT), anomaly detection (tool invocation success >99%), and maintenance decision-making (<3 min knowledge search) claims are well-supported by quantitative results in Tables 1, 2, and 4.
- **Medium Confidence**: Fault localization claims (precision >90%, accuracy >89%) are supported by Table 3 but depend on fine-tuning quality and data representativeness; confusion between similar fault types (e.g., Type3 vs Type17) indicates potential brittleness.
- **Low Confidence**: The AUC principle's generalizability beyond spacecraft power systems is asserted but not empirically validated across diverse domains; mechanism 1 lacks direct corpus support for the alignment framework itself.

## Next Checks

1. **AUC Principle Generalization Test**: Apply SpaceHMchat to a different domain (e.g., satellite thermal control or terrestrial power grids) and validate whether the same capability alignment strategy achieves comparable performance without domain-specific redesign.

2. **Novel Fault Type Stress Test**: Introduce synthetic fault patterns not present in the training data (e.g., combined sensor failures or rare transient events) and measure fault localization accuracy drop-off and reasoning quality degradation.

3. **Knowledge Base Verification Audit**: Reconstruct the knowledge base from publicly available aerospace maintenance manuals and evaluate RAG retrieval accuracy and hallucination rate (citation generation) on a held-out test set of maintenance queries.
