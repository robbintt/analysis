# Leveraging Knowledge Graphs and LLM Reasoning to Identify Operational Bottlenecks for Warehouse Planning Assistance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.17273
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17273
- Authors: Rishi Parekh; Saisubramaniam Gopalakrishnan; Zishan Ahmad; Anirudh Deodhar

- Primary result: Framework integrating Knowledge Graphs and LLM reasoning identifies warehouse bottlenecks with 96% operational QA accuracy and superior diagnostic capability.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework that combines Knowledge Graphs (KG) and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning to analyze warehouse simulation data for bottleneck identification. The approach converts raw Discrete Event Simulation (DES) output into a KG capturing relationships between events and entities, then uses an LLM agent with iterative reasoning to answer operational and investigative questions. The framework demonstrates near-perfect performance on operational queries and successfully identifies complex bottlenecks in three investigative scenarios, outperforming traditional baseline methods. This enables automated, intelligent warehouse inefficiency evaluation through natural language interaction, significantly reducing time-to-insight for warehouse planners.

## Method Summary
The framework ingests DES logs from warehouse simulations and transforms them into a Neo4j Knowledge Graph with nodes representing entities (Suppliers, Workers, AGVs) and relationships representing transfer events with timestamp properties. An LLM agent (GPT-4o) processes natural language queries through two distinct paths: a QA Chain for operational questions using step-wise decomposition and self-reflection, and a Reasoning Chain for investigative questions using iterative sub-questioning conditioned on previous answers. The KG schema requires careful upfront design, and the framework trades latency for accuracy through its iterative reasoning approach, demonstrating superior diagnostic capability compared to baseline methods.

## Key Results
- Achieved 96% Pass@1 and 100% Pass@4 accuracy on operational QA compared to baselines scoring 72% and 88% respectively
- Successfully identified three injected bottlenecks in investigative scenarios that traditional methods missed
- Demonstrated the framework's ability to answer both straightforward operational questions and complex investigative queries about root causes
- Showed that iterative reasoning with evidence-conditioned decomposition outperforms monolithic query approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Iterative Evidence-Conditioned Decomposition
Complex investigative queries are resolved more accurately when decomposed into sequential sub-questions where each question is conditioned on the answer of the previous one. The agent generates sub-questions like "Is supplier X slower than average?" retrieves answers, and uses that context to generate next specific questions, mirroring human root-cause analysis. This assumes the LLM can maintain context and formulate valid follow-up queries based on returned data snippets.

### Mechanism 2: Step-wise Self-Correction via Local Reflection
Embedding self-reflection immediately after every query execution step significantly improves reliability over single-pass reflection. In the "Step-wise Guide," if a generated Cypher query fails or returns null, the agent attempts to correct it before synthesizing the final answer, localizing error correction rather than trying to fix complex analysis at the end. This assumes syntax errors can be detected and fixed by the LLM upon receiving error messages.

### Mechanism 3: Semantic Grounding in Structured Event Graphs
Translating raw DES logs into a Knowledge Graph with explicit relationships enables the LLM to traverse complex process flows difficult to express in standard SQL joins. The KG schema maps entities and events into nodes and edges with temporal properties, allowing the LLM to generate Cypher path queries to calculate derived metrics like "total discharge time" dynamically. This assumes simulation logs are consistent enough to map to a static schema.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Graphs (Property Graph Model)**: Understanding Neo4j's property graph model where Nodes represent entities and Relationships represent events with timestamps as properties is non-negotiable. Quick check: Can you distinguish between storing "Worker status" as a Node property versus a Relationship property in a temporal event graph?

- **Discrete Event Simulation (DES) Basics**: Understanding DES concepts like "Start Time," "End Time," "Wait Time," and "Throughput" is critical to design the KG schema and interpret diagnostic results. Quick check: If a simulation log shows an AGV "arrival" but no "departure," what does that imply about the system state, and how would the KG represent it?

- **LLM Chaining & Tool Use (LangChain)**: Understanding how to structure prompts to force an LLM to output a Cypher query rather than chat text is critical. Quick check: What is the difference between a "Reasoning Chain" (iterative) and a "QA Chain" (sequential) in terms of context window usage?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: DES Logs -> Python Parser -> Neo4j KG (Nodes: Supplier/Worker/AGV; Edges: Transfer events) -> LLM Agent (GPT-4o) -> LangChain Chains -> Operational/Investigative Queries -> Answers
- **Critical path**: The KG Schema Design requires "careful upfront domain expertise." If the schema does not explicitly link Suppliers to Packages and Packages to AGVs, the LLM cannot generate Cypher queries to join them.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Latency vs. Accuracy - Iterative Reasoning Chain is slower (multiple LLM calls) but offers higher diagnostic depth compared to Direct QA. Cypher vs. SQL - Chosen for expressiveness in path traversal, trading off SQL tooling simplicity.
- **Failure signatures**: Schema Hallucination (LLM queries non-existent relationships), Metric Miscalculation (misidentifying start/end nodes), Empty Context (decomposition fails to trigger correct aggregation queries)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Recreate "Direct QA" vs. "Step-wise Guide" comparison using Appendix questions to validate Pass@k improvement. 2) Modify simulation to include "Maintenance Event" to test KG schema rigidity. 3) Run Investigative query with limited context window to observe "Reasoning Drift."

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Benchmarking methodology**: How can the framework's performance on complex investigative bottleneck identification be formally quantified through rigorous benchmarking? The authors state the need for "developing rigorous benchmarking methodologies for its investigative question-answering capabilities to formally quantify performance in bottleneck identification tasks."

- **Transferability**: To what extent is the specific Knowledge Graph schema and agent fine-tuning transferable to other warehouse processes like slotting design or order picking? Section 6 notes that "seamless applicability to vastly different DES models or a broader array of warehouse processes is yet to be exhaustively demonstrated."

- **Reliability in novel scenarios**: How reliable are LLM-generated Cypher queries and synthesized explanations when the framework encounters highly novel or ambiguous operational scenarios? The limitations section notes that "nuanced accuracy of its synthesized explanations warrant ongoing evaluation, particularly when faced with highly novel or ambiguous operational scenarios."

## Limitations

- **Schema Rigidity**: The custom KG schema requires "careful upfront domain expertise" and cannot adapt to new event types without manual schema updates, creating maintenance burden as warehouse operations evolve.
- **LLM Dependency**: The entire reasoning pipeline depends on GPT-4o's ability to parse natural language questions, generate valid Cypher queries, and maintain context during iterative decomposition, with performance degrading if context window is truncated.
- **Evaluation Scope**: The 25 operational questions and 3 investigative scenarios represent a single warehouse simulation scenario, with generalizability to different warehouse layouts, equipment configurations, or industry verticals remaining unproven.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The operational QA results (Pass@1=96%, Pass@4=100%) and the framework's ability to correctly identify three injected bottlenecks in investigative scenarios are well-supported by provided data and methodology.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that iterative reasoning outperforms monolithic queries for complex diagnostics is supported by framework design and observed success, but lacks direct comparative ablation studies.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that Knowledge Graphs are superior to standard SQL for this domain is plausible given semantic richness, but the paper does not provide direct SQL baseline comparisons for the same queries.

## Next Checks

1. **Schema Adaptability Test**: Introduce a new event type (e.g., "Maintenance Event") into DES simulation and attempt to query it. Document whether framework requires manual schema updates or if LLM can adapt Cypher generation.

2. **Cross-Scenario Generalization**: Apply framework to a different warehouse simulation scenario (different layout, equipment count, or operational focus). Compare Pass@k scores and diagnostic accuracy to assess generalizability.

3. **LLM Context Window Stress Test**: Run an investigative query with truncated context window to observe if "Reasoning Drift" occurs. Compare diagnostic outcome to full context case to quantify impact of context limitations.
