# Heterogeneous Multi-agent Collaboration in UAV-assisted Mobile Crowdsensing Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.25261
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25261
- **Reference count:** 14
- **Primary result:** Novel CKAN-HAPPO MADRL algorithm achieves superior performance in UAV-assisted mobile crowdsensing optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the complex optimization problem in UAV-assisted mobile crowdsensing networks by proposing a joint framework that integrates time slot partition, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory planning. The authors formulate the problem as a non-convex stochastic optimization modeled as a POMDP and solve it using a novel MADRL algorithm called CKAN-HAPPO. The method combines CNNs for feature extraction with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to capture state-action dependencies, implementing a sequential update scheme for coordinated multi-agent training. The approach effectively handles device heterogeneity, mobility constraints, and resource limitations in dynamic sensing environments.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework solves the UAV-assisted mobile crowdsensing optimization through a joint approach that simultaneously determines time slot allocation, resource distribution, and UAV trajectories. The problem is modeled as a POMDP to handle the stochastic and partially observable nature of the environment. The CKAN-HAPPO algorithm employs a hybrid actor network architecture combining CNNs for spatial feature extraction with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to model complex state-action relationships. A sequential update mechanism enables coordinated learning across multiple UAVs, addressing the challenges of device heterogeneity and dynamic mobility patterns in crowdsensing applications.

## Key Results
- CKAN-HAPPO achieves superior reward convergence and processed data volume compared to CNN-HAPPO and MLP-HAPPO baselines
- Consistent performance gains demonstrated across varying UAV counts and computation frequencies
- The hybrid CNN-KAN architecture effectively captures complex dependencies in the multi-agent sensing environment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CKAN-HAPPO algorithm succeeds by leveraging the complementary strengths of CNNs for spatial pattern recognition and KANs for modeling high-order state-action dependencies. The sequential update scheme enables coordinated decision-making among multiple UAVs while maintaining computational efficiency. By formulating the problem as a POMDP, the approach naturally handles the uncertainty and partial observability inherent in mobile crowdsensing scenarios, where ground user locations and task distributions are dynamic and only partially known to the UAVs.

## Foundational Learning
- **POMDP modeling:** Essential for handling uncertainty and partial observability in dynamic sensing environments; quick check: verify state transition and observation models accurately reflect real-world mobility patterns
- **MADRL sequential updates:** Critical for coordinating multiple agents without centralized control; quick check: test convergence stability with different update orderings
- **CNN feature extraction:** Enables spatial pattern recognition from environmental observations; quick check: validate feature representations against known mobility patterns
- **KAN state-action modeling:** Captures complex non-linear relationships between states and actions; quick check: compare performance against traditional neural networks on benchmark tasks
- **Joint optimization framework:** Integrates multiple optimization objectives (time, resources, trajectories); quick check: assess Pareto optimality across different objective weightings
- **Device heterogeneity handling:** Addresses varying computation and communication capabilities; quick check: test performance across realistic device capability distributions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Observation Inputs -> CNN Feature Extractor -> KAN State-Action Model -> Action Outputs; Sequential Update Coordinator -> Multiple UAV Agents

**Critical Path:** Environmental observations → CNN spatial feature extraction → KAN high-order dependency modeling → Action selection → Environment feedback → Sequential update coordination

**Design Tradeoffs:** The hybrid CNN-KAN architecture trades increased model complexity for improved capture of state-action dependencies, while the sequential update scheme balances coordination quality against computational overhead. The POMDP formulation provides robust uncertainty handling at the cost of increased state space complexity.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor convergence may indicate insufficient feature extraction capability (CNN issues) or inadequate state-action modeling (KAN issues). Coordination failures suggest problems with the sequential update scheme. Suboptimal sensing performance could result from POMDP state estimation inaccuracies.

**First Experiments:**
1. Benchmark CKAN-HAPPO against pure CNN and pure KAN baselines to isolate contribution of each component
2. Test sequential update performance with varying update orders and frequencies
3. Evaluate robustness to observation noise and partial observability levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on synthetic simulations without real-world validation
- Assumes stationary user distribution patterns that may not hold in dynamic scenarios
- Communication overhead between UAVs and ground users not explicitly modeled
- Computational complexity of the hybrid architecture not thoroughly analyzed

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Mathematical formulation of POMDP model and MADRL framework structure
**Medium Confidence:** Reported performance improvements over baselines, dependent on simulation assumptions
**Medium Confidence:** Claims about KAN's superior state-action dependency modeling require broader empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of KAN versus CNN components to overall performance
2. Implement framework on real UAV testbed or high-fidelity simulator with realistic mobility and channel conditions
3. Analyze computational overhead and communication latency introduced by sequential update scheme across different network sizes
