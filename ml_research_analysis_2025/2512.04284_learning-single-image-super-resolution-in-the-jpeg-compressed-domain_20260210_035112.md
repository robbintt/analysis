# Learning Single-Image Super-Resolution in the JPEG Compressed Domain

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04284
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04284

- Primary result: JPEG-compressed-domain SISR achieves 2.6x faster data loading and 2.5x faster training with competitive quality

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a JPEG-compressed-domain approach to single-image super-resolution (SISR), processing DCT coefficients directly without full RGB decoding. The method uses a lightweight FreqSR CNN architecture tailored for frequency-domain inputs, achieving significant computational efficiency gains while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. Evaluation demonstrates reduced memory usage and faster processing, particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments.

## Method Summary
The approach operates directly on JPEG DCT coefficients rather than decoding to RGB format. Using the DIV2K dataset transcoded to JPEG quality 100, the method extracts Y-channel DCT coefficients and processes them through a FreqSR model consisting of 4 depth-wise residual blocks followed by 4 standard residual blocks. DCT coefficients are normalized from [-1024, 1016] to [-1, 1], and patches of size 32×32 are used for training. The model is trained with Adam optimizer, L1 loss, and 100 epochs at batch size 1. Post-processing involves DCT-to-RGB conversion with chrominance upsampling and merging.

## Key Results
- 2.6x faster data loading compared to traditional JPEG decoding pipelines
- 2.5x faster training while maintaining competitive PSNR/SSIM metrics
- Reduced memory usage suitable for resource-constrained environments
- Modest quality trade-offs acceptable for practical applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The efficiency gains stem from eliminating the computational overhead of full JPEG decoding and RGB reconstruction. By operating directly in the frequency domain, the method avoids unnecessary transformations and leverages the compressed representation's inherent structure. The lightweight FreqSR architecture is specifically designed to process DCT coefficients efficiently, with depth-wise convolutions reducing parameter count while maintaining representational capacity.

## Foundational Learning
- **JPEG compression basics**: Understanding DCT coefficient extraction and quantization is essential for working with compressed-domain inputs. Quick check: Verify DCT coefficient ranges match [-1024, 1016] before normalization.
- **Frequency domain processing**: SISR in DCT space requires understanding of frequency-domain upsampling and block alignment. Quick check: Confirm DCT-domain upsampling produces correct spatial resolution.
- **Residual network architecture**: The FreqSR model uses residual connections for stable training and feature reuse. Quick check: Verify residual block skip connections maintain feature dimensionality.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: JPEG image -> DCT extraction -> Normalization [-1024,1016]->[-1,1] -> FreqSR (4 DW-res blocks + 4 res blocks) -> Post-processing (denormalize, CbCr upsample, merge) -> RGB output

**Critical path**: DCT coefficient preprocessing → FreqSR inference → DCT-to-RGB post-processing

**Design tradeoffs**: Operating in compressed domain sacrifices some reconstruction quality for significant speed and memory gains. The lightweight architecture prioritizes efficiency over maximum possible quality.

**Failure signatures**: Chrominance misalignment artifacts indicate issues in Cb/Cr channel handling during post-processing. Training instability suggests incorrect DCT normalization ranges or extraction errors.

**First experiments**: 1) Verify DCT coefficient extraction produces expected ranges, 2) Test normalization pipeline with sample DCT patches, 3) Validate FreqSR output against known DCT-to-RGB conversion examples.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Modest quality trade-offs compared to full-RGB approaches may limit applications requiring maximum fidelity
- Limited evaluation to JPEG quality factor 100 and scale factor ×2 restricts generalizability
- DCT-domain upsampling implementation details referenced but not fully specified

## Confidence
- High confidence: Efficiency gains are well-supported by methodology eliminating full decoding overhead
- Medium confidence: Competitive quality claim depends on specific datasets and metrics used
- Low confidence: Resource-constrained environment suitability inferred from speed gains without explicit hardware testing

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the DCT-domain upsampling implementation using referenced papers [21,22] to verify exact algorithm
2. Train and evaluate FreqSR on DIV2K/JPEG-Q100 with exact residual block configuration to confirm PSNR/SSIM values
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing full JPEG decoding vs. compressed-domain approach on identical hardware to quantify actual benefits
