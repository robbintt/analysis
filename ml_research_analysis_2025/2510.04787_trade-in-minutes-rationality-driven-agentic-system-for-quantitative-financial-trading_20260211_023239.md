# Trade in Minutes! Rationality-Driven Agentic System for Quantitative Financial Trading

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04787
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04787
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Rationality-driven multi-agent system achieves 137ms latency and competitive profitability (ARR 6.4%-13.7%, Sharpe 0.74-0.86) across 200+ trading pairs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents TiMi, a rationality-driven multi-agent system for quantitative financial trading that effectively decouples strategy development from minute-level deployment. The system leverages specialized LLM capabilities in semantic analysis, code programming, and mathematical reasoning to create a closed-loop policy-optimization-deployment chain. Through a two-tier analytical paradigm from macro patterns to micro customization, layered programming design for trading bot implementation, and hierarchical optimization driven by mathematical reflection, TiMi demonstrates superior performance across 200+ trading pairs in both stock and cryptocurrency markets.

## Method Summary
TiMi employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) Policy stage—LLMs develop strategies offline; (2) Optimization stage—bots undergo simulation and mathematical reflection via linear programming; (3) Deployment stage—optimized bots execute with 137ms latency. The system uses four specialized agents: A_ma (DeepSeek-V3) for macro strategy generation, A_sa for pair-specific customization, A_be (Qwen2.5-Coder) for bot code generation, and A_fr (DeepSeek-R1) for mathematical optimization. The architecture follows layered programming with strategy→function→parameter hierarchy and employs hierarchical refinement across three optimization layers.

## Key Results
- Annual Rate of Return: 6.4% (U.S. stock index futures), 8.0% (mainstream cryptocurrencies), 13.7% (altcoin markets)
- Sharpe Ratios: 0.74 (stocks), 0.79 (crypto), 0.86 (altcoins)
- Action latency: 137ms
- Maximum Drawdown: 20.3% (stocks), 32.8% (cryptocurrencies), 28.5% (altcoins)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decoupling offline strategy development from real-time deployment improves execution latency by eliminating continuous LLM inference during trading.
- Mechanism: Three-stage pipeline separates policy development (offline), optimization (simulation-based), and deployment (137ms latency). Efficiency ratio η ≈ c_agent/c_bot as trading frequency increases.
- Core assumption: Trading strategies can be sufficiently codified into executable bots that operate without real-time LLM reasoning.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "architecturally decouples strategy development from minute-level deployment"; [section] efficiency quantified as η = c_agent × n / (c_policy + c_optimization + c_bot × n)
- Break condition: Market dynamics shift faster than optimization cycles can adapt.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical optimization (parameter → function → strategy layers) enables systematic refinement while preserving strategic continuity.
- Mechanism: Feedback reflection agent formulates linear programming problems from risk scenarios, escalating from parameter adjustments to function substitution to structural strategy changes.
- Core assumption: Risk scenarios can be meaningfully translated into linear constraints with feasible solution spaces.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "closed-loop optimization driven by mathematical reflection"; [section] Θ* = argmax_{Θ∈C(Θ)} Σ ω_i J_i(Θ, F) subject to C(Θ) = {Θ∈ℝ^n | A(R)Θ ≼ b(R)}
- Break condition: Non-convex risk scenarios or mutually infeasible constraints.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pair-specific customization via strategy adaptation agent reduces cross-pair performance variance and improves risk-adjusted returns.
- Mechanism: A_sa refines general macro strategies S into pair-specific candidates S_p via semantic analysis, then optimizes parameters Θ_p via mathematical reasoning.
- Core assumption: Trading pairs exhibit heterogeneous behaviors that benefit from customized strategies.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "two-tier analytical paradigm from macro patterns to micro customization"; [section] Ablation study shows σ_ARR drops from 19.5% to 11.0% with A_sa enabled
- Break condition: High correlation between pairs or regime-unified markets.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear programming for constrained optimization
  - Why needed here: Feedback reflection agent transforms qualitative risk scenarios into formal inequality constraints (A(R)Θ ≼ b(R)) solvable via LP methods.
  - Quick check question: Given constraints x + y ≤ 10 and 2x + y ≥ 5, can you identify the feasible region for maximizing f(x,y) = 3x + 2y?

- Concept: Multi-agent coordination patterns (pipeline vs. negotiation)
  - Why needed here: TiMi uses pipeline architecture where agents have specialized, sequential responsibilities rather than debate-style negotiation.
  - Quick check question: If agent outputs are conditionally dependent (A_sa depends on A_ma's strategies), what failure modes emerge if A_ma produces incomplete outputs?

- Concept: Sharpe Ratio and Maximum Drawdown as risk-adjusted metrics
  - Why needed here: Paper reports SR of 0.74–0.86 and MDD of 20.3–32.8% across markets; understanding these is essential for interpreting claimed "robust risk control."
  - Quick check question: If ARR increases from 8% to 12% but volatility doubles, does Sharpe Ratio improve or degrade?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Market data → A_ma (macro strategies) → A_sa (pair-specific customization) → A_be (bot code generation) → Offline simulation → A_fr (feedback analysis + LP solving) → A_be (hierarchical refinement) → Deploy B* to live environment

- Critical path: Four specialized agents with DeepSeek-V3 (semantic analysis), Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct (code programming), DeepSeek-R1 (mathematical reasoning), and hybrid local/API LLM inference.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Zero-shot performance vs. optimization depth: Optimization stage limits zero-shot capability when porting to new markets
  - Latency vs. adaptability: CPU-only deployment achieves 137ms latency but cannot adapt without re-running optimization cycles
  - Generality vs. specificity: Macro strategies provide statistical significance; pair-specific customization adds overhead but reduces variance

- Failure signatures:
  - "Logic inconsistency": Parameter-only optimization without code synchronization produces runnable but semantically mismatched bots
  - "Runtime unstable": Bots without A_fr optimization fail under edge cases
  - MDD spikes >50%: Order density MQ and bounds MP inadequately calibrated for volatility regime shifts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce backtest on 2024 cryptocurrency data with full TiMi vs. w/o A_fr to validate optimization contribution
  2. Deploy unified strategy (w/o A_sa) across correlated altcoin pairs to test whether customization overhead is justified
  3. Stress-test LP constraint solver with simulated tail-risk scenarios to identify infeasibility conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the system be adapted to support zero-shot trading performance in new markets without the extensive offline optimization stage? (The authors acknowledge limited zero-shot capability when porting to new markets)
- Is the system's efficacy dependent on the specific proprietary LLMs used (DeepSeek, Qwen), or is it robust to model substitution? (No ablation on sensitivity to specific model choices provided)
- How does the feedback reflection agent handle "black swan" events or market regimes absent from historical simulation data? (Mathematical reasoning optimizes parameters based on observed data, may fail for unencountered scenarios)

## Limitations

- Architecture assumes stable market regimes between optimization cycles, which may not hold for minute-level trading requiring rapid adaptation
- Linear programming formulation may fail under non-convex market conditions or mutually infeasible constraints during extreme volatility
- Limited zero-shot capability when porting to new markets without full optimization cycles

## Confidence

**High Confidence (4/5):** Architectural framework of decoupling strategy development from deployment is well-founded and logically sound. Layered optimization approach follows established principles. Reported 137ms latency is verifiable.

**Medium Confidence (3/5):** Empirical performance metrics are reported with statistical rigor, but lack of out-of-sample validation reduces confidence in generalizability. Pair-specific customization benefits supported by ablation studies but effectiveness across diverse conditions remains to be validated.

**Low Confidence (2/5):** Robustness of linear programming constraint solver under extreme market conditions is untested. Zero-shot performance claims contradicted by authors' acknowledgment of limited cross-market transferability.

## Next Checks

1. **Extreme Market Stress Test:** Deploy during simulated flash crash scenarios with liquidity vacuums to validate whether LP constraint solver produces feasible solutions or fails when risk scenarios become non-convex.

2. **Cross-Market Transferability:** Port optimized bots to new asset class (commodities or forex) without running full optimization cycles to quantify "limited zero-shot capability" and measure degradation in ARR/Sharpe Ratio.

3. **Real-World Execution Impact:** Run live trading with sub-100ms latency measurement including market data processing, order placement, and fill confirmation to validate whether 137ms latency holds under actual exchange conditions with slippage and execution variance.
