# PG-DPIR: An efficient plug-and-play method for high-count Poisson-Gaussian inverse problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.10375
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10375
- Reference count: 29
- Key outcome: PG-DPIR achieves state-of-the-art PSNR (48.66 dB for restoration, 37.18 dB for super-resolution) with significantly improved efficiency through warm-started gradient descent in Poisson-Gaussian inverse problems

## Executive Summary
PG-DPIR introduces an efficient plug-and-play method for high-count Poisson-Gaussian inverse problems in satellite imaging. The method adapts the DPIR framework by incorporating a novel warm-start initialization for gradient descent in the proximal step, using an approximate proximal operator computed in closed form. This approach accelerates convergence by several orders of magnitude while maintaining restoration quality. Experiments on realistic Pleiades satellite image simulations demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving high PSNR values with dramatically reduced runtime.

## Method Summary
PG-DPIR addresses image restoration and super-resolution under Poisson-Gaussian noise by modifying the Half-Quadratic Splitting framework with a two-phase iteration strategy. The key innovation is an efficient initialization of the gradient descent required for the proximal step: early iterations use a closed-form approximate proximal operator based on mean noise level estimation, while later iterations employ limited gradient descent steps initialized from this approximation. The method uses DRUNet as a plug-and-play denoiser with a noise schedule that decreases from σ_d = 20/255 to σ_0. The algorithm requires 8 iterations for image restoration and 20 iterations for super-resolution, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieves PSNR of 48.66 dB for image restoration and 37.18 dB for super-resolution
- Reduces runtime by 16× compared to baseline DPIR (SISR: 68s vs 1090s)
- Maintains near-identical quality (≤0.04 dB PSNR difference) between full and approximate methods
- Demonstrates superiority over Bay+IF and standard DPIR baselines across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Warm-starting gradient descent with a closed-form approximate proximal operator dramatically reduces iterations needed for convergence in Poisson-Gaussian inverse problems.
- **Mechanism**: The approximate proximal operator (eq. 9) uses a mean noise level σ̄² = σ²₀ + K(Aū_{k-1}) computed from the current estimate's mean luminance, allowing analytical solution. This provides a starting point close to the true solution of the exact proximal (eq. 8), which lacks closed form due to signal-dependent variance in the Poisson-Gaussian likelihood.
- **Core assumption**: Mean luminance provides a sufficiently accurate noise variance estimate for initialization; the approximate and exact proximal solutions lie in the same basin of attraction.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "we propose in particular an efficient initialization of the gradient descent required for the proximal step that accelerates convergence by several orders of magnitude"
  - [Table II]: SISR speedup from 1090s (without init) to 68s (with init) with near-identical PSNR (37.19 vs 37.18)
  - [corpus]: Limited corpus support for this specific warm-start technique; related PnP work [25] addresses convergence but not this initialization strategy
- **Break condition**: When spatial noise variance varies dramatically (e.g., scenes with extreme brightness gradients), the mean-based approximation may provide poor initialization, requiring more gradient steps or causing suboptimal convergence.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: A two-phase iteration strategy—approximate-only in early iterations, limited gradient descent in later iterations—preserves restoration quality while achieving computational efficiency.
- **Mechanism**: Early iterations involve large changes in x_k, making approximate proximal sufficient. Later iterations refine solutions near convergence, where the warm-started gradient descent (5 steps) achieves precision without full optimization. The noise schedule drives σ_d from high (20/255) to σ_0 (minimum noise level), naturally aligning phases with solution maturity.
- **Core assumption**: Early approximate iterations do not irreversibly bias the optimization trajectory; final quality depends primarily on later iterations' precision.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [Algorithm 1]: Explicit two-phase logic with `if i ≤ n/2` branch
  - [Table II]: PSNR difference of only 0.01-0.04 dB between full and approximate methods
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus precedent for this phased approach in PnP methods
- **Break condition**: Severe degradations (e.g., large downsampling factors combined with blur) may require more precise proximal computation even in early iterations to avoid error accumulation.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: For high photon counts (>20), the Gaussian approximation of Poisson-Gaussian noise (eq. 3) enables tractable optimization while maintaining accuracy suitable for satellite imaging.
- **Mechanism**: The Poisson component p(Ax) ~ P(Ax) approximates as Gaussian with variance K(Ax), combining with electronic noise σ²₀ to yield signal-dependent variance σ²_w(x) = σ²₀ + K(Ax). This transforms the intractable Poisson-Gaussian likelihood into a weighted quadratic form amenable to gradient-based optimization.
- **Core assumption**: Photon counts consistently exceed 20 in target applications; the approximation error is negligible relative to other modeling uncertainties.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section I]: "This approximation is very accurate as long as the number of photons exceeds 20. This condition is satisfied in various applications, for instance for remote sensing problems"
  - [eq. 7]: Negative log-likelihood formulation with signal-dependent covariance Σ_w(x)
  - [corpus]: Related work [2,3,23] validates this approximation; [96680] addresses low-photon Poisson problems requiring different treatment
- **Break condition**: Low-light imaging (e.g., nighttime satellite imagery, astronomy) where photon counts fall below the approximation threshold requires reverting to exact Poisson-Gaussian models.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Proximal Operators**
  - Why needed here: The entire method hinges on efficiently computing proximal operators for data fidelity terms. Understanding why closed-form solutions exist for Gaussian noise but not Poisson-Gaussian is essential.
  - Quick check question: For g(x) = (1/2σ²)||y - Hx||² with blur kernel H, what is the closed-form prox_{g/μ}(z)? (Answer: Requires solving (H^T H/σ² + μI)x = H^T y/σ² + μz, typically via FFT for convolution).

- **Concept: Half Quadratic Splitting (HQS)**
  - Why needed here: PG-DPIR uses HQS to decouple data fidelity from regularization, enabling the plug-and-play framework where a denoiser acts as implicit regularizer.
  - Quick check question: In HQS, how does the penalty parameter μ relate to the denoising level σ_d? (Answer: μ = λ/σ²_d, so decreasing σ_d increases μ, forcing x_k and u_k closer together).

- **Concept: Plug-and-Play Regularization**
  - Why needed here: Distinguishes PG-DPIR from sensor-specific supervised methods; the denoiser DRUNet provides regularization independent of the forward model A.
  - Quick check question: Why can the same DRUNet denoiser handle both image restoration (IR) and single-image super-resolution (SISR)? (Answer: The denoiser only removes noise from intermediate estimates; the data fidelity step handles degradation-specific constraints).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Degraded image y -> Initialization module (u_0) -> Proximal computation (approximate/gradient) -> Denoising module (DRUNet) -> Output (u_n)
- **Critical path**:
  1. Initialize u_0 (typically zeros or pseudo-inverse)
  2. For k = 1 to n:
     - Compute σ̄ from mean of u_{k-1}
     - Solve eq. (9) in closed form → x_k^(0)
     - If k > n/2: run 5 gradient steps from x_k^(0)
     - Denoise: u_k = DRUNet(x_k, σ_d^(k))
  3. Return u_n
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Iterations vs. quality**: 8 iterations sufficient for IR; 20 needed for SISR (Table I)
  - **Gradient steps in phase 2**: 5 chosen empirically; paper notes this produces "very similar results" to full optimization
  - **Denoiser fine-tuning**: DRUNet pretrained on general images, fine-tuned 500k iterations on satellite data—trades generality for domain-specific performance
- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Line artifacts in SISR** (Fig. 3): Paper acknowledges this; likely hyperparameter sensitivity in noise schedule or μ values
  - **Over-smoothing**: If σ_d^(1) too low or λ too high, fine details (e.g., pedestrian crossings in Fig. 1) lost
  - **Slow convergence without warm start**: If gradient descent not initialized properly, SISR takes 16× longer (Table II)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Reproduce IR baseline comparison** (Table I) on provided test set: Implement PG-DPIR with 8 iterations, compare PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS against Bay+IF, DPIR, and PGD to validate claimed 48.66 dB PSNR
  2. **Ablation on gradient descent iterations**: Test {0, 3, 5, 10, 20} gradient steps in phase 2 to verify 5 is sufficient and identify quality-speed frontier
  3. **Noise level robustness test**: Vary K and σ₀ parameters to characterize when the Gaussian approximation (photon count > 20) begins to fail, informing operational bounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can the line artifacts observed in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) be eliminated through specific hyperparameter tuning or modified training procedures?
- **Basis**: [explicit] Page 4, Section IV-D notes visual artifacts in SISR and states: "It is likely that a more careful choice of the hyperparameters... would erase those artifacts. This is left for future work."
- **Why unresolved**: The current work identifies the artifacts but does not define the specific training or testing hyperparameters required to remove them.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A demonstration of PG-DPIR on the SISR task producing artifact-free images with maintained PSNR/SSIM metrics after hyperparameter optimization.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can diffusion-based methods be adapted to approximate the Poisson-Gaussian noise model within the PG-DPIR framework?
- **Basis**: [explicit] Page 5, Conclusion states: "Future work will be dedicated to... adapting diffusion-based methods to approximate the Poisson-Gaussian noise model."
- **Why unresolved**: The current method relies on a plug-and-play denoiser (DRUNet), and the integration of diffusion models for this specific noise approximation remains unexplored by the authors.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A variant of the algorithm utilizing a diffusion-based prior that maintains the efficiency and convergence properties of PG-DPIR.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Is the Gaussian approximation of Poisson-Gaussian noise valid for PG-DPIR in low-count imaging scenarios (e.g., less than 20 photons)?
- **Basis**: [inferred] Page 1, Section I states the approximation is "very accurate as long as the number of photons exceeds 20," explicitly excluding low-count imaging from the current method's scope.
- **Why unresolved**: The efficiency of PG-DPIR relies on the approximate forward model (Eq. 3), which breaks down in low-light conditions common in astronomy or biology.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Error analysis or restoration results on synthetic data specifically generated with photon counts below the threshold of 20.

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: Does PG-DPIR maintain its stated efficiency and performance superiority when applied to real raw data from operational satellite sensors, as opposed to realistic simulations?
- **Basis**: [inferred] Abstract claims the method is "promising for on-ground satellite processing chains," yet Section IV-A confirms experiments rely solely on "realistic simulated images" from airplane data.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper demonstrates results on simulations (Pleiades) but lacks validation on actual raw satellite captures, where sensor mismatches or unmodeled degradations might occur.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Benchmark comparisons (PSNR, LPIPS, runtime) on actual raw satellite imagery against the Bay+IF baseline.

## Limitations
- **Dynamic range limitations**: The mean-based noise variance estimation may fail in scenes with extreme brightness variations, leading to poor warm-start initialization
- **Low-light applicability**: The Gaussian approximation breaks down when photon counts fall below 20, excluding nighttime or astronomical imaging
- **SISR artifacts**: Line artifacts appear in super-resolution outputs, indicating potential hyperparameter sensitivity or structural limitations in the current formulation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The Gaussian approximation for high photon counts (>20) is well-established in remote sensing literature [2,3,23] and the paper provides theoretical grounding for the approximation's accuracy
- **Medium Confidence**: The warm-start initialization mechanism shows dramatic runtime improvements (16× speedup in SISR) with minimal quality degradation (≤0.04 dB PSNR loss), but the corpus lacks direct precedent for this specific approach
- **Medium Confidence**: The two-phase iteration strategy achieves claimed efficiency gains, though the rationale for exactly 5 gradient steps and the n/2 iteration threshold appear empirically determined rather than theoretically justified

## Next Checks
1. **Photon Count Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary photon counts below and above the assumed threshold (K·Ax < 20) to quantify when the Gaussian approximation breaks down, using ground-truth high-resolution satellite images with known noise characteristics
2. **Dynamic Range Robustness**: Test PG-DPIR on scenes with extreme brightness variations (e.g., urban scenes with both dark shadows and bright rooftops) to evaluate whether mean-based noise variance estimation provides adequate warm-start initialization across all spatial regions
3. **Generalization to Alternative Denoisers**: Replace DRUNet with diffusion model priors (e.g., from [28]) or alternative denoisers to verify whether the efficiency gains from warm-start initialization transfer to other PnP frameworks, particularly those designed for low-photon imaging
