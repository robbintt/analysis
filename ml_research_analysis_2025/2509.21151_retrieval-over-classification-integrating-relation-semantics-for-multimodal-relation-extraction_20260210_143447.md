# Retrieval over Classification: Integrating Relation Semantics for Multimodal Relation Extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21151
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21151
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: F1 scores of 91.22% (MNRE) and 71.97% (MORE) using retrieval-based framework

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitations of classification-based approaches in multimodal relation extraction, particularly their inability to model entity types and positions and their limited semantic expressiveness for fine-grained relations. The proposed ROC framework reformulates the task as a retrieval problem driven by relation semantics, integrating entity types and positions via a multimodal encoder, expanding relations into natural language descriptions using a large language model, and aligning entity-relation pairs through semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments on the MNRE and MORE datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with F1 scores of 91.22% and 71.97%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each component, highlighting the effectiveness of the retrieval-based paradigm and explicit multimodal interaction in improving accuracy and interpretability.

## Method Summary
The ROC framework transforms multimodal relation extraction from a classification problem into a retrieval task by leveraging relation semantics. The approach consists of three main components: (1) a multimodal encoder that integrates entity types and positions using a transformer-based architecture, (2) a relation description generator that uses a large language model to expand relations into natural language descriptions, and (3) a semantic alignment mechanism that employs contrastive learning to match entity-relation pairs based on semantic similarity. This retrieval-based paradigm enables the model to handle fine-grained relations and provides interpretable results by explicitly modeling the semantic relationships between entities and their contexts.

## Key Results
- Achieves F1 scores of 91.22% on MNRE and 71.97% on MORE datasets
- Outperforms state-of-the-art classification-based methods by significant margins
- Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, particularly the retrieval-based reformulation and multimodal encoder

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The retrieval-based approach overcomes classification limitations by modeling semantic relationships rather than relying on fixed relation categories. By expanding relations into natural language descriptions, the framework captures nuanced semantic distinctions that are difficult to express through categorical labels. The multimodal encoder explicitly integrates entity types and positions, allowing the model to leverage both visual and textual information effectively. Contrastive learning enables fine-grained semantic alignment between entities and relations, improving the model's ability to distinguish between similar relation types.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Multimodal Encoding**
   - Why needed: Traditional models often fail to effectively combine visual and textual information for relation extraction
   - Quick check: Verify that the encoder can process both entity positions and types while maintaining semantic coherence

2. **Relation Description Generation**
   - Why needed: Categorical labels are insufficient for capturing fine-grained semantic distinctions
   - Quick check: Ensure generated descriptions accurately represent the intended relation semantics

3. **Contrastive Learning for Alignment**
   - Why needed: Direct classification cannot capture complex semantic relationships between entities and relations
   - Quick check: Validate that semantically similar entity-relation pairs are properly aligned in the embedding space

4. **Retrieval vs Classification Paradigm**
   - Why needed: Classification approaches struggle with scalability and fine-grained distinctions
   - Quick check: Confirm retrieval accuracy improves as the relation taxonomy becomes more granular

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Multimodal Encoder -> Relation Description Generator -> Semantic Alignment -> Retrieval Module

Critical Path: Entity inputs → Multimodal Encoder → Entity embeddings → Contrastive Learning → Relation embeddings → Semantic alignment → Final retrieval prediction

Design Tradeoffs: The framework trades computational efficiency (due to retrieval complexity) for improved semantic expressiveness and interpretability. The reliance on LLMs for relation descriptions introduces dependency on external models but enables richer semantic representation.

Failure Signatures:
- Poor retrieval performance when relation descriptions lack semantic clarity
- Degraded accuracy with highly similar relation types due to insufficient semantic distinction
- Scalability issues with extremely large relation taxonomies

First Experiments:
1. Validate multimodal encoder performance on entity type and position integration
2. Test relation description generation quality across diverse relation types
3. Evaluate semantic alignment accuracy for fine-grained relation distinctions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the framework's generalizability to different multimodal domains, scalability to larger relation taxonomies, and the impact of relation description quality on retrieval accuracy. It also raises questions about the framework's performance on datasets with different entity types and relation granularities beyond those tested in the experiments.

## Limitations

- Dependence on large language models for relation description generation introduces potential variability in relation semantics quality
- Semantic alignment mechanism may struggle with highly similar relation types or ambiguous entity positioning
- Scalability to extremely large relation taxonomies or document collections remains unclear
- Experimental validation limited to two datasets (MNRE and MORE), potentially constraining generalizability

## Confidence

- High confidence in the retrieval-based reformulation as a viable alternative to classification for multimodal relation extraction
- Medium confidence in the semantic alignment approach for capturing fine-grained relations, pending broader validation
- Medium confidence in the multimodal encoder's ability to effectively integrate entity types and positions across diverse datasets
- Low confidence in the framework's scalability and performance on relation taxonomies beyond those tested

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the framework's performance on additional multimodal datasets with different relation granularities and entity types to assess generalizability
2. Conduct systematic ablation studies to quantify the impact of relation description quality from the LLM on retrieval accuracy
3. Test the framework's scalability with progressively larger relation taxonomies and document collections to identify performance bottlenecks
