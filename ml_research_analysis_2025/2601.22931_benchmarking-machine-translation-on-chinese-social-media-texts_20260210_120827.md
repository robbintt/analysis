- Primary result: CSM-MTBench benchmark reveals MT models struggle with slang translation and social-media tone despite strong general performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CSM-MTBench, a new benchmark for evaluating machine translation of Chinese social media text that captures two distinct challenges: slang/neologism translation (Fun Posts) and style/emotion preservation (Social Snippets). The authors propose specialized evaluation metrics including Slang Success Rate (fuzzy matching against GPT-5-generated candidate dictionaries) and Embedding Similarity (averaging style, emotion, and sentiment embeddings). Testing over 20 models reveals that while large models achieve high general translation quality, they consistently underperform on slang translation and maintaining social media tone, with simple prompting strategies providing partial improvements.

## Method Summary
The benchmark consists of two Chinese social media text types: Fun Posts (informal posts with slang/neologisms, ~41 chars avg) and Social Snippets (short emotional expressions, ~10 chars avg). For Fun Posts, the Slang Success Rate metric uses GPT-5 to identify slang and generate translation candidates, then applies fuzzy matching (threshold=0.8) to verify if model outputs contain valid translations. For Social Snippets, Embedding Similarity combines cosine similarities of style, emotion, and sentiment embeddings. The dataset contains 1,183 Fun Posts and 1,000 Social Snippets translated into 5 languages (es, fr, ja, ko, ru), with models evaluated using XCOMET-XL for general quality, SSR for slang, ES for style, and GEMBA-stars (LLM-as-judge) for validation.

## Key Results
- Large models achieve high XCOMET scores but struggle with slang translation (low SSR) and style preservation
- Explicit slang-reminder prompting consistently improves SSR scores (+2.17 for GPT-4o) but has negligible impact on style preservation
- ES metric shows limited discriminability across models (61.74-68.27 range) compared to distinct GEMBA-star differences
- Social media translation requires specialized evaluation beyond standard semantic metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Slang Success Rate (SSR) via fuzzy matching detects semantic gaps in neologism translation that standard metrics miss.
- Mechanism: GPT-5 identifies slang in source/target pairs, generates candidate dictionaries of valid translations, and fuzzy matching (threshold=0.8) verifies if model output contains any candidate.
- Core assumption: GPT-5 can accurately identify slang and generate exhaustive valid translation candidates.
- Evidence: [section 3.2] GPT-5 prompted to identify slang and locate corresponding expressions; [abstract] SSR measures slang translation success rate.
- Break condition: Novel valid translations not in GPT-5 candidate list score as failure.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Averaging cosine similarities of style, emotion, and sentiment embeddings serves as proxy for preserving "reactive" tone of social snippets.
- Mechanism: Short social snippets rely on affective features; encoding source/target into three embedding spaces and averaging cosine similarities quantifies tone consistency.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained embedding models generalize to capture nuanced syntax of Chinese social media comments.
- Evidence: [section 3.3] Final ES score averages cosine similarities across three embedding types; [section 4.2.2] ES provides reasonable assessment and correlates with GEMBA.
- Break condition: Embedding models fail to distinguish different emotional intensities (e.g., sarcasm vs. genuine praise).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explicit prompting regarding slang presence improves translation accuracy but fails for style preservation.
- Mechanism: Alerting models to slang activates informal lexicon knowledge; instructing to "preserve tone" insufficient to override training toward standard grammar.
- Core assumption: Models possess slang translation capability but default to conservative translation unless nudged.
- Evidence: [section 4.3] Slang-reminder prompts improve XCOMET and SSR scores; style-preservation prompting shows no notable differences on Social Snippets; [table 3] SSR improvement (+2.17 for GPT-4o) but negligible ES change.
- Break condition: Completely unseen neologisms result in hallucination or literal translation rather than successful transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: XCOMET vs. Lexical Metrics
  - Why needed: Paper uses XCOMET as baseline for "general quality," contrasting against proposed SSR/ES metrics to show it fails on informal style.
  - Quick check: Why would high XCOMET score accompany low Slang Success Rate?

- Concept: Fuzzy Matching (RapidFuzz)
  - Why needed: SSR metric relies on fuzzy matching rather than exact matching to accommodate morphological variations in slang translations.
  - Quick check: If fuzzy threshold is 0.8, would slang translation with minor spelling error pass or fail SSR check?

- Concept: LLM-as-a-Judge (GEMBA)
  - Why needed: Authors use this as validation standard for cheaper ES metric; understanding prompt-guided LLM scoring is crucial for interpreting GEMBA-stars results.
  - Quick check: In GEMBA-stars prompt, is LLM asked to judge semantic accuracy or stylistic fidelity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Chinese Social Media Text (Fun Posts vs. Social Snippets) -> Translation by MT/LLM models -> Evaluation Layer: GPT-5 (Slang Extraction) -> Human Verification -> Fuzzy Matcher -> SSR Score (Fun Path); Style/Emotion/Sentiment Encoders -> Cosine Similarity Avg -> ES Score (Snippet Path); LLM-as-a-Judge (GEMBA) -> Style Score; Baseline: XCOMET-XL (Semantic Quality)

- Critical path: Fun Posts evaluation relies heavily on GPT-5 extraction prompt and human verification step; poor slang candidate list invalidates SSR metric.

- Design tradeoffs: ES metric is computationally cheaper than GEMBA but shows "relatively narrow performance gap" across models; strict filtering for safety and PII reduces data volume but ensures focus on linguistic challenges rather than toxic content.

- Failure signatures: High XCOMET + Low SSR indicates literal meaning translated but slang missed; High ES + Low Human Evaluation means embeddings align on positive sentiment but specific "vibe" is wrong.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline Reproduction: Run Qwen3-8B or GPT-4o on 50 Fun Posts subset, manually verify SSR pipeline including fuzzy matching outputs.
  2. Ablation on Embeddings: Calculate ES scores using only Style vs. only Emotion embeddings on Social Snippets to identify driving components and GEMBA correlation.
  3. Prompt Sensitivity Test: Apply "Reminder Prompt" to low-resource model (Qwen3-1.7B) to test prompting scalability with model size.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can slang-aware pretraining or targeted fine-tuning significantly outperform simple prompting strategies tested for translating Chinese social media neologisms?
- Basis: [explicit] Limitations section states more sophisticated approaches like slang-aware pretraining can be investigated, as current work focused only on simple prompting.
- Why unresolved: Experiments restricted to general prompting strategies, leaving architectural or training-level interventions untested.
- Evidence: Comparative study fine-tuning models on CSM-MTBench training split or slang-specific corpora measuring SSR delta over baseline prompting results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific prompting mechanisms or model architectures are required to preserve social-media-specific tone and style where simple reminders failed?
- Basis: [inferred] Section 4.3 notes prompting helped with slang (SSR) but "does not lead to notable differences on Social Snippets" for style preservation.
- Why unresolved: Paper demonstrates failure mode but doesn't propose solution for style preservation deficit.
- Evidence: Experiments using few-shot prompting with style-aligned examples or RLAIF optimized for ES score on Social Snippets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can automatic embedding-based metrics be refined to provide greater absolute discriminability between models on style preservation tasks?
- Basis: [inferred] Appendix A.4 notes ES metric exhibits "limited absolute discriminability" (61.74-68.27 range) compared to distinct GEMBA differences.
- Why unresolved: While efficient, current embeddings may lack sensitivity to capture nuance of social media tone, relying on LLM-as-judge for fine-grained distinction.
- Evidence: Development of new style-aware metric correlating more strongly with human or LLM-as-judge rankings while maintaining wider score distribution than current ES metric.

## Limitations

- Human verification of GPT-5 slang extraction remains unclear despite sample verification (0.8% of slang terms)
- Embedding Similarity metric shows limited discriminability (scores clustered 61-68) compared to distinct GEMBA-star differences
- Benchmark focuses on Chinese-to-five-languages direction; proposed methods require validation for other source languages or contexts

## Confidence

**High Confidence**
- Benchmark construction methodology and dataset characteristics (Fun Posts vs. Social Snippets)
- Observation that large models struggle with slang translation and style preservation despite strong general performance
- Effectiveness of explicit slang-reminder prompting for improving translation accuracy

**Medium Confidence**
- Reliability of SSR as comprehensive slang translation metric (dependent on GPT-5 candidate generation quality)
- Validity of ES as cost-effective alternative to GEMBA for style preservation evaluation
- Scalability of prompt-based interventions across different model sizes and capabilities

**Low Confidence**
- Exact human verification rate and procedures for slang candidate dictionaries
- Robustness of fuzzy matching threshold (0.8) across diverse slang terms and translation variations
- Potential bias introduced by using GPT-5 for both slang detection and human reference generation

## Next Checks

1. SSR Pipeline Validation: Select 50 Fun Post samples and manually verify complete SSR pipeline from GPT-5 slang extraction to fuzzy matching; document systematic errors in slang identification or candidate generation.

2. ES vs. GEMBA Correlation Analysis: Calculate ES scores using only individual embedding types (style-only, emotion-only, sentiment-only) on Social Snippets subset; measure correlation with GEMBA-stars to determine driving components and reliability as LLM-as-judge proxy.

3. Prompt Scaling Experiment: Apply "Reminder Prompt" strategy to low-resource model (Qwen3-1.7B) and compare results against reported improvements for larger models to test prompting effectiveness dependency on model capacity.
