# The Sensitivity of Variational Bayesian Neural Network Performance to Hyperparameters

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.20574
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20574
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Learning rate is the single most influential hyperparameter for both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification in variational BNNs.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how hyperparameters affect the performance of variational Bayesian neural networks using global sensitivity analysis. The authors examine the impact on both predictive accuracy (measured by RMSE) and uncertainty quantification (measured by interval score) across two synthetic datasets and two loss functions. The results show that while learning rate has the strongest individual effect, most performance variability comes from complex interactions between hyperparameters. The study finds that smaller KL multipliers and larger numbers of optimizer steps generally improve performance for KL divergence, while α-Renyi divergence shows less sensitivity to certain hyperparameters. The findings emphasize the importance of careful hyperparameter tuning and suggest sensitivity analysis or Bayesian optimization can help identify optimal settings.

## Method Summary
The study uses two synthetic datasets: a 1D cubic function with noise and a 2D quadratic function with noise. A 2-layer neural network with tanh activation is trained using variational inference with either KL divergence or α-Renyi divergence loss functions. The Bayes by Backprop algorithm is implemented with independent Gaussian priors and variational posteriors. A 750-point Latin hypercube sample explores 7 hyperparameters: learning rate, KL multiplier, prior variance, optimizer steps, batch size, hidden layer size, and α. Performance is measured using RMSE for predictive accuracy and interval score for uncertainty calibration. A treed Gaussian process surrogate model computes first-order and total sensitivity indices to quantify hyperparameter importance.

## Key Results
- Learning rate is the most influential individual hyperparameter, contributing roughly half of the first-order sensitivity indices
- Most performance variability is driven by complex interactions between hyperparameters rather than individual effects
- For KL divergence, smaller KL multipliers (γ < 1) and larger numbers of optimizer steps generally improve both RMSE and interval score
- α-Renyi divergence shows less sensitivity to prior variance and optimizer steps compared to KL divergence
- Optimal hyperparameter settings differ between datasets and performance metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The variational inference framework optimizes a lower bound on the marginal likelihood by approximating the true posterior with a tractable distribution. The KL divergence term regularizes the variational posterior toward the prior, while the reconstruction term encourages fitting the data. The α-Renyi divergence provides an alternative divergence measure that can better handle model misspecification. Learning rate controls the optimization dynamics, while the KL multiplier balances the trade-off between fitting the data and maintaining regularization. Optimizer steps determine the extent of training, and prior variance sets the initial regularization strength.

## Foundational Learning
- Variational Inference: Approximates intractable posterior distributions with tractable ones by optimizing a lower bound; needed because exact Bayesian inference is computationally intractable for neural networks
- KL Divergence vs α-Renyi Divergence: Different ways to measure the difference between distributions; α-Renyi can be more robust to model misspecification
- Sensitivity Analysis: Quantifies how input variations affect output variability; needed to understand hyperparameter importance beyond simple grid searches
- Latin Hypercube Sampling: Stratified sampling method that ensures full coverage of the hyperparameter space; needed for efficient global sensitivity analysis
- Treed Gaussian Process Surrogate: Non-parametric regression model that handles discontinuities and can estimate sensitivity indices; needed because direct computation of Sobol indices is intractable for expensive models
- Interval Score: Proper scoring rule that combines coverage and interval width; needed because calibration requires both accuracy and uncertainty quantification

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
- Synthetic Data Generator -> BNN Training Loop -> Prediction Engine -> Performance Metrics (RMSE, IS)
- Hyperparameter Sampler -> Training Configuration -> Sensitivity Index Calculator

### Critical Path
Data generation → hyperparameter sampling → BNN training → performance evaluation → sensitivity analysis

### Design Tradeoffs
- KL multiplier γ: Small values reduce prior influence but may lead to overfitting; large values increase regularization but may underfit
- Optimizer steps: More steps can improve convergence but increase computational cost and risk of overfitting for α-Renyi
- α parameter: α ≈ 1 minimizes RMSE while α ≈ 0 minimizes interval score, creating a fundamental trade-off

### Failure Signatures
- High RMSE and IS: Learning rate too large (>0.1)
- Poor uncertainty calibration: KL multiplier too large or prior variance too small
- Overfitting: Too many optimizer steps with α-Renyi divergence

### First Experiments
1. Train with learning rate = 0.01 and KL multiplier = 0.1 to establish baseline performance
2. Vary only learning rate (0.001, 0.01, 0.1) to confirm its dominant effect
3. Compare KL divergence vs α-Renyi divergence with α = 0.5 and same learning rate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How do specific pairwise hyperparameter interactions (e.g., KL multiplier γ and prior variance σ²₀) drive performance? The study identified that interactions are important but didn't quantify specific second-order indices.
2. Do the optimal settings for the KL multiplier γ generalize to complex, high-dimensional data generating mechanisms? The current study was limited to simple polynomial functions.
3. How should the α parameter be selected in α-Renyi divergence when predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification objectives conflict? The authors found α ≈ 1 minimizes RMSE while α ≈ 0 minimizes interval score.

## Limitations
- Based on two synthetic datasets with simple polynomial structures that may not generalize to real-world applications
- Limited to regression tasks; classification performance remains unexplored
- Fixed 2-layer architecture; findings may not extend to deeper networks or different activation functions

## Confidence
- High: Learning rate's dominant individual effect on performance
- High: KL divergence performance improves with smaller KL multipliers and more optimizer steps
- Medium: Differential sensitivity between KL and α-Renyi divergence methods
- Low: Generalization to complex, high-dimensional real-world datasets

## Next Checks
1. Apply the same sensitivity analysis to real-world regression datasets (e.g., UCI repository) to assess whether learning rate remains the dominant hyperparameter across data types
2. Test whether the hyperparameter importance hierarchy holds for deeper networks (3+ layers) and different activation functions
3. Measure actual training time for each hyperparameter configuration to evaluate the practical trade-off between optimizer steps, learning rate, and final performance across both divergence methods
