# ScaleLong: A Multi-Timescale Benchmark for Long Video Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.23922
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23922
- Reference count: 27
- Multi-timescale benchmark for long video understanding with within-content design

## Executive Summary
ScaleLong introduces a novel benchmark for long video understanding that embeds questions targeting four hierarchical temporal scales - clip, shot, event, and story - within the same video content. This within-content design enables direct comparison of model performance across timescales on identical videos, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that scatter scale-specific questions across different videos. The benchmark includes 269 long videos (average 86 minutes) from 5 main categories and 36 sub-categories, with 4-8 carefully designed questions per video, ensuring at least one question for each timescale.

## Method Summary
ScaleLong constructs a multi-timescale benchmark by first collecting 269 long videos (avg. 86 min) from 5 main categories and 36 sub-categories. For each video, the authors design 4-8 questions targeting four hierarchical temporal scales - clip (seconds), shot (tens of seconds), event (minutes), and story (hours) - all within the same video content. This within-content design enables direct comparison of model performance across timescales on identical videos. The benchmark is then used to evaluate 23 multimodal large language models (MLLMs), revealing a U-shaped performance curve with higher accuracy at the shortest (clip) and longest (story) timescales and a dip at intermediate levels.

## Key Results
- ScaleLong includes 269 long videos (avg. 86 min) with 4-8 questions per video targeting four hierarchical temporal scales
- Evaluations of 23 MLLMs reveal a U-shaped performance curve across timescales, with higher accuracy at clip and story levels
- Increased visual token capacity consistently enhances reasoning across all timescales

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The within-content design of ScaleLong enables direct comparison of model performance across timescales on identical videos, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that scatter scale-specific questions across different videos. This design allows for a more nuanced understanding of how MLLMs perform at different temporal scales and reveals the U-shaped performance curve that might be obscured in benchmarks with scattered questions. Assumption: The U-shaped curve indicates distinct cognitive demands at different timescales rather than artifacts of the evaluation methodology.

## Foundational Learning
- **Long video understanding**: The ability to comprehend and reason about content spanning hours requires tracking information across extended temporal scales. This is needed to evaluate MLLMs on realistic long-form video tasks. Quick check: Can models maintain coherent understanding across 86-minute videos?
- **Multi-timescale reasoning**: Different cognitive processes may be required for understanding content at seconds vs. hours timescales. This is needed to probe how MLLMs handle different temporal granularities. Quick check: Do performance differences across timescales reveal distinct cognitive demands?
- **Within-content benchmark design**: Embedding questions targeting different timescales within the same video content enables direct comparison across scales. This is needed to isolate timescale effects from content variability. Quick check: Does performance vary across timescales even when content is held constant?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Video Collection -> Question Design (4 timescales) -> Benchmark Construction -> MLLM Evaluation -> Performance Analysis
**Critical Path**: Video collection and annotation -> Question design targeting four timescales -> Benchmark assembly -> Model evaluation -> U-shaped performance curve analysis
**Design Tradeoffs**: Within-content design enables direct timescale comparison but limits the total number of videos/questions; multiple categories provide diversity but increase annotation complexity
**Failure Signatures**: Performance inconsistencies across timescales on identical videos may indicate temporal reasoning limitations; uniform performance across timescales might suggest models aren't leveraging temporal structure
**First Experiments**: 1) Verify U-shaped curve holds across different video categories, 2) Test whether increased visual tokens improve performance at all timescales, 3) Compare performance on ScaleLong versus traditional multi-video benchmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided

## Limitations
- Relatively small number of videos (269) and questions (1-8 per video) may limit generalizability
- Benchmark's applicability to real-world long-video understanding tasks remains to be validated
- Interpretation of U-shaped curve as evidence of distinct cognitive demands is speculative

## Confidence
- High confidence in benchmark design and construction
- Medium confidence in core findings about U-shaped performance curve
- Low confidence in broader implications for MLLM capabilities and underlying mechanisms

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the U-shaped performance curve on a larger, more diverse set of long videos to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies with a wider range of visual token capacities to confirm consistent enhancement across timescales
3. Evaluate the benchmark's applicability to real-world long-video understanding tasks by comparing MLLM performance on ScaleLong to their performance on human-annotated long videos from diverse domains
