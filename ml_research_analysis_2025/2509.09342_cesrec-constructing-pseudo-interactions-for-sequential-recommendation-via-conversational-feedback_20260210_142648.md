# CESRec: Constructing Pseudo Interactions for Sequential Recommendation via Conversational Feedback

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.09342
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09342
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Primary result:** CESRec achieves up to 0.6246 HR@10 and 0.4931 NDCG@10 on benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models.

## Executive Summary
CESRec introduces a novel framework that integrates sequential and conversational recommendation by dynamically refining user interaction sequences using natural language feedback. The system employs a fine-tuned LLM (Constructor) to generate pseudo-interaction sequences that combine long-term and real-time preferences, while a dual alignment outlier items masking mechanism identifies and masks items deviating from core preferences. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements across multiple datasets and baselines, with significant gains in both hit rate and normalized discounted cumulative gain metrics.

## Method Summary
CESRec enhances sequential recommendation by integrating conversational feedback through a multi-stage pipeline. First, a base sequential recommender (e.g., SASRec) is trained to obtain collaborative embeddings. Then, an Adapter (2-layer MLP) aligns LLM-extracted semantic embeddings with the collaborative space using MSE loss. The dual alignment outlier masking identifies items that deviate from user core preferences by computing cosine similarity between mean-pooled user embeddings and individual item embeddings, masking the top-k lowest-similarity items. Finally, the Constructor (fine-tuned LLM with LoRA) generates pseudo-sequences by replacing masked items based on user feedback, which are then fed to the base SRS model for recommendations.

## Key Results
- CESRec achieves HR@10 up to 0.6246 and NDCG@10 up to 0.4931 on benchmark datasets
- Outperforms state-of-the-art sequential models by 4.8-10.7% on HR@10 and 4.7-9.2% on NDCG@10
- Consistent gains across three datasets (MovieLens, Amazon Video Games, Amazon Toys) and multiple baselines
- Iterative feedback refinement shows monotonic improvement across 1-3 iterations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic-Based Pseudo Interaction Construction
Natural language feedback enables dynamic refinement of historical interaction sequences to reflect real-time preferences. A fine-tuned LLM receives the historical sequence and user feedback, then replaces items that conflict with stated preferences. The resulting pseudo-interaction sequence serves as input to the base SRS model.

### Mechanism 2: Dual Alignment Outlier Items Masking
Aligning semantic embeddings with collaborative signals enables precise identification of items that deviate from user core preferences. The system extracts LLM semantic embeddings, projects them via a trainable Adapter to the RecSys embedding space, computes user representation via mean-pooling, then masks the k items with lowest cosine similarity to the user representation.

### Mechanism 3: Iterative Feedback Refinement
Multiple rounds of user feedback progressively improve recommendation alignment. Each feedback iteration triggers pseudo-sequence reconstruction, which is fed back to SRS for refined predictions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Semantic vs. Collaborative Embeddings**
  - **Why needed here:** CESRec explicitly fuses these two representation types; misunderstanding their properties prevents debugging alignment failures.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a pure semantic embedding might rank "The Conjuring" and "Hereditary" as similar, while collaborative signals might not?

- **Concept: Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction Loss**
  - **Why needed here:** The Constructor is trained via autoregressive sequence prediction; understanding token-level loss is essential for debugging generation quality.
  - **Quick check question:** What would happen to pseudo-sequence quality if the loss only optimized for the final token rather than the full sequence?

- **Concept: k-Selection for Outlier Masking**
  - **Why needed here:** Masking too few items leaves noise; too many remove signal. Section 6.6 shows dataset-specific optima.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a dataset with 0.01% density (Toys), would you expect optimal k to be higher or lower than for a 4.26% density dataset (MovieLens)? Why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** LLM Extractor -> Adapter -> Outlier Masker -> Constructor -> Base SRS
- **Critical path:** Feedback → Constructor → Pseudo-sequence → SRS → Recommendation
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - LLM backbone size: LLaMA3-8B outperforms LLaMA2-7B but adds ~3s inference latency
  - Masking aggressiveness: k=1 optimal for MovieLens/VideoGames; higher k benefits sparse datasets (Toys)
  - Alignment training: Requires paired (semantic, collaborative) embeddings; insufficient alignment data degrades masking precision
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low HR improvement: Check Adapter alignment loss; if >0.1, retrain with more item pairs
  - Pseudo-sequences contain irrelevant items: Inspect Constructor training data for feedback-item alignment quality
  - Performance degrades with more iterations: Likely user feedback drift or over-masking; cap iterations at 2-3
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce SASRec+CESRec baseline on Video Games: Verify HR@10 improvement from 0.717 → 0.745
  2. Ablate dual alignment: Compare CESRec vs. CESRec w/o d.a. to isolate alignment contribution
  3. Vary k on Toys dataset: Replicate Figure 5 pattern to understand sparsity-masking relationship

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the framework be adapted to maintain robustness when user feedback is vague, ambiguous, or unclear? The current method lacks a mechanism to detect or request clarification for low-confidence or noisy natural language inputs.

### Open Question 2
To what extent does the reliance on an LLM-based user simulator (GPT-4o-mini) skew the evaluation of the Constructor's ability to handle human feedback? The alignment between GPT-generated feedback and the capabilities of the CESRec Constructor may inflate performance metrics compared to real human interactions.

### Open Question 3
Can the system be optimized to reduce the 7–10 second inference latency to meet the strict real-time requirements of conversational interfaces? The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy but does not propose methods to mitigate the computational overhead of the "Pseudo Sequence Construction" component.

### Open Question 4
Does the "dual alignment outlier items masking" strategy inadvertently remove valid preferences for users with highly eclectic or diverse tastes? The evaluation focuses on overall metrics but does not analyze performance specifically on users with high interaction entropy or diverse interaction histories.

## Limitations
- The Adapter's MLP architecture details (particularly bottleneck width) are underspecified, making faithful reproduction challenging
- Constructor fine-tuning depends on simulated user feedback with incompletely defined prompt templates
- Dataset-specific masking parameters show significant variation, suggesting limited generalization without careful hyperparameter tuning
- System shows performance degradation when user feedback is vague, ambiguous, or unclear

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** CESRec's overall architecture design (semantic-based pseudo interaction construction + dual alignment outlier masking) is sound and well-documented
- **Medium confidence:** The reported performance improvements are likely reproducible given proper implementation of base components
- **Low confidence:** The specific implementation details required for full reproduction (Adapter architecture, LoRA hyperparameters, feedback prompt templates) are insufficient for guaranteed replication

## Next Checks
1. **Adapter alignment validation:** Monitor the MSE alignment loss during training; if it remains above 0.1 after 50 epochs, simplify the MLP projection head or reduce the learning rate
2. **Constructor hallucination detection:** Implement strict item validation during pseudo-sequence generation; log and analyze any generated items that don't match the candidate set
3. **Dataset-specific masking optimization:** Systematically vary k from 1-5 on each dataset to empirically determine optimal masking counts, particularly for the sparse Toys dataset
