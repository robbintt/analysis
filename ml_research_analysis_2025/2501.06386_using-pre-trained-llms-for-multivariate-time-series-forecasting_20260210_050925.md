# Using Pre-trained LLMs for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.06386
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06386
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Pre-trained LLMs with fine-tuning achieve competitive performance on retail demand forecasting

## Executive Summary
This paper explores using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for multivariate time series forecasting. The authors propose embedding multivariate time series data into the LLM token space using linear or MLP maps, and fine-tuning the LLM layer norms while keeping other weights frozen. They introduce multivariate patching to aggregate information across time series and static features before embedding. Experiments on retail demand forecasting show that fine-tuned LLMs, particularly Flan-T5 and MPT-7B, achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art models like MQCNN. The authors also use heavy-tailed self-regularization (HTSR) theory to validate their approach, showing that the spectral properties of weight matrices correlate with forecasting accuracy.

## Method Summary
The proposed method involves embedding multivariate time series data into LLM token space through either linear or MLP mapping functions. The approach uses multivariate patching to aggregate information across multiple time series before embedding, then fine-tunes only the layer normalization parameters of pre-trained LLMs while keeping other weights frozen. This transfer learning strategy leverages the pre-trained language models' general pattern recognition capabilities for time series forecasting tasks. The method is evaluated on retail demand forecasting datasets, comparing performance against traditional time series models like MQCNN.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned pre-trained LLMs (Flan-T5, MPT-7B) achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art models like MQCNN on retail demand forecasting
- The multivariate patching approach effectively aggregates information across time series and static features
- HTSR analysis shows correlation between spectral properties of weight matrices and forecasting accuracy
- Linear and MLP embedding maps both work effectively for converting time series to LLM token space

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages pre-trained LLMs' ability to capture complex patterns in sequential data. By mapping time series into the LLM token space, the model can utilize the transformer architecture's attention mechanisms to identify relationships across multiple time series and temporal patterns. Fine-tuning only the layer norms allows adaptation to the specific forecasting task while maintaining the general knowledge captured during pre-training. The multivariate patching strategy helps the model aggregate relevant information across different time series dimensions before processing.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Heavy-tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) Theory**
   - Why needed: Provides theoretical framework to analyze weight matrix properties and their relationship to model performance
   - Quick check: Verify spectral properties of weight matrices correlate with forecasting accuracy

2. **Multivariate Time Series Embedding**
   - Why needed: Transforms time series data into a format compatible with LLM token processing
   - Quick check: Compare linear vs MLP embedding performance on the same datasets

3. **Layer Norm Fine-tuning**
   - Why needed: Enables task adaptation while preserving pre-trained knowledge
   - Quick check: Measure performance difference between full fine-tuning vs layer norm only

4. **Multivariate Patching**
   - Why needed: Aggregates information across multiple time series before embedding
   - Quick check: Test performance with and without patching on same datasets

5. **Transfer Learning from LLMs**
   - Why needed: Leverages pre-trained pattern recognition capabilities for time series
   - Quick check: Compare against models trained from scratch on same data

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Time Series -> Embedding Map (Linear/MLP) -> Multivariate Patching -> LLM Token Space -> Fine-tuned Layer Norms -> Forecast

**Critical Path**: The embedding and patching components are critical for converting time series data into LLM-compatible format, while fine-tuning layer norms enables task-specific adaptation without losing pre-trained knowledge.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Frozen LLM weights limit adaptation but preserve general pattern recognition capabilities; multivariate patching adds preprocessing overhead but improves information aggregation; linear vs MLP embeddings offer simplicity vs flexibility tradeoff.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate ineffective embedding mappings, inadequate patching aggregation, or insufficient fine-tuning of layer norms for the specific task.

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare linear vs MLP embedding performance; 2) Test with different levels of layer norm fine-tuning; 3) Evaluate impact of multivariate patching on forecasting accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Narrow experimental scope focused primarily on retail demand forecasting datasets
- Architectural complexity may limit practical deployment and computational efficiency
- HTSR-based validation shows correlation but lacks rigorous theoretical grounding

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core experimental methodology and reported results for tested retail datasets
- **Medium Confidence**: Generalizability across different time series domains and HTSR theoretical implications
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about fundamental advantages over specialized architectures without broader validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the approach on diverse time series datasets from multiple domains (financial, medical, industrial sensor data)
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing different embedding strategies and multivariate patching approaches
3. Benchmark computational efficiency and memory requirements against traditional time series models and other LLM adaptation methods
