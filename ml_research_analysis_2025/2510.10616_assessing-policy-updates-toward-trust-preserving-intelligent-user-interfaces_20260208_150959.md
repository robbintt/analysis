# Assessing Policy Updates: Toward Trust-Preserving Intelligent User Interfaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.10616
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10616
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Salient-contrast demonstrations significantly improve users' ability to assess policy updates in interactive RL settings

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in interactive reinforcement learning: helping users effectively assess whether their corrective feedback has meaningfully improved an agent's policy. Through a controlled user study with 280 participants, the authors compared four strategies for communicating policy updates in a gridworld environment. The key innovation is "salient-contrast" demonstrations that deliberately highlight informative differences between old and new policies, making policy changes perceptually salient to users. Results demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving 83.2% correct assessment rates versus 71.1% for same-context and 66.3% for random-context demonstrations, while also improving trust calibration and reducing bias toward assuming feedback always helps.

## Method Summary
The study employed a controlled user experiment where participants interacted with a MiniGrid-based gridworld environment featuring collectible balls (Blue=+4, Green=+2, Red=-2), lava tiles (-3), and a goal tile. Participants provided corrective feedback across five rounds, then evaluated policy updates using one of four demonstration strategies: no demonstration, same-context (same board as feedback), random-context (random board from pool), or salient-contrast (board maximizing score difference between policies). The system selected policies from a bank of k=6 pre-trained PPO policies that best matched cumulative corrections. Assessment involved choosing between old and new policies across 18 evaluation boards, measuring both local (on feedback board) and generalized correctness. Final outcomes included delegation decisions, capability ratings, and explanation satisfaction.

## Key Results
- Salient-contrast demonstrations achieved 83.2% correct choice rates versus 71.1% for same-context and 66.3% for random-context conditions
- Participants using salient-contrast were significantly less biased toward assuming feedback always helps
- Salient-contrast improved trust calibration, with participants more accurately assessing when updates harmed performance
- Same-context demonstrations excelled at local assessment (on feedback board) while salient-contrast excelled at generalization across novel contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The salient-contrast mechanism works by deliberately selecting demonstration contexts that maximize the perceptual difference between old and new policies, making policy changes obvious to users. Unlike random or same-context demonstrations that may show similar behaviors, salient-contrast boards are chosen to highlight where policies diverge in behavior, directly addressing the challenge of users' inability to detect subtle but meaningful policy changes. This comparative approach leverages human perceptual strengths in detecting differences rather than requiring users to track absolute performance changes.

## Foundational Learning
**MiniGrid Environment**: A grid-based RL environment with discrete states and actions, used for controlled experimental studies. Why needed: Provides reproducible, controllable testbed for studying human-agent interaction. Quick check: Verify ball types, lava tiles, and action space match specifications.

**PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: An on-policy RL algorithm that alternates between collecting data and optimizing policy with clipped objective to prevent destructive updates. Why needed: Trains diverse policies with different preference weightings for the policy bank. Quick check: Ensure policies exhibit sufficiently distinct behaviors for comparison.

**Policy Bank Selection**: Maintains multiple pre-trained policies and selects the one best matching user corrections from a neighborhood. Why needed: Enables responsive policy updates without retraining from scratch. Quick check: Verify selection mechanism finds policies with improved agreement after each feedback round.

**Value Function Estimation**: Estimates expected return V^π(s) for policy evaluation in demonstration selection. Why needed: Quantifies policy performance differences to identify salient-contrast boards. Quick check: Compute score differences on candidate boards to verify selection maximizes contrast.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Interface -> Feedback Collection -> Policy Selection -> Demonstration Selection -> User Assessment

**Critical Path**: Feedback Collection -> Policy Selection -> Demonstration Selection -> User Assessment (delegation decision)

**Design Tradeoffs**: Controlled MiniGrid environment provides experimental rigor but limits ecological validity; pre-trained policy bank enables quick responses but constrains policy space; salient-contrast selection maximizes perceptual differences but may not capture all relevant policy changes.

**Failure Signatures**: Random/same-context conditions show similar performance to salient-contrast; participants cannot detect negative updates even with salient-contrast; explanation satisfaction remains low despite improved correctness.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test salient-contrast board selection by computing V^H(π_t) - V^H(π_{t+1}) across all candidate boards, 2) Verify perceptible behavioral changes by computing action distribution differences between consecutive policies, 3) Analyze participant decision patterns across evaluation boards to confirm local vs. generalized performance differences.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: Can hybrid demonstration strategies that combine same-context and salient-contrast approaches outperform either method alone for both local and generalized policy assessment? The study tested each strategy independently, revealing complementary strengths, but did not explore combinations that might leverage both local transparency and global evidence.

**Open Question 2**: How do salient-contrast demonstrations perform in high-stakes, real-world domains such as robotics or clinical decision support? The controlled MiniGrid environment lacks the richness of real-world domains with continuous state spaces, partial observability, and higher cognitive load.

**Open Question 3**: Can adaptive demonstration-selection algorithms that respond to user performance or highlight likely-misunderstood differences improve assessment accuracy? Current salient-contrast selection uses fixed heuristics without personalizing to individual user knowledge gaps or misconceptions.

## Limitations
- Study relies on controlled MiniGrid environment that may not generalize to real-world RL applications
- Pre-trained policy bank approach constrains policy space and depends on behavioral diversity of initial policies
- Feedback mechanism assumes participants can accurately perceive and articulate desired behavioral changes
- Exact preference weightings for k=6 pre-trained policies and PPO hyperparameters remain unspecified

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Experimental methodology with appropriate controls, sample size, and validated metrics; straightforward statistical comparisons between conditions.

**Medium confidence**: MiniGrid implementation and PPO training procedure can be reproduced with reasonable hyperparameter choices; core finding about salient-contrast superiority should be robust.

**Low confidence**: Exact numerical results depend on specific pre-trained policies and their behavioral diversity, which cannot be verified without complete training details.

## Next Checks
1. Verify salient-contrast demonstration boards achieve significantly higher score differences (V^H(π_t) - V^H(π_{t+1})) than random or same-context boards across all update rounds.
2. Test whether policy selection mechanism produces perceptible behavioral changes by computing action distribution differences between consecutive policies.
3. Validate participants can reliably distinguish between positive and negative updates in salient-contrast condition by analyzing decision patterns across 18 evaluation boards.
