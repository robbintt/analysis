# AgentChangeBench: A Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework for Goal-Shift Robustness in Conversational AI
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18170
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18170
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First multi-dimensional benchmark for measuring conversational AI agent adaptation to mid-dialogue goal shifts across 315 tasks and 5 personas

## Executive Summary
AgentChangeBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures how conversational AI agents adapt when user goals shift mid-dialogue. The benchmark spans banking, retail, and airline domains with five distinct user personas, evaluating agents through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate, Tool Use Efficiency, Tool Call Redundancy Rate, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time. Experimental results reveal significant performance variations across frontier models that are obscured by traditional evaluation metrics, demonstrating that high raw accuracy does not guarantee robustness under dynamic goals.

## Method Summary
AgentChangeBench constructs a systematic testbed for evaluating conversational AI agents' resilience to goal shifts during interactions. The framework generates 315 tasks across three domains (banking, retail, airline) with five user personas exhibiting different shift patterns. Agents are evaluated through four metrics: Task Success Rate measures completion accuracy, Tool Use Efficiency tracks optimal tool selection, Tool Call Redundancy Rate quantifies unnecessary repetitions, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time measures adaptation speed. The benchmark employs a controlled task generation process that introduces goal shifts at predetermined conversation points, enabling reproducible measurement of agent adaptation behaviors.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o achieves 92.2% recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini drops to 48.6%
- Retail tasks show near-perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates exceeding 80%
- High raw accuracy does not guarantee robustness under dynamic goals

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its multi-dimensional approach that captures different aspects of goal-shift adaptation. By evaluating both outcome metrics (task completion) and process metrics (tool efficiency, redundancy, recovery time), the benchmark reveals nuanced performance differences that single-score evaluations miss. The controlled task generation ensures consistent goal-shift scenarios across models, while the persona-based approach captures realistic variations in how users communicate changes. This comprehensive measurement framework exposes the gap between models that can complete static tasks versus those that can dynamically adapt to changing objectives.

## Foundational Learning
- **Goal-shift dynamics**: Understanding how and when user objectives change during conversations is essential for building robust conversational agents. Quick check: Can your agent identify when a user's intent has fundamentally changed?
- **Tool selection efficiency**: Optimal tool usage under time constraints distinguishes capable agents from brittle ones. Quick check: Does your agent choose the most appropriate tool for each sub-task?
- **Redundancy detection**: Excessive tool calls indicate poor context retention and adaptation. Quick check: How often does your agent repeat the same actions unnecessarily?
- **Recovery time measurement**: The speed of adapting to new goals is as important as eventual success. Quick check: How quickly can your agent pivot when user goals shift?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Task Generator -> Agent Interface -> Tool Execution -> Metric Collector -> Evaluation Dashboard

Critical path: Task Generation → Goal-Shift Introduction → Agent Response → Tool Execution → Metric Calculation → Performance Analysis

Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes controlled reproducibility over ecological validity, sacrificing some real-world complexity for systematic measurement. This enables precise benchmarking but may miss emergent behaviors in unconstrained environments.

Failure signatures: High redundancy rates indicate poor context retention, while slow recovery times suggest inadequate goal recognition. Low tool efficiency reveals suboptimal action selection strategies.

First experiments:
1. Baseline evaluation with static tasks (no goal shifts) to establish upper performance bounds
2. Single-domain evaluation with one persona type to isolate domain-specific adaptation challenges
3. Cross-model comparison using identical task sequences to quantify relative robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability uncertain beyond banking, retail, and airline domains
- Synthetic user personas may not capture real-world behavioral complexity
- Controlled task generation may miss emergent goal-shift patterns from natural interactions

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Four-metric evaluation framework is methodologically sound and well-documented
- Medium Confidence: Cross-model performance rankings reflect current capabilities but may shift with model evolution
- Low Confidence: Synthetic personas and controlled tasks may not capture production environment behaviors

## Next Checks
1. Deploy AgentChangeBench with real user interaction data from enterprise conversational AI deployments to validate synthetic persona representativeness
2. Extend evaluation to long-context models and systems with explicit memory mechanisms to assess architectural impact on goal-shift recovery metrics
3. Conduct ablation studies systematically removing individual metrics to quantify their marginal contribution to overall robustness assessment
