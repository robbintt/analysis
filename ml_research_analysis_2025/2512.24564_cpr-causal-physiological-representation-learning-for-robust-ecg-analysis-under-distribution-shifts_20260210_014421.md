# CPR: Causal Physiological Representation Learning for Robust ECG Analysis under Distribution Shifts
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24564
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24564
- Authors: Shunbo Jia; Caizhi Liao
- Reference count: 5
- Key outcome: CPR achieves F1 score of 0.632 under SAP attacks, outperforming Median Smoothing by 9.1% while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fragility of deep learning models for ECG diagnosis against Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) by proposing Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). The method uses a dual-pathway autoencoder guided by a physiological mask to disentangle invariant pathological features from non-causal artifacts. By enforcing orthogonality between content and style latent spaces and ensuring semantic consistency, CPR achieves robust ECG analysis while maintaining clinical interpretability. The approach demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in controlled adversarial settings.

## Method Summary
CPR employs a dual-pathway autoencoder architecture that learns causal physiological representations for ECG analysis. The key innovation is the use of a physiological mask that separates pathological features (content) from non-causal artifacts (style) during the encoding process. The model enforces orthogonality constraints between the content and style latent spaces to ensure clean disentanglement. A semantic consistency mechanism maintains the relationship between disentangled features and their physiological meaning. The training process involves minimizing reconstruction loss while maximizing the separation between pathological and artifactual components, enabling robust inference even under adversarial perturbations.

## Key Results
- CPR achieves F1 score of 0.632 under SAP attacks, outperforming Median Smoothing (0.541) by 9.1%
- Matches certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency
- Demonstrates effective disentanglement of pathological features from acquisition artifacts in PTB-XL dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of CPR stems from its causal disentanglement approach, which separates invariant pathological features from non-causal artifacts using physiological knowledge. By enforcing orthogonality between content and style latent spaces, the model prevents interference between diagnostic-relevant and artifactual information. The physiological mask ensures that the disentanglement process aligns with established medical understanding of cardiac physiology. This causal separation makes the pathological features more robust to perturbations that primarily affect the artifactual components, while maintaining the semantic consistency needed for accurate diagnosis.

## Foundational Learning
- Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP): Small, smooth modifications to input signals that can fool deep learning models - needed to understand the threat model; check by verifying perturbation magnitude is below clinical significance thresholds
- Physiological Masking: Using domain knowledge to separate clinically relevant features from artifacts - needed to ensure interpretability and clinical relevance; check by validating mask alignment with cardiologist input
- Latent Space Orthogonality: Mathematical constraint ensuring disentangled feature spaces don't interfere - needed for clean separation of pathological vs. artifactual features; check by measuring correlation between content and style embeddings
- Semantic Consistency: Maintaining meaningful relationships between learned features and physiological concepts - needed for clinical interpretability; check by conducting expert review of feature meanings
- Dual-Pathway Autoencoder: Separate encoding paths for different feature types - needed to enable specialized processing of pathological vs. artifactual information; check by comparing reconstruction quality of each pathway

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: ECG Signal -> Physiological Mask -> Content Encoder + Style Encoder -> Orthogonalization Layer -> Content Decoder + Style Decoder -> Reconstructed ECG

Critical path: The disentanglement process where the physiological mask guides separation of content (pathological) and style (artifactual) features, followed by orthogonalization to prevent interference.

Design tradeoffs: Single-pass inference efficiency vs. potential loss of subtle pathological patterns captured in style features; clinical interpretability vs. possible reduction in diagnostic sensitivity for complex cases.

Failure signatures: Poor reconstruction quality indicating inadequate disentanglement; high correlation between content and style embeddings suggesting failed orthogonality; degraded performance on non-adversarial data suggesting over-regularization.

First experiments: 1) Ablation study removing physiological mask to quantify its contribution to robustness; 2) Cross-dataset evaluation on non-PTB-XL ECG data to test generalizability; 3) Expert review of disentangled features for clinical validity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Clinical significance of 9.1% F1 improvement under adversarial conditions remains uncertain for real-world practice
- Generalizability of physiological mask across different ECG datasets and diagnostic tasks is unproven
- Performance against naturally occurring physiological variations and artifacts not established beyond controlled adversarial settings

## Confidence
- Causal disentanglement effectiveness: Medium
- Robustness claims: Medium  
- Clinical interpretability: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Cross-dataset validation: Evaluate CPR performance on multiple independent ECG datasets (CPSC, PTB Diagnostic, or clinical data from different institutions) to assess generalizability of the physiological mask and robustness across different acquisition protocols and patient populations.

2. Clinical expert validation: Conduct a study where cardiologists review and validate the interpretability of the disentangled pathological features, assessing whether the learned representations align with established clinical understanding of cardiac physiology and pathology.

3. Real-world deployment testing: Implement CPR in a clinical environment with naturally occurring artifacts, varying patient conditions, and different ECG acquisition equipment to evaluate performance under realistic conditions beyond controlled adversarial perturbations.
