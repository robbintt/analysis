# SHADE-AD: An LLM-Based Framework for Synthesizing Activity Data of Alzheimer's Patients

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.01768
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01768
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Synthesizes AD-specific skeleton videos to improve HAR accuracy by up to 79.69%

## Executive Summary
SHADE-AD addresses the critical shortage of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-specific activity datasets by proposing a Large Language Model (LLM) framework that generates synthetic skeleton-based videos of human activities with AD-specific characteristics. The framework employs a three-stage training mechanism that combines pre-training on general human actions, domain adaptation to AD behaviors, and motion metric fine-tuning to ensure clinical realism. Evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) detection accuracy and strong alignment between real and synthetic motion metrics.

## Method Summary
SHADE-AD is a three-stage training framework that synthesizes skeleton-based videos of AD-specific human activities. It begins with pre-training on general actions from NTU RGB+D 120 using contrastive learning to align text and video encoders. The model then undergoes domain adaptation using adversarial fine-tuning on private AD patient data to capture disease-specific movement patterns. Finally, a diffusion model with motion metric loss fine-tunes the generation process using patient-specific joint motion data from 12 key joints. The resulting synthetic videos can be adapted to different sensor modalities and show strong alignment with real AD patient kinematics.

## Key Results
- SHADE-AD improves Human Activity Recognition detection accuracy by up to 79.69% compared to existing methods
- Motion metric analysis demonstrates strong alignment between real and synthetic data (speed, angles, range of motion)
- The framework successfully captures AD-specific movement characteristics including slower speed and reduced range of motion

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SHADE-AD works by leveraging LLM capabilities to bridge the gap between general human action data and AD-specific movement patterns. The three-stage training approach first establishes a foundation of general human motion understanding, then adapts this knowledge to the AD domain through adversarial learning, and finally refines the output using motion metrics that capture the biomechanical characteristics of AD patients. This progressive refinement ensures that generated movements are both semantically coherent and clinically realistic.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning (Why needed):** Aligns text and video representations to enable text-to-video generation with semantic consistency
- **Adversarial Domain Adaptation (Why needed):** Transfers knowledge from general human actions to AD-specific movements while preserving domain characteristics
- **Motion Metric Loss (Why needed):** Ensures generated movements match the biomechanical characteristics of real AD patients through quantitative constraints
- **Diffusion Models (Why needed):** Provides a probabilistic framework for generating high-quality, diverse skeleton sequences
- **Multi-Modal Encoding (Why needed):** Combines text embeddings with video features to enable controllable generation based on clinical parameters
- **Joint Kinematics Analysis (Why needed):** Quantifies movement patterns through speed, angles, and range of motion metrics for validation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** OpenCLIP encoders -> Diffusion model -> Domain discriminator -> Motion metric loss

**Critical Path:** Text input → OpenCLIP encoders → Latent space → Diffusion generation → Motion metric refinement → Skeleton output

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Private AD dataset vs. generalization capability
- Motion metric loss weight vs. generation diversity
- Domain adaptation strength vs. preservation of general action semantics

**Failure Signatures:**
- Smooth/Non-AD Output: Generated movements lack characteristic AD features like shuffling or oscillation
- Catastrophic Forgetting: Model loses general action semantics during domain adaptation
- Metric Overfitting: Motion metrics converge too quickly, reducing movement diversity

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test text-to-skeleton generation with simple action prompts (e.g., "walking") to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate domain adaptation by comparing generated movements before and after AD-specific fine-tuning
3. Measure motion metric alignment between real and synthetic data using speed, joint angles, and range of motion

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
**Question:** Does incorporating explicit biomechanical constraints into the generation process improve the fidelity of synthetic movements compared to the current data-driven approach?

**Basis in paper:** Section 5.4 states that "Incorporating biomechanical constraints and broader datasets may enhance movement fidelity and generalization."

**Why unresolved:** The current framework relies on learning motion patterns from data without explicit physics-based constraints, which may result in minor discrepancies in joint trajectory initiation.

**What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study evaluating the physical plausibility (e.g., joint torque validity) of videos generated with and without biomechanical loss terms.

### Open Question 2
**Question:** Can multi-joint coordination analysis provide a more robust validation of AD-specific behaviors than the current 12-key-joint metrics?

**Basis in paper:** Section 5.4 notes that "Beyond key-joint metrics, multi-joint coordination analysis can provide a more comprehensive assessment."

**Why unresolved:** The current validation focuses on individual joint speeds and angles, potentially missing complex, full-body coordination deficits characteristic of cognitive decline.

**What evidence would resolve it:** Development and application of a multi-joint coordination metric that shows stronger correlation between synthetic data and real AD patient data than current single-joint metrics.

### Open Question 3
**Question:** How can the framework be extended to ensure semantic consistency and clinical relevance when simulating realistic disease progression over time?

**Basis in paper:** The authors list "ensuring semantic consistency and clinical relevance in realistic disease progression" as a target for future refinements in Section 5.4.

**Why unresolved:** SHADE-AD currently generates activity based on specific input prompts but does not explicitly model the longitudinal evolution or temporal causality of symptom progression.

**What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstrating that models trained on synthetic longitudinal data can accurately predict the stage of AD or future motor decline in real patients.

## Limitations
- Reliance on a private AD Behavior Dataset containing 99 patients' depth videos prevents independent verification
- Lack of explicit architectural details for the diffusion model backbone and domain discriminator
- Motion metric loss formulation and integration details are only broadly outlined

## Confidence
- **HAR Accuracy Improvement:** Low - depends on proprietary dataset and limited architectural transparency
- **Motion Metric Alignment:** Medium - metrics are well-defined but data and implementation details are unclear
- **Clinical Realism:** Medium - framework design is sound but validation is limited to specific metrics

## Next Checks
1. Obtain or simulate AD-like gait features (e.g., reduced speed, stooping) to test whether the three-stage training pipeline can effectively generate realistic skeleton videos with these characteristics
2. Implement the motion metric loss function and verify that it successfully constrains generated videos to match real AD patient kinematics, using a proxy dataset if the private data is unavailable
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of domain adaptation and motion metric fine-tuning to HAR performance, ensuring that improvements are not solely due to increased training data volume
