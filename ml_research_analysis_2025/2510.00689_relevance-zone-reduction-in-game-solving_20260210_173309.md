## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an iterative method to reduce the size of Relevance-Zones (RZs) in game solving, enabling more efficient pruning and pattern reuse. The approach repeatedly solves the same position under progressively tighter constraints, guiding the solver toward solutions with smaller RZs. Three constraint generation strategies—random, erosion, and heatmap—are proposed, with heatmap showing the best performance. Experiments on 7×7 Killall-Go demonstrate that the method achieves 85.95% average RZ size reduction compared to baseline solving.

## Method Summary
The method iteratively reduces RZ size by repeatedly solving positions under constraints. Starting with a baseline solve, each iteration locks points outside the previous RZ and prohibits one inner point. Three constraint strategies are tested: random selection, erosion (prioritizing empty points with more external neighbors), and heatmap (selecting least-covered points from the solution tree). An RZ Pattern Table is modified to return all matching entries and filter by constraint compliance, selecting the smallest valid RZ. The process terminates after K=5 consecutive failures to find valid solutions.

## Key Results
- Achieves 85.95% average RZ size reduction on 7×7 Killall-Go
- Heatmap constraint strategy outperforms random and erosion approaches
- Modified RZ Pattern Table improves results across all constraint methods
- Reduced RZs can be stored and reused for future solving tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Iterative Constraint-Guided Re-solving
By repeatedly solving under region-based constraints, the algorithm guides the solver toward solutions with progressively smaller RZs. Each successful iteration produces a smaller RZ by preventing outward expansion and forcing shrinkage through point prohibitions.

### Mechanism 2: Heatmap-Based Constraint Point Selection
The heatmap strategy prioritizes low-coverage points for prohibition, minimizing disruption to the existing solution tree. By selecting points appearing in fewer RZs, the method is more likely to preserve alternative valid paths while achieving shrinkage.

### Mechanism 3: RZ Pattern Table (RZT) for Cross-Iteration Reuse
The modified RZT returns all matching patterns and filters them by constraint compliance, enabling efficient reuse of previously discovered solutions. This approach accelerates re-solving by bypassing redundant subtree exploration while respecting current constraints.

## Foundational Learning

- **Relevance-Zone (RZ)**: The minimal board region determining game-theoretic value. Needed because smaller RZs enable more pruning and pattern reuse. Quick check: Given a solved terminal position, can you identify which board points contributed to the outcome versus which were irrelevant?

- **AND-OR Game Trees**: Game tree structure where AND nodes (opponent's turn) merge child RZs via union, while OR nodes (current player's turn) can adopt any solved child's RZ. Needed because RZ propagation rules differ by node type. Quick check: In a two-player game where White (OR) wants to live and Black (AND) must kill all, how does RZ propagation differ at White's vs. Black's decision nodes?

- **Proof Cost Network (PCN)**: AlphaZero-style network trained to predict solution size, used for search heuristics. Needed because understanding PCN helps interpret why certain moves are favored. Quick check: How does PCN's training objective differ from standard AlphaZero value networks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Solver Worker -> Constraint Generator -> RZ Pattern Table (RZT) -> Iteration Controller
- **Critical path**: 1) Initialize: Solve position without constraints → baseline RZ 2) Iterate: Generate constraint → Re-solve → If success, update RZ; if failure, mark point as hopeless 3) Terminate: After K consecutive failures, output smallest RZ discovered
- **Design tradeoffs**: Simulation budget trade-off (higher for initialization vs. lower for iterations), constraint strategy effectiveness vs. computational cost, RZT filtering benefits vs. increased query time
- **Failure signatures**: No reduction achieved (RZ may be irreducible), high iteration count with minimal shrinkage (inherently large minimal RZ), constraint violation on all RZT matches (incompatible stored patterns)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline validation: Run solver without RZR on 100 positions; record average RZ size and solve time 2) Ablation on constraint strategies: Compare Random, Erosion, and Heatmap (each with/without RZT) on same 100 positions; measure reduction rate and iteration count 3) Early stopping sensitivity: Vary K from 1 to 10 on a subset; plot RZ size vs. computational cost to identify diminishing-returns threshold

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness relies on assumption that multiple valid solution trees exist with different RZ sizes, but this is not systematically characterized
- Results demonstrated only on 7×7 Killall-Go with specific opening positions; generalization to larger boards or different game types unverified
- Modified RZT could become computationally expensive for large pattern databases, but scaling analysis is absent

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core iterative framework and constraint enforcement mechanism are well-specified and reproducible. Baseline reduction results (85.95%) are clearly presented.
- **Medium Confidence**: Heatmap strategy's advantage is empirically supported but lacks theoretical justification. RZT filtering mechanism appears sound but depends on implementation details not fully specified.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about benefits for "larger board sizes or different openings" are speculative, with only 7×7 Killall-Go tested.

## Next Checks
1. **Irreducible Position Characterization**: Systematically test diverse game positions to identify structural features (e.g., miai pairs, ko threats) that make RZs irreducible, validating whether 85.95% reduction is a ceiling or can be improved.

2. **Cross-Game Generalization**: Apply iterative reduction to other combinatorial games (e.g., Hex, Amazons) or larger Go board sizes (9×9, 13×13) to verify claimed benefits beyond 7×7 Killall-Go, tracking whether heatmap advantage persists.

3. **RZT Scalability Analysis**: Measure computational overhead of modified RZT (returning all matches and filtering) as pattern database grows, determining the threshold where filtering becomes impractical compared to alternative indexing strategies.
