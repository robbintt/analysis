# From Satellite to Street: A Hybrid Framework Integrating Stable Diffusion and PanoGAN for Consistent Cross-View Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24369
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24369
- Reference count: 40
- Combines Stable Diffusion v2.1 with PanoGAN and conditional GANs for cross-view synthesis

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a hybrid framework that addresses the challenge of generating street-view panoramas from satellite imagery by combining the strengths of diffusion models and conditional GANs. The approach employs a dual-branch architecture where one branch uses ControlNet-enhanced Stable Diffusion with PanoGAN for format conversion, while the other applies PanoGAN directly to satellite images. The outputs from both branches are fused using a conditional GAN to produce geometrically consistent panoramic street-view images. Evaluated on the CVUSA dataset, the hybrid approach achieves 2.18% improvement in SSIM and 2.68% reduction in FID compared to pure GAN-based methods, and an 11.75% improvement in PSNR over diffusion-only methods.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a two-stage training strategy using a dual-branch architecture. The first branch leverages ControlNet-enhanced Stable Diffusion to generate street-view images, followed by PanoGAN for panoramic format conversion. The second branch applies PanoGAN directly to satellite images. Both branches are trained separately, then fused using a conditional GAN that learns to combine the complementary strengths of each approach. The model uses contrastive loss for cross-view consistency, GAN loss for image quality, and KL divergence for latent space regularization. The architecture is designed to preserve geometric consistency between satellite and street-view domains while generating realistic fine-grained details.

## Key Results
- Achieves 2.18% improvement in SSIM and 2.68% reduction in FID compared to pure GAN-based methods
- Shows 11.75% improvement in PSNR over diffusion-only approaches
- Successfully generates realistic street-view panoramas with preserved geometric consistency between domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach works by combining the spatial awareness and detail generation capabilities of diffusion models with the geometric consistency preservation of conditional GANs. Stable Diffusion provides strong semantic understanding and fine-grained detail generation, while the dual-branch architecture allows for complementary processing paths that capture different aspects of the translation task. The conditional GAN fusion layer effectively combines the strengths of both branches, learning to preserve geometric alignment while enhancing visual quality. This multi-stage approach addresses the fundamental challenge that neither pure diffusion nor pure GAN approaches can simultaneously achieve both geometric consistency and visual fidelity.

## Foundational Learning

**Cross-view Image Translation**: Converting between satellite and street-view imagery requires understanding the geometric relationships between orthogonal and perspective projections. Why needed: Different viewing angles and scales make direct translation challenging. Quick check: Verify that learned transformations preserve relative spatial relationships between features.

**Dual-Branch Architecture**: Using two parallel processing paths allows the model to capture complementary information from different perspectives. Why needed: Single-branch approaches often struggle to balance detail generation with geometric consistency. Quick check: Compare outputs from each branch independently to identify their respective strengths and weaknesses.

**ControlNet Integration**: ControlNet provides additional spatial conditioning for diffusion models, enabling better preservation of geometric relationships. Why needed: Standard diffusion models lack explicit mechanisms for maintaining cross-view geometric consistency. Quick check: Evaluate how well ControlNet-preserved features align with ground truth street-view geometry.

**Panoramic Format Conversion**: Converting standard street-view images to panoramic format requires specialized handling of perspective distortion. Why needed: Most available datasets provide standard perspective views, but panoramic views offer better spatial context. Quick check: Measure distortion levels in converted panoramas compared to ground truth.

**Conditional GAN Fusion**: The final fusion stage learns to optimally combine outputs from both branches while maintaining consistency. Why needed: Each branch has complementary strengths that need to be balanced for optimal results. Quick check: Analyze which features from each branch are preserved in the final output.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Satellite Image -> Branch 1 (ControlNet + Stable Diffusion v2.1) -> PanoGAN -> Branch 1 Output; Satellite Image -> Branch 2 (Direct PanoGAN) -> Branch 2 Output; Branch 1 Output + Branch 2 Output -> Conditional GAN -> Fused Output

**Critical Path**: Satellite Image -> ControlNet -> Stable Diffusion v2.1 -> PanoGAN -> Conditional GAN Fusion -> Final Street-View Panorama

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency for improved quality by using multiple sequential models rather than a single end-to-end architecture. This approach increases parameter count and inference time but allows for specialized processing at each stage. The dual-branch design adds complexity but captures complementary information that single-branch approaches miss.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include geometric misalignment between generated street-view and original satellite imagery, loss of fine-grained details in texture-rich areas, and inconsistent lighting or weather conditions between domains. The model may also struggle with complex urban layouts or areas with unusual architectural patterns not well-represented in training data.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test each branch independently on validation data to identify their respective strengths and failure modes
2. Evaluate the fusion mechanism by comparing conditional GAN outputs with simple averaging of branch outputs
3. Measure geometric consistency preservation by computing feature alignment metrics between satellite input and generated street-view output

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can next-generation diffusion architectures (e.g., FLUX) effectively replace the conditional GAN components in this hybrid framework to improve visual quality? The authors state plans to integrate advanced generative models like FLUX to replace conditional GAN components. This remains unresolved because newer architectures possess different inductive biases and latent spaces that may or may not fuse effectively with the existing ControlNet backbone. Evidence would require quantitative results from an ablation study replacing the PanoGAN branch with FLUX, showing improved FID scores without degrading PSNR or SSIM.

**Open Question 2**: Does the framework maintain geometric consistency and visual fidelity when synthesizing street views under adverse weather conditions or varying lighting? The conclusion explicitly lists future work to incorporate street-view images from various weather conditions, including rain, snow, and different lighting scenarios. This remains unresolved because current evaluation is restricted to the CVUSA dataset, which primarily contains clear daytime imagery; the model's robustness to domain shifts caused by atmospheric elements remains untested. Evidence would require evaluation on a new test set comprising paired satellite and street-view images captured during rain, snow, and night, reporting stable SSIM and FID metrics.

**Open Question 3**: How can Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) be refined to ensure that text prompts enforce strict geometric alignment rather than just semantic plausibility? While domain-specific models like RS-LLaVA improve detail, the resulting street-view images are "not entirely geometrically consistent" with the input satellite data. This remains unresolved because text descriptions inherently abstract away precise spatial coordinates; the current method relies on the diffusion model interpreting spatial relationships from text, which is prone to "hallucinating" layouts that look correct but violate the satellite geometry. Evidence would require a new conditioning mechanism that quantifiably binds LVLM-generated tokens to specific spatial features in the satellite image, resulting in higher pixel-level accuracy compared to the current captioning approach.

## Limitations
- Performance improvements are incremental rather than transformative (2.18% SSIM improvement)
- Evaluation restricted to CVUSA dataset limits generalizability to diverse geographic contexts
- Heavy computational requirements due to sequential processing of multiple complex models

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The hybrid framework architecture is technically sound and the reported quantitative improvements on CVUSA are verifiable

**Medium Confidence**: The claimed geometric consistency preservation requires additional validation beyond standard image quality metrics

**Medium Confidence**: The incremental nature of improvements suggests the approach may be more valuable for specific niche applications rather than broad deployment

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-dataset validation using non-CVUSA datasets (e.g., HRTI, S2S) to assess generalizability across different geographic regions and urban contexts

2. Implement geometric consistency verification using structure-from-motion or SfM-derived ground truth to quantify cross-view alignment beyond pixel-level metrics

3. Perform ablation studies isolating the contribution of each component (ControlNet, PanoGAN, conditional GAN fusion) to determine which architectural choices drive performance improvements
