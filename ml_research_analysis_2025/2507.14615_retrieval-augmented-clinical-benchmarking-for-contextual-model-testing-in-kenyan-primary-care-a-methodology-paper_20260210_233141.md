# Retrieval-Augmented Clinical Benchmarking for Contextual Model Testing in Kenyan Primary Care: A Methodology Paper

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.14615
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14615
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Developed guideline-grounded AI benchmark for Kenyan primary care using RAG, revealing significant LLM performance gaps on localized scenarios compared to Western benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a methodology for building a guideline-grounded AI benchmark focused on Kenyan primary care, addressing the gap between Western-centric medical benchmarks and African healthcare realities. Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the authors digitized Kenya's national Level 2-3 clinical guidelines, chunked them into machine-readable sections, and employed Gemini Flash 2.0 Lite to generate realistic clinical scenarios and multiple-choice questions in English and Swahili. Kenyan physicians co-created and refined the dataset, while a blinded expert review ensured clinical accuracy and cultural appropriateness. The resulting Alama Health QA dataset comprises thousands of regulator-aligned question-answer pairs.

## Method Summary
The methodology digitizes Kenya's 636-page Level 2-3 clinical guidelines into 1,115 semantic chunks, then uses RAG with Gemini Flash 2.0 Lite to generate clinical scenarios and MCQs. Expert Kenyan physicians validate outputs using a blinded 5-criteria rubric (clinical relevance, guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, cultural appropriateness). The pipeline produces bilingual (English/Swahili) datasets with metadata for evaluation using five specialized metrics targeting clinical reasoning, safety, and contextual adaptability.

## Key Results
- Developed guideline-grounded AI benchmark for Kenyan primary care using RAG methodology
- Revealed significant LLM performance gaps when confronted with localized scenarios
- Created Alama Health QA dataset with thousands of regulator-aligned question-answer pairs in English and Swahili
- Introduced innovative evaluation metrics (Decision Points, Needle-in-the-Haystack, Reverse QA, Geographic-Contextual Variance, Cognitive-Bias Stress Tests)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Retrieval-augmented generation reduces hallucination by constraining LLM outputs to guideline-grounded content.
- **Mechanism:** The RAG pipeline retrieves specific guideline chunks (1,115 indexed segments from 636 pages) and injects them into the prompt. The model must "fill in the blank" by converting factual statements into questions rather than generating from parametric memory. Citation requirements in the prompt further enforce source attribution.
- **Core assumption:** The guideline text itself is accurate, current, and sufficiently comprehensive for primary care scenarios.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "Gemini Flash 2.0 Lite was then prompted with relevant guideline excerpts to generate realistic clinical questions... with source citations"; Section 2.2 explains "because the model's knowledge is augmented with the exact guideline wording during generation, the chances of hallucinating an incorrect fact are minimized"

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Expert co-creation embeds tacit contextual knowledge that pure text extraction cannot capture.
- **Mechanism:** Kenyan physicians iteratively reviewed generated questions using a 5-point rubric across clinical relevance, guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and cultural appropriateness. Blinded review prevented bias toward AI-generated vs. benchmark comparison items.
- **Core assumption:** Expert reviewers accurately represent frontline clinical realities and can articulate implicit knowledge as evaluable criteria.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "Kenyan physicians co-created and refined the dataset, and a blinded expert review process ensured clinical accuracy, clarity, and cultural appropriateness"

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Multi-dimensional evaluation metrics (beyond accuracy) expose LLM failures in clinical reasoning that accuracy alone masks.
- **Mechanism:** Five specialized metrics test different failure modes: Decision Points (premature closure), Needle-in-the-Haystack (vigilance to rare cues), Reverse QA (symptom consistency), Geographic-Contextual Variance (adaptability), and Cognitive-Bias Stress Tests (anchoring).
- **Core assumption:** These metrics correlate with real-world clinical performance and patient safety outcomes.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3 states "Traditional metrics like overall accuracy or F1 score on answers are useful but insufficient. We want to answer deeper questions: Can the model reason through a case like a clinician?"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire pipeline depends on understanding how document chunking, embedding, retrieval, and prompt augmentation interact.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a query about "pediatric malaria treatment in pregnancy," which retrieval approach (BM25 lexical vs. vector semantic) would better handle the medical terminology mismatch?

- **Concept: Clinical Practice Guidelines as Knowledge Representations**
  - **Why needed here:** Guidelines are not textbooks—they're prescriptive, locally-adapted, and sometimes contradictory across versions.
  - **Quick check question:** A Kenyan guideline recommends benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin for severe pediatric pneumonia. How would you verify this is current practice vs. a 3-year-old recommendation?

- **Concept: Evaluation Metric Design for High-Stakes Domains**
  - **Why needed here:** Healthcare AI failures are asymmetric—false reassurance is worse than false alarm.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a model score highly on accuracy but fail the Needle-in-the-Haystack metric? What does this tell you about deployment readiness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** [Kenya MoH Guidelines PDF] → [Chunking Engine] → 1,115 chunks with metadata → [Hybrid Retrieval Index] ←–– query → [Gemini Flash 2.0 Lite] → MCQ generation + rationales → [Expert Review Platform (Kobo Collect)] → blinded 5-criteria rubric → [Alama Health QA Dataset] ←–– evaluation harness → [5 Evaluation Metrics Pipelines] → model scores

- **Critical path:** The guideline chunking strategy determines downstream quality. Poorly segmented text (e.g., splitting algorithm decision nodes across chunks) will produce incoherent questions regardless of LLM quality.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Comprehensive vs. specialty guidelines: Authors note general-purpose guidelines may be outdated; specialty guidelines recommended but increase scope
  - Human vs. automated validation: Blinded expert review is slow (~dozens of cases/reviewer-day) but catches cultural nuance; fully automated scoring scales but may miss subtlety
  - Static vs. living benchmark: Version-tagging enables updates as guidelines evolve, but requires ongoing maintenance infrastructure

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low Decision Point scores with high accuracy: Model jumps to answers without history-taking (safe on facts, unsafe in practice)
  - High Needle-in-the-Haystack misses: Model defaults to common diagnoses (malaria/typhoid) and ignores rare epidemiological cues
  - Geographic variance failures: Model gives same vaccination schedule for Kenya and South Africa (context-insensitive)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Chunk size ablation: Test question quality across chunk sizes (paragraph vs. section vs. algorithm branch) to optimize retrieval granularity
  2. Model temperature sweep: Evaluate hallucination rate vs. creative distractor quality at temperatures 0.0-0.7 for Gemini Flash 2.0 Lite
  3. Cross-validation with AfriMed-QA: Run both benchmarks on same LLM to identify whether guideline-grounded vs. expert-derived questions surface different failure modes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How do variations in LLM generation parameters (temperature, model selection) affect the quality, cost, and latency of guideline-grounded question generation in the RAG pipeline?
- **Basis in paper:** Explicit statement that "Further testing is planned on the impact of varying the model types & parameters (e.g. temperature) on quality, cost and latency."
- **Why unresolved:** The proof-of-concept used Gemini Flash 2.0 Lite based on qualitative assessment, but systematic parameter sweeps were not conducted.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Controlled experiments comparing question quality (expert-rated accuracy, clarity, distractor plausibility) across different temperature settings and model architectures, with latency and API cost measurements.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What is the inter-rater reliability of the blinded expert review process, and does reviewer background (physician vs. pharmacist vs. nurse) systematically affect validation scores?
- **Basis in paper:** Inferred from statement that reviewers used a 5-point rubric and "could also leave free-text comments," but does not report inter-rater agreement statistics or analyze variance by reviewer specialty.
- **Why unresolved:** Without quantifying rater concordance, the reproducibility of the validation pipeline remains uncertain.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Calculate Cohen's kappa or intraclass correlation across independent reviewer pairs; perform subgroup analysis by professional background.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How should the five proposed evaluation metrics (Decision Points, Needle-in-the-Haystack, Reverse QA, Geographic-Contextual Adaptability, Cognitive-Bias Stress Test) be weighted to produce a composite score for regulatory decision-making?
- **Basis in paper:** Explicit statement that "One might argue our custom metrics introduce their own subjectivity – e.g., how to weigh the importance of each metric is somewhat arbitrary at this stage."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper proposes weighted scoring formulas for individual metrics but does not justify cross-metric weighting for an overall model assessment.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Multi-stakeholder Delphi process with regulators, clinicians, and AI researchers to derive consensus weights; empirical validation correlating weighted scores with real-world clinical safety outcomes.

## Limitations
- Assumes guideline text is current and comprehensive; if guidelines lag clinical practice or omit emerging conditions, the benchmark will perpetuate those gaps
- Expert review was limited to Kenyan physicians for initial validation, potentially missing broader East African clinical diversity
- The RAG pipeline's effectiveness depends on chunking strategy and retrieval quality—poorly segmented text or suboptimal embeddings could undermine the entire pipeline

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The RAG methodology for reducing hallucination and the general pipeline architecture are well-established and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The five evaluation metrics are theoretically grounded but lack direct validation against clinical outcomes or established benchmark correlation studies
- **Low confidence**: The Swahili translation quality and cultural appropriateness assessments are difficult to verify without broader linguistic and regional expert input

## Next Checks
1. **Ecological validity test**: Deploy the benchmark questions in actual Kenyan primary care settings to compare LLM responses against real physician decisions on identical cases
2. **Cross-border generalizability assessment**: Apply the methodology to clinical guidelines from neighboring East African countries to evaluate regional transferability and identify guideline structural differences
3. **Longitudinal drift monitoring**: Establish a framework for tracking guideline updates and automatically flagging dependent questions for review/re-generation, measuring maintenance overhead and accuracy degradation over time
