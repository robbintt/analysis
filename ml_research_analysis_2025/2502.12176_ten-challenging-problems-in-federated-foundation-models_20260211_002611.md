- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Comprehensive survey identifying ten key challenges in Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs), including foundational theory, private data utilization, continual learning, and bidirectional knowledge transfer.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs), a distributed learning paradigm that combines the capabilities of large foundation models with the privacy-preserving features of federated learning. It identifies ten key challenges in FedFMs: foundational theory, private data utilization, continual learning, unlearning, non-IID and graph data, bidirectional knowledge transfer, incentive mechanism design, game mechanism design, model watermarking, and efficiency.

## Method Summary
This is a survey paper that systematically identifies and analyzes ten challenging problems in Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs). The paper provides mathematical formulations for each problem and reviews existing approaches from the literature. No single experimental method is specified, but the paper suggests implementation paths for validation, including selecting one problem, choosing a foundation model and dataset, and implementing specific techniques from referenced methods.

## Key Results
- Identifies ten critical challenges in FedFMs spanning theory, privacy, learning dynamics, and system design
- Proposes a unified mathematical framework combining utility, efficiency, watermark, contribution, and privacy losses
- Highlights the "No Free Lunch" trade-off between privacy, utility, and efficiency in FedFMs
- Introduces bidirectional knowledge transfer as a novel teacher-student learning paradigm between foundation and domain models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** If Foundation Models (FMs) and Domain Models (DMs) interact in a teacher-student loop, bidirectional knowledge transfer can occur, enhancing both generalization and domain specificity.
- **Mechanism:** The system utilizes a "teacher-student" setting where large FMs (server) transfer general capabilities to small DMs (clients), while DMs return domain-specific insights. This is formalized via three settings: optimizing DMs via FM knowledge, optimizing FMs via DM knowledge, or co-optimizing both.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: Knowledge can be effectively compressed and decompressed between models of vastly different scales (large FMs vs. small DMs) without catastrophic loss of utility.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "allows the large foundation models and the small local domain models at the remote clients to learn from each other in a teacher-student learning setting."
  - [section VII] "Setting 3: Co-optimizing the server's FM and clients' DMs... by mutually leveraging the knowledge of each other."
  - [corpus] "Federated Adapter on Foundation Models" supports the use of adapters to handle distribution shifts, aligning with the bidirectional transfer mechanism.
- **Break condition:** If the knowledge gap between the FM and DM is too wide (extreme model heterogeneity), transfer learning methods like distillation or adapters may fail to converge, resulting in negative transfer.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Improving system privacy guarantees inevitably degrades utility or efficiency, necessitating a "No Free Lunch" (NFL) optimization strategy.
- **Mechanism:** The system operates under a multi-objective optimization constraint where Privacy Loss ($\ell_p$), Utility Loss ($\ell_u$), and Efficiency Loss ($\ell_e$) are balanced. The NFL theorem implies $\ell_u + \ell_p + \ell_e > 0$, meaning perfect privacy, utility, and efficiency cannot coexist.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: The theoretical bounds derived for standard Federated Learning apply analogously to the scale and complexity of Foundation Models.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section II] "Note that the sum of loss in Eq. (1) for privacy, utility and efficiency is larger than zero, denoting the 'no free lunch' aspect of the tradeoff."
  - [corpus] Evidence is limited in the specific neighbor corpus regarding NFL proofs for FedFMs specifically, though general trade-offs are acknowledged in related surveys.
- **Break condition:** If an adversary has unlimited computational power or if the privacy budget ($\delta_k$) is set impossibly low, the utility loss ($\ell_u$) may become indistinguishable from random guessing.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Utilizing local private data for federated tuning enhances domain performance while adhering to regulations like GDPR, provided unlearning mechanisms are robust.
- **Mechanism:** Clients compute updates on private data $D_k$ without sharing raw data. To handle the "Right to be Forgotten," the system employs "unlearning executors" (e.g., gradient ascent or influence functions) to scrub specific data contributions from the global model $w_g$ without full retraining.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: The influence of specific data points can be mathematically isolated and reversed in high-dimensional foundation model parameters.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section IV] "The objective of FU is to mitigate the impact of a specific subset of data... min dist(w_un, w_re)" where $w_{re}$ is the retrained model.
  - [corpus] "Synergies between Federated Foundation Models and Smart Power Grids" highlights the necessity of data privacy in critical infrastructure, validating the need for this mechanism.
- **Break condition:** If knowledge coupling is too dense (entangled weights), removing specific data knowledge may inadvertently corrupt unrelated domain knowledge stored in the same parameters.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Federated Learning (FL)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the base protocol (e.g., FedAvg) upon which FedFMs are built. You must understand local training vs. global aggregation to grasp Problem 1 and 5.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how FedAvg aggregates model weights from local clients to form a global model?

- **Concept:** **Knowledge Distillation**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the primary engine for "Bidirectional Knowledge Transfer" (Problem 6), allowing large models to teach small ones and vice versa via logits or feature alignment.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a "student" model minimize the divergence between its output distribution and a "teacher" model's distribution?

- **Concept:** **Differential Privacy (DP)**
  - **Why needed here:** Essential for understanding the "Privacy-Utility" trade-off (Problem 1/2) and how systems protect against gradient inversion attacks.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the role of the privacy budget $\epsilon$ in determining the noise added to gradients?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Server (Foundation Model $w_s$, Public Data $D_p$, Aggregation Mechanism $F$) -> Clients (Domain Models $w_c$, Private Data $D_k$, Unlearning/Watermarking modules) -> Interface (Communication channels for model updates or knowledge representations)

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Define Objective:** Select the trade-off weights ($\alpha_1 \dots \alpha_5$) in the unified objective function (Eq. 17).
  2. **Select Transfer Setting:** Choose between Setting 1 (FM helps DM), 2 (DM helps FM), or 3 (Co-optimization).
  3. **Aggregation:** Implement White-box (parameters) or Black-box (prompts/knowledge) aggregation based on FM accessibility.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Open vs. Closed Source:** Open-source FMs allow parameter-tuning (White-box), offering better customization but high resource costs. Closed-source FMs require prompt-based tuning (Black-box), offering lower barriers but less control.
  - **Efficiency vs. Privacy:** Stronger privacy (HE/DP) lowers communication efficiency. The paper suggests "Hybrid Privacy-Preserving Techniques" to balance this.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Spatial-Temporal Catastrophic Forgetting:** The model forgets old tasks or global knowledge when learning new local tasks (Problem 3).
  - **Non-IID Divergence:** The global model fails to converge due to extreme data heterogeneity across clients (Problem 5).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Vanilla Integration:** Implement a standard FedAvg loop between a pre-trained BERT (FM) and small client models to establish a baseline for utility loss.
  2. **Heterogeneity Stress Test:** Introduce Non-IID data partitions to clients and measure the drop in accuracy, then implement a simple adapter-based solution (as suggested in Problem 5) to observe recovery.
  3. **Unlearning Verification:** Simulate a "Right to be Forgotten" request for a specific data class. Implement a gradient ascent unlearning executor and measure the "distance" between the unlearned model and a gold-standard retrained model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can a unified theoretical framework be established to mathematically define the complex trade-offs between privacy, utility, and efficiency in FedFMs?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section II states that FedFMs "currently lack a solid theoretical foundation" and frames the problem as a multi-objective optimization balancing $\ell_p$, $\ell_u$, and $\ell_e$.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper notes that real-world complexities and the "No Free Lunch" theorem hinder achieving an optimal equilibrium, as improving privacy often degrades utility.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Theoretical bounds defining the Pareto front for these competing objectives or a convergence proof for the unified loss function in Eq. (1).

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can bidirectional knowledge transfer be optimized between large Foundation Models and small Domain Models given severe model and data heterogeneity?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section VII identifies "Data Heterogeneity," "Representation Heterogeneity," and "Model Heterogeneity" as key challenges in the reciprocal teacher-student exchange.
- **Why unresolved:** Standard aggregation methods like FedAvg assume homogeneous architectures; FedFMs must reconcile massive server models with small client models without sharing raw data.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Algorithms demonstrating effective server-to-client and client-to-server knowledge transfer (Eq. 10) even when $w_s$ and $w_k$ have vastly different architectures.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can scalable incentive mechanisms be designed to fairly evaluate data contributions without incurring exponential computational overhead?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section VIII notes that methods like Shapley-Value calculations "exhibit exponential time complexity," making them infeasible for billion-scale FedFMs.
- **Why unresolved:** Accurately mapping data contribution to task performance is computationally expensive, leading to issues with "Scalability and Computational Overhead."
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A polynomial-time approximation algorithm for contribution evaluation that maintains "no-free-rider" properties and group rationality.

## Limitations
- Theoretical foundations for FedFMs lack specific convergence proofs for foundation model scale, relying on general FL literature
- Proposed solutions for bidirectional transfer, game mechanisms, and watermarking have limited empirical validation at foundation model scale
- Efficiency improvement claims through hybrid privacy-preserving techniques lack quantitative benchmarks and implementation details

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Identification of ten core challenges and unified mathematical framework; privacy-utility-efficiency trade-off mechanism consistent with established FL theory
- **Medium Confidence**: Solutions for Problems 6-10 show promise but limited empirical validation; unlearning mechanism's effectiveness for large models remains theoretical
- **Low Confidence**: Efficiency improvement claims lack quantitative benchmarks; incentive and game mechanism designs are conceptual without implementation details

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical Convergence Test**: Implement a baseline FedAvg system between a pre-trained foundation model (BERT or GPT-2) and small client models on CIFAR-10 or a domain-specific text corpus. Measure utility loss compared to centralized training to validate the privacy-utility trade-off claims.

2. **Knowledge Transfer Scalability**: Test the bidirectional knowledge transfer mechanism by implementing a teacher-student loop between a large FM and small DMs. Measure performance degradation when scaling down model size and when introducing heterogeneous data distributions.

3. **Unlearning Verification**: Simulate a "Right to be Forgotten" scenario by implementing gradient ascent unlearning executors. Compare the distance between the unlearned model and a gold-standard retrained model to verify the claimed unlearning effectiveness for foundation models.
