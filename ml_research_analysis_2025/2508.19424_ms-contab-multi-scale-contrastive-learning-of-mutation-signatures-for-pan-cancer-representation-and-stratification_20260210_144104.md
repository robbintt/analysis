# MS-ConTab: Multi-Scale Contrastive Learning of Mutation Signatures for Pan Cancer Representation and Stratification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.19424
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19424
- **Reference count:** 5
- **Primary result:** First contrastive learning framework for pan-cancer clustering using dual mutation signatures, achieving superior clustering quality over baselines.

## Executive Summary
MS-ConTab introduces a novel multi-scale contrastive learning framework that learns unified cancer-type embeddings from gene-level and chromosome-level mutation signatures. By leveraging dual TabNet encoders trained with NT-Xent loss, the method captures complementary information across different genomic scales. Applied to 43 cancer types from COSMIC, the framework reveals two biologically meaningful clusters: solid epithelial tumors versus hormone-related and hematopoietic malignancies. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates strong clustering performance (Silhouette: 0.561) and clear separation in mutation patterns and driver genes, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines like NMF.

## Method Summary
MS-ConTab processes protein-coding mutation data through two complementary views: gene-level mutation counts for the top 25 mutated genes per cancer type (300-dim vector) and chromosome-level substitution frequencies normalized by chromosome length (288-dim vector). These dual views are encoded using separate TabNet architectures with sequential attention mechanisms, producing 64-dim embeddings that are aligned through NT-Xent contrastive loss. The learned embeddings are then clustered using K-Means to reveal pan-cancer relationships. The framework specifically targets single-nucleotide substitutions from COSMIC, filtering for protein-coding mutations to focus on functional driver events.

## Key Results
- Strong clustering quality with Silhouette score of 0.561, outperforming NMF (0.141) and other baselines
- Clear separation into two biologically meaningful clusters: solid epithelial tumors versus hormone-related and hematopoietic malignancies
- Top mutated genes (TP53, PIK3CA) effectively distinguish between clusters, validating the biological relevance of learned representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Scale View Alignment
Aligning gene-level and chromosome-level views forces the model to learn a unified representation that captures hierarchical genomic structure. The framework treats gene-level profiles and chromosome-level distributions as two views of the same cancer type, minimizing NT-Xent loss to pull these views together while pushing apart different cancer types. This assumes gene-level and chromosome-level mutation patterns carry complementary, non-redundant information about underlying cancer biology.

### Mechanism 2: Attentive Feature Selection on Tabular Data
TabNet's sequential attention mechanism filters noisy mutation features, isolating specific driver genes and substitution patterns relevant for clustering. Unlike standard MLPs, TabNet uses decision steps with sparse attention masks to focus on subsets of features at each step, creating an interpretable, feature-selected latent space. This assumes the informative signal is sparse and embedded within high-dimensional, noisy background of passenger mutations.

### Mechanism 3: Non-Linear Manifold Separation
Deep non-linear embeddings separate cancer types more effectively than linear methods by capturing complex interaction patterns. The composition of TabNet encoders and non-linear projection heads maps input mutation vectors into a curved manifold where biologically similar cancer types are close, while linearly inseparable types are pushed apart. This assumes relationships between cancer mutation profiles are fundamentally non-linear.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning (Self-Supervised)**
  - Why needed: This is the engine of MS-ConTab. Understanding how NT-Xent loss maximizes agreement between positive pairs (same cancer, different views) and minimizes it for negative pairs is crucial.
  - Quick check: How does the model know which sample is a "positive pair" if there are no labels? (Answer: Positive pairs are generated by construction—the two views of the exact same cancer type).

- **Concept: Tabular Data & Sparse Attention**
  - Why needed: Unlike images, tabular mutation data has no spatial locality. Understanding how TabNet uses "masks" to select features column-by-column is crucial for debugging why the model attends to specific genes.
  - Quick check: Why use TabNet instead of a standard Transformer? (Answer: TabNet is optimized for tabular data, using decision steps and sparse regularization to handle lack of sequential/spatial structure).

- **Concept: Pan-Cancer Mutational Signatures**
  - Why needed: The input features are not raw DNA sequences but 12 types of nucleotide substitutions. Understanding that these distributions reflect biological processes helps interpret the clusters.
  - Quick check: Why does the paper focus on "protein-coding" mutations only? (Answer: To reduce noise and focus on functional drivers rather than vast non-coding genome).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer (Gene: 300-dim, Chr: 288-dim) -> Dual TabNet Encoders -> Linear Projection Head (64-dim) -> NT-Xent Loss -> K-Means Clustering

- **Critical path:** The preprocessing step defines success. Construction of "Top 25 most frequently mutated genes" per cancer type is the primary feature filter. If this list is noisy or incomplete for a rare cancer, the encoder receives garbage input. The contrastive loss relies on the assumption that the chromosome-level view compensates for gene-level noise.

- **Design tradeoffs:** 
  - Embedding Dimension (64): Chosen to prevent overfitting given small cohort size (N=43). Higher dimensions would likely memorize training data.
  - Dual Encoders vs. Single Encoder: Separate TabNet encoders for Gene and Chr views allow specialized feature selection for each scale, but reduces parameter sharing that might help in very low-data regimes.
  - Temperature (0.5): A standard starting point; lower values make the contrastive task harder (sharpening similarity distribution), likely necessary to separate 43 similar cancer types.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Mode Collapse: All cancer types map to same embedding point. (Check: Monitor variance of embeddings; if near zero, learning rate is too high or batch size too small).
  - View Dominance: One encoder learns meaningful features while the other outputs noise ignored by projection head. (Check: Visualize attention masks for both encoders separately).
  - Single Cluster Output: Model creates one giant cluster and one outlier. (Check: Inspect K-means initialization; verify NT-Xent maximizes distance between different cancer types).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reconstruction Baseline: Run standard Autoencoder on concatenated data to establish "non-contrastive" lower bound for cluster quality.
  2. View Ablation: Train two separate models—one using only Gene-level data, one using only Chr-level data—to quantify performance gain from "Multi-Scale" fusion.
  3. Hyperparameter Sweep on Temperature: Retrain MS-ConTab with varying NT-Xent temperatures (e.g., 0.1, 0.5, 1.0) to visualize how "sharpness" of loss affects Silhouette score of final clusters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the learned MS-ConTab embeddings effectively identify drug repurposing opportunities or novel mutation signatures?
- Does the integration of structural variants and non-coding annotations further refine the cancer clusters identified by MS-ConTab?
- How sensitive are the resulting clusters to the selection of the "top 25 most frequently mutated genes" threshold?

## Limitations
- The framework excludes indels, structural variants, and non-coding mutations which may carry distinct etiological signals
- The 43 cancer types represent a relatively small sample size for deep contrastive learning, raising concerns about overfitting
- Exact list of "top 25 mutated genes" per cancer type and precise 43 cancer types used are not fully enumerated, making exact replication challenging

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Biological clustering results (solid epithelial vs. hormone/hematopoietic) are well-supported by data and align with known cancer biology. Quantitative superiority over NMF and other baselines is clearly demonstrated.
- **Medium Confidence:** Mechanism of dual-view alignment improving robustness is logically sound but lacks direct ablation evidence proving chromosome-level view provides unique, non-redundant information.
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability of 64-dim embedding space to downstream tasks (e.g., predicting patient survival or drug response) is not tested, leaving gap between representation learning and clinical utility.

## Next Checks
1. **View Ablation Study:** Train and evaluate MS-ConTab using only gene-level view and only chromosome-level view to quantify performance gain from multi-scale fusion.
2. **Feature Importance Analysis:** Use TabNet's built-in attention masks to identify which specific genes and chromosomes drive clustering, validating against known driver mutations (e.g., TP53, PIK3CA).
3. **Cross-Validation Stability:** Perform k-fold cross-validation (k=5) on the 43 cancer types to assess stability of learned embeddings and clustering scores across different train/test splits.
