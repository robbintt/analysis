# Dynamic View Synthesis as an Inverse Problem

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.08004
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08004
- Authors: Hidir Yesiltepe; Pinar Yanardag
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: State-of-the-art 6-DoF dynamic view synthesis from single monocular video without training or architectural modifications, achieving FID 53.15, FVD 103.44, CLIP-T 35.37, and PSNR 16.28 on curated dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos by treating it as an inverse problem without requiring any training or architectural modifications. The authors identify and address a critical zero-terminal SNR collapse problem that occurs during deterministic inversion of diffusion models. They introduce K-order Recursive Noise Representation (K-RNR) to resolve this issue and align VAE-encoded and DDIM-inverted latents. The method also incorporates Stochastic Latent Modulation to synthesize plausible content for newly visible regions through visibility-aware sampling. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a curated dataset, outperforming existing methods like ReCamMaster, TrajectoryCrafter, and DaS across multiple metrics while preserving identity and scene fidelity.

## Method Summary
The approach treats dynamic view synthesis as an inverse problem, leveraging pre-trained generative models without any fine-tuning. The core innovation addresses the zero-terminal SNR collapse problem that occurs when deterministically inverting diffusion models, which leads to loss of information during the generation process. K-RNR recursively represents noise across multiple orders to maintain signal integrity throughout the inversion process. Stochastic Latent Modulation is then applied to handle regions that become visible in new viewpoints, using visibility-aware sampling to generate plausible content for these areas. The method processes monocular video input and generates novel views with 6 degrees of freedom, all while preserving the identity of dynamic objects and maintaining scene consistency without requiring any training data specific to the target scenes.

## Key Results
- Achieves FID score of 53.15 on curated dataset, outperforming ReCamMaster, TrajectoryCrafter, and DaS
- Demonstrates FVD of 103.44, indicating better temporal consistency in synthesized sequences
- Maintains CLIP-T score of 35.37, showing preserved semantic content across novel viewpoints
- Achieves PSNR of 16.28, providing quantitative measure of reconstruction quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method succeeds by reframing dynamic view synthesis as an inverse problem rather than a generation problem. By leveraging the pre-trained diffusion model's understanding of natural image statistics, the approach can generate novel views without scene-specific training. The K-RNR mechanism prevents information loss during the inversion process by maintaining noise representation across multiple scales, while Stochastic Latent Modulation handles the challenge of synthesizing content for newly visible regions that weren't present in the original viewpoint. This combination allows the system to generate temporally consistent, identity-preserving views while working entirely with pre-trained models.

- **6-DoF View Synthesis**: Why needed - Enables full 3D motion around scenes; Quick check - Know the six degrees of freedom in 3D space

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Video Input -> VAE Encoder -> K-RNR Module -> DDIM Inversion -> Stochastic Latent Modulation -> VAE Decoder -> Novel View Output

Critical Path:
The critical computational path runs from the VAE encoder through K-RNR processing, DDIM inversion with Stochastic Latent Modulation, and finally through the VAE decoder. This pipeline must process each frame efficiently to maintain temporal consistency while handling the additional complexity of visibility-aware sampling for novel viewpoints.

Design Tradeoffs:
The method trades computational efficiency for generality by avoiding scene-specific training. While this enables zero-shot application to new scenes, it may limit performance compared to trained methods on specific domains. The K-RNR approach adds computational overhead but is essential for preventing the SNR collapse that would otherwise degrade synthesis quality.

Failure Signatures:
Performance degradation occurs when input videos have rapid motion or extreme lighting changes that exceed the pre-trained model's generalization capabilities. The method may struggle with highly occluded scenes or when the baseline viewpoint differs significantly from the target viewpoints, as Stochastic Latent Modulation has limited ability to hallucinate content far outside the training distribution.

First Experiments:
1. Test deterministic vs. K-RNR inversion on a simple synthetic scene to observe SNR collapse directly
2. Evaluate visibility-aware sampling performance by comparing regions that become newly visible vs. already visible areas
3. Measure temporal consistency across synthesized sequences by computing frame-to-frame differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on a "curated dataset" without transparency about its composition, scale, or real-world representativeness
- Absolute metric values (FID 53.15, FVD 103.44, CLIP-T 35.37, PSNR 16.28) indicate room for improvement in visual quality
- Claims of "state-of-the-art" performance lack contextualization against broader view synthesis literature
- No ablation studies demonstrate individual contributions of K-RNR and Stochastic Latent Modulation components
- Computational efficiency and runtime performance are not discussed, limiting practical deployment assessment

## Confidence

High Confidence:
- Technical approach of treating dynamic view synthesis as an inverse problem is well-grounded
- Identification of zero-terminal SNR collapse as a critical failure mode is theoretically sound
- Conceptual framework for K-RNR and Stochastic Latent Modulation is coherent

Medium Confidence:
- Experimental results show quantitative improvements over baselines
- Performance metrics support claims of state-of-the-art results
- Limited dataset details and lack of qualitative examples reduce confidence in practical significance

Low Confidence:
- Claims about identity preservation and scene fidelity lack user study validation
- Scalability to diverse real-world scenarios remains unproven
- Generalizability beyond curated dataset is unverified

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of K-RNR and Stochastic Latent Modulation to quantify their individual impact on synthesis quality

2. Evaluate the method on publicly available datasets (e.g., RealEstate10K, MannequinChallenge) to verify generalizability beyond the curated dataset

3. Perform user studies comparing perceptual quality and identity preservation against baseline methods to validate qualitative improvements suggested by quantitative metrics
