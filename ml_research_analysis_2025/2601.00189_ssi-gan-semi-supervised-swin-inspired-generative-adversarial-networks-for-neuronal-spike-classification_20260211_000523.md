- 99.93% accuracy on 3% labeled data for mosquito spike classification

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SSI-GAN, a semi-supervised generative adversarial network that achieves 99.93% classification accuracy for neuronal spike signals from Zika and dengue-infected mosquitoes using only 1-3% labeled data. The model employs a Swin-inspired shifted-window transformer discriminator that captures sparse, high-frequency spike features through local self-attention, combined with a transformer-based generator. This architecture reduces manual labeling effort by 97-99% compared to traditional fully supervised methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance across all infection stages. The approach demonstrates that semi-supervised transformer architectures can deliver exceptional results in sparse spike classification with minimal expert annotation.

## Method Summary
SSI-GAN uses a semi-supervised GAN framework where the discriminator receives both supervised cross-entropy loss on a small labeled subset and unsupervised real/fake discrimination on all data. The key innovation is a Swin-inspired shifted-window transformer discriminator that partitions input sequences into fixed windows and applies local self-attention within each window, with shifted windows in alternating layers enabling cross-window interactions. The generator creates synthetic spike samples that regularize the discriminator. The model processes 100-timestep × 60-channel spike sequences after high-pass filtering (700Hz cutoff) and thresholding (±10µV). Training uses 500 iterations with 5-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation, optimizing hyperparameters via Bayesian optimization.

## Key Results
- 99.93% classification accuracy on third-day post-infection data using only 3% labeled data
- Maintained over 99% accuracy across all infection stages (1, 3, and 5 days post-infection)
- Achieved 96% accuracy even with just 1% labeled data, demonstrating robust semi-supervised learning
- Outperformed strong CNN, RNN, LSTM, and hybrid baselines across all experimental conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Semi-supervised adversarial training enables high classification accuracy with 97-99% less labeled data than fully supervised methods.
- **Mechanism:** The discriminator receives three training signals: (1) supervised cross-entropy loss on the small labeled subset, (2) unsupervised real/fake discrimination on all data, and (3) adversarial feedback from generated samples. This allows the discriminator to learn discriminative features from unlabeled data while aligning them with labeled examples.
- **Core assumption:** Unlabeled spike sequences share the same underlying feature distribution as labeled ones, so learning to distinguish real from fake samples forces the discriminator to capture class-relevant structure without explicit labels.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples... This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort."
  - [section 4.2] "Even with less supervision (1% labeled data), the proposed model maintained competitive performance relative to the fully supervised methods... achieving an accuracy of over 96%."
  - [corpus] "READ: Reinforcement-based Adversarial Learning for Text Classification with Limited Labeled Data" and "Applications and Effect Evaluation of Generative Adversarial Networks in Semi-Supervised Learning" corroborate that adversarial semi-supervised frameworks consistently reduce labeling requirements across domains.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The Swin-inspired shifted-window transformer discriminator captures sparse, high-frequency spike features more effectively than CNNs or RNNs.
- **Mechanism:** Unlike standard transformers with global attention, this discriminator partitions the 100×60 input into fixed windows and applies local self-attention within each window. Shifted windows in alternating layers enable cross-window interactions without hierarchical downsampling.
- **Core assumption:** Discriminative spike patterns are sparse and localized; selective attention to these regions is more efficient than processing all positions equally.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features."
  - [section 3.4] "This simplified shifted-window design allows efficient local modeling while enabling cross-window interaction in alternating layers, which is critical for sparse spike patterns."
  - [section 5, ablation] Baseline 4 (CNN generator + Swin-inspired discriminator) achieved 99.28% at 1 dpi, while Baseline 5 (full CNN-GAN) dropped to 95.38%, confirming the discriminator's contribution.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The discriminator architecture drives classification performance more than the generator design in semi-supervised GANs for this task.
- **Mechanism:** The generator's role is primarily to provide adversarial pressure on the discriminator rather than produce high-fidelity synthetic spikes. Ablation shows that both CNN and transformer generators yield similar final accuracy when paired with the same discriminator.
- **Core assumption:** Semi-supervised GAN classification depends more on discriminator feature learning than generator sample quality.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.3] "Because the generator in semi-supervised GANs primarily serves to support discriminator learning rather than producing high-fidelity synthetic samples, the final performance of the classifier showed difference between the two designs."
  - [section 5, ablation] Baselines 2 and 4 (different generators, same or similar discriminators) performed comparably (97.15-99.28%), while Baseline 1 (full Swin Transformer discriminator) collapsed to 32-34% accuracy due to overfitting.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Semi-supervised learning with consistency regularization**
  - **Why needed here:** The model must extract useful signal from 97-99% unlabeled data. Understanding how unsupervised real/fake discrimination transfers to supervised classification is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a batch with 3% labeled spikes and 97% unlabeled, can you explain how the discriminator's loss combines supervised cross-entropy and unsupervised GAN loss?

- **Concept: Window-based self-attention with positional encoding**
  - **Why needed here:** The shifted-window transformer discriminator relies on local attention rather than global. You must understand how windows partition the sequence and how shifting enables cross-window information flow.
  - **Quick check question:** For a 100-timestep spike sequence split into windows of size 10, what happens to attention patterns when windows shift by 5 positions in the next layer?

- **Concept: GAN training dynamics and stability**
  - **Why needed here:** Adversarial training is notoriously unstable. Understanding generator-discriminator equilibrium is critical for debugging divergence or mode collapse.
  - **Quick check question:** If discriminator accuracy on real vs. fake samples reaches 99% early in training, what does this indicate about generator quality and how might you adjust learning rates or loss balancing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input (100×60 spike sequences) -> Generator (noise → synthetic spikes) -> Discriminator (windowed attention → 3-class softmax + real/fake head) -> Classification output

- **Critical path:**
  1. Spike detection (filtering + thresholding) directly determines what the model sees—poor preprocessing here propagates errors.
  2. Discriminator attention weights must focus on sparse spike positions; if attention disperses uniformly, classification fails.
  3. Semi-supervised loss balancing—over-weighting GAN loss vs. supervised loss can distort learned features.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Non-hierarchical vs. hierarchical Swin: Preserving full resolution maintains temporal granularity but increases compute; hierarchical downsampling may lose fine spike timing.
  - Generator complexity: Simpler CNN generator trains faster with similar results; transformer generator adds parameters without clear accuracy gain.
  - Window size and shift amount: Smaller windows capture finer local patterns but require more layers for global context; shift must ensure coverage of all positions across layers.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Discriminator accuracy stuck near 100% early → generator collapsed or learning rate too low for G.
  - Supervised accuracy plateaus while unsupervised GAN loss oscillates → label distribution mismatch or insufficient labeled diversity.
  - Performance varies widely across Monte Carlo folds → data split sensitivity; consider stratified sampling by infection stage.
  - Attention maps show uniform weights across timesteps → positional encoding may be weak or spike sparsity too extreme for attention to differentiate.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline sanity check:** Train a standard CNN classifier with 100% labeled data on the same preprocessing. Compare accuracy to SSI-GAN at 3% labels—if the gap is small, semi-supervised gains may be marginal for this dataset.
  2. **Window size ablation:** Test window sizes of 5, 10, 20, and 50 timesteps with fixed shift (half window). Plot accuracy vs. window size to find the local-global attention balance optimal for sparse spikes.
  3. **Labeled data scaling curve:** Train SSI-GAN with 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, and 10% labeled data. Plot accuracy vs. label fraction to identify the point of diminishing returns and verify robustness below 3%.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the SSI-GAN framework generalize to other mosquito species and a broader range of flaviviruses?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state that extending to "additional mosquito vector species and to comprehensive flavivirus panels" is required to establish generalizability.
- **Why unresolved:** The study restricted analysis to *Aedes aegypti* and only Zika and Dengue viruses.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful classification results when training and testing on datasets from different vector species or other neurotropic flaviviruses.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can active learning or self-supervised pre-training further reduce the requirement for labeled data to near-zero?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors suggest investigating "even lower labeled-data ratios (such as zero-shot mechanisms) through active learning or self-supervised pre-training."
- **Why unresolved:** The current model achieves high performance with 1-3% labeled data, but the feasibility of completely removing manual labeling via these techniques remains untested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments demonstrating maintained accuracy when coupling the GAN with active learning pipelines on the same dataset.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the proposed architecture suitable for real-time, closed-loop experimentation with live neuronal recordings?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors note the model was evaluated only on static datasets and propose the "development of real-time classification systems."
- **Why unresolved:** High-frequency streaming data and latency constraints in live biological environments were not addressed in the current offline methodology.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Deployment metrics showing the model processing streaming MEA data with latency sufficient for live feedback control.

## Limitations

- **Window size hyperparameter:** The specific window length for the shifted-window transformer discriminator is not specified, which could significantly impact local attention patterns and classification accuracy.
- **Optimizer configuration:** Beyond learning rate, the specific optimizer (Adam, AdamW) and beta parameters are not explicitly listed in the provided text.
- **Data normalization ambiguity:** While thresholding is specified, it is unclear if the resulting non-zero spike values are normalized (e.g., to [-1, 1]) before entering the model.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The 97-99% reduction in labeling effort and >99% accuracy on 1-3% labeled data are well-supported by experimental results and ablation studies. The transformer discriminator's superiority over CNN baselines is demonstrated.
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that the discriminator architecture drives performance more than the generator is supported by ablation but could benefit from additional generator variants. The effectiveness of shifted windows for sparse spike features is demonstrated but not directly compared to other sparse feature extraction methods.

## Next Checks

1. **Window size ablation:** Test window sizes of 5, 10, 20, and 50 timesteps with fixed shift (half window) to determine optimal local attention resolution for spike patterns.
2. **Labeled data scaling curve:** Train SSI-GAN with 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, and 10% labeled data to verify robustness below 3% and identify diminishing returns.
3. **Fully supervised baseline comparison:** Train a standard CNN classifier with 100% labeled data on the same preprocessing to quantify the semi-supervised advantage margin.
