# Reasoning Stabilization Point: A Training-Time Signal for Stable Evidence and Shortcut Reliance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.11625
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11625
- Authors: Sahil Rajesh Dhayalkar
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Explanation drift stabilizes before or shortly after validation accuracy saturates, providing a training-time signal for when model reasoning patterns become stable.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces explanation drift and the Reasoning Stabilization Point (RSP) as training-time diagnostics for monitoring how a fine-tuned model's decision evidence evolves. The method measures epoch-to-epoch changes in token-level attributions on a fixed probe set, with RSP marking the earliest epoch where drift remains consistently low. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and classification tasks, drift typically stabilizes by or before accuracy saturation, and in a controlled shortcut setting, attribution dynamics reveal increasing reliance on spurious features even when validation accuracy remains competitive. These results suggest that explanation drift provides a simple, low-cost complement to accuracy curves for detecting when decision evidence stabilizes and when models may be adopting brittle cues.

## Method Summary
The method tracks explanation drift during fine-tuning by computing token-level attributions (using Gradient×Input) on a fixed probe set across training epochs. Drift is measured as epoch-to-epoch changes in normalized attribution rankings using Spearman rank correlation. The Reasoning Stabilization Point (RSP) is identified as the earliest epoch where drift drops below the median of observed drift values for a specified window of consecutive epochs. The approach uses lightweight transformer classifiers (DistilBERT, MiniLM) on SST-2 and QNLI tasks, with attribution normalization and drift aggregation following specific equations. The method is designed to detect when model reasoning patterns stabilize without requiring out-of-distribution validation data.

## Key Results
- Attribution drift typically stabilizes by or before validation accuracy saturation across multiple runs and tasks
- RSP occurs at epoch 3.0 in controlled experiments while accuracy changes only slightly after RSP occurrence
- In shortcut experiments, attribution mass shifts toward spurious features while validation accuracy remains competitive, revealing brittle reasoning patterns
- The median-based threshold for RSP detection successfully identifies stabilization epochs without requiring OOD validation data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Early Stabilization of Decision Evidence
Fine-tuned models often stabilize the importance assigned to specific tokens (evidence) before or shortly after validation accuracy saturates. As optimization progresses, the model rapidly identifies core tokens that reliably predict the label. Once identified, further epochs primarily refine decision boundaries rather than reallocating which features matter, causing epoch-to-epoch attribution rankings to converge.

### Mechanism 2: Drift Dynamics Reveal Shortcut Adoption
Stable accuracy metrics can mask a shift in internal reasoning toward spurious or brittle features, detectable via attribution mass shifts. When easy-to-learn spurious correlations exist, the model gradually increases reliance on them to minimize loss, even after task accuracy is high. This reallocation of importance keeps accuracy constant but changes the explanation profile.

### Mechanism 3: Data-Driven Stabilization Threshold
A stabilization point can be identified using internal run dynamics (median drift) without requiring out-of-distribution validation data. By setting the stability threshold to the median of observed drift values, the system anchors "stability" to the relative behavior of that specific run, with RSP triggered when drift drops and stays below this relative baseline for a fixed window.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gradient-based Attribution (e.g., Integrated Gradients, Gradient×Input):** Core to computing token importance scores E_θ(x). Quick check: If model weights change slightly, how might the gradient of output w.r.t. a specific input token change?

- **Distributional Similarity (Spearman Rank Correlation):** Used to measure drift by tracking changes in token importance orderings. Quick check: Why is rank correlation preferred over cosine similarity when checking if the "most important token" has changed?

- **Probe Sets vs. Validation Sets:** The method distinguishes between accuracy monitoring (validation) and explanation stability monitoring (probe). Quick check: If we resampled the probe set every epoch, would we be measuring model stability or dataset variance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Probe Set (P) -> Attribution Engine -> Normalizer -> Drift Calculator -> RSP Detector
- **Critical path:** 1) Save checkpoints at every epoch. 2) Pass same Probe Set P through checkpoint to get attributions. 3) Normalize attributions per instance. 4) Compute Spearman similarity between consecutive epochs. 5) Aggregate to scalar drift D_t and check against threshold τ.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Window size w affects detection timing vs. robustness; probe size |P| balances stability vs. compute overhead; attribution method choice impacts fidelity vs. computational cost.
- **Failure signatures:** "Never Stabilizes" indicates model not converging on fixed reasoning or probe set issues; "Instant Stabilization" suggests pre-trained model already has reasoning pattern or threshold miscalculation.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline drift curve on SST-2 to verify D_t drops before accuracy saturates. 2) Shortcut injection to verify spur attribution mass Mt increases. 3) Threshold sensitivity to compare median vs. fixed thresholds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Does RSP generalize to larger language models and generative tasks? Current study limited to lightweight classifiers.
- Can a single RSP capture stabilization in dynamic training regimes like curriculum learning? Models with shifting data distributions may exhibit multiple stabilization phases.
- To what extent is RSP invariant to attribution method choice? Current reliance on gradient-based attributions leaves sensitivity to other methods unexplored.

## Limitations

- Fidelity of gradient-based attributions as proxies for actual model reasoning remains uncertain, potentially influenced by gradient artifacts.
- Probe set methodology lacks specification of sampling strategy, risking unrepresentative drift patterns if set is not carefully constructed.
- Median-based threshold for RSP detection lacks theoretical grounding for consistent identification across different learning rates, model architectures, or task difficulties.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Attribution drift typically stabilizes before or shortly after validation accuracy saturates; RSP detection method successfully identifies low-drift epochs.
- **Medium Confidence:** Attribution dynamics can reveal shortcut adoption while validation accuracy remains competitive; method provides useful training-time signal.
- **Low Confidence:** Specific choice of Gradient×Input attributions is optimal; RSP consistently corresponds to meaningful behavioral changes beyond explanation stability.

## Next Checks

1. **Probe Set Representativeness Test:** Run RSP detection with multiple probe set sizes (100, 500, 1000 examples) and sampling strategies to assess sensitivity to probe set composition.

2. **Attribution Method Sensitivity Analysis:** Repeat analysis using Integrated Gradients instead of Gradient×Input to compare drift curves, RSP epochs, and spur attribution patterns.

3. **Distribution Shift Validation:** After identifying RSP, evaluate model performance on out-of-distribution test sets to test whether models fine-tuned beyond RSP show different generalization patterns.
