core_contribution: The paper introduces BNLI, a linguistically refined Bengali dataset
  for natural language inference (NLI) that addresses issues like annotation errors
  and lack of semantic diversity found in existing Bengali NLI datasets. BNLI was
  created using a multi-stage pipeline involving translation of premises from SNLI,
  hypothesis generation by native speakers, and rigorous validation through semantic
  similarity scoring and human review.

# BNLI: A Linguistically-Refined Bengali Dataset for Natural Language Inference
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.08813
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08813
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Introduces BNLI, a linguistically refined Bengali NLI dataset with 23,067 sentence pairs validated through multi-stage pipeline

## Executive Summary
BNLI addresses critical shortcomings in existing Bengali natural language inference datasets, particularly annotation errors and limited semantic diversity. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous multi-stage pipeline involving SNLI premise translation, native speaker hypothesis generation, and comprehensive validation using semantic similarity scoring and human review. With 23,067 balanced sentence pairs across entailment, contradiction, and neutral classes, BNLI provides a robust resource for Bengali NLI research. Transformer-based models, particularly LLaMA-2, achieved strong performance with an F1-score of 79.13%, demonstrating the dataset's quality and utility for advancing low-resource language modeling.

## Method Summary
The BNLI dataset was created using a multi-stage pipeline that began with translating premises from the SNLI dataset into Bengali. Native Bengali speakers then generated hypotheses for each premise, ensuring linguistic authenticity and semantic diversity. A rigorous validation process followed, incorporating semantic similarity scoring and human review to eliminate annotation errors and maintain quality. The final dataset contains 23,067 sentence pairs distributed across three balanced classes: entailment (7,682), contradiction (7,696), and neutral (7,661). This approach specifically targeted the limitations of existing Bengali NLI datasets by emphasizing linguistic refinement and comprehensive validation.

## Key Results
- LLaMA-2 achieved the highest F1-score of 79.13% on the BNLI benchmark
- Transformer-based models significantly outperformed traditional methods across all evaluation metrics
- The dataset contains 23,067 balanced sentence pairs across three NLI classes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-stage validation pipeline ensures high-quality annotations by combining automated semantic similarity scoring with human expertise. Native speaker involvement in hypothesis generation captures authentic linguistic patterns and semantic relationships specific to Bengali. The balanced class distribution prevents model bias toward any particular inference type. Translation from SNLI premises provides a reliable foundation while allowing for linguistic adaptation to Bengali's unique characteristics.

## Foundational Learning
- Semantic similarity scoring: Why needed - quantifies semantic relationships between sentence pairs; Quick check - verify similarity scores correlate with human judgments
- NLI class balance: Why needed - prevents model bias toward dominant classes; Quick check - confirm 33% distribution across entailment, contradiction, neutral
- Native speaker validation: Why needed - ensures linguistic authenticity and cultural appropriateness; Quick check - compare native vs non-native generated hypotheses for quality differences

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: SNLI premises -> Bengali translation -> Native hypothesis generation -> Semantic similarity scoring -> Human validation -> BNLI dataset
Critical path: The validation stages (semantic similarity scoring and human review) form the critical path, as errors here directly impact dataset quality and downstream model performance.
Design tradeoffs: Translation-based approach enables rapid dataset creation but risks semantic drift; native generation ensures authenticity but increases resource requirements; automated scoring provides scalability but requires human oversight for accuracy.
Failure signatures: Inconsistent class distribution indicates validation failures; low inter-annotator agreement suggests ambiguous or poorly constructed sentence pairs; semantic similarity score anomalies reveal potential annotation errors.
First experiments: 1) Evaluate semantic similarity score distribution across classes to verify logical relationships, 2) Test model performance on progressively larger validation subsets to identify quality thresholds, 3) Compare native vs translated premise quality through controlled ablation studies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The 23,067 pair size may limit generalization to more diverse linguistic phenomena
- Translation from SNLI premises could introduce subtle semantic shifts affecting NLI relationships
- Performance comparisons lack direct benchmarking against existing Bengali NLI datasets

## Confidence
High: Dataset creation methodology, benchmarking procedures, validation pipeline design
Medium: Claims about BNLI's superiority over existing datasets, semantic diversity improvements
Medium: Reported F1-score of 79.13% requires contextualization against other Bengali NLI benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-dataset evaluation by testing models trained on BNLI against existing Bengali NLI datasets to measure generalization
2. Perform ablation studies removing different validation stages to quantify their impact on dataset quality
3. Test model performance across different sentence length distributions and linguistic phenomena to identify potential biases or coverage gaps in the dataset
