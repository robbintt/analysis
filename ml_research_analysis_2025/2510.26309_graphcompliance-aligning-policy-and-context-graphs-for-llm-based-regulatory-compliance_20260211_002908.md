# GraphCompliance: Aligning Policy and Context Graphs for LLM-Based Regulatory Compliance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.26309
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26309
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 4.1-7.2 pp higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines on GDPR compliance

## Executive Summary
GraphCompliance addresses the challenge of automating regulatory compliance by aligning structured policy graphs with unstructured context graphs. The method constructs a policy graph from regulatory text and a context graph from runtime scenarios, then uses a compliance gate to perform deterministic structural analysis before LLM judgment. This alignment anchors LLM reasoning in structured information, reducing the burden of regulatory interpretation. Experiments on 300 GDPR-derived scenarios show 4.1-7.2 percentage points higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines, with improved recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies confirm contributions from each graph component, demonstrating that structured representations and judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

## Method Summary
GraphCompliance constructs two graphs: a Policy Graph from regulatory text encoding normative structure and cross-references, and a Context Graph from runtime scenarios formalizing events and entities. A Compliance Gate performs deterministic structural analysis—like traversing cross-references and checking actor attributes—before passing a curated problem to a judge LLM. This offloads structural logic from the probabilistic LLM to a verifiable graph traversal system. The framework uses LLMs to extract Compliance Units (CUs) from policy text and entities/relations from context scenarios, then aligns them via anchor extraction and reference closure for exception handling.

## Key Results
- Achieves 4.1-7.2 percentage points higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines on GDPR compliance
- Improves recall and lowers false positive rates through structured graph alignment
- Ablation studies show significant performance drops when disabling reference traversal (-9.6 pp micro-F1) or context graph components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured graph representations of policy and context constrain LLM reasoning, reducing errors in regulatory compliance tasks.
- Mechanism: The framework constructs two distinct graphs: a Policy Graph from regulatory text (encoding normative structure and cross-references) and a Context Graph from runtime scenarios (formalizing events and entities). A "Compliance Gate" then performs deterministic structural analysis—like traversing cross-references and checking actor attributes—before passing a curated problem to a judge LLM. This offloads structural logic from the probabilistic LLM to a verifiable graph traversal system.
- Core assumption: Regulations possess an underlying logical structure (normative, cross-referential, decision-tree-based) that can be accurately and completely captured in a symbolic graph.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...policy graph encodes normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes events... GraphCompliance yields 4.1–7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1..."
  - [section 1] Figure 1 illustrates three failure modes of retrieval-centric approaches: missed cross-references, broken decision-tree logic, and checklist conflation.
  - [corpus] Related work "Regulatory Graphs and GenAI for Real-Time Transaction Monitoring and Compliance Explanation in Banking" also integrates graph-based modeling with generative AI for automated compliance, supporting the hybrid approach.
- Break condition: If the regulatory text is highly ambiguous or lacks clear logical structure, the graph construction process (via LLM) may fail to accurately capture the policy's intent, invalidating downstream structural analysis.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The alignment of context and policy graphs via a Compliance Gate improves recall and lowers false positive rates in compliance judgment.
- Mechanism: The Compliance Gate aligns the two graphs by extracting "anchors" from the context graph and using them to retrieve relevant "compliance units" (CUs) from the policy graph. It then uses an LLM to judge compliance based on the retrieved CUs and a subgraph of evidence. Crucially, it employs a "reference closure" step to check for exceptions to violations, implementing a form of defeasible logic.
- Core assumption: The judge LLM's performance is improved when its reasoning is anchored to a structured, pre-filtered set of policy rules and contextual evidence, rather than raw text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in structured information... resulting in higher recall and lower false positive rates."
  - [section 3.3] "A second LLM call then determines whether any CU within this R(c) constitutes a valid exception that overrides the initial violation."
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is weak or missing for this specific alignment mechanism's effect on recall/FPR. Related work on "Policy Cards" focuses on runtime governance for agents, not this graph alignment mechanism.
- Break condition: The alignment mechanism fails if the context graph's entities cannot be meaningfully mapped to the policy graph's hypernyms or if the retrieval mechanism fails to surface the correct CUs for a given anchor.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explicit, structured traversal of cross-references within the policy graph mitigates failure modes common in LLM-only or RAG-based systems.
- Mechanism: Unlike standard retrieval which fetches text chunks based on similarity, this method explicitly encodes cross-references (e.g., "REFERS_TO" edges) in the policy graph. When a potential violation is found, the system traverses these edges to check for exceptions or modifying provisions in other parts of the regulation.
- Core assumption: Key regulatory logic is often non-local and distributed across multiple articles via cross-references that are lost in chunk-based retrieval.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 1] "Query-centric retrieval often misses the reference chain by focusing on query relevance over inter-chunk relationships."
  - [section 4.2, Figure 3] The ablation study shows a significant performance drop (-9.6 pp micro-F1) when the explicit reference traversal (S4) is disabled.
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is weak or missing for this specific cross-reference traversal mechanism.
- Break condition: The mechanism is less effective if cross-references are implicit or if the graph construction step fails to identify and correctly link them.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Knowledge Graphs (KGs)**
  - Why needed here: This entire method is built on representing both the regulatory policy and the runtime context as Knowledge Graphs. Understanding nodes, edges, entity-relation triples, and graph traversal is non-negotiable.
  - Quick check question: Can you define a 'compliance unit' (CU) as it is represented as a node in the Policy Graph?

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: This work is positioned as a significant improvement over standard RAG for regulatory tasks. You must understand the baseline (retrieving text chunks for an LLM) to appreciate why graph-based retrieval and alignment are proposed as solutions to its failures (e.g., broken logic).
  - Quick check question: According to the paper, what are the three main failure modes of RAG pipelines in the context of regulatory reasoning?

- **Concept: Defeasible Logic in Law**
  - Why needed here: The system's "reference closure" and exception handling step is an implementation of defeasible logic, where a general rule can be overturned by a more specific one. This is a core concept in legal reasoning.
  - Quick check question: How does the system's "Compliance Gate" handle a judgment that is initially deemed NON_COMPLIANT?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Policy Graph Constructor (offline) -> Context Graph Constructor (runtime) -> Compliance Gate (runtime) -> Judge LLM -> Final Decision

- **Critical path**: Context Text -> Context Graph Construction -> Anchor Extraction -> Candidate CU Retrieval -> Cross-Encoder Re-ranking -> LLM Judgment (with Reference Closure/Exception Handling) -> Final Decision. The most critical steps for accuracy are the **Anchor Extraction/Alignment** and the **Reference Closure/Exception Handling**.

- **Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades off implementation complexity for increased accuracy and verifiability. It introduces a heavy offline graph construction step and multiple online LLM calls (judgment, exceptions), increasing cost and latency compared to a single LLM call or basic RAG.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Missed Violations (Low Recall):** Likely a failure in the Context Graph construction or anchor retrieval. Check if key entities from the scenario were correctly extracted and mapped to policy hypernyms.
  - **Over-Prediction (High FPR):** May indicate a failure in the Reference Closure mechanism. Verify that cross-references were correctly identified in the Policy Graph and that the "exception LLM" is functioning as intended.
  - **Logic Breaks:** If the system fails to follow a complex decision tree, check the policy graph construction to see if the decision logic was correctly captured as CUs and cross-references.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Reproduce Baseline Comparisons:** Replicate the main experiment comparing GraphCompliance against a Raw LLM and a standard RAG baseline on the provided GCS-300 benchmark samples to validate the performance claims.
  2. **Ablate the Compliance Gate:** Run the framework with the Compliance Gate's reference traversal disabled (variant S4 from the paper) to measure its direct impact on performance, especially for regulations with heavy cross-referencing.
  3. **Test Graph Fidelity:** Manually inspect a small set of constructed Policy and Context graphs. The paper's "cycle-consistency test" (Section 4.3) provides a protocol; try this on new text to see if information is preserved or hallucinated during graph construction.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the GraphCompliance schema generalize effectively to regulatory domains outside of data privacy, such as finance or healthcare?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion identifies "extending the framework to broader regulatory domains such as finance and healthcare" as a primary direction to validate the framework's policy-agnostic design.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were strictly limited to the GDPR (privacy), leaving the transferability of the Compliance Unit schema and alignment mechanisms to regulations with different structural properties unproven.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results (Micro-F1, Recall) on a benchmark constructed from financial (e.g., Basel norms) or healthcare (e.g., HIPAA) regulations showing comparable performance to the GDPR baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the initial graph construction phase be further automated to prevent error propagation from affecting the final LLM judgment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "the quality of initial graph extraction directly impacts the final judgment" and explicitly propose enhancing "the automation and robustness of graph construction."
- Why unresolved: The current fidelity tests (RQ3) rely on LLM-based extraction, and noise injection tests show semantic similarity drops significantly (to ~0.82) with 10% noise, suggesting the pipeline is sensitive to construction errors.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing judgment accuracy using graphs generated by an improved, robust extraction mechanism versus the current LLM-based method, specifically measuring the reduction in error cascades.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the framework scale to handle multi-jurisdictional compliance by aligning multiple policy graphs against a single context?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The introduction notes that platforms "operate across jurisdictions," but the evaluation section states the authors "leave cross-regulation evaluations to future work" despite the framework being policy-agnostic by design.
- Why unresolved: The current methodology aligns one Policy Graph with one Context Graph; it is unclear if the Compliance Gate can reason over conflicts or distinct requirements across overlapping regulatory graphs (e.g., GDPR vs. CCPA).
- What evidence would resolve it: A benchmark requiring simultaneous compliance checks against two distinct regulatory corpora, measuring the system's ability to correctly identify conflicts or dual violations in a unified pass.

## Limitations
- The framework's performance depends heavily on the quality of graph construction, which relies on LLM prompts that are not publicly available
- Limited evaluation to GDPR regulation, leaving generalizability to other regulatory domains unproven
- Lack of public benchmark data (GCS-300) restricts independent validation of claims

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core hypothesis that structured graph representations improve compliance reasoning over unstructured text retrieval is well-supported by the ablation study and performance gains (4.1-7.2 pp micro-F1 improvement). The mechanism of using deterministic graph traversal to offload structural logic from the LLM is clearly articulated and validated.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific impact of the "Compliance Gate" alignment mechanism on recall and false positive rates is inferred from results but lacks direct ablation evidence. The effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of graph construction, which is not fully transparent.
- **Low Confidence**: The performance claims are based on a single semi-synthetic benchmark (GCS-300) derived from GDPR, which may not generalize to other regulatory domains or real-world scenarios with more ambiguity.

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt Fidelity Test:** Reconstruct the policy graph using publicly available GDPR text and the paper's described methodology (without the original prompts). Compare the graph structure and cross-reference density to assess potential information loss during reconstruction.
2. **Cross-Regulation Transfer:** Apply the framework to a different regulatory text (e.g., CCPA or HIPAA) to test generalizability beyond GDPR. Measure performance drop and identify failure modes.
3. **Error Case Analysis:** For a subset of GCS-300 scenarios, manually trace the decision path through the graph construction, alignment, and judgment steps to identify specific points of failure (e.g., missed cross-references, incorrect hypernym mapping, or LLM misjudgment).
