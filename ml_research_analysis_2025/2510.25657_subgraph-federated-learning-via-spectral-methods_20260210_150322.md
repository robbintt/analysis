# Subgraph Federated Learning via Spectral Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25657
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25657
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: FEDLAP+ achieves competitive accuracy with strong privacy guarantees and low communication cost in federated graph learning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FEDLAP, a subgraph federated learning framework that uses Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to exploit global graph structure while preserving privacy. The method avoids sharing sensitive node embeddings by integrating structural information via a regularized loss term, eliminating the need for costly global matrix computations. FEDLAP+ further reduces communication overhead and enhances scalability through spectral truncation and a decentralized Arnoldi iteration for efficient eigen-decomposition.

## Method Summary
The framework operates in two phases: an offline phase where clients collaboratively compute global Laplacian eigenvectors using decentralized Arnoldi iteration with homomorphic encryption, and an online phase where standard federated averaging trains local models with a spectral Laplacian regularizer. The method captures global structural dependencies without exchanging sensitive node embeddings by adding a regularization term that acts as a low-pass filter in the spectral domain, preserving global community structure while attenuating local noise.

## Key Results
- FEDLAP+ achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing methods across six datasets
- The framework provides formal privacy guarantees protecting intra-client connections under strong attacker models
- Spectral truncation and decentralized computation reduce communication overhead while maintaining model utility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spectral Domain Regularization (Laplacian Smoothing)
By regularizing the loss function using the graph Laplacian in the spectral domain, the framework captures global structural dependencies without exchanging sensitive node embeddings. The regularization term minimizes the variance of embeddings between connected nodes, acting as a low-pass filter that attenuates high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency components representing global community structure.

### Mechanism 2: Dimensionality Reduction via Spectral Truncation
Retaining only the top r eigenvectors substantially reduces communication costs and enhances privacy while maintaining model utility. This exploits the property that graph structure is often low-rank, meaning a few smooth eigenvectors are sufficient to approximate the global topology.

### Mechanism 3: Decentralized Eigen-decomposition via Arnoldi Iteration
The decentralized Arnoldi iteration allows clients to collaboratively compute global Laplacian eigenvectors without any client or server observing the raw global adjacency matrix. Clients compute local contributions and aggregate them using homomorphic encryption, ensuring the server only sees aggregate sums, not individual client edges.

## Foundational Learning

- **Graph Laplacian & Spectral Graph Theory:** Understanding the graph as a signal processing domain where Laplacian eigenvectors represent frequencies is fundamental to the entire architecture.
  - Quick check: Why does the smallest non-zero eigenvalue correspond to the "bottleneck" of the graph?

- **Krylov Subspace Methods (Arnoldi Iteration):** Standard eigen-decomposition is O(n³), making Arnoldi's O(nr²) efficiency critical for large graphs.
  - Quick check: How does Arnoldi approximate eigenvalues using only matrix-vector multiplications?

- **Secure Aggregation & Homomorphic Encryption:** The privacy of the offline phase relies on the server summing encrypted vectors without decryption.
  - Quick check: Why does receiving the sum of neighbors' vectors prevent a client from inferring specific edges?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Offline Phase (Arnoldi with HE) -> Client (local features + spectral rows) -> Online Phase (FL training) -> Server (aggregate updates)
- **Critical path:** 1) Partition graph and distribute inter-connection knowledge, 2) Run decentralized Arnoldi with HE to establish U, 3) Server sends U rows to clients, 4) Clients run local SGD with combined loss, 5) Clients send gradients to server for aggregation
- **Design tradeoffs:** Lower truncation rank r improves privacy but risks underfitting; higher r increases fidelity but communication cost and potential privacy leakage
- **Failure signatures:** Poor performance on heterophilic graphs, convergence stagnation if Arnoldi residual remains high, privacy leaks if P+R > 1
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Validate baseline performance on Cora/Citeseer with varying r, 2) Simulate worst-case attack to confirm P+R ≤ 1, 3) Compare runtime of decentralized vs centralized eigen-decomposition on large sparse graphs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the FEDLAP framework be effectively adapted for federated link prediction or edge-level inference tasks without compromising privacy? The authors state the framework is applicable to any local graph-based task, but experimental validation is restricted to node classification.

### Open Question 2
How does the strictness of the privacy guarantee vary when the graph deviates from the assumed Bernoulli random model to one with distinct community structure? The privacy analysis assumes Bernoulli model for simplicity, which may not reflect realistic clustered graphs.

### Open Question 3
How can FEDLAP be modified to improve performance on highly heterophilic graphs without relying solely on spectral truncation? The results show significant degradation on heterophilic graphs, suggesting the need for explicit heterophily handling.

## Limitations

- Performance significantly degrades on heterophilic graphs where the low-pass filtering assumption conflicts with neighbor dissimilarity
- Privacy guarantees depend critically on parameter tuning (r and p maintaining P+R ≤ 1) which varies per dataset
- Implementation requires complex homomorphic encryption and HOP2VEC structure feature generation not fully specified

## Confidence

- **Medium** for core algorithmic claims due to asymptotic approximations in privacy analysis
- **Low** regarding exact implementation details of homomorphic encryption and HOP2VEC
- **Medium** for practical privacy guarantees requiring careful parameter tuning per dataset

## Next Checks

1. Systematically vary r and p to empirically verify theoretical bound P+R ≤ 1 across all datasets, measuring actual edge reconstruction success rates

2. Design controlled experiments comparing FEDLAP+ against spatial smoothing baselines on graphs with varying homophily ratios to quantify performance gaps

3. Measure wall-clock time and communication cost scaling of decentralized Arnoldi versus centralized eigen-decomposition on graphs with n > 100k nodes to validate claimed efficiency improvements
