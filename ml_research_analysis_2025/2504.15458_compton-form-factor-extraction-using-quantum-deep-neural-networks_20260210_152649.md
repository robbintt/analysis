# Compton Form Factor Extraction using Quantum Deep Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.15458
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15458
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Quantum-inspired deep neural networks (QDNNs) outperform classical deep neural networks (CDNNs) for Compton form factor extraction from DVCS data

## Executive Summary
This work introduces quantum-inspired deep neural networks (QDNNs) as a novel approach for extracting Compton form factors (CFFs) from deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) measurements at Jefferson Lab. The authors demonstrate that QDNNs achieve higher predictive accuracy and tighter uncertainties compared to classical deep neural networks (CDNNs) when analyzing both pseudodata and experimental cross sections. A key innovation is the development of a "quantum qualifier" metric that can predict a priori which neural network architecture (QDNN or CDNN) will perform better for a given experimental fit based on nonlinearity and error characteristics.

The results show that QDNNs are not only more accurate but also more efficient for CFF determination, with substantially reduced uncertainties in experimental extractions compared to previous global analyses. The authors position QDNNs as a complementary tool to CDNNs for future multidimensional studies of parton distributions and hadronic structure, potentially enabling more precise investigations of fundamental nuclear physics.

## Method Summary
The authors employ quantum-inspired deep neural networks (QDNNs) to extract Compton form factors from DVCS measurements. They benchmark these quantum-inspired networks against classical deep neural networks (CDNNs) using both pseudodata and experimental cross sections from Jefferson Lab. The methodology includes developing a novel "quantum qualifier" metric that predicts when QDNNs or CDNNs will be optimal for a given experimental fit based on the data's nonlinearity and error characteristics. This qualifier-guided approach is then applied to experimental data, with performance measured in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification for the extracted CFFs.

## Key Results
- QDNNs achieve higher predictive accuracy and tighter uncertainties than CDNNs at comparable model complexity
- The quantum qualifier metric successfully predicts optimal network architecture choice for experimental fits
- Application to experimental cross sections yields substantially reduced uncertainties on CFFs compared to previous global analyses
- QDNNs demonstrate efficiency advantages for CFF determination and multidimensional studies of parton distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The quantum-inspired architecture leverages principles from quantum information theory to create neural network structures that can more effectively capture complex, non-linear relationships in the DVCS data. The quantum qualifier metric works by analyzing the inherent characteristics of the experimental data—specifically its nonlinearity and error patterns—to determine which network architecture will best model the underlying physics. This adaptive approach allows the methodology to select the most appropriate tool for each specific extraction problem rather than using a one-size-fits-all solution.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS)**: A process where a virtual photon scatters off a proton and produces a real photon, providing access to generalized parton distributions. *Why needed*: Forms the experimental basis for CFF extraction. *Quick check*: Understanding that DVCS provides 3D imaging of the nucleon's internal structure.

2. **Compton Form Factors (CFFs)**: Theoretical quantities that encode information about the proton's structure in DVCS processes. *Why needed*: The primary physical observables being extracted from experimental data. *Quick check*: Recognizing CFFs as generalized parton distributions that depend on momentum transfer variables.

3. **Quantum-Inspired Neural Networks**: Neural network architectures that incorporate principles from quantum mechanics and quantum information theory. *Why needed*: The core innovation enabling improved CFF extraction performance. *Quick check*: Understanding these are classical algorithms inspired by quantum computation, not actual quantum computers.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input data (DVCS cross sections) → Quantum Qualifier metric → Architecture selector (QDNN vs CDNN) → Trained neural network → CFF extraction with uncertainty quantification

**Critical Path**: The quantum qualifier analysis must complete before network training begins, as it determines which architecture will be used. The qualifier's accuracy in predicting optimal architecture directly impacts final CFF extraction quality.

**Design Tradeoffs**: QDNNs offer better accuracy and uncertainty quantification but may require more computational resources during training. CDNNs are simpler and faster to train but may yield less precise results for highly non-linear data. The qualifier metric adds overhead but can prevent wasted computation on suboptimal architectures.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor qualifier performance (incorrect architecture selection), overfitting in either network type, systematic biases in CFF extraction, or failure to properly quantify uncertainties. The system should flag when qualifier predictions don't match actual performance.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test qualifier accuracy on a validation dataset with known ground truth, 2) Compare training convergence rates between QDNN and CDNN for varying data complexity, 3) Analyze uncertainty quantification by comparing extracted CFF error bars with known systematic uncertainties.
