# An Interpretable Recommendation Model for Psychometric Data, With an Application to Gerontological Primary Care

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.19824
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19824
- Reference count: 40
- This work introduces an interpretable recommendation model for psychometric data to support gerontological primary care.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the Polygrid model, a recommendation system designed specifically for psychometric assessment data in gerontological primary care. The model transforms psychometric scores into a geometric representation where the ordering of individuals on a latent variable is preserved by the area of a polygon. This geometric mapping enables both accurate prediction of care recommendations and visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals.

The system was evaluated on three healthcare datasets using both offline performance metrics and a user study. Results showed competitive performance compared to traditional models, with the model dominating on multiclass datasets and showing mixed results on multilabel datasets. The user study demonstrated that the Polygrid diagram achieved approximately 0.9 accuracy in classification tasks, with participants completing tasks faster and with greater consensus compared to bar chart alternatives.

## Method Summary
The Polygrid model performs multilabel classification and label ranking tasks by mapping patient assessments to personalized care plans with visual explanations. The approach transforms psychometric scores into vertices on a unit disc using scalar multiples of roots of unity, where the polygon area serves as a proxy for the latent capacity. The model partitions the unit disc into annular sectors as a fixed "kernel-like" feature extractor, computing intersection areas between the patient's polygon and each cell. A linear solver (Ridge or LSTSQ) learns weights to map these features to predicted labels. The visual explanation diagram displays the weighted inner product, allowing users to simulate the model's decision process through shape and color matching.

## Key Results
- The Polygrid model showed competitive performance on healthcare datasets compared to traditional models
- The model dominated on multiclass datasets while showing mixed results on multilabel datasets
- User study demonstrated ~0.9 accuracy with faster completion times compared to bar chart alternatives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The model transforms psychometric scores into a geometric representation where the ordering of individuals on a latent variable (the measurand) is preserved by the area of a polygon.
- **Mechanism:** Assessment scores are mapped to vertices on a unit disc (via scalar multiples of roots of unity). The polygon area serves as a proxy for the "sum-score" or latent capacity.
- **Core assumption:** The psychometric instrument fits a **congeneric factor model** (items correlate positively with a single latent variable) and measurement error is negligible for ordering purposes.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.5.3]: Demonstrates the monotonic relationship between sum-scores and polygon area under assumptions A1–A5.
  - [Section 2.2]: Defines the congeneric model required for this geometric equivalence.
  - [corpus]: Weak. Corpus neighbors focus on general interpretable prediction (e.g., DynaGraph) but do not address this specific polygon-to-latent-variable mapping.
- **Break condition:** If the input data violates the unidimensionality assumption (e.g., items correlate negatively or are multidimensional), the polygon area may no longer correspond to the latent variable, breaking the ordering logic.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The partition of the unit disc into annular sectors acts as a non-adaptive "kernel-like" feature extractor, capturing local score interactions without learning the grid boundaries.
- **Mechanism:** The disc is divided into cells $\Omega$. The feature vector for a patient is constructed by calculating the area of the patient's polygon that intersects with each cell (Algorithm 4). This transforms the input into a higher-dimensional space $S$ where linear relationships are more likely.
- **Core assumption:** The geometric position of scores relative to the center and axes carries predictive information that a simple linear combination of raw scores might miss.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.4]: Explicitly compares the `uh-to-ud` mapping to a kernel method $\Phi(X)$.
  - [Section 5.3.2]: Notes that performance drops when the fixed grid fails to capture complex boundaries that adaptive methods (like Decision Trees) might find.
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct corpus support for this specific fixed-grid spatial kernel in healthcare.
- **Break condition:** If the decision boundaries are highly irregular or do not align with the radial/angular symmetry of the partition, the model may underperform compared to adaptive partitioning (e.g., Decision Trees).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Interpretability is achieved because the visual explanation (the Polygrid diagram) is isomorphic to the model's forward computational graph (FCG).
- **Mechanism:** The "matching chart" visually displays the weighted inner product. The colors in the background represent weights $W$, and the overlaid polygon represents the features $S$. The user simulates the model by visually matching shapes and colors rather than calculating numbers.
- **Core assumption:** Users can intuitively estimate "area" and "shape similarity" better than they can process numerical weights.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 6.3]: User study shows ~0.9 accuracy and faster completion times compared to bar charts, supporting the "shape-matching" hypothesis.
  - [Section 4.5.2]: Defines fidelity as the ability to extract the FCG from the explanation.
  - [corpus]: Moderate. *DynaGraph* (neighbor) similarly uses graph structures for interpretable prediction, supporting the trend toward structural transparency, though via different mechanics.
- **Break condition:** If the model complexity (number of annuli/sectors) grows too large, the visual noise may overwhelm the user's cognitive capacity, degrading interpretability despite theoretical fidelity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Congeneric Factor Analysis**
  - **Why needed here:** The validity of the core geometric projection relies entirely on the data satisfying a congeneric model (one latent variable causing variance in all observed domains). Without this, the polygon area is geometrically meaningless.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the instrument have a single, unidimensional latent construct (e.g., "Quality of Life"), and do all domain scores correlate positively with it?

- **Concept: Radar Charts (Kiviat Diagrams)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the visual language of the model. Understanding how multivariate data is encoded as a polygon is prerequisite to understanding the input representation.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you identify when two radar chart polygons are "similar" based on shape rather than just size?

- **Concept: Multilabel vs. Label Ranking**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper adapts the algorithm for both tasks. Multilabel uses binary relevance; Ranking uses fuzzy membership.
  - **Quick check question:** Is the goal to select a set of items (Multilabel) or to order items by preference (Ranking)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (scaled scores $X$) -> Projection (Algorithm 1: $X \to Z$ polygons) -> Partition (Algorithm 3: annular sectors) -> Feature Extraction (Algorithm 4: intersection areas $S$) -> Solver (Algorithm 5: weights $W$ via Ridge/LSTSQ) -> Output (prediction + Polygrid diagram)

- **Critical path:** The **Projection and Feature Extraction** steps. The transformation of raw scores into "intersection areas" is the non-standard logic that differentiates this from standard linear regression. If the geometric intersection logic (using libraries like `shapely` or similar) is implemented incorrectly, the feature vector $S$ will be wrong.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Partition Granularity ($n_a, n_s$):** Higher granularity acts as a larger "kernel," potentially fitting better but risking overfitting and visual clutter (interpretability loss).
  - **Sector/Annulus Type:** `s-invariant` (equal area) vs. `r-invariant` (equal width). The paper shows `r-invariant` often performed better (Table 6), likely capturing size thresholds better.
  - **Solver:** `Ridge` (with intercept) generally outperformed `LSTSQ` on multiclass tasks because it captures "size" offsets (e.g., sum-score $\ge$ cutoff).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Label Ranking Degradation:** Performance drops significantly in Ranking tasks compared to Classification (Section 5.3.3). This is linked to the fuzzy membership conversion in Algorithm 5/Equation 6, which may introduce noise.
  - **Unidimensionality Violation:** If the psychometric data doesn't fit a single latent variable (e.g., the AMPI-AB dataset), the area-score mechanism violates the sum-score ordering (Section B.4), leading to unpredictable behavior.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce the Iris Baseline:** Train Polygrid on the Iris dataset (as done in the user study) to verify the visual output matches the paper's figures (Figure 13).
  2. **Hyperparameter Sweep:** Run the evaluation on the WHOQOL dataset varying `n_annuli` (1 to 8) and `solver` (LSTSQ vs. Ridge) to replicate the dominance of Ridge in multiclass tasks (Table 6).
  3. **Sanity Check:** Test the monotonic relationship (Appendix B). Plot sum-scores vs. area-scores for the dataset to verify the geometric assumption holds before training the full model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can an adaptive feature extractor that learns disc partition boundaries improve Polygrid's predictive performance without sacrificing the model's interpretability?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5.3.2 and Section 7 suggest an "adaptive version of the Polygrid’s feature extractor" as a promising candidate to address performance gaps with Decision Trees.
- **Why unresolved:** The current model relies on fixed geometric partitions (annuli and sectors) determined by hyperparameters, whereas top-performing models learn boundaries based on data variance.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified Polygrid implementation that dynamically adjusts boundaries based on assignment data, evaluated on `elsio1` and `ampiab` datasets while maintaining interpretability scores.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does refining the method for converting label rankings to membership matrices reduce the performance gap between classification and ranking tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5.3.3 and Section 7 identify the conversion function (Equation 6) used to generate the membership matrix $U$ as a likely cause for the model's poor performance on label ranking datasets.
- **Why unresolved:** The current conversion maps ranks to arbitrary fuzzy membership values, which appears to introduce a large increase in false negatives compared to multilabel classification.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical evaluation of Polygrid on label ranking datasets (e.g., `whoqol-lr-22`) using an alternative mapping function that yields higher Kendall’s tau and lower false negative rates.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the Polygrid diagram interpretable and effective for care professionals using real-world, high-dimensional gerontological data?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6.4 and Section 7 highlight that the user study relied on the Iris dataset with non-experts and note uncertainty regarding generalization to complex diagrams or clinical settings.
- **Why unresolved:** The study avoided healthcare datasets due to severe class imbalance and abstraction issues, leaving the model's efficacy for real clinical decision-making unverified.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A user study involving geriatricians or care professionals assessing real patient cases with real referrals (e.g., WHO ICOPE data), measuring accuracy, completion time, and consensus.

## Limitations

- The model's performance heavily depends on the psychometric instrument satisfying a congeneric factor model assumption, which may not hold for many real-world assessment tools.
- The fixed geometric partition may underperform compared to adaptive methods when decision boundaries are highly irregular or don't align with radial/angular symmetry.
- The effectiveness of the visual explanation for care professionals using real clinical data remains unverified, as the user study used simplified Iris dataset with non-experts.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The geometric mapping mechanism and visual explanation fidelity are well-supported by mathematical proofs and user study results.
- **Medium Confidence:** The partition-based feature extraction shows competitive performance but lacks strong comparative analysis against adaptive methods beyond Decision Trees.
- **Low Confidence:** The generalizability of the model across diverse psychometric instruments remains unclear due to limited testing on datasets with known multidimensional structures.

## Next Checks

1. **Unidimensionality Verification:** Before applying Polygrid to any new psychometric dataset, explicitly test whether the congeneric factor model assumption holds using confirmatory factor analysis or similar psychometric validation techniques.

2. **Grid Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct systematic experiments varying grid granularity (annuli/sectors) across multiple datasets to determine optimal configurations and identify when the fixed partition becomes a limiting factor compared to adaptive methods.

3. **Interpretability Scalability Test:** Evaluate the model's visual explanation effectiveness with increasing dimensionality and complexity, measuring whether user accuracy and speed degrade as the number of grid cells grows beyond what was tested in the user study.
