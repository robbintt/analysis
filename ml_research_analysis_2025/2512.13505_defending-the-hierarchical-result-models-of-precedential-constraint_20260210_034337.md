# Defending the Hierarchical Result Models of Precedential Constraint

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.13505
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13505
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Key outcome:** The paper defends dimension-based hierarchical result models against criticisms that they incorrectly handle cases where intermediate factors have varying strengths, showing that when reformulated using dimensions, the model correctly distinguishes cases based on the strength of evidence.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses criticisms by Trevor Bench-Capon regarding hierarchical result models for modeling precedential constraint in legal reasoning. The authors argue that Bench-Capon's examples implicitly treat intermediate factors as dimensions with ordered values rather than binary factors. By reformulating these examples using van Woerkom's dimension-based hierarchical result model (DHRM), the paper demonstrates that the model can correctly handle cases where intermediate factors are established with different strengths by different base-level factors. The analysis focuses on two family law examples (MaxMonday and EmmaMonday) to show how the DHRM distinguishes cases based on varying strengths of intermediate factors without violating precedential constraint, while the original hierarchical result model cannot.

## Method Summary
The paper defends the hierarchical result models by showing that criticisms from Bench-Capon arise from implicitly treating intermediate factors as dimensions. The authors analyze two specific examples (MaxMonday and EmmaMonday) using formal definitions of both factor-based and dimension-based hierarchical result models. They demonstrate that when these examples are reformulated using dimensions with ordered values, the dimension-based model correctly handles cases where intermediate factors have varying strengths. The analysis involves implementing the recursive constraint algorithms defined in Definitions 2.3 and 4.3, comparing the behavior of factor-based and dimension-based models on the same test cases, and showing that the dimension-based approach produces the intuitively correct results.

## Key Results
- The dimension-based hierarchical result model (DHRM) correctly distinguishes MaxMonday from EmmaMonday based on varying strengths of intermediate factors
- When intermediate factors are treated as dimensions with ordered values, the model properly handles cases where different base-level facts establish the same intermediate concept with different strengths
- The factor-based hierarchical result model (HRM) incorrectly forces decisions in cases where intermediate factors have asymmetric strengths
- The paper demonstrates that omitting intermediate factors from case descriptions can preserve flexibility in precedential reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Reinterpreting binary intermediate factors as dimensions (ordered values) allows the model to capture varying strengths of establishment, which resolves the "incorrect outcome" criticisms.
- **Mechanism:** The model replaces the binary truth assignment of factors ($t/f$) with a partial order of values ($\preceq$) on a dimension. This allows a base-level fact (e.g., "interrupted teacher") to set a value on an intermediate dimension (e.g., "bad behavior") that is stronger or weaker than other facts (e.g., "inattentive"). Constraint is then computed based on these ordered values rather than mere presence/absence.
- **Core assumption:** The semantic difference between base-level facts and intermediate concepts can be consistently mapped to a quantitative or ordinal scale.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "We argue that in some examples Bench-Capon seems to interpret intermediate factors as dimensions, and that applying van Woerkom's dimension-based version... avoids Bench-Capon's criticisms." [section 5] "For present purposes, all we need to represent is that R is satisfied more strongly in MaxMonday than in EmmaMonday... M |= 3 <= E(R)... iff [conditions on subordinates]... 1 <= 0 (as values in F6)... does not hold."
- **Break condition:** If the domain does not permit the assignment of ordered values to intermediate concepts (i.e., they remain genuinely binary), this mechanism fails to apply.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Hierarchical constraint propagates "a fortiori" conditions recursively, ensuring that a decision is forced only if the current case is at least as strong as the precedent on all relevant branches of the hierarchy.
- **Mechanism:** The model (DHRM) recursively checks if a new fact situation $X$ falls within the "lower bound" set by a precedent $Y$. For an abstract dimension (e.g., outcome $\pi$), $X$ is constrained if it meets the lower bounds of all subordinate dimensions (e.g., $Q$ and $R$). If $X$ is "weaker" on any necessary subordinate, the constraint chain breaks.
- **Core assumption:** The "strength" of a case is compositional; the strength of the whole depends strictly on the strength of its parts as defined by the hierarchy.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4, Def 4.3] "The idea of the recursive clause is that there is a precedent Y which forces X to take a value v which is at least Y(d)... CB |= Y(e) <= X(e) holds for all e in H(d)." [section 5] "To have M |= 1 <= E(pi)... we must... have 1. M |= 2 <= E(Q); and 2. M |= 3 <= E(R)."
- **Break condition:** If the hierarchy contains "trade-offs" where weakness in one branch can be compensated by exceptional strength in another (not just meeting a bound), this strict recursive logic may be too rigid.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Excluding intermediate factors from the explicit case description forces the model to resolve constraints using only base-level comparisons, preserving flexibility when intermediate concepts are ambiguous.
- **Mechanism:** If a case is recorded without specifying the value of an intermediate dimension (e.g., $P$ or $Q$), the constraint definition (Def 2.3/4.3) cannot recurse through that intermediate node. It defaults to checking the base-level factors directly. This prevents the "accidental" creation of unintended constraints based on assumed intermediate states.
- **Core assumption:** The absence of a value implies the value was not determined or relevant, rather than being false/zero.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.1] "Jo's thinking in terms of MMH can be modelled by including the intermediate factors... while her thinking in terms of MMF can be modelled by omitting the intermediate factors." [section 3.2] "Let Emma on Monday be represented as... undefined on the abstract factors {P, Q, R, pi}. Then, we have that Emma is not forced for pi by the HRM."
- **Break condition:** If the system forces cases to be "complete" (defined on all dimensions) before storage, this flexibility is lost.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Factors vs. Dimensions**
  - **Why needed here:** The core resolution of the paper depends on upgrading "Factors" (binary yes/no) to "Dimensions" (ordered scales).
  - **Quick check question:** If "being late" is a factor, is being 5 minutes late different from being 5 hours late in your model?

- **Concept: Precedential Constraint (A Fortiori Reasoning)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper defends a specific logic of constraint where a new case is forced if it is "at least as strong" (a fortiori) as a precedent.
  - **Quick check question:** If a plaintiff won with 10 units of evidence, must they win with 12 units?

- **Concept: Abstract Hierarchy**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper models legal reasoning as a tree where base facts (leaves) satisfy intermediate concepts (nodes), which satisfy the final outcome (root).
  - **Quick check question:** Can a change in a leaf node (e.g., "folded clothes") change the state of the root node without explicitly updating the intermediate node ("behaved at home")?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - **Knowledge Base:** Stores the *Dimension Hierarchy* (structure) and the *Case Base* (stored instances)
  - **Input:** Partial Fact Situation (new case to decide)
  - **Engine:** The "Forcing" algorithm (Def 2.3 / 4.3) which recursively traverses the hierarchy to compare Input against Case Base
  - **Output:** A binary constraint decision (Forced for $\pi$, Forced for $\delta$, or Not Forced)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define the Hierarchy (specifically the partial order $\preceq$ for dimensions)
  2. Ingest cases (ensure completeness or handle partiality)
  3. Implement the recursive lower/upper bound check (Def 4.3)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Factor-based vs. Dimension-based:** Factors are simpler to implement (set comparisons) but fail on "strength" nuances (Bench-Capon's critique). Dimensions require defining scales and orders but handle nuanced comparisons correctly.
  - **Explicit vs. Implicit Intermediates:** Storing intermediate factors in the case base makes reasoning transparent but brittle (requires the judge to explicitly define them). Omitting them makes reasoning robust but less explainable.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **The "EmmaMonday" Failure:** The system incorrectly forces a decision because it treats "inattentive" (weakly bad) and "interrupting" (strongly bad) as equivalent binary factors ($1=1$).
  - **The "Hidden Intermediate" Failure:** The system fails to distinguish a case because it relies on an intermediate classification that isn't explicitly stored in the precedent.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce the Ice Cream Example:** Implement the hierarchy in Figure 1. Encode MaxMonday and EmmaMonday as dimension-based cases to verify that $M$ does *not* force a decision for $E$.
  2. **The "Undefined Intermediate" Test:** Run the factor-based model (HRM) on the EmmaMonday case where intermediates are *undefined*. Verify that the constraint is broken (result is Not Forced), confirming the paper's defense regarding omission.
  3. **Trade-off Boundary Test:** Create a case where the plaintiff is "stronger" on one branch of the hierarchy but "weaker" on another (e.g., $Q$ increases but $R$ decreases relative to precedent) to verify the system correctly identifies the lack of constraint (non-comparability).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The analysis is limited to specific examples rather than comprehensive case coverage, with medium confidence that all precedential constraint challenges are resolved
- The model assumes a strict compositional strength relationship that may not capture all legal reasoning patterns, particularly where trade-offs between different factors are possible
- The approach relies on predefined dimensional hierarchies which could struggle with genuinely ambiguous intermediate factors or non-linear strength relationships
- No empirical validation is provided that judges actually reason with ordered scales as assumed by the dimensional approach

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The core claim that dimension-based models resolve Bench-Capon's specific criticisms has strong formal proof support
- **Medium confidence:** The broader claim that this resolves all precedential constraint challenges is supported but limited to specific examples
- **Low confidence:** The assumption that legal domains consistently support the required dimensional ordering lacks empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Testing:** Apply the DHRM to legal domains beyond family law (e.g., contract interpretation or tort law) to verify the dimensional ordering assumption holds across different types of legal reasoning.

2. **Edge Case Analysis:** Test cases where intermediate factors have conflicting strengths across different branches of the hierarchy to verify the model handles non-comparable situations appropriately.

3. **Implementation Verification:** Build a working implementation of the recursive constraint algorithm and run it against both the paper's examples and novel test cases to verify the theoretical claims produce correct practical results.
