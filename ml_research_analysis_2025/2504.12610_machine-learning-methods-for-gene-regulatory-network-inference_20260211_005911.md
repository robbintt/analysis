## Executive Summary
This review comprehensively surveys machine learning methods for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference, with particular emphasis on deep learning approaches. The paper categorizes methods into supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and contrastive learning paradigms, providing detailed overviews of 23 representative algorithms. It highlights recent advances in transformer-based models like GRNFormer and DeepMCL that leverage single-cell multi-omics data for improved accuracy, while addressing key challenges such as data integration, lack of ground-truth networks, and dynamic network inference.

## Method Summary
The review systematically analyzes machine learning approaches for GRN inference by organizing methods according to their learning paradigms. It examines traditional methods including correlation-based, information-theoretic, and regression-based approaches before focusing extensively on deep learning methods. The paper provides detailed descriptions of 23 representative algorithms, with particular attention to transformer-based architectures like GRNFormer and DeepMCL that utilize single-cell multi-omics data. Performance metrics such as AUROC and AUPRC are discussed throughout, with the review emphasizing the need for specialized deep learning architectures to handle the complexity of GRN inference across diverse biological contexts.

## Key Results
- The review categorizes 23 representative GRN inference methods into supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and contrastive learning paradigms
- Transformer-based models like GRNFormer achieve high performance metrics (0.89 AUPRC for non-specific networks)
- The paper identifies key challenges including data integration, lack of ground-truth GRNs, and dynamic network inference
- Future directions proposed include foundation models and large language models for automated GRN discovery

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of machine learning methods for GRN inference stems from their ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships between transcription factors and target genes that traditional methods cannot detect. Deep learning approaches, particularly transformer architectures, can leverage attention mechanisms to identify long-range regulatory relationships and integrate multi-modal single-cell data effectively. The hierarchical feature learning in deep networks allows for the extraction of meaningful regulatory patterns from high-dimensional biological data, while contrastive learning methods can learn robust representations without requiring labeled ground-truth networks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Single-cell RNA-seq analysis**: Understanding cell-to-cell variability in gene expression is crucial for GRN inference as it provides high-resolution temporal and spatial information about regulatory dynamics
- **Multi-omics integration**: Combining different molecular data types (RNA, DNA accessibility, protein) provides complementary information about regulatory mechanisms and strengthens inference accuracy
- **Network topology**: Knowledge of network structure and properties helps in evaluating inferred GRNs and understanding biological significance of predicted regulatory relationships
- **Attention mechanisms**: Critical for transformer models to identify which regulatory elements are most important for gene expression control across different cellular contexts
- **Contrastive learning**: Enables representation learning without labeled data by learning to distinguish between positive and negative regulatory pairs

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input data → Feature extraction (CNNs/transformers) → Regulatory relationship scoring → Network construction → Validation

**Critical path**: Data preprocessing → Network architecture training → Regulatory inference → Performance evaluation

**Design tradeoffs**: The paper highlights tradeoffs between model complexity and interpretability, with deep learning methods offering higher accuracy but reduced biological interpretability compared to traditional methods. Another tradeoff exists between computational efficiency and the ability to integrate multi-modal data, with transformer models requiring more resources but capturing richer regulatory patterns.

**Failure signatures**: Methods may fail when training data lacks diversity in cell types or conditions, when regulatory relationships involve indirect effects that are difficult to distinguish from direct interactions, or when data quality issues (batch effects, technical noise) are not properly addressed. Performance degradation typically occurs when models are applied to biological contexts different from their training data.

**First experiments**: 1) Benchmark selected methods on a standardized single-cell RNA-seq dataset with known regulatory relationships; 2) Test model transferability across different cell types or tissues; 3) Evaluate the impact of data quality and preprocessing on inference accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The review identifies several open questions in the field, including how to effectively integrate diverse data types beyond single-cell RNA-seq, how to validate inferred networks without complete ground-truth information, and how to adapt models for dynamic network inference across different cellular states and developmental stages. The paper also questions the scalability of current methods to larger networks and the need for more interpretable deep learning architectures that can provide biological insights beyond prediction accuracy.

## Limitations
- Most performance metrics are based on synthetic or simulated data rather than real biological datasets
- High accuracy claims for transformer models lack validation across diverse biological contexts and cell types
- The emphasis on single-cell multi-omics integration assumes consistent data availability and quality across studies
- Proposed future directions like foundation models remain largely theoretical without empirical validation

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Categorization into supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and contrastive learning paradigms | High |
| Performance claims of specific algorithms (AUROC, AUPRC) | Medium |
| Challenges discussion (data integration, dynamic inference) | High |
| Proposed solutions for identified challenges | Medium |
| Future directions (foundation models, LLMs) | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Re-evaluate the performance of top-performing algorithms (e.g., GRNFormer) on independent, real-world single-cell RNA-seq datasets to confirm reported metrics
2. Conduct systematic comparisons of transformer-based models with traditional GRN inference methods across multiple benchmark datasets to assess generalizability
3. Investigate the feasibility and performance of proposed future directions (e.g., foundation models) on small-scale pilot studies before broader implementation
