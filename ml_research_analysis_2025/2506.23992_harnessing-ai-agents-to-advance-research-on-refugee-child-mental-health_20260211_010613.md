# Harnessing AI Agents to Advance Research on Refugee Child Mental Health

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.23992
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23992
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: DeepSeek R1-7B outperforms Zephyr-7B-beta on hallucination (0.12 vs 0.32) and answer relevance (0.91 vs 0.88) in refugee health data extraction

## Executive Summary
This study introduces an AI-driven framework for extracting and analyzing unstructured refugee health data to support research on child mental health. It compares two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines—Zephyr-7B-beta and DeepSeek R1-7B—using semantic-aware segmentation, domain-specific tuning, and hallucination control. DeepSeek R1-7B demonstrates superior performance with answer relevance of 0.91 versus 0.88 and hallucination rate of 0.12 versus 0.32. The results highlight the importance of structured retrieval and context preservation in sensitive humanitarian domains.

## Method Summary
The study compares two RAG pipelines processing 16 PDF documents (UNHCR reports, NGO publications, medical records, social media) with 50 domain-specific queries. Zephyr uses RecursiveTextSplitter with fixed-size chunking and top-k retrieval, while DeepSeek employs MarkdownHeaderSplitter for semantic-aware segmentation and Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) retrieval. Both use FAISS vector stores but differ in embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 vs nomic-embed-text), context window sizes (4k vs 8k), and LLM backends (HuggingFace vs Ollama). Evaluation uses GPT-4 as judge via Opik framework to score hallucination and answer relevance.

## Key Results
- DeepSeek R1-7B achieves answer relevance of 0.91 versus Zephyr's 0.88
- DeepSeek R1-7B reduces hallucination rate to 0.12 versus Zephyr's 0.32
- Semantic-aware segmentation and MMR retrieval are identified as key factors for performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Semantic-aware document segmentation reduces hallucination rates by preserving contextual boundaries.
- Mechanism: DeepSeek's MarkdownHeaderSplitter respects hierarchical document structure (headings, subheadings), producing chunks that maintain logical coherence rather than arbitrarily splitting at token boundaries. This prevents context fragmentation where critical qualifying information gets separated from claims.
- Core assumption: Refugee health reports contain hierarchical information where psychological assessments, context, and conclusions are structurally organized.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.5.1]: "Text is then segmented using a MarkdownHeaderSplitter, which respects headings, subheadings, and other semantic cues. This strategy produces chunks that better align with logical divisions in the source material."
  - [section 6]: "Semantic-Aware Segmentation - Deepseek's MarkdownHeaderSplitter does honor document structure, producing pieces that better capture contextual meaning."
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers focus on child-LLM interaction patterns rather than document segmentation strategies.
- Break condition: If source documents lack clear structural markers (headings, sections), header-aware splitting provides no advantage over fixed-size chunking.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) retrieval reduces hallucination by providing diverse yet relevant context, preventing echo-chamber reinforcement.
- Mechanism: MMR (λ=0.5, k=2) balances similarity with diversity, retrieving chunks that are both relevant to the query AND non-redundant with each other. This prevents the LLM from over-weighting repetitive information and generating confident but narrowly-sourced claims.
- Core assumption: Humanitarian documents contain redundant information across sections; diversity in retrieval improves comprehensiveness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The results highlight the importance of structured retrieval and context preservation in sensitive humanitarian domains."
  - [section 5.5.4]: "Instead of merely selecting the top-k most similar chunks, MMR blends similarity with diversity, reducing redundancy in the returned segments."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for MMR in humanitarian contexts.
- Break condition: If queries require deep dive into a single specific section (not cross-sectional synthesis), MMR's diversity preference may dilute precision.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Extended context windows (8k vs 4k tokens) reduce hallucination by enabling more complete document context at inference.
- Mechanism: Larger context windows allow more retrieved chunks to be presented to the LLM simultaneously, reducing the probability that critical qualifying or contradicting information is excluded from the generation context.
- Core assumption: Hallucinations arise partially from missing context rather than model parametric errors alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.5.3]: "The larger window means more rich and complete context can be incorporated at inference time."
  - [section 6]: "The increased context window size also reduces hallucination hazards since the LLM can draw upon a wider knowledge base during inference."
  - [corpus]: No corpus papers specifically test context window size effects on hallucination.
- Break condition: If retrieved context contains contradictory or low-quality information, larger windows may increase confusion rather than reduce hallucination.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: Core architecture pattern; understanding that RAG grounds LLM outputs in external documents rather than relying solely on parametric knowledge.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why RAG helps reduce hallucination compared to vanilla LLM prompting?

- Concept: **Semantic Chunking vs. Fixed-Size Chunking**
  - Why needed here: Critical design choice in this paper's results; determines whether document meaning is preserved during segmentation.
  - Quick check question: What information is lost when splitting a document at exactly 500 tokens regardless of content boundaries?

- Concept: **Hallucination in Sensitive Domains**
  - Why needed here: The primary risk being mitigated; hallucination in refugee mental health contexts could lead to harmful policy recommendations.
  - Quick check question: Why is a 0.32 hallucination rate unacceptable in clinical/humanitarian contexts but might pass in general Q&A?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Data Ingestion**: PyMuPDFLoader (Zephyr) vs. DocumentConverter (DeepSeek)
  - **Chunking**: RecursiveTextSplitter 500/50 (Zephyr) vs. MarkdownHeaderSplitter (DeepSeek)
  - **Embedding**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Zephyr) vs. nomic-embed-text (DeepSeek)
  - **Vector Store**: FAISS (both)
  - **Retrieval**: Top-k=3 (Zephyr) vs. MMR k=2, λ=0.5 (DeepSeek)
  - **LLM Backend**: HuggingFace 4k context (Zephyr) vs. Ollama 8k context (DeepSeek)
  - **Evaluation**: GPT-4 as judge via Opik framework

- Critical path: Document → Preprocessing → Chunking → Embedding → Vector Index → Query → Retrieval → Context Assembly → LLM Generation → Evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed chunking (Zephyr): Faster, simpler, lower compute; worse context preservation
  - Semantic chunking (DeepSeek): Better context; requires structured documents, more preprocessing
  - Top-k retrieval: Simpler, deterministic; may return redundant results
  - MMR retrieval: More diverse context; additional computation, may miss deeply relevant but redundant info

- Failure signatures:
  - High hallucination with high relevance: Model is confident but wrong; check retrieval quality
  - Low relevance scores: Retrieved chunks don't match query intent; check embedding model suitability
  - Inconsistent outputs across runs: Temperature too high (paper uses 0.2 for stability)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce the 50-query benchmark on the 16-document corpus with both pipelines to validate reported metrics (hallucination: 0.32 vs 0.12; relevance: 0.88 vs 0.91)
  2. Ablate the retrieval method: Run DeepSeek with Top-k=3 instead of MMR to isolate the contribution of diversity-aware retrieval
  3. Test boundary conditions: Feed documents without clear heading structure to both pipelines to identify when semantic chunking provides no advantage

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does fine-tuning on domain-specific refugee data yield better hallucination control than the current RAG architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states future work will aim to "refine these pipelines with fine-tuning domain-specific data."
- Why unresolved: This study focused on comparing existing RAG architectures (Zephyr and DeepSeek) using retrieval strategies like MMR, without implementing model weight updates.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative experiment benchmarking the current DeepSeek RAG pipeline against a version fine-tuned on the refugee health corpus.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can multimodal data integration improve the robustness of AI frameworks in real-world humanitarian contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly call for "investigation into multimodal integration" in future work.
- Why unresolved: The current framework processes only unstructured text (PDFs), ignoring potential audio or visual data sources common in field reporting.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance metrics from a pipeline that ingests images and audio alongside text, tested in a field deployment.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How reliably does the "LLM-as-a-judge" evaluation correlate with human expert validation in sensitive mental health contexts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study relies entirely on GPT-4 for evaluation metrics (relevance/hallucination), yet the literature review highlights the "black-box" nature of LLMs and the need for transparent clinical integration.
- Why unresolved: There is no reported comparison between the automated GPT-4 scores and human expert reviews to validate the "judge's" accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: A dual-evaluation study comparing GPT-4 generated scores against assessments from mental health professionals for the same model outputs.

## Limitations
- Small corpus of 16 documents and 50 queries limits generalizability of results
- Evaluation relies entirely on GPT-4 as judge without human expert validation
- Specific documents, queries, and evaluation prompts are not disclosed, preventing independent verification

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The architectural framework and design rationale for semantic-aware segmentation and MMR retrieval are clearly articulated and align with established RAG best practices.
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported performance differences between Zephyr and DeepSeek (hallucination: 0.32 vs 0.12; relevance: 0.88 vs 0.91) are plausible given the described methodological improvements, but are not independently verifiable due to missing data.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of these results to larger, more diverse refugee health datasets or other sensitive humanitarian domains remains unproven.

## Next Checks
1. **Replication with Ground Truth**: Conduct a small-scale human evaluation study where domain experts label a subset of outputs for hallucination and relevance to validate GPT-4 judge scores.
2. **Ablation of Design Choices**: Systematically disable semantic chunking or MMR retrieval in the DeepSeek pipeline to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains.
3. **Robustness Testing**: Test both pipelines on documents lacking clear structural headings to assess whether semantic chunking provides benefits beyond well-structured sources.
