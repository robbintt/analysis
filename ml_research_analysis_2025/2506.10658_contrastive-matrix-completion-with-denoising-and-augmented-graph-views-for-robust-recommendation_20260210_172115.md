# Contrastive Matrix Completion with Denoising and Augmented Graph Views for Robust Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.10658
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10658
- Authors: Narges Nemati; Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces MCCL, a contrastive matrix completion method that constructs denoising and VGAE graph views to improve robustness and performance in recommender systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the sensitivity to noise and overfitting in graph neural network (GNN)-based recommender systems by introducing MCCL, a novel matrix completion method. MCCL constructs two distinct graph representations for each interaction: a denoising view using RGCN layers with attention mechanisms, and a graph variational autoencoder (VGAE) view that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. These representations are harmonized during training using a mutual learning loss function, allowing the model to capture common patterns and enhance generalizability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MCCL improves both numerical accuracy and ranking quality, achieving up to 0.8% improvement in RMSE and up to 36% improvement in ranking metrics compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
MCCL is a matrix completion method for recommender systems that addresses sensitivity to noise and overfitting in GNN-based approaches. The method constructs two distinct graph representations for each interaction: a denoising view using RGCN layers with attention mechanisms, and a graph variational autoencoder (VGAE) view that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. These representations are harmonized during training using a mutual learning loss function, allowing the model to capture common patterns and enhance generalizability. The approach is validated on real-world datasets, demonstrating improvements in both numerical accuracy and ranking quality.

## Key Results
- MCCL achieves up to 0.8% improvement in RMSE compared to baseline methods.
- MCCL demonstrates up to 36% improvement in ranking metrics.
- The method enhances robustness and generalizability in recommender systems.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MCCL works by constructing two complementary graph views for each interaction: a denoising view that captures local graph structure with attention mechanisms, and a VGAE view that learns a latent representation aligned with a standard prior. The mutual learning loss function harmonizes these views during training, enabling the model to learn robust and generalizable representations. This contrastive approach helps mitigate the effects of noise and overfitting, leading to improved performance in both numerical accuracy and ranking quality.

## Foundational Learning
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Why needed - to capture complex relationships in user-item interaction graphs. Quick check - verify that the RGCN layers effectively aggregate neighborhood information.
- Graph Variational Autoencoders (VGAEs): Why needed - to learn latent representations that align with a standard prior for improved generalization. Quick check - ensure the VGAE view captures meaningful latent features.
- Mutual Learning Loss: Why needed - to harmonize the denoising and VGAE views during training. Quick check - confirm that the loss function effectively balances the two views.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: User-Item Graph -> RGCN Layers with Attention -> Denoising View; User-Item Graph -> VGAE Layers -> VGAE View; Denoising View + VGAE View -> Mutual Learning Loss -> Harmonized Representation
- Critical Path: User-Item Graph -> RGCN/VGAE Layers -> Mutual Learning Loss -> Final Prediction
- Design Tradeoffs: Balancing denoising and VGAE views for robustness vs. complexity of mutual learning loss.
- Failure Signatures: Overfitting to noisy interactions, poor alignment between denoising and VGAE views.
- First Experiments: 1) Train with only denoising view to assess its standalone impact. 2) Train with only VGAE view to evaluate its contribution. 3) Vary the strength of mutual learning loss to find optimal balance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The reported performance gains are plausible but lack consistency verification across datasets and sparsity regimes.
- The mutual learning loss's role in preventing overfitting versus enforcing consistency is unclear without variance analysis or cross-validation.
- The robustness claim under noise lacks details on noise injection procedures and hyperparameter sensitivity.

## Confidence
- Novelty of contrastive framework: High
- Empirical improvements: Medium
- Robustness and scalability claims: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct an ablation study removing the mutual learning loss to quantify its direct impact on robustness and performance.
2. Test MCCL on datasets with varying sparsity levels and noise rates to verify consistent gains across different regimes.
3. Perform cross-validation with multiple random seeds to assess variance and generalizability of reported results.
