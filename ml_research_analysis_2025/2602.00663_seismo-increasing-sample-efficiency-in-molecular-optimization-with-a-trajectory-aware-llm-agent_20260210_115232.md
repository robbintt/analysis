core_contribution: SEISMO is a large language model (LLM)-based agent that performs

# SEISMO: Increasing Sample Efficiency in Molecular Optimization with a Trajectory-Aware LLM Agent

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.00663
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00663
- Reference count: 40
- SEISMO achieves 2-3 times higher area under the optimization curve than prior methods on the PMO benchmark

## Executive Summary
SEISMO introduces a trajectory-aware LLM agent for molecular optimization that conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, including task descriptions, scalar scores, and structured explanatory feedback. Unlike population-based or batched methods, SEISMO updates after every oracle call without retraining, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency. On the Practical Molecular Optimization (PMO) benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO reaches near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to efficient molecular optimization.

## Method Summary
SEISMO is a large language model-based agent that performs inference-time molecular optimization by conditioning each proposal on the full optimization trajectory. The agent takes as input the task description, previous molecular structures, their associated scores, and structured explanatory feedback from the oracle. After each oracle evaluation, SEISMO updates its internal state and generates a new molecular proposal, creating a sequential decision-making process. This trajectory-aware approach contrasts with population-based methods that maintain multiple candidates and update in batches, allowing SEISMO to efficiently navigate the chemical space while avoiding redundant proposals.

## Key Results
- SEISMO achieves 2-3 times higher area under the optimization curve than prior methods on the PMO benchmark
- Near-maximal task scores are reached within 50 oracle calls
- Providing explanatory feedback further improves sample efficiency compared to using only scalar scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SEISMO's trajectory awareness allows the LLM to learn from the full optimization history rather than treating each proposal independently. By conditioning on previous molecules, their scores, and explanatory feedback, the agent can identify patterns in the chemical space and avoid making similar suboptimal proposals. The sequential nature of the approach enables the model to refine its search strategy based on the oracle's feedback, effectively learning the underlying structure of the optimization problem through interaction rather than pre-training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Molecular optimization** - why needed: Core task of finding molecules with desired properties
  quick check: Can the agent improve initial random molecules?
- **LLM-based agents** - why needed: Ability to process complex prompts and generate structured molecular representations
  quick check: Does the LLM correctly parse and respond to optimization instructions?
- **Trajectory awareness** - why needed: Prevents redundant exploration and enables learning from optimization history
  quick check: Does the agent avoid proposing similar molecules to previously evaluated ones?
- **Explanatory feedback** - why needed: Provides richer information than scalar scores alone
  quick check: Does structured feedback improve proposal quality compared to scalar scores only?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Task description -> LLM agent -> Molecular proposal -> Oracle evaluation -> Explanatory feedback -> Trajectory update -> LLM agent
Critical path: Task description → LLM agent → Oracle evaluation → Trajectory update
Design tradeoffs: Sequential updates vs. parallel exploration; complexity of feedback vs. computational overhead
Failure signatures: Stuck in local optima, redundant proposals, inability to interpret feedback
First experiments:
1. Test agent with only scalar scores, no trajectory awareness
2. Evaluate with random feedback instead of structured explanations
3. Compare against population-based methods on simple optimization tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study focuses on a specific benchmark (PMO) without exploring broader chemical spaces or real-world drug discovery scenarios
- The exact mechanisms by which trajectory awareness and explanatory feedback contribute to performance gains remain unclear without detailed ablation studies
- The claim of achieving "near-maximal task scores" needs careful interpretation as benchmark tasks may not fully represent actual molecular optimization complexity

## Confidence
- SEISMO achieves 2-3x higher area under the optimization curve than prior methods - High
- Trajectory awareness is the key factor for improved sample efficiency - Medium
- Explanatory feedback significantly improves optimization performance - Medium
- Near-maximal task scores are reached within 50 oracle calls - Low (depends on task definition)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing trajectory awareness and explanatory feedback separately to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains.
2. Test SEISMO on diverse molecular optimization tasks beyond the PMO benchmark, including multi-objective optimization and real-world drug discovery scenarios.
3. Perform extensive error analysis to understand failure modes and limitations of the trajectory-aware approach, particularly in cases where the LLM agent struggles to improve upon initial proposals.
