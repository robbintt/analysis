# Weak Diffusion Priors Can Still Achieve Strong Inverse-Problem Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22443
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22443
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Weak diffusion priors achieve strong inverse problem performance when measurements are highly informative

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether diffusion models trained on mismatched or low-fidelity data can effectively solve inverse problems. Through extensive experiments across multiple tasks (inpainting, super-resolution, deblurring) and datasets (faces, bedrooms, churches), the authors demonstrate that weak diffusion priors can achieve performance comparable to strong-prior baselines when measurements are highly informative. The key finding is that reconstruction becomes dominated by the observation rather than the prior in data-informative regimes, which is supported by theoretical analysis showing Bayesian posterior concentration around the true signal regardless of prior choice. The work also identifies specific failure modes where weak priors underperform.

## Method Summary
The method employs weak diffusion priors using 3-step DDIM sampling combined with initial-noise optimization. The optimization objective minimizes reconstruction error on a subset of observed pixels while using a holdout set for early stopping (HoldoutTopK). AdamSphere optimizer is used to keep the latent code on the sphere during optimization. The approach is tested across multiple inverse problems including 70% random inpainting, 4× super-resolution, and Gaussian deblurring with various noise levels. Key implementation details include specific learning rates (0.01-0.02), 1000 optimization iterations, and noise σ=0.01.

## Key Results
- Weak diffusion priors achieve PSNR and SSIM comparable to strong priors in data-informative regimes (e.g., 70% random inpainting)
- Theoretical analysis shows Bayesian posterior concentration around true signal when measurements are highly informative
- Clear failure modes identified: box inpainting and large-scale super-resolution (e.g., 16×) where weak priors underperform
- HoldoutTopK early stopping effectively prevents overfitting to measurement noise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on the high-dimensional nature of measurements causing the posterior to concentrate around the true signal regardless of prior choice. When sufficient data is observed (many pixels in inpainting, high-resolution in super-resolution), the likelihood term dominates the posterior, making the choice of prior less critical. This Bayesian consistency allows even weak or mismatched priors to recover accurate reconstructions.

## Foundational Learning

**Bayesian consistency** - Understanding how posterior distributions concentrate around true parameters as sample size increases
*Why needed*: The paper's theoretical analysis relies on showing posterior concentration
*Quick check*: Verify that the posterior variance shrinks with increasing measurement dimensionality

**DDIM sampling** - Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models for fast generation
*Why needed*: 3-step DDIM is used as the weak prior generator
*Quick check*: Confirm that 3-step sampling produces reasonable samples from pretrained models

**Manifold optimization** - Optimization constrained to lie on a sphere
*Why needed*: AdamSphere keeps latent codes on the sphere during optimization
*Quick check*: Monitor ||z|| during optimization to ensure it stays near √d

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Observation A -> DDIM generator G(z) -> Reconstruction loss ||A(G(z)) - y||² -> AdamSphere optimization -> z

**Critical path**: The optimization pipeline from observed measurements through the DDIM generator to the reconstruction loss, with AdamSphere ensuring the latent remains on the sphere constraint

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Weak priors vs. strong priors: computational efficiency and robustness to prior mismatch vs. optimal performance in low-data regimes
- HoldoutTopK vs. full-dataset optimization: prevents overfitting but requires careful K selection
- 3-step DDIM vs. full sampling: faster but potentially lower-quality prior

**Failure signatures**:
- Reconstruction degrades at later iterations (overfitting)
- z drifting off sphere (AdamSphere implementation issues)
- Poor performance on box inpainting or extreme super-resolution (expected for weak priors)

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test HoldoutTopK with different K values (5, 10, 20) to verify robustness
2. Compare normalization vs. exponential map retraction in AdamSphere
3. Evaluate on non-Gaussian noise to test theoretical assumptions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- What are the sharp theoretical thresholds determining when measurements are sufficiently informative for weak priors to be effective?
- Can hybrid algorithms combining measurement injection with noise optimization improve performance for weak priors?
- Do the theoretical guarantees for posterior concentration extend to general nonlinear inverse problems?

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes Gaussian measurement noise and well-behaved posteriors
- HoldoutTopK early stopping strategy lacks precise specification of K
- Failure cases like box inpainting and extreme super-resolution show clear boundaries of weak-prior advantage

## Confidence
- Empirical demonstrations of weak prior effectiveness: High
- Theoretical Bayesian consistency argument: Medium (relies on asymptotic assumptions)
- Failure mode characterization: High (clearly demonstrated)
- Generalizability beyond tested settings: Medium (limited by task diversity)

## Next Checks
1. Test HoldoutTopK with multiple K values (5, 10, 20) to verify robustness of early stopping performance
2. Implement both normalization and exponential map retraction for AdamSphere and compare convergence behavior
3. Evaluate on additional inverse problems with non-Gaussian noise (e.g., Poisson) to test theoretical assumptions
