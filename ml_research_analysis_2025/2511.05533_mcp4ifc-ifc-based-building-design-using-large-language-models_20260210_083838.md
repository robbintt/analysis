# MCP4IFC: IFC-Based Building Design Using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05533
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05533
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Enables LLMs to manipulate IFC data for BIM workflows with accuracy scores up to 83.1% on scene querying tasks

## Executive Summary
MCP4IFC is a framework that allows large language models to interact with Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data for building information modeling (BIM) workflows. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and integrating with tools like IfcOpenShell and Blender, the system provides standardized interfaces for querying, creating, and editing IFC models. The framework combines in-context learning with retrieval-augmented generation to enable LLMs to generate Python code for tasks beyond predefined toolsets. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can perform complex BIM operations, such as constructing houses from scratch and querying existing IFC data, with accuracy scores reaching 83.1% using GPT-5 mini. The framework is released as open-source to foster research in AI-assisted BIM design.

## Method Summary
The MCP4IFC framework integrates large language models with Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data for building information modeling workflows. It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide LLMs with standardized tools for querying, creating, and editing IFC models, leveraging IfcOpenShell for IFC manipulation and Blender for 3D visualization. A key innovation is the integration of in-context learning with retrieval-augmented generation to dynamically generate Python code for tasks beyond the predefined toolset. Experiments demonstrate that LLMs can perform complex BIM operations, such as constructing a house from scratch and querying existing IFC data, achieving accuracy scores of 83.1% on scene querying tasks using GPT-5 mini and 75.4% using Claude Sonnet 4.5. The framework is released as open-source to encourage research in AI-assisted BIM design.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieved 83.1% accuracy on scene querying tasks using GPT-5 mini
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 achieved 75.4% accuracy on a house construction task
- Framework successfully enabled construction of a house from scratch and querying of existing IFC data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by providing LLMs with standardized tools to interact with IFC data through the Model Context Protocol. This allows LLMs to leverage IfcOpenShell for IFC manipulation and Blender for 3D visualization. The integration of in-context learning with retrieval-augmented generation enables dynamic Python code generation for tasks beyond predefined toolsets, allowing LLMs to handle complex BIM operations.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)** - A standardized data model for BIM workflows. Why needed: Enables interoperability between different BIM software and platforms. Quick check: Verify IFC file compatibility with multiple BIM tools.

2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - A protocol for standardizing LLM interactions with external tools. Why needed: Provides consistent interfaces for LLM access to IFC manipulation tools. Quick check: Test MCP tool integration with multiple LLM providers.

3. **In-Context Learning (ICL)** - A technique where LLMs learn from examples provided in prompts. Why needed: Enables LLMs to adapt to new BIM tasks without fine-tuning. Quick check: Evaluate ICL effectiveness across different BIM scenarios.

4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** - Combines information retrieval with text generation. Why needed: Enhances LLM capabilities by incorporating external knowledge sources. Quick check: Measure performance improvement when using RAG for code generation.

5. **IfcOpenShell** - An open-source library for working with IFC files. Why needed: Provides programmatic access to IFC data for manipulation and querying. Quick check: Test IfcOpenShell integration with various IFC file versions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User -> MCP Server -> LLM -> IfcOpenShell/Blender -> IFC Data

**Critical Path:** User request → MCP Server tools → LLM processing → Python code generation → IFC manipulation → Result visualization

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational overhead for flexibility by using LLMs for code generation rather than pre-programmed solutions. This allows handling novel tasks but may introduce variability in performance.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance on complex BIM tasks, LLM hallucinations in generated code, incompatibility with certain IFC file versions, or visualization issues in Blender.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Replicate the scene querying accuracy experiment using multiple LLM models
2. Test the house construction task with varying levels of architectural complexity
3. Evaluate the framework's performance with large, complex IFC models containing thousands of elements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance metrics based on limited task sets and single LLM model
- Reliance on in-context learning and RAG introduces variability and potential brittleness
- Scalability to larger, more complex IFC models remains untested
- Integration with Blender may introduce computational overhead in production environments

## Confidence
- Confidence in core claims about MCP4IFC's ability to interface LLMs with IFC data: Medium
- Confidence in reported accuracy metrics: Low
- Confidence in framework's scalability and robustness: Low

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the accuracy experiments using multiple LLM models (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4) and report inter-model consistency
2. Test MCP4IFC on a larger and more diverse set of BIM tasks, including complex architectural designs and modifications to existing models
3. Conduct a user study with BIM professionals to evaluate the framework's usability, robustness, and integration with existing BIM workflows
