# From Volumes to Slices: Computationally Efficient Contrastive Learning for Sequential Abdominal CT Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.14593
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14593
- **Reference count:** 5
- **Primary result:** 2D-VoCo framework enables efficient pre-training on 2D CT slices, improving multi-organ injury classification performance

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a computationally efficient adaptation of 3D volume contrastive learning (VoCo) for sequential abdominal CT analysis. The proposed 2D-VoCo method enables self-supervised pre-training on 2D CT slices, addressing the high computational costs of traditional 3D approaches. The pre-trained CNN backbone is integrated into a CNN-LSTM architecture for multi-organ injury classification. Experimental results on the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma dataset demonstrate that 2D-VoCo pre-training significantly improves mean average precision (mAP), precision, recall, and the RSNA score compared to training from scratch. The method also benefits from incorporating additional unlabeled data during pre-training, and multi-organ classification outperforms single-organ approaches when using the 2D-VoCo pre-trained model.

## Method Summary
The 2D-VoCo framework adapts 3D volume contrastive learning to operate on 2D CT slices instead of volumetric data. The method performs self-supervised pre-training on 2D slices to learn anatomical representations, then transfers these learned features to a CNN-LSTM architecture for sequential analysis of abdominal CT scans. The CNN backbone processes individual slices, while the LSTM layer captures temporal/spatial relationships across the sequence. This approach significantly reduces computational requirements compared to 3D VoCo while maintaining strong performance for multi-organ injury classification tasks. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned on labeled data for the specific classification task, demonstrating improved performance over training from scratch.

## Key Results
- 2D-VoCo pre-training significantly improves mAP, precision, recall, and RSNA score compared to training from scratch
- Performance benefits from incorporating additional unlabeled data during pre-training
- Multi-organ classification with 2D-VoCo pre-trained model outperforms single-organ classification approaches
- The method provides a practical solution for reducing dependency on labeled data in clinical CT analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The 2D-VoCo framework leverages the spatial continuity of CT slices while avoiding the computational burden of 3D volumetric processing. By pre-training on 2D slices using contrastive learning, the model learns robust anatomical representations that capture essential features for organ injury detection. The CNN-LSTM architecture then integrates these learned features across sequential slices to capture temporal and spatial relationships. The self-supervised nature of pre-training allows the model to utilize large amounts of unlabeled clinical data, addressing the common challenge of limited labeled medical imaging datasets. The 2D approach maintains sufficient contextual information while being computationally tractable on standard hardware.

## Foundational Learning

**Contrastive Learning:** A self-supervised learning technique that trains models to distinguish between similar and dissimilar data pairs. Needed for learning useful representations without labels. Quick check: Verify the contrastive loss implementation and positive/negative sample selection strategy.

**CT Slice Sequences:** Sequential 2D images representing volumetric CT data. Essential for capturing anatomical context across different viewing angles. Quick check: Confirm slice ordering and spacing are consistent across datasets.

**CNN-LSTM Architecture:** Combines convolutional neural networks for spatial feature extraction with long short-term memory networks for sequence modeling. Required for processing both individual slice features and their temporal relationships. Quick check: Validate the sequence length and batch size choices.

**Multi-organ Classification:** Simultaneous prediction of injury states across multiple abdominal organs. Important for clinical relevance and comprehensive assessment. Quick check: Verify the class imbalance handling and evaluation metrics.

**Self-supervised Pre-training:** Training models on unlabeled data to learn general features before fine-tuning on labeled data. Critical for reducing labeled data requirements. Quick check: Assess the impact of pre-training duration and dataset size.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** CT slices → CNN backbone → Feature vectors → LSTM → Classification head

**Critical Path:** The most performance-critical components are the CNN backbone (for feature extraction quality) and the LSTM layer (for sequence modeling). The contrastive pre-training quality directly impacts downstream performance.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The 2D approach sacrifices some 3D volumetric context for computational efficiency. Using LSTM instead of Transformers trades some modeling capacity for reduced computational requirements. The framework balances between performance and practicality for clinical deployment.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance may indicate inadequate pre-training duration, insufficient unlabeled data, or suboptimal sequence length choices. Model degradation could result from inconsistent slice spacing or poor CNN backbone initialization.

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare 2D-VoCo pre-training with random initialization on a small validation subset
2. Evaluate different sequence lengths (number of slices processed together) for optimal performance
3. Test the impact of varying amounts of unlabeled pre-training data on final performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited ablation studies on the CNN-LSTM architecture, including justification for LSTM over Transformers
- Unclear optimal pre-training dataset size and scaling behavior with additional unlabeled data
- Computational efficiency claims lack detailed timing comparisons across different hardware configurations
- Single dataset evaluation limits generalizability assessment
- No exploration of alternative CNN backbone architectures beyond ResNet-50/101

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core contribution: 2D-VoCo provides a computationally efficient alternative to 3D self-supervised learning for sequential CT analysis
- **Medium confidence** in the quantitative results: Performance improvements are demonstrated but limited by single dataset evaluation
- **Medium confidence** in the clinical relevance: The framework shows promise but requires validation on diverse clinical datasets

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the framework on multiple abdominal CT datasets with varying organ injury patterns and acquisition protocols to assess generalizability
2. Conduct detailed computational benchmarking comparing training time, memory usage, and inference latency between 2D-VoCo and 3D-VoCo across different hardware configurations
3. Perform ablation studies on the sequence modeling component, comparing LSTM with Transformer-based architectures and different CNN backbone choices
