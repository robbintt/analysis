# Explainable Anomaly Detection for Industrial IoT Data Streams

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08885
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08885
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: iPDP-based explanations enable operators to dynamically reassess feature relevance and adjust anomaly thresholds for proactive maintenance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an explainable anomaly detection framework for real-time industrial IoT data streams that addresses limited supervision and concept drift. The method combines an online Isolation Forest with incremental Partial Dependence Plots (iPDPs) and a feature importance score derived from deviations of Individual Conditional Expectation curves. Applied to a Jacquard loom unit, the system successfully correlates feature importance with both production changes and emerging faults, offering interpretable insights into bearing degradation.

## Method Summary
The framework employs an Online Isolation Forest (Onl-iForest) that maintains a forest of trees updated in real time through a sliding window of the ω most recent points. Anomaly scores are computed from average path length, with shorter paths indicating anomalies. The iPDP mechanism updates feature effect estimates by combining current model evaluations with previous estimates using an exponential moving average. Feature importance scores are derived from deviations of Individual Conditional Expectation curves from a fading historical average, enabling operators to identify which features are driving current anomalies.

## Key Results
- iPDP-based explanations successfully correlate with both production changes and emerging faults in bearing degradation scenarios
- Feature importance tracking enables operators to distinguish between known production shifts and unexpected fault patterns
- The system demonstrates effective real-time adaptation to concept drift in industrial IoT streaming data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Online Isolation Forest with sliding-window pruning enables anomaly detection that adapts to concept drift without labeled data. The Onl-iForest maintains a forest of trees where each node tracks bin counts over a sliding window W of the ω most recent points. As new samples arrive, bin counts increment; as samples age out of the window, counts decrement. When counts drop below thresholds, underpopulated subtrees are merged (pruned). Anomaly scores are computed from average path length—shorter paths indicate anomalies since they require fewer splits to isolate.

### Mechanism 2
Incremental Partial Dependence Plots (iPDPs) provide interpretable marginal feature effects in streaming settings by aggregating Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves over time. For each incoming observation, the system computes an ICE curve by evaluating the model at 20 evenly-spaced points per feature while holding other features fixed. The iPDP is maintained as an exponential moving average of these ICE curves. Grid locations adapt as feature min/max evolve, using a sampling procedure to recompute ranges when distributions shift significantly.

### Mechanism 3
Feature Importance (FI) scores derived from ICE curve deviations enable operators to correlate anomalies with production events and emerging faults. The FI score quantifies how each feature's ICE curve deviates from its fading historical average. Large deviations indicate features driving current anomaly scores. By tracking FI over time, operators can distinguish between production changes (known shifts) and emerging faults (unexpected patterns).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Isolation Forest Path Length Scoring**
  - Why needed here: The entire anomaly detection mechanism depends on understanding why shorter path lengths indicate anomalies
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a point isolated in 2 splits receives a higher anomaly score than one isolated in 10 splits?

- Concept: **Partial Dependence Plots vs ICE Curves**
  - Why needed here: iPDP interpretation requires distinguishing between average marginal effects (PDP) and individual-level effects (ICE)
  - Quick check question: What would an ICE curve that deviates sharply from the PDP at high feature values indicate?

- Concept: **Exponential Moving Average with Fading Factor**
  - Why needed here: The iPDP and feature importance both use fading averages to handle streaming data
  - Quick check question: If the fading factor α=0.1, approximately how much weight does the most recent observation retain vs. historical data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Ingestion Layer -> Onl-iForest Engine -> iPDP Calculator -> Feature Importance Module -> Human Interface
- Critical path: Data arrives → Update Onl-iForest bin counts (increment new, decrement old) → Check for subtree merges → Compute anomaly score via average path length → If anomaly threshold exceeded, compute ICE curves → Update iPDPs → Calculate FI deviations → Present to operator with explanation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Window size ω: Larger windows capture more history but adapt slower to drift; smaller windows are more responsive but may be noisier
  - Number of evaluation points (20): More points give smoother PDPs but increase computation per observation
  - Fading factor α: Higher values prioritize recent data; lower values smooth more aggressively
  - Assumption: Paper does not specify optimal values; these require domain-specific tuning
- Failure signatures:
  - Persistent high anomaly scores across all features: May indicate window size too small for new normal behavior
  - Flat FI across all features during anomaly: Check if ICE grid points span the actual feature range; sparse regions may bias results
  - PDP interpretations contradicting physical understanding: Possible interaction effects not captured by marginal plots
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline calibration: Run Onl-iForest on 1 week of known-normal loom operation; validate that anomaly scores stabilize around 0.1-0.3 and FI scores remain low/flat
  2. Controlled fault injection: Introduce known production changes (material switches) and verify FI spikes correlate with expected features; confirm iPDP patterns match physical expectations
  3. Threshold sensitivity analysis: Systematically vary anomaly threshold and measure precision/recall against historical maintenance logs; document false positive rate vs. detection latency tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the framework predict and explain imminent bearing failures before they result in costly downtime? (The current results are preliminary, identifying anomaly spikes but not yet demonstrating a validated predictive capability for specific mechanical failures.)
- How can the bias in iPDP interpretations caused by data sparsity in specific feature regions be effectively mitigated? (The paper identifies the limitation but does not propose a correction mechanism or uncertainty quantification for these sparse regions.)
- How can the fidelity of the explanations be quantitatively validated against physical ground truth in an unsupervised setting? (The paper relies on qualitative expert inspection to correlate iPDP shapes with fault types, lacking a quantitative metric for explanation accuracy.)

## Limitations
- The exact formula for computing feature importance scores from ICE deviations is not specified, only described qualitatively
- Data sparsity in certain feature regions can bias PDP interpretations, and no correction mechanism is provided
- The system relies on qualitative validation via expert inspection rather than quantitative metrics for explanation accuracy

## Confidence
- High: Core anomaly detection mechanism (Onl-iForest with sliding window and path length scoring)
- Medium: iPDP computation and maintenance (EMA of ICE curves with adaptive grids)
- Low: Feature importance scoring formula and threshold determination

## Next Checks
1. Implement the iPDP and FI calculation pipeline using synthetic data with known feature effects to verify the deviation-based scoring actually identifies the correct features
2. Systematically vary anomaly detection thresholds and document false positive rates vs. detection latency on the Jacquard loom dataset
3. Create controlled concept drift scenarios (gradual vs. abrupt) to test whether the sliding window mechanism appropriately balances adaptation speed against noise suppression
