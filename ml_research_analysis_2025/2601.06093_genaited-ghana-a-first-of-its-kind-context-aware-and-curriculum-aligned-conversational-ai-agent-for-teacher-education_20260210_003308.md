# GenAITEd Ghana: A First-of-Its-Kind Context-Aware and Curriculum-Aligned Conversational AI Agent for Teacher Education

- First-of-its-kind curriculum-aligned conversational AI for Ghanaian teacher education

## Executive Summary
GenAITEd Ghana is a context-aware, curriculum-aligned conversational AI system designed specifically for teacher education in Ghana. Built using a design science approach, the system integrates the Ghana National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA) curriculum, multilingual voice interaction capabilities, and culturally responsive prompts with teacher-in-the-loop oversight. The architecture operationalizes Responsible AI principles by embedding transparency, fairness, and accountability directly into the system design. Functional testing demonstrated reliable performance across text and voice modalities with response latencies under 2 seconds, while human expert evaluation confirmed strong pedagogical relevance, curriculum alignment, and cultural legitimacy. The system positions itself as scalable pedagogical infrastructure for the Global South by addressing the unique educational context of Ghanaian teachers.

## Method Summary
The study employed a design science research methodology to develop GenAITEd Ghana as a multi-agent RAG system. The architecture uses Node.js v18 with Express.js and PostgreSQL for backend operations, with GPT-4 Turbo as the primary LLM (supporting routing to Claude, Groq, and HuggingFace models). The system ingests the Ghana NaCCA curriculum (Early Grade, Upper Primary, JHS) into JSON structure with fields for subject, grade_level, strand, sub_strand, core_competency, and learning_indicator. Voice support includes English, Twi, Dagbani, and Ewe through Whisper v3 for ASR and ElevenLabs/FastSpeech2 for TTS via LiveKit streaming. A two-layer prompt system combines system-level prompts for curriculum boundaries and ethics with semi-automated interaction prompts for dialogue structuring. The system features JWT-based authentication with role-based access (Teacher, Student, Admin) and implements group collaboration through passkey systems.

## Key Results
- Functional testing showed reliable performance with response latencies under 2 seconds across text and voice modalities
- Human expert evaluation (N=5) found strong pedagogical relevance, curriculum alignment, and cultural legitimacy
- System successfully integrated NaCCA curriculum, multilingual voice interaction, and culturally responsive prompts with teacher oversight
- Operationalized Responsible AI principles through embedded transparency, fairness, and accountability in architecture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by combining curriculum-aware RAG architecture with culturally embedded prompting and multilingual voice interaction. The multi-agent design allows for specialized processing of curriculum content while maintaining conversational fluency. By grounding responses in the NaCCA curriculum framework and incorporating Ghanaian cultural context directly into system prompts, the AI maintains pedagogical relevance and cultural legitimacy. The teacher-in-the-loop oversight ensures pedagogical accuracy while the Responsible AI framework provides governance structures that align with UNESCO/OECD/AU standards.

## Foundational Learning
- **NaCCA curriculum integration**: Understanding Ghana's national curriculum structure is essential for contextualizing the system's knowledge base. Quick check: Verify curriculum JSON structure matches NaCCA documentation.
- **RAG pipeline orchestration**: The retrieval-augmented generation system combines semantic search with LLM reasoning. Quick check: Test curriculum retrieval accuracy for sample queries.
- **Multilingual voice processing**: ASR/TTS support for English, Twi, Dagbani, Ewe requires understanding language-specific acoustic models. Quick check: Validate voice recognition accuracy across supported languages.
- **Responsible AI frameworks**: Integration of UNESCO/OECD/AU guidelines into system architecture. Quick check: Audit system prompts for compliance with stated principles.
- **Teacher-in-the-loop governance**: Oversight mechanisms ensuring pedagogical accuracy. Quick check: Test teacher review and approval workflows.
- **Group collaboration architecture**: Passkey-based system for enabling teacher-student group interactions. Quick check: Validate group creation and access control functionality.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Curriculum Database -> RAG Service -> LLM Router -> Prompt Engine -> Voice Pipeline -> User Interface

**Critical Path:**
User Query → Curriculum Search → Context Retrieval → Prompt Assembly → LLM Generation → Response Formatting → TTS/Display

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The system prioritized curriculum fidelity and cultural relevance over maximum response speed, accepting ~2s latency for accurate, context-aware responses. Voice functionality was partially implemented to demonstrate capability while managing development complexity. The multi-LLM architecture provides redundancy but increases operational complexity and cost.

**Failure Signatures:**
- High latency (>2s) indicates bottlenecks in RAG retrieval or LLM processing
- Curriculum misalignment suggests broken semantic search or incorrect prompt context
- Voice recognition failures point to ASR model limitations or audio quality issues
- Cultural irrelevance indicates prompt engineering failures or insufficient context data

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test curriculum retrieval accuracy by querying sample questions and validating against NaCCA learning indicators
2. Validate multilingual voice interaction by testing ASR→LLM→TTS pipeline with each supported language
3. Assess prompt effectiveness by evaluating AI responses against Ghanaian cultural context criteria

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small evaluation sample (N=5 human experts) limits generalizability of pedagogical relevance findings
- Critical implementation details including complete prompt templates and full NaCCA curriculum dataset are not disclosed
- Voice functionality, particularly teacher voice cloning, was only partially tested
- Study lacks quantitative metrics for conversational quality, response accuracy, and educational outcomes
- Long-term sustainability concerns including maintenance costs and low-bandwidth infrastructure requirements are not addressed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical architecture description, functional testing results showing <2s latency, system design choices, Responsible AI framework integration
- **Medium confidence**: Human expert evaluation findings on pedagogical relevance and cultural legitimacy, multilingual voice interaction capabilities
- **Low confidence**: Scalability claims, long-term sustainability assessment, quantitative performance metrics beyond latency

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user testing with a larger sample of Ghanaian teachers (N≥30) to validate pedagogical relevance and cultural appropriateness across diverse educational contexts
2. Implement full functional testing of voice cloning and multilingual capabilities in varied acoustic environments representative of Ghanaian classrooms
3. Perform longitudinal evaluation tracking system usage patterns, teacher satisfaction, and student learning outcomes over a complete academic term
