# Provably Efficient Algorithm for Best Scoring Rule Identification in Online Principal-Agent Information Acquisition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.17379
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17379
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposed OIAFC and OIAFB algorithms achieve near-optimal sample complexity for best scoring rule identification in principal-agent information acquisition

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the Best Scoring Rule Identification (BSRI) problem in online information acquisition under a principal-agent framework. The authors propose two algorithms, OIAFC for the fixed-confidence setting and OIAFB for the fixed-budget setting, to efficiently identify an (ε,δ)-optimal scoring rule through repeated interactions with the agent. The key innovation lies in the introduction of adaptive trade-off parameters {αᵗₖ} and a stopping threshold βᵗ, which enable both instance-dependent and instance-independent sample complexity bounds. The algorithms leverage an action-informed oracle assumption and use linear programming with upper confidence bounds to balance exploration and exploitation, achieving near-optimal performance that aligns with multi-armed bandit literature while accounting for strategic agent responses.

## Method Summary
The paper tackles BSRI through two algorithms: OIAFC (fixed-confidence) and OIAFB (fixed-budget). Both algorithms use an action-informed oracle to provide initial scoring rules and employ UCB-LP (linear programming with confidence bounds) to compute optimistic estimates of optimal scoring rules. The algorithms balance exploration and exploitation through adaptive trade-off parameters αᵗₖ = min(√M/Lᵗₖ, 1), where Lᵗₖ counts how often arm k appeared in normal exploration. The stopping rule for OIAFC uses a threshold βᵗ based on confidence radii for belief distribution estimates. The framework reduces the principal-agent problem to a bandit problem where the goal is identifying the arm with highest expected reward h(S*_k).

## Key Results
- OIAFC achieves instance-dependent sample complexity of Õ(ε⁻²B²SMHΔ) and instance-independent bound of Õ(ε⁻²B²SMHε)
- OIAFB matches OIAFC's instance-independent performance bound in the fixed-budget setting
- Both algorithms improve upon prior work by achieving near-optimal performance with provable guarantees
- Theoretical analysis shows the algorithms align with multi-armed bandit results while handling strategic agent complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Adaptive Trade-off Parameters (α_t^k)
The trade-off parameters α_t^k balance exploration efficiency against estimation accuracy. The algorithm blends an action-informed scoring rule (S̃_k) with an estimated optimal rule (Ŝ_{k,t}) via S_t = α_t^k·S̃_k + (1-α_t^k)·Ŝ_{k,t}. When α_t^k is large, the principal forces the agent toward the desired arm with high confidence; when small, the principal learns more about the optimal rule. The paper sets α_t^k = min(√M/L_t^k, 1), where L_t^k counts how often arm k appeared in normal exploration. If α_t^k is set too small too quickly, the agent may not select the desired arm, triggering excessive binary searches.

### Mechanism 2: Breaking Rule with β_t Parameter
The breaking rule determines when to terminate exploration and output the estimated optimal scoring rule while guaranteeing (ε, δ)-optimality. The algorithm terminates when 2(B_S + B_u)·I_q^t(k*_t) ≤ β_t, where I_q^t is the confidence radius for belief distribution estimates and β_t = ε⁻²α_{k*_t}^t(B_S+B_u)/(1-α_{k*_t}^t). This ensures the gap h(S*) - h(Ŝ*) ≤ ε with probability ≥ 1-δ. If β_t is set too aggressively (large), the algorithm may terminate before achieving ε-accuracy.

### Mechanism 3: UCB-LP (Linear Programming with Confidence Bounds)
The principal-agent optimization problem reduces to a sequence of linear programs with upper confidence bounds. For each arm k, UCB-LP_k,t maximizes û_k^t + B_u·I_q^t(k) - v subject to payment constraints v - û_t^S(k') ≥ Ĉ_t(k,k') - (I_c^t(k,k') + B_S·I_q^t(k')). This provides an optimistic estimate of h(S*_k) while ensuring incentive compatibility constraints. If confidence bounds are too loose, UCB-LP may become overly optimistic, wasting samples on suboptimal arms.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Proper Scoring Rules**
  - **Why needed here:** Proper scoring rules incentivize truthful belief reporting by the agent (E[S(ω,σ)] ≥ E[S(ω,σ̂)] for all σ̂). This is critical because the principal's decision depends on the agent's reported belief.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a proper scoring rule guarantees truthful reporting is optimal for a risk-neutral agent?

- **Concept: Best Arm Identification (Fixed Confidence vs Fixed Budget)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper directly parallels MAB best-arm identification but with the added complexity of incentivizing agent actions. Understanding the difference between sample complexity bounds (fixed confidence) and error probability bounds (fixed budget) is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the fundamental difference in algorithm design between fixed-confidence and fixed-budget best arm identification?

- **Concept: Principal-Agent Games and Incentive Compatibility**
  - **Why needed here:** The agent selects actions to maximize expected payment minus cost. The principal cannot directly choose arms but must design scoring rules that make the optimal arm the agent's best response. This is a Stackelberg game formulation.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is the action-informed oracle assumption necessary for learning, and what would fail without it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Oracle Interface -> Estimator Module -> UCB-LP Solver -> Sampling Policy -> Binary Search Module -> Termination Checker

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialization: Collect K samples using oracle rules
  2. Main loop: Solve UCB-LP → compute S_t → observe agent response → update estimators
  3. Deviation handling: Trigger binary search if k_t ≠ k*_t
  4. Termination: Return S_t when breaking condition satisfied

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Larger α_t^k reduces forced exploration (binary search rounds) but increases normal exploration rounds needed for estimation accuracy
  - Instance-dependent bounds require knowing/approximating gaps Δ_k; instance-independent bounds are looser but require no gap knowledge
  - Fixed-confidence setting adapts to instance difficulty; fixed-budget must pre-specify budget based on worst-case complexity

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Excessive binary search rounds (τ₂ >> τ₁): α_t^k decays too fast or confidence radii too tight
  - Non-termination: β_t too conservative or belief distribution learning stalled
  - Infeasible UCB-LP: Confidence bounds inconsistent, may need to fall back to oracle rule
  - High simple regret: Agent strategically misreporting (violation of proper scoring rule assumption)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Synthetic validation with known ground truth:** Create an environment with K=5 arms, M=10 beliefs, known q_k and C(k,k'). Verify OIAFC achieves (ε, δ)-condition with sample complexity matching theoretical bound within log factors. Track τ₁ vs τ₂ decomposition.
  2. **Ablation on α_t^k schedule:** Compare the paper's α_t^k = min(√M/L_t^k, 1) against baselines: constant α, α = 1 (pure oracle), α = 0 (pure UCB-LP). Measure sample complexity and (ε, δ)-achievement rate.
  3. **Stress test on belief set cardinality M:** Scale M from 5 to 100 while fixing K=5. Verify sample complexity scales as Õ(M) per theory, and identify where numerical issues in UCB-LP or binary search emerge.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the Best Scoring Rule Identification framework be extended to settings involving multiple agents?
- **Basis in paper:** The conclusion states: "A promising avenue for future work would be to extend the Best Scoring Rule Identification framework to more complex multi-agent environments, as explored in Cacciamani et al. (2023)."
- **Why unresolved:** The current theoretical analysis and algorithms (OIAFC, OIAFB) are designed strictly for a single principal and a single agent.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An algorithm and theoretical sample complexity bounds for a model involving one principal interacting with multiple agents simultaneously or sequentially.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does a lower bound exist that matches the instance-dependent upper bound provided for OIAFC?
- **Basis in paper:** Theorem 1 claims the result is "near-optimal" and Remark 4 aligns the result with standard MAB bounds, but the paper does not provide a formal lower bound proof for this specific principal-agent information acquisition setting.
- **Why unresolved:** While upper bounds suggest efficiency, only a matching lower bound can confirm that the Õ(ε⁻²B²SMHΔ) sample complexity is fundamental to the problem class.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A formal derivation of a lower bound that scales identically with the problem complexity HΔ and gap parameters Δ_k.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can instance-dependent sample complexity be achieved for the fixed-budget setting (OIAFB)?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper provides instance-dependent bounds for OIAFC (Theorem 1) but only provides instance-independent bounds for OIAFB (Theorem 2), leaving the instance-dependent efficiency of the fixed-budget algorithm uncharacterized.
- **Why unresolved:** The analysis for OIAFB focuses on bounding the error probability given a fixed budget, rather than optimizing sample count based on reward gaps Δ_k.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A theoretical analysis of OIAFB (or a variant) yielding an error probability bound that depends inversely on the reward gaps Δ_k.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How does the sample complexity scale if the belief set Σ or observation set O is continuous rather than finite?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper explicitly assumes O is finite with C_O observations and defines M (belief set size) as finite (M ≤ K × C_O) to apply Lemma 6 (concentration for empirical distribution).
- **Why unresolved:** The proposed algorithms rely on finite support for concentration inequalities; extending this to continuous spaces would require different estimation techniques and complexity metrics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An algorithm capable of handling continuous beliefs and a sample complexity bound that accounts for the dimensionality or covering number of the belief space.

## Limitations

- **Oracle Assumption Dependency:** The algorithm's performance critically relies on the existence of an action-informed oracle with guaranteed gap ε, which the paper assumes but does not construct or verify.
- **Scalability to Large M:** The sample complexity scales as O(M), which becomes prohibitive for large belief sets, and the paper lacks empirical validation on problems with M >> K.
- **Practical Performance Validation:** While theoretical bounds are provided, the paper lacks empirical validation on synthetic or real-world problems, and key implementation details like the action-informed oracle construction are unspecified.

## Confidence

- **Algorithm Correctness and Theoretical Guarantees:** High - The mathematical derivations appear sound with proper use of concentration inequalities and bandit analysis techniques.
- **Practical Performance and Implementation:** Medium - Theoretical bounds are provided, but practical performance and key implementation details are unverified.
- **Novelty and Improvement Over Prior Work:** Medium - The paper builds on established MAB techniques but adapts them to the principal-agent setting; the degree of improvement is unclear without empirical comparison.

## Next Checks

1. **Synthetic Problem Validation:** Create a synthetic environment with K=5 arms and M=10 beliefs where all parameters are known. Implement OIAFC and verify it achieves (ε, δ)-optimality with sample complexity matching theoretical bounds within log factors. Track the decomposition of τ₁ (normal exploration) vs τ₂ (binary search) rounds.

2. **Oracle Assumption Stress Test:** Implement multiple oracle construction strategies with varying gap properties (some with ε-gaps, others with smaller gaps). Measure how OIAFC performance degrades as oracle gap quality decreases, and test whether the algorithm gracefully handles cases where Assumption 1 is violated.

3. **Fixed-Budget Setting Validation:** Implement OIAFB and compare its error probability performance against OIAFC run with equivalent total samples. Verify that OIAFB achieves the claimed error probability bounds and investigate whether the fixed-budget constraint leads to premature termination in challenging instances.
