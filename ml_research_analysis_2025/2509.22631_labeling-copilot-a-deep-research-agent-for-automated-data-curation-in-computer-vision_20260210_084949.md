# LABELING COPILOT: A Deep Research Agent for Automated Data Curation in Computer Vision

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.22631
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22631
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Automated computer vision dataset curation via an agentic framework integrating discovery (active learning + OOD), synthesis (diffusion models), and consensus annotation (multi-model ensemble).

## Executive Summary
Labeling Copilot is an autonomous agent for computer vision dataset curation that integrates data discovery, controllable synthesis, and consensus annotation into a unified workflow. It uses multi-model weak supervision with non-maximum suppression variants to produce high-quality labels at scale. The consensus annotation module discovered 903 new bounding box categories on Open Images and achieved a 37.1% mAP on dense COCO, averaging 14.2 candidate proposals per image—nearly double the ground-truth count. The calibrated discovery tool, employing active learning and OOD detection, was shown to be up to 40x more computationally efficient than alternatives while maintaining sample efficiency. The modular, agentic design enables iterative, domain-agnostic data curation for industrial-scale datasets.

## Method Summary
Labeling Copilot is a multi-agent orchestration system that combines discovery, synthesis, and consensus annotation for automated dataset curation. The core workflow is controlled by an LMLM orchestrator that coordinates specialized agents. The discovery agent uses active learning (K-Center Greedy, Margin/Representative sampling) with FAISS indexing and OOD filtering via GMM typicality estimation to identify informative samples. The synthesis agent employs diffusion models for controllable data generation. The consensus annotation agent runs an ensemble of DETIC, GroundingDINO, and OWL-ViT, fusing their outputs using IoU-based support matching and voting, followed by Soft-NMS and DIoU-NMS. The system was validated on COCO, Open Images, and Pascal VOC, achieving 37.1% mAP with 14.2 proposals per image and discovering 903 new categories on Open Images.

## Key Results
- Consensus annotation achieved 37.1% mAP on dense COCO with 14.2 proposals per image
- Discovered 903 new bounding box categories on Open Images
- Discovery tool demonstrated 40x computational efficiency gain over alternatives
- FAISS-based indexing with K-Center Greedy sampling maintained high sample efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by treating dataset curation as an iterative, multi-agent process where each component addresses a specific bottleneck. The orchestrator (LMLM) enables flexible decision-making across heterogeneous tools. Multi-model consensus annotation leverages complementary strengths of different detectors to maximize recall while voting-based fusion filters false positives. Active learning with OOD detection ensures sample efficiency by prioritizing informative, diverse examples. The modular design allows independent optimization and scaling of each component.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-model weak supervision:** Using multiple imperfect models to generate higher-quality labels through consensus. Why needed: Single models have blind spots; ensemble improves coverage. Quick check: Compare mAP of single vs. ensemble models.
- **Active learning with K-Center Greedy:** Selecting diverse, representative samples to maximize information gain. Why needed: Reduces labeling cost while maintaining quality. Quick check: Verify diversity metric on selected vs. random samples.
- **FAISS indexing for large-scale similarity search:** Efficient approximate nearest neighbor search for candidate selection. Why needed: Enables real-time candidate pooling at industrial scale. Quick check: Measure query time vs. dataset size.
- **GMM-based OOD detection:** Identifying samples that don't fit the current distribution. Why needed: Prevents model collapse to known patterns. Quick check: Verify typicality scores on synthetic outliers.
- **Soft-NMS for proposal refinement:** Decaying scores instead of hard suppression to preserve overlapping objects. Why needed: Improves recall for dense scenes. Quick check: Compare AP vs. IoU threshold.
- **DIoU-NMS for localization accuracy:** Using distance information in suppression. Why needed: Better handles occlusion and partial overlap. Quick check: Measure localization error vs. standard NMS.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Orchestrator (LMLM) -> Discovery Agent -> Synthesis Agent -> Consensus Annotation Agent -> Data Curation
- **Critical path:** Orchestrator selects samples → Discovery identifies informative candidates → Synthesis generates synthetic data if needed → Consensus annotates with ensemble → Curated dataset produced
- **Design tradeoffs:** High recall vs. precision in annotation; computational efficiency vs. sample quality in discovery; synthetic data diversity vs. fidelity
- **Failure signatures:** Low mAP indicates consensus implementation issues; scalability problems suggest FAISS indexing problems; poor sample efficiency indicates AL/OOD parameter issues
- **First experiments:** 1) Validate consensus annotation fusion on COCO, 2) Test FAISS discovery pipeline on 100K subset, 3) Implement and verify OOD filtering via GMM typicality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1:** How does training on datasets curated by Labeling Copilot compare to training on human-curated datasets in terms of downstream model convergence speed and generalization? The paper uses a data-centric evaluation protocol but doesn't benchmark target vision models trained on the curated datasets against standard baselines.

**Open Question 2:** Can the consensus annotation mechanism be refined to improve precision (currently ~0.48 on COCO) without compromising the high recall achieved by the multi-model ensemble? The system averages 14.2 proposals per image to maximize discovery, but the precision-recall tradeoff remains challenging.

**Open Question 3:** To what extent can the automated selection of synthesis models and prompts replace the need for human expert validation in the loop? While normalized scores are used for automated selection, human experts currently validate final hyperparameters for high-fidelity generation in niche domains.

## Limitations
- Missing critical hyperparameters for consensus annotation (IoU thresholds, NMS parameters) and discovery (typicality thresholds, neighborhood sizes)
- Orchestrator implementation details (specific LMLM model and prompting strategy) not specified
- No downstream model training experiments to validate curated dataset quality
- Synthetic data generation process for scaling tests lacks implementation details

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Modular architecture design and general workflow are clearly specified; ensemble consensus mechanism is well-defined
- **Medium Confidence:** Reported annotation quality (37.1% mAP, 14.2 proposals/image) and discovery efficiency (40x gain) can be validated with inferred parameters
- **Low Confidence:** Complete orchestration logic and specific model checkpoints are unknown; synthetic data generation process unclear

## Next Checks
1. Implement and validate the consensus annotation fusion module using DETIC, GroundingDINO, and OWL-ViT on COCO and Open Images. Compare mAP and proposal count against Table I to verify IoU-based support matching and Soft/DIoU-NMS implementation.
2. Reconstruct the FAISS-based discovery pipeline (IVF/PQ/HNSW) with K-Center Greedy and Margin/Representative sampling. Test on a 100K image subset to verify OOD filtering via GMM typicality estimation and measure sample efficiency (AUC) vs. random baseline.
3. Request or infer missing hyperparameters from authors: LMLM model/variant, IoU thresholds, NMS parameters, OOD threshold, and AL candidate pool size. Validate annotation module first with assumed defaults before full pipeline integration.
