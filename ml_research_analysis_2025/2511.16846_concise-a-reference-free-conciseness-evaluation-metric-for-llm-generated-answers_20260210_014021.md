# ConCISE: A Reference-Free Conciseness Evaluation Metric for LLM-Generated Answers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16846
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16846
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Reference-free conciseness metric achieving 94% pairwise accuracy vs human preferences

## Executive Summary
ConCISE addresses the challenge of evaluating conciseness in LLM-generated answers without requiring reference answers. The metric quantifies non-essential content by measuring compression ratios across three techniques: abstractive summarization, extractive summarization, and word-removal pruning. By averaging these three compression ratios, ConCISE provides a reference-free score that correlates strongly with human judgments of answer verbosity.

## Method Summary
ConCISE calculates conciseness by generating three compressed versions of each answer using LLM-based techniques: abstractive summaries, extractive summaries, and word-removal pruning. Each compression ratio is computed as 1 minus the word count reduction divided by the original word count. The final ConCISE score is the average of these three ratios, with negative values clipped to zero. The method validates semantic equivalence of compressed versions through a secondary LLM prompt before scoring. Evaluation uses the WikiEval dataset with human-annotated verbosity ratings, measuring Spearman correlation and pairwise accuracy against human preferences.

## Key Results
- Strong correlation with human judgments: Spearman's r=0.628, Kendall's τ=0.523
- High pairwise accuracy: 94% agreement with human preferences for answer conciseness
- Effective reference-free evaluation: demonstrates LLMs can identify redundant content without gold standards

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The metric leverages LLM's inherent ability to distinguish essential from non-essential content through compression. By using multiple compression techniques (abstractive, extractive, and word-removal), ConCISE captures different aspects of verbosity that humans perceive as unnecessary. The semantic verification step ensures compressed versions maintain meaning while reducing word count, making the compression ratios meaningful indicators of conciseness.

## Foundational Learning
- **Compression ratio calculation**: Measuring reduction in word count relative to original length (why: quantifies verbosity objectively; quick check: verify ratio calculation matches paper formula)
- **Semantic equivalence verification**: Ensuring compressed text preserves original meaning (why: prevents invalid compression from skewing results; quick check: review verification prompt effectiveness)
- **Reference-free evaluation**: Scoring without gold standard answers (why: enables practical deployment on new data; quick check: test on unseen question-answer pairs)

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Answer → Three compressions (abstractive, extractive, word-removal) → Semantic verification → Compression ratios → ConCISE score
- **Critical path**: Original answer → LLM compression generation → Semantic verification → Ratio calculation → Final score
- **Design tradeoffs**: Equal weighting of three compression methods vs. optimizing weights based on individual performance; simplicity vs. potential accuracy gains
- **Failure signatures**: Negative compression ratios (handle by clipping to zero), semantic drift in compressed outputs (handle through verification), compression outputs longer than original
- **3 first experiments**:
  1. Run single answer through all three compression methods and verify semantic equivalence
  2. Calculate individual compression ratios and compare with expected values
  3. Test negative value clipping by intentionally generating longer compressed versions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Metric quality bounded by underlying LLM compression capabilities
- Equal weighting assumption for three compression methods lacks empirical validation
- Evaluation limited to Wikipedia-based Q&A domain, may not generalize to other domains

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Correlation results with human judgments (Spearman 0.628, Kendall's 0.523) and pairwise accuracy (94%)
- **Medium confidence**: Practical utility for real-world applications beyond Wikipedia domain
- **Low confidence**: Robustness across different LLM architectures and versions

## Next Checks
1. Test ConCISE sensitivity by running experiments with multiple generations of the same LLM to assess stability
2. Conduct ablation studies to optimize weighting of the three compression methods
3. Validate cross-domain generalization by applying ConCISE to non-Wikipedia datasets and comparing correlation patterns
