# AutoML Algorithms for Online Generalized Additive Model Selection: Application to Electricity Demand Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.24019
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24019
- Reference count: 8
- Key outcome: DRAGON-based joint optimization achieves 54% RMSE improvement over handcrafted models for French electricity demand forecasting

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing electricity demand forecasting models by automating the selection of both the formula and hyperparameters for adaptive Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The authors propose using the DRAGON package, originally designed for neural architecture search, to efficiently explore the search space of GAM formulae and adaptation parameters. They encode the GAM structure using DRAGON's building blocks and adapt its search operators to prevent duplicate effects and ensure interpretability. The approach is evaluated on French electricity demand forecasting, demonstrating that simultaneously optimizing both the formula and adaptation parameter using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) significantly outperforms handcrafted models and methods that optimize them separately.

## Method Summary
The authors adapted DRAGON, a neural architecture search framework, for GAM formula selection by encoding GAM structures using DRAGON's building blocks. They modified DRAGON's search operators to prevent duplicate effects and maintain interpretability. The approach uses evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize both the GAM formula structure and adaptation parameters. This joint optimization is applied to French electricity demand forecasting data, where the framework automatically explores different GAM configurations to find optimal forecasting models.

## Key Results
- Joint optimization of GAM formula and adaptation parameters achieved 54% RMSE improvement over state-of-the-art handcrafted models
- DRAGON-based approach outperformed methods that optimize formula and parameters separately
- Evolutionary algorithm successfully explored search space while maintaining model interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The joint optimization approach works by simultaneously exploring both structural and parametric dimensions of GAMs, which are traditionally optimized separately. By adapting DRAGON's neural architecture search framework, the method can efficiently navigate the complex combinatorial space of possible GAM formulae while ensuring interpretability through carefully designed search operators that prevent duplicate effects. The evolutionary algorithm provides a robust optimization mechanism that can handle the non-convex search landscape typical of model selection problems.

## Foundational Learning

**Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)** - Why needed: Understanding the basic framework that the paper aims to optimize automatically. Quick check: Can you explain how GAMs differ from linear regression?

**Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** - Why needed: The DRAGON framework's adaptation forms the core methodological contribution. Quick check: What are the key components of a typical NAS framework?

**Evolutionary Algorithms** - Why needed: The optimization mechanism used for joint formula and parameter search. Quick check: How do evolutionary algorithms handle multi-objective optimization problems?

**Electricity Demand Forecasting** - Why needed: The specific application domain with its unique characteristics. Quick check: What are the main challenges in short-term electricity demand forecasting?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Preprocessing -> DRAGON Encoding -> Evolutionary Search -> GAM Training -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The most time-consuming components are the evolutionary search and GAM training phases, as they involve multiple model evaluations across the search space.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The adaptation of DRAGON for GAMs required balancing search space expressiveness with computational efficiency. The choice of evolutionary algorithms over gradient-based methods prioritizes global optimization capability over local refinement speed.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate insufficient search space coverage, inappropriate encoding of GAM structures, or convergence issues in the evolutionary algorithm. Interpretability problems suggest the search operators are not effectively preventing duplicate effects.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate the encoding scheme by testing whether all basic GAM structures can be represented
2. Benchmark the evolutionary algorithm's convergence rate on simplified search spaces
3. Test the joint optimization approach on synthetic data with known optimal structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Single-dataset validation on French electricity demand data limits generalizability to other regions and forecasting contexts
- The computational efficiency claims lack systematic benchmarking against alternative GAM optimization frameworks
- The interpretability guarantees rely on search operator constraints that lack formal verification across the full search space

## Confidence

**Encoding scheme validity**: Medium - The encoding approach was not systematically validated against alternative representations
**Generalizability claims**: Low - Based on single-dataset evaluation without cross-regional validation
**Computational efficiency claims**: Medium - Demonstrated on a single use case without comprehensive benchmarking
**Interpretability guarantees**: Medium - Relies on search operator constraints demonstrated through examples but not formally verified

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the joint optimization approach on electricity demand data from at least three different countries/regions to assess generalizability of the 54% improvement claim.

2. **Alternative encoding comparison**: Implement and compare at least two different GAM formula encoding schemes within the DRAGON framework to quantify the impact of representation choices on search performance.

3. **Scalability assessment**: Evaluate the computational efficiency and search performance on progressively larger feature sets (e.g., 10, 50, 100 features) to establish practical limits of the approach.
