# Explainability, risk modeling, and segmentation based customer churn analytics for personalized retention in e-commerce

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11604
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11604
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: XGBoost achieves 0.964 accuracy and 0.952 recall in e-commerce churn prediction with explainable SHAP features, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and RFM segmentation for targeted retention.

## Executive Summary
This study develops a comprehensive framework to address customer churn in e-commerce through integrated predictive modeling, explainability, survival analysis, and behavioral segmentation. The XGBoost classifier emerges as the best-performing model, achieving high accuracy and recall while maintaining low cross-validation variance. SHAP analysis identifies tenure, complaint history, cashback amount, and distance to warehouse as key churn drivers. Kaplan-Meier survival curves reveal a steep early churn risk that stabilizes after six months, highlighting critical intervention windows. RFM segmentation enables personalized retention strategies across distinct customer cohorts. Together, these components provide actionable insights into why churn occurs, when to intervene, and which customers to prioritize, offering a practical approach to reducing attrition and enhancing loyalty.

## Method Summary
The study integrates explainable AI, survival analysis, and RFM-based segmentation to predict and reduce e-commerce customer churn. The methodology begins with data preprocessing including iterative imputation for numerical features, median imputation for HourSpendOnApp, one-hot encoding for categorical variables with ≤5 categories, and Mahalanobis distance-based outlier removal at p≤0.001. An 80/20 stratified split separates training and testing data. Five models are benchmarked: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost, with XGBoost selected for its superior performance. TreeSHAP provides global and local feature attributions to explain churn predictions. Kaplan-Meier survival curves analyze temporal churn patterns, while RFM scoring creates customer segments for targeted retention actions.

## Key Results
- XGBoost achieves 0.964 accuracy, 0.952 recall, 0.847 precision, and 0.896 F1-score on e-commerce churn prediction.
- SHAP analysis identifies tenure, complaint history, cashback amount, and distance to warehouse as the most influential churn drivers.
- Kaplan-Meier survival curves show steep early churn decline from 0.95 at onboarding to 0.86-0.88 by month 6, stabilizing thereafter.
- RFM segmentation creates distinct cohorts (Best, New, Lost, Promising) for personalized retention strategies.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** TreeSHAP-based explainability enables identification of actionable churn drivers when applied to gradient-boosted tree models.
- **Mechanism:** SHAP values decompose predictions into feature-level contributions by computing Shapley values from cooperative game theory. For tree ensembles, TreeSHAP exploits tree structure for exact polynomial-time computation rather than approximation. The mean absolute SHAP value `Imp(j) = (1/n) Σ|φᵢⱼ|` quantifies each feature's average influence on model output.
- **Core assumption:** Post-hoc feature attributions faithfully represent the model's decision logic and generalize to business-leveragable interventions (not causally validated in this study).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "SHAP analysis revealed that tenure, complaint history, cashback amount, and distance to warehouse are the most influential features affecting churn, enabling interpretable predictions."
  - [section IV.A] "Higher Tenure is associated with negative SHAP values, indicating a lower propensity to churn. Customers who have lodged a Complain show positive SHAP contributions, increasing churn risk."
  - [corpus] Related work (Asif et al. 2025 in Results in Engineering) demonstrates SHAP quantifying feature contributions to churn risk in telecommunications, showing revenue and regularity positively associated with churn (+0.21, +0.06).
- **Break condition:** If SHAP explanations exhibit high instability across similar instances, or if feature importance rankings shift significantly under distribution drift, the explainability layer loses reliability for intervention design.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Kaplan-Meier survival curves characterize temporal churn dynamics, revealing when intervention windows are most critical.
- **Mechanism:** The Kaplan-Meier estimator `Ŝ(t) = Π_{tⱼ≤t}(1 - dⱼ/nⱼ)` computes non-parametric survival probability by multiplying conditional survival rates at each observed event time, naturally handling right-censored observations (customers still active at study end). The resulting curve shows retention probability over tenure.
- **Core assumption:** Historical churn timing patterns remain predictive of future intervention windows; censoring mechanism is non-informative.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Kaplan-Meier survival curves highlighted a steep early churn risk with stabilization beyond 6 months, indicating critical intervention windows."
  - [section IV.B] "The Kaplan-Meier survival curve shows a steep early decline, from about 0.95 at onboarding to approximately 0.86–0.88 by month 6, followed by a slower decrease... These dynamics indicate front-loaded churn in early tenure with greater stability thereafter."
  - [corpus] Periáñez et al. (2016 IEEE DSAA) applied survival ensemble models to predict survival probability and time-to-churn in online gaming. Masarifoglu and Buyuklu applied Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards to telecom churn—no comparable e-commerce survival literature found.
- **Break condition:** If churn timing distribution shifts seasonally or due to market changes, the survival curve requires re-estimation; intervention windows derived from historical data may misalign.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** RFM-based segmentation translates transactional behavior into actionable customer cohorts for prioritized retention.
- **Mechanism:** RFM scoring assigns quantitative values to recency (time since last purchase), frequency (purchase count), and monetary (total spend). Customers are then clustered or scored into segments (e.g., Best, New, Lost, Promising) based on combined RFM profiles. Each segment maps to tailored intervention strategies.
- **Core assumption:** RFM dimensions capture the behavioral heterogeneity relevant to churn risk; segment-treatment effects are sufficiently homogeneous within segments.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "RFM segmentation further identified distinct customer cohorts (e.g., Best, New, Lost) for targeted retention actions."
  - [section IV.C] "New and Promising segments... can benefit from personalized welcome campaigns... Lost or Lost Potential customers require personalized win-back initiatives... Best and Loyal customers may be engaged with loyalty rewards."
  - [corpus] Christy et al. (2021, Journal of King Saud University) validate RFM ranking effectiveness for customer segmentation. Doğan et al. (2018) demonstrate RFM clustering in retail. No corpus evidence directly validates RFM-to-retention-outcome linkage in e-commerce.
- **Break condition:** If segment boundaries are arbitrary or if customers within segments respond heterogeneously to interventions, the segmentation-to-action mapping fails; consider continuous scoring or alternative clustering features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Shapley Values and SHAP**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how TreeSHAP decomposes predictions into feature contributions is essential for interpreting churn drivers and debugging explainability outputs.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a customer with high tenure and a recent complaint, which feature would you expect to push churn probability up vs. down, based on SHAP direction?

- **Concept: Censoring in Survival Analysis**
  - **Why needed here:** Kaplan-Meier requires understanding right-censoring—customers who haven't churned by study end contribute partial information. Incorrect censoring handling biases survival estimates.
  - **Quick check question:** If 30% of customers are right-censored at month 12, how does this affect median lifetime estimation if Ŝ(t) never drops below 0.5?

- **Concept: RFM Scoring vs. Clustering**
  - **Why needed here:** RFM segments can be defined via rule-based scoring (e.g., quintiles) or unsupervised clustering. Choice affects segment granularity and business interpretability.
  - **Quick check question:** A customer purchased yesterday but only once with low spend—which RFM segment would they likely fall into, and what retention action is appropriate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** E-commerce dataset → preprocessing (imputation, outlier removal, encoding) → XGBoost classifier → TreeSHAP explainability → Kaplan-Meier survival curves → RFM segmentation → segment-specific retention strategies

- **Critical path:** Data preprocessing → model selection (high recall, low variance) → SHAP analysis (intervention levers) → survival analysis (intervention timing) → RFM segmentation (intervention targets) → integrated retention playbook

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Recall vs. precision: Paper prioritizes recall (0.952) to avoid missing at-risk customers; this increases false positives and potential intervention costs.
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability: XGBoost chosen over deep learning for balance of accuracy and TreeSHAP compatibility.
  - Static vs. dynamic modeling: Current framework is batch-mode; real-time deployment would require incremental SHAP updates and survival curve re-estimation.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High cross-validation variance → model overfitting or data instability
  - SHAP values concentrated near zero → model not learning meaningful patterns
  - Survival curve shows no early decline → possible data quality issue or churn definition mismatch
  - RFM segments highly imbalanced → scoring thresholds may need recalibration

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline validation:** Reproduce XGBoost performance (accuracy 0.964, recall 0.952) on held-out test set; verify cross-validation variance < 0.02 across 5 folds.
  2. **Explainability sanity check:** Run TreeSHAP on 100 random instances; confirm tenure shows negative SHAP values for high-tenure customers and complaint history shows positive SHAP values for complainants.
  3. **Survival curve replication:** Generate Kaplan-Meier curve on training data; verify ~10 percentage point survival decline from onboarding to month 6, with stabilization thereafter.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can survival analysis techniques, specifically Cox proportional hazards regression, effectively quantify churn risk factors in diverse e-commerce contexts beyond the single dataset analyzed?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state, "no published survival analysis literature addresses e-commerce, leaving a significant gap in the literature."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current study establishes the utility of Kaplan-Meier analysis but the authors explicitly note the lack of broader literature applying these time-to-event methods to the e-commerce domain.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful application and validation of multivariate survival models on external, heterogeneous e-commerce datasets showing significant hazard ratios for domain-specific features.

- **Open Question 2:** How does accounting for temporal dynamics, such as seasonality and product lifecycles, impact the stability of the identified early-churn intervention window?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The introduction identifies "seasonality" and "product lifecycle" as factors making "static churn prediction models less effective," yet the methodology utilizes a static dataset.
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper identifies a "steep early churn risk" using static data but does not test if this curve shifts when temporal variables are included.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A longitudinal study comparing the proposed static Kaplan-Meier curve against a time-varying survival model that incorporates seasonal and lifecycle covariates.

- **Open Question 3:** What is the marginal reduction in customer attrition achieved by implementing the proposed SHAP-informed interventions compared to standard heuristic strategies?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The study proposes "personalized retention strategies" derived from SHAP explanations but lacks empirical measurement of their actual impact on churn reduction.
  - **Why unresolved:** The framework validates predictive accuracy and explanatory coherence but does not validate the causal effectiveness of the resulting business actions.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Field experiment results (e.g., A/B testing) measuring retention rates for customers targeted via SHAP-driven insights versus those targeted by traditional RFM-only strategies.

## Limitations

- Feature attribution explanations (SHAP) and segment-treatment effectiveness lack experimental validation or causal analysis.
- Survival curve applicability assumes historical churn timing patterns persist without testing for seasonal or market shifts.
- RFM segment definitions and their retention effectiveness are unspecified, limiting replication fidelity.
- External validity is constrained by reliance on a single e-commerce dataset.
- Analysis does not account for dynamic behavioral changes over time.

## Confidence

- **High:** XGBoost model performance metrics (accuracy 0.964, recall 0.952) and data preprocessing steps (imputation, outlier removal, encoding).
- **Medium:** TreeSHAP feature importance rankings and Kaplan-Meier survival curve interpretation.
- **Low:** Causal impact of identified features on churn, segment-treatment mapping effectiveness, and generalizability beyond the specific dataset.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a prospective validation by deploying the model and measuring actual intervention outcomes across identified segments to test causal impact.
2. Perform temporal validation by retraining on rolling time windows and monitoring survival curve shifts to detect distribution drift.
3. Replicate RFM segmentation thresholds and test segment stability under perturbed scoring rules to assess sensitivity.
