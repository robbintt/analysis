- Multi-LLM framework achieves superior caption quality in scientific documents

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MLBCAP, a multi-LLM collaborative framework for generating captions in scientific documents. The approach addresses limitations of existing methods that treat caption generation as either image-to-text or text summarization problems. MLBCAP integrates both textual and visual information through three key modules: quality assessment, diverse caption generation, and judgment. The framework employs multiple LLMs including GPT-4o, LLaMA-3-8B, Yi-1.5-9B, and Pegasus to generate candidate captions, with a final judgment module selecting the optimal output. Human evaluations demonstrate that informative captions produced by MLBCAP rank better than human-written captions, highlighting its effectiveness.

## Method Summary
The MLBCAP framework processes scientific figures through a three-stage pipeline. First, a quality assessment module uses a fine-tuned LLaVA model to filter out low-quality training captions. Second, the diverse caption generation module employs multiple LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaMA-3-8B, Yi-1.5-9B, and Pegasus) to generate candidate captions from both visual and textual inputs. Finally, the judgment module uses GPT-4o to select the best candidate caption and refine it for accuracy and coherence. This collaborative approach leverages the strengths of different LLMs while mitigating individual model limitations through systematic quality control and selection mechanisms.

## Key Results
- MLBCAP generates scientific figure captions that outperform human-written captions on informativeness metrics
- The framework demonstrates improved caption quality through systematic quality assessment and diverse generation
- Human evaluations show MLBCAP captions rank higher than human-generated captions for scientific figure descriptions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-LLM collaborative approach works by leveraging complementary strengths of different language models while incorporating both visual and textual information from scientific documents. The quality assessment module filters noise from training data, ensuring only high-quality examples inform the generation process. Diverse caption generation produces multiple candidate captions, increasing the likelihood of capturing relevant scientific information. The judgment module acts as a meta-learner, selecting the most appropriate caption while refining for accuracy and coherence. This systematic integration of multiple models and quality control mechanisms addresses the complexity of scientific figure captioning better than single-model approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- Quality assessment in LLM outputs: Why needed - To filter noise and ensure training data quality; Quick check - Measure precision/recall of low-quality caption detection
- Multi-modal scientific document understanding: Why needed - Scientific figures contain complex visual and textual relationships; Quick check - Evaluate caption accuracy against figure content
- Meta-learning for caption selection: Why needed - Different LLMs have varying strengths for different caption types; Quick check - Compare selected vs. unselected captions for informativeness
- Scientific domain adaptation: Why needed - General captioning models may miss domain-specific terminology; Quick check - Measure domain-specific term accuracy in generated captions
- Human evaluation protocols for caption quality: Why needed - Automated metrics may not capture informativeness; Quick check - Establish inter-rater reliability scores
- Fine-tuning vision-language models: Why needed - Base models may not handle scientific figure quality assessment; Quick check - Compare fine-tuned vs. base model performance on caption filtering

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Quality Assessment -> Diverse Caption Generation -> Judgment Module

Critical Path:
Scientific figure and text input → Quality assessment filtering → Multiple LLM generation → GPT-4o selection and refinement → Final caption output

Design Tradeoffs:
The framework trades computational efficiency for quality by using multiple LLMs and a judgment layer. While this increases resource requirements, it enables superior caption quality through collaborative generation and systematic selection. The choice of GPT-4o for final judgment leverages its strong reasoning capabilities but introduces dependency on a single high-cost model.

Failure Signatures:
- Poor quality assessment may allow noisy training data to influence generation
- Inconsistent diverse generation could lead to redundant candidate captions
- Judgment module bias toward certain caption styles may reduce diversity
- Failure to capture domain-specific terminology may result in generic captions
- Over-refinement by judgment module might introduce hallucinated details

3 First Experiments:
1. Ablation study removing quality assessment module to measure impact on final caption quality
2. Comparison of different LLM combinations in diverse generation module
3. Evaluation of judgment module performance with different selection criteria

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed evaluation methodology and statistical significance measures
- Potential evaluator bias in human assessments due to unclear rater training procedures
- No comparison with other state-of-the-art scientific figure captioning approaches
- Evaluation metrics not fully specified, making it difficult to assess relative quality dimensions

## Confidence
- Multi-LLM collaboration improves caption quality: Medium
- MLBCAP captions rank better than human-written captions: Medium
- Systematic integration of quality control and selection mechanisms: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a double-blind human evaluation with detailed inter-rater reliability measures and clear evaluation criteria
2. Implement ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of each module (quality assessment, diverse generation, and judgment) to overall performance
3. Compare MLBCAP's performance against other recent scientific figure captioning approaches using standardized benchmark datasets and metrics
