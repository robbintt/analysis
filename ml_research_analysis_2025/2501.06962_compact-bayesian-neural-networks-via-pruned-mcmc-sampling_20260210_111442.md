# Compact Bayesian Neural Networks via pruned MCMC sampling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.06962
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06962
- Reference count: 40
- This study proposes a novel pruning strategy that leverages Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to identify and remove redundant parameters from BNNs, achieving over 75% reduction in network size while maintaining or improving generalization performance.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of developing compact Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) that retain uncertainty quantification while significantly reducing model size. The authors propose a novel pruning strategy that leverages Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to identify and remove redundant parameters from BNNs. The method uses signal-to-noise and signal-plus-noise ratios to assess parameter importance during post-training pruning, followed by resampling to refine the compact model. Experiments on benchmark regression and classification datasets demonstrate that the approach achieves over 75% reduction in network size while maintaining or improving generalization performance. The pruned models also show better convergence and uncertainty estimates compared to unpruned networks.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines Bayesian inference with network pruning to create compact BNNs. It uses Langevin MCMC to sample from the posterior distribution of network weights, then applies signal-to-noise (STN) or signal-plus-noise (SPN) ratios to identify and prune low-importance weights. After pruning, the method performs resampling by restarting MCMC on the remaining weights to recover any lost accuracy. The approach is applied to both regression and classification tasks using benchmark datasets, with experiments comparing pruned models against unpruned baselines and random pruning approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieved over 75% reduction in network size while maintaining or improving generalization performance
- Pruned models showed better convergence and uncertainty estimates compared to unpruned networks
- Real-world applications on coral reef lithology classification datasets validated the method's effectiveness in complex, multi-class scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** If structured pruning criteria (STN/SPN) are used to identify low-importance weights, the network can maintain generalization performance significantly better than random pruning at high sparsity levels (e.g., 75%).
- **Mechanism:** The Signal-to-Noise (STN) and Signal-Plus-Noise (SPN) ratios serve as proxies for weight importance. By removing weights where the magnitude (signal) is low relative to or combined with variance (noise), the method preserves parameters that contribute most to the deterministic output while discarding redundant or uncertain connections.
- **Core assumption:** The paper assumes that weights with low magnitude relative to their posterior variance contribute less to the final prediction accuracy than those with high ratios.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "We sample the posterior distribution... and prune weights with low importance." [section 3.1.1/3.1.2] Equations (15) and (16) define the specific mathematical criteria for removing weights based on mean ($P_{\mu}$) and standard deviation ($P_{\sigma}$).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** If post-pruning resampling is applied, the compact BNN can recover accuracy lost during the pruning phase by redistributing information among the remaining weights.
- **Mechanism:** Pruning permanently removes weights, which can create "dead zones" in the network's representational capacity. Resampling (Stage 4) restarts the Langevin MCMC process on the remaining weights, allowing them to adjust their posterior distributions to compensate for the missing connections.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: The remaining weights have sufficient capacity to model the data distribution if their values are updated, meaning the original network was significantly over-parameterized.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "...retaining the model training and generalisation performance accuracy by adapting post-pruning resampling." [section 4.4] "Resampling has a notable impact on reducing RMSE... resampled BNNs (lighter shades) consistently outperform their original counterparts."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** If Langevin dynamics are used for MCMC sampling, the proposal distribution leverages gradient information to navigate the high-dimensional posterior more effectively than random-walk Metropolis-Hastings.
- **Mechanism:** Standard MCMC explores slowly. Langevin MCMC adds a deterministic gradient term ($\nabla_\theta \log P(\theta|d)$) to the proposal, guiding the sampler toward regions of higher probability density (Eq. 7), which is crucial for the complex, multimodal posteriors of BNNs.
- **Core assumption:** The log-posterior gradient provides a reliable directional guide for exploration, and the noise term ($\eta$) is sufficient to escape local modes.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 2.3] "Langevin MCMC sampling utilises gradient information... to enhance the proposal distribution." [abstract] Mentions addressing challenges of sampling multimodal posterior distributions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)**
  - **Why needed here:** You must understand that BNNs treat weights as distributions (uncertainty) rather than fixed values. Without this, the "pruning based on variance" concept makes no sense.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a weight with a mean of 0.01 and high variance might be treated differently in a BNN than a weight with 0.01 and near-zero variance?

- **Concept: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**
  - **Why needed here:** The method relies on sampling chains to estimate the posterior. You need to grasp what "burn-in" and "mixing" mean to interpret the resampling results.
  - **Quick check question:** Why can't we just use backpropagation to find the single "best" weight values if we want to quantify uncertainty?

- **Concept: Network Pruning**
  - **Why needed here:** The goal is model compression. You need to distinguish between *structured* (removing neurons) and *unstructured* (removing individual weights) pruning to understand the implementation details.
  - **Quick check question:** Does setting a weight to zero remove the need to store it in memory (unstructured), or does it remove the entire computation path (structured)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer -> Langevin MCMC Engine -> Posterior Store -> Pruning Filter -> Resampling Engine
- **Critical path:** The transition from **Stage 3 (Pruning)** to **Stage 4 (Resampling)**. If you prune but skip resampling, the paper shows you suffer significant accuracy drops (e.g., >25% loss at 75% pruning). The resampling phase is the "repair" mechanism.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **STN (Signal-to-Noise) vs. SPN (Signal-Plus-Noise):** Section 4.4 indicates STN is generally more robust for *classification* (preserves accuracy better at high pruning rates), while SPN yields lower RMSE for *regression*.
  - **Sparsity vs. Accuracy:** The paper achieves 75% reduction, but pushing beyond this (e.g., 90%) would likely break the "generalization retention" capability.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **High Gelman-Rubin ($\hat{R}$) values:** Indicates the resampling chains did not converge (Section 4.5 warns about this due to short resampling duration).
  - **Performance Collapse:** If Random Pruning (RND) performs similarly to STN/SPN, your importance metric is not functioning correctly.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Verification:** Train a BNN on the "Iris" or "Abalone" dataset using Langevin MCMC (Stage 2) without any pruning to establish a performance baseline.
  2. **Pruning Metric Comparison:** Implement Stage 3 (Pruning) at 50% sparsity. Compare Random (RND) vs. STN vs. SPN on the validation set to verify that STN/SPN degrades less than RND.
  3. **Resampling Ablation:** Take the pruned model from Experiment 2. Run one version with Stage 4 (Resampling) and one without. Confirm that the resampled version recovers the accuracy gap closer to the baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can adaptive or dynamic strategies automatically adjust pruning thresholds based on task requirements and dataset complexity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "Future research could focus on developing adaptive and dynamic strategies to adjust the pruning thresholds of BNNs based on task requirements and dataset complexity."
- Why unresolved: The current study relies on fixed, manually selected pruning rates (0.25, 0.5, 0.75) applied uniformly across different datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of an algorithm that dynamically selects optimal pruning thresholds, demonstrating improved efficiency or accuracy over fixed-threshold baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do the pruning and resampling strategies retain performance and uncertainty quantification when applied to complex architectures like CNNs or deep transfer-learning models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that "Pruning and resampling strategies can be extended to more complex neural network architectures, including CNNs and deep transfer-learning methods."
- Why unresolved: The experiments were limited to Bayesian Neural Networks with simple, fully-connected architectures (typically one hidden layer).
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results applying the MCMC pruning method to deep Convolutional Neural Networks on high-dimensional data (e.g., ImageNet) while retaining uncertainty estimates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can this Bayesian pruning technique be integrated with knowledge distillation to facilitate efficient knowledge transfer in deep network architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes, "There is also potential to bridge the gap between pruning and knowledge distillation... opening avenues for improved generalisation and model efficiency."
- Why unresolved: While knowledge distillation is discussed as related work, the proposed method has not been tested in a teacher-student framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study demonstrating that a pruned BNN can act as an efficient student model receiving distilled knowledge, outperforming standard training or pruning alone.

## Limitations
- The method's performance heavily depends on proper MCMC convergence, yet the paper acknowledges potential issues with Gelman-Rubin statistics not reaching optimal values due to the short 1,000-iteration resampling period.
- The STN/SPN pruning heuristics, while effective, may not generalize well to extremely sparse datasets or architectures where signal-to-noise ratios don't align with actual weight importance.
- The computational overhead of MCMC sampling, even with pruning benefits, may still be prohibitive for very large-scale applications compared to deterministic pruning methods.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core claim that MCMC-based pruning can achieve >75% model compression while maintaining generalization is well-supported by the experimental results across multiple datasets and metrics.
- **Medium Confidence:** The assertion that STN outperforms SPN for classification and vice versa for regression is supported but could benefit from more extensive ablation studies across different network depths and widths.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim about improved uncertainty estimates in pruned models is demonstrated but relies on qualitative comparisons rather than comprehensive uncertainty calibration metrics like expected calibration error (ECE).

## Next Checks
1. **Convergence Verification:** Run extended MCMC chains (10,000+ iterations) post-pruning to verify whether improved Gelman-Rubin statistics lead to better performance and whether the 1,000-iteration limit is indeed a bottleneck.
2. **Extreme Sparsity Testing:** Evaluate the method at 90%+ pruning rates to identify the breaking point where STN/SPN heuristics fail and compare against alternative pruning criteria like magnitude-based or gradient-based methods.
3. **Uncertainty Calibration:** Implement proper uncertainty calibration metrics (e.g., ECE, reliability diagrams) to quantitatively compare uncertainty quality between pruned and unpruned BNNs across all benchmark datasets.
