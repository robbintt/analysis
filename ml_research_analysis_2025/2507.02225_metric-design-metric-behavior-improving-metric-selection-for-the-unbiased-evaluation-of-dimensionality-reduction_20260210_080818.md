# Metric Design != Metric Behavior: Improving Metric Selection for the Unbiased Evaluation of Dimensionality Reduction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.02225
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02225
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposes a workflow that selects evaluation metrics based on empirical behavior rather than design characteristics, improving the stability of DR evaluation rankings by up to 15% compared to random or class-based selection.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of biased evaluation in dimensionality reduction (DR) by identifying that commonly used evaluation metrics are often highly correlated, leading to redundant and skewed assessments that favor DR techniques optimizing similar structural characteristics. To mitigate this, the authors propose a workflow that selects evaluation metrics based on their empirical behavior rather than their intended design characteristics. This involves computing pairwise correlations of metric rankings across diverse projections, clustering metrics by similarity, and selecting representative metrics from each cluster to minimize redundancy. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this cluster-based selection strategy improves the stability of DR evaluation rankings by up to 15% compared to random or class-based selection, indicating reduced evaluation bias. The authors recommend a compact set of five representative metrics—covering local, cluster-level, and global structural properties—to provide a balanced and efficient evaluation framework.

## Method Summary
The study proposes a workflow to select an unbiased subset of DR evaluation metrics by clustering based on empirical correlations rather than design categories. The method generates 300 diverse projections per dataset (96 datasets total) using 40 DR techniques with varied hyperparameters, scores all projections with all candidate metrics, computes pairwise Spearman's ρ between metric rankings per dataset (averaged across datasets), converts similarity to distance (1 - correlation), applies hierarchical clustering with average linkage, and selects representative metrics from each cluster based on highest average intra-cluster similarity. The approach is validated by comparing rank stability against random and class-based selection strategies using 200 metric subsets per strategy for k=4-10.

## Key Results
- Cluster-based metric selection achieves higher rank stability than random or class-based selection for 5 ≤ k ≤ 10 (p < 0.001 for all)
- Recommended compact set of five representative metrics covers local, cluster-level, and global structural properties
- The clusters do not strictly align with original design-based classes, indicating empirical behavioral similarity differs from intended design characteristics
- Rank stability improvement of up to 15% compared to baseline selection strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Empirical Correlation as Behavioral Similarity Proxy
- Claim: Pairwise rank correlation captures whether metrics measure redundant structural characteristics, independent of their stated design goals.
- Mechanism: For each dataset, 300 diverse projections are generated using 40 DR techniques with varied hyperparameters. Each metric ranks these projections; Spearman's ρ is computed between all metric pairs and averaged across 96 datasets to form a similarity matrix.
- Core assumption: Metrics that produce similar rankings across diverse projections are measuring the same underlying structural property, even if their mathematical formulations differ.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 3, Step 1]
- Break condition: If correlations are driven by dataset-specific artifacts rather than intrinsic metric behavior, generalizability to new data distributions fails.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Clustering with Average Linkage for Orthogonal Grouping
- Claim: Clustering metrics by behavioral similarity (not design class) yields groups that represent distinct evaluation perspectives with minimal overlap.
- Mechanism: The similarity matrix is converted to a distance matrix (1 - correlation). Hierarchical clustering with average linkage merges clusters based on mean inter-cluster distance, producing a dendrogram. The optimal cut point is determined via elbow analysis on normalized diversity.
- Core assumption: Each cluster corresponds to a qualitatively different structural characteristic worth evaluating; metrics within a cluster are substitutable.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3, Step 2], [section 5.2, Figure 2]
- Break condition: If clusters are artifacts of the specific dataset/DR technique sampling, they will not generalize; singleton clusters may indicate noise rather than meaningful distinctiveness.

### Mechanism 3: Rank Stability as Bias Reduction Signal
- Claim: Higher consistency of DR technique rankings across different metric subsets indicates lower evaluation bias.
- Mechanism: For each selection strategy (random, class-based, cluster-based), 200 metric subsets are sampled. For each dataset, pairwise Spearman correlations between the 300 projection rankings produced by each subset are computed and averaged. Higher mean correlation indicates greater stability.
- Core assumption: Unbiased evaluation should produce consistent rankings regardless of which valid metric subset is chosen; instability indicates over-sensitivity to metric selection.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 4.2]
- Break condition: If stable rankings are produced by metrics that share a common blind spot (all miss the same distortion), stability could indicate shared bias rather than reduced bias.

## Foundational Learning

- **Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (ρ)**
  - Why needed here: Core measure of metric behavioral similarity; captures monotonic relationships without assuming linearity.
  - Quick check question: Why would Pearson correlation be inappropriate if metric scores have nonlinear but monotonic relationships?

- **Hierarchical Clustering with Average Linkage**
  - Why needed here: Groups metrics by behavioral similarity; average linkage balances sensitivity to outliers versus cluster compactness.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between single, complete, and average linkage in terms of what determines the distance between two clusters?

- **Elbow Method (Kneedle Algorithm)**
  - Why needed here: Determines optimal cluster count by identifying diminishing returns in diversity gains.
  - Quick check question: If diversity continues increasing linearly with no clear elbow, what does this suggest about the metric space structure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Projection Generator -> Metric Scorer -> Correlation Engine -> Distance Converter -> Hierarchical Clusterer -> Representative Selector -> Diversity Optimizer

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Generate diverse projections (requires DR technique library + hyperparameter ranges)
  2. Score all projections with all candidate metrics
  3. Compute correlation matrix → distance matrix
  4. Run hierarchical clustering
  5. Cut dendrogram at optimal k (via elbow on diversity)
  6. Select representatives → output compact metric set

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Projection count (300): Higher improves correlation estimates but increases compute; paper does not report sensitivity analysis
  - Cluster count (k=5): Elbow method choice; smaller k risks missing structural perspectives, larger k increases redundancy
  - Dataset diversity (96 datasets): Paper claims coverage of size/dimensionality/distribution, but Assumption: generalization to out-of-distribution data remains unverified
  - Singleton cluster removal: Reduces noise but may discard rare but meaningful evaluation perspectives

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low inter-dataset correlation stability: Suggests metric behavior is dataset-dependent; workflow may not generalize
  - Clusters mirror design classes exactly: Indicates correlation analysis adds no value over prior knowledge
  - No significant rank stability improvement: Cluster-based selection fails to reduce bias; reassess correlation as similarity proxy
  - High variance in cluster membership across runs: Hierarchical clustering unstable; consider alternative algorithms

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Holdout validation: Apply the recommended 5-metric set to a completely new dataset (not in original 96) and verify that rank stability remains higher than random/class-based baselines.
  2. Ablation on projection diversity: Reduce projection count from 300 to 100/50 and measure correlation matrix stability; identify minimum viable sample size.
  3. Cross-domain generalization test: Apply the workflow to a different evaluation domain (e.g., NMT metrics as mentioned in Section 6) to assess whether the clustering approach transfers; expect to recompute correlations from scratch for new domain.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the empirically driven metric selection workflow be generalized to other machine learning domains with high metric redundancy, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) or medical image segmentation?
- Do the recommended representative metrics and cluster structures remain stable when utilizing a significantly larger and more diverse set of datasets and dimensionality reduction techniques?
- Does the observed improvement in rank stability translate to improved performance on downstream visual analytics tasks?

## Limitations
- The workflow relies on empirical correlations across 300 projections per dataset, which assumes projections are sufficiently diverse and representative.
- The specific 40 DR techniques and their hyperparameter ranges are not fully specified in the main text, limiting reproducibility.
- While 96 datasets are used, their generalizability to out-of-distribution data remains unverified.
- The clustering mechanism's reliance on average linkage and the Kneedle algorithm introduces sensitivity to parameter choices that are not extensively validated.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The methodological framework for selecting metrics based on empirical correlations is sound and well-explained. The improvement in rank stability by up to 15% compared to random or class-based selection is statistically significant (F2,2012 = 315.84, p < 0.001).
- **Medium Confidence**: The recommendation of a compact set of five representative metrics is practical and covers local, cluster-level, and global structural properties, but the specific choice of metrics may vary with different dataset or projection sampling strategies.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the workflow to entirely new domains (e.g., NMT) is proposed but not empirically validated in the study.

## Next Checks
1. Holdout validation: Apply the recommended 5-metric set to a completely new dataset (not in the original 96) and verify that rank stability remains higher than random/class-based baselines.
2. Ablation on projection diversity: Reduce projection count from 300 to 100/50 and measure correlation matrix stability; identify minimum viable sample size.
3. Cross-domain generalization test: Apply the workflow to a different evaluation domain (e.g., NMT metrics as mentioned in Section 6) to assess whether the clustering approach transfers; expect to recompute correlations from scratch for new domain.
