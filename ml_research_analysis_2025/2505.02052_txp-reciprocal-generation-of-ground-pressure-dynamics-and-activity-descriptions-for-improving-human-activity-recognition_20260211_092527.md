# TxP: Reciprocal Generation of Ground Pressure Dynamics and Activity Descriptions for Improving Human Activity Recognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.02052
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02052
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Improved HAR macro F1 by up to 12.4% over state-of-the-art using bidirectional text-pressure generation

## Executive Summary
TxP introduces a reciprocal framework that addresses data scarcity in pressure-based human activity recognition by enabling bidirectional generation between text descriptions and pressure dynamics. The method discretizes continuous pressure data into token sequences using a Pressure Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder, allowing cross-modal learning with language models. When evaluated across four real-world datasets, TxP demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy through synthetic data augmentation and grounded classification via LLM interpretation.

## Method Summary
TxP operates through a three-stage pipeline: First, PressureRQVAE discretizes continuous pressure dynamics into token sequences using residual vector quantization with a codebook of 1024 entries. Second, Text2Pressure uses a CLIP text encoder and autoregressive transformer to generate synthetic pressure sequences from text descriptions, enabling data augmentation. Third, Pressure2Text projects pressure tokens into a frozen LLM's embedding space (LLaMA 2 13B) to generate activity descriptions, enabling zero-shot classification through prompt engineering. The framework is trained on PressLang, a dataset of 81,100 text-pressure pairs generated from Motion-X 3D poses via PresSim simulation.

## Key Results
- Improved macro F1 scores by up to 12.4% compared to state-of-the-art on four real-world datasets
- Text2Pressure data augmentation contributed up to 11.6% improvement, with 50/50 real/synthetic split optimal
- Pressure2Text grounded classification yielded up to 8.2% improvement
- PressureRQVAE achieved FID < 0.2 and R-Precision@5 > 0.65 on test split

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Pressure Tokenization via Vector Quantization
- **Claim:** Discretizing continuous pressure dynamics into a finite codebook of tokens allows unstructured sensor data to interface with discrete language models.
- **Core assumption:** Pressure dynamics can be losslessly or near-losslessly compressed into a finite set of discrete atomic units without losing semantic meaning.
- **Evidence anchors:** PressureRQVAE converts continuous pressure patterns into tokenized sequences through residual vector quantization; achieved FID < 0.2 and R-Precision@5 > 0.65.

### Mechanism 2: Synthetic Data Augmentation
- **Claim:** Generating synthetic pressure data from text descriptions augments limited real-world datasets, improving downstream classifier robustness.
- **Core assumption:** Synthetic data generated via this pipeline shares sufficient statistical properties with real-world sensor data to serve as a functional proxy.
- **Evidence anchors:** 50/50 real/synthetic data ratio yielded highest Macro F1 scores; 100% synthetic resulted in degraded performance (0.482 F1 vs 0.879 Real F1 on PresSim).

### Mechanism 3: LLM-Grounded Classification
- **Claim:** Interpreting pressure data via a Large Language Model allows for classification grounded in atomic actions, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen activities.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM's pre-trained world knowledge of human movement can be effectively activated by projected pressure tokens to reason about activities.
- **Evidence anchors:** Pressure2Text achieved up to 8.2% improvement; however, performance degraded on complex sequential activities like yoga poses.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Vector Quantization (VQ-VAE)**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how the paper creates the "Pressure Codebook" is essential to grasp how continuous sensor readings are mapped to discrete indices.
  - **Quick check question:** How does forcing a continuous latent vector to snap to the nearest entry in a discrete codebook affect reconstruction error versus diversity?

- **Concept: Cross-Modal Alignment (CLIP)**
  - **Why needed here:** The Text2Pressure mechanism relies on aligning text embeddings with pressure embeddings through shared embedding spaces.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is it necessary to map both text and pressure data into a shared dimension or sequence format before passing them to an autoregressive model?

- **Concept: Autoregressive Generation**
  - **Why needed here:** Both Text2Pressure and Pressure2Text use autoregressive prediction for generating sequences token by token.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the specific role of the "end token" ($V_x$) in the stopping condition for the pressure sequence generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Motion-X (3D poses) → PresSim (Simulation) → PressLang (Paired Data) → PressureRQVAE (Encoder + Quantization + Decoder) → Text2Pressure (CLIP → Transformer → PressureRQVAE Decoder) → Pressure2Text (PressureRQVAE Encoder → Projection Head → Frozen LLaMA 2 13B)

- **Critical path:** Train PressureRQVAE first to ensure working tokenizer; then train Text2Pressure Transformer; finally train Projection Head for Pressure2Text. Do not proceed if reconstruction loss is high.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Codebook Size: 1024 entries optimal for detail vs complexity
  - Window Size: 2-second windows (60 frames) balanced context and accuracy
  - LLM Size: LLaMA 2 13B best performance, smaller models offer lower latency

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Domain Gap: Poor performance on sleeping/lying activities due to lack of these motions in PressLang
  - Over-augmentation: High synthetic ratios (>60%) degrade performance
  - Wearable Mismatch: Direct application to insoles fails without spatial position adjustment

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train PressureRQVAE and plot reconstructed pressure maps against ground truth
  2. Train baseline HAR classifier with varying Real vs. Synthetic data ratios
  3. Run Pressure2Text inference on pressure sequences and manually evaluate semantic quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1: Pressure Dynamics Filter for Hallucination Mitigation**
  - Can a neural network-based "Pressure Dynamics filter" effectively detect and reject synthetically generated pressure sequences that do not match their input text prompts?

- **Open Question 2: Continuous Stream Architectures vs. Tokenization**
  - Would architectures like Mamba that operate on continuous data streams without tokenization outperform the current PressureRQVAE discrete tokenization approach?

- **Open Question 3: Multi-Modal Sensor Integration**
  - How much improvement can be achieved by integrating pressure sensing with complementary modalities like IMU and EMG for complex or ambiguous movements?

- **Open Question 4: Wearable Pressure Sensor Adaptation**
  - Can a dedicated simulation model for wearable insoles achieve comparable improvements to pressure mattress data?

## Limitations

- Dataset construction relies on PresSim simulation which may not capture full real-world variability
- Performance highly dataset-dependent (0.879 F1 on PressLang vs 0.609 F1 on PmatData)
- Fundamental limitation in simulation pipeline for horizontal body orientations (sleeping/lying postures)
- LLM-based classification shows inconsistent performance on complex sequential activities

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** PressureRQVAE discretization mechanism - well-supported by quantitative metrics and ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence:** Text2Pressure data augmentation - supported by controlled experiments but synthetic quality varies
- **Low Confidence:** Pressure2Text classification reliability - LLM-based approach shows inconsistent performance

## Next Checks

1. **Reconstruction Fidelity Validation:** Generate 100 random pressure sequences from test set, reconstruct through full PressureRQVAE pipeline, compute FID/R-Precision and visual comparisons

2. **Synthetic Data Quality Audit:** For each dataset, generate 100 synthetic pressure sequences using Text2Pressure and have human annotators rate realism and physical plausibility

3. **Zero-Shot Transfer Evaluation:** Train Pressure2Text on PressLang and evaluate ability to generate accurate descriptions for completely unseen datasets or activities not in training corpus
