# Common Sense Is All You Need

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.06642
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06642
- Reference count: 2
- Primary result: Current AI systems lack common sense reasoning, limiting their autonomy despite scaling advances; a paradigm shift toward common sense integration is needed.

## Executive Summary
The paper argues that despite impressive scaling of AI systems, they fundamentally lack common sense reasoning, which limits their autonomy and reliability. The author proposes a paradigm shift from incremental improvements to prioritizing common sense integration through contextual learning, adaptive reasoning, and embodiment in both physical and abstract domains. Current benchmarks like ARC and Turing Test are critiqued for inadequately assessing common sense, and the paper calls for their redesign with stricter minimal prior knowledge constraints. Practical steps include enforcing tabula rasa conditions, developing new evaluation metrics, and rethinking AI software architectures. The study concludes that integrating common sense is essential for achieving trustworthy AI autonomy and unlocking its full societal potential.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a conceptual framework rather than a specific algorithm or implementation. It recommends redesigning benchmarks to enforce minimal prior knowledge constraints, incorporating cognitive science principles into AI systems, and rethinking the AI software stack to support common sense integration. The proposed approach emphasizes contextual learning, adaptive reasoning, and embodiment within structured domains, with evaluation focused on reasoning processes rather than just outcomes. No specific training procedures or architectural details are provided, making practical implementation challenging.

## Key Results
- Current AI systems lack common sense reasoning despite scaling advances
- Existing benchmarks inadequately assess common sense capabilities
- Common sense integration is essential for reliable, trustworthy AI autonomy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Embodied Interaction Within Structured Domains
- Claim: Common sense may emerge from systematic interaction with environments that have consistent rules and observable regularities, rather than from pattern recognition on static datasets.
- Mechanism: An AI system engages with a structured domain (physical or abstract), receiving feedback through perception-action loops. Over time, it builds grounded representations that support contextual learning and adaptive reasoning.
- Core assumption: Biological systems demonstrate that intelligence arises from environment interaction; similar principles may apply to artificial systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "emphasizing the importance of developing AI systems that start from minimal prior knowledge and are capable of contextual learning, adaptive reasoning, and embodiment—even within abstract domains"
  - [section 6.1] "Structured Domains as Environments...Domains have specific rules that govern interactions, which can be physical laws or logical principles"
  - [corpus] "Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning" explores physical common sense through embodied decision-making
- Break condition: If the domain lacks consistent structure or feedback signals are unreliable, the mechanism fails to produce stable representations.

### Mechanism 2: Minimal Prior Knowledge Constraint (Tabula Rasa)
- Claim: Restricting an AI system to minimal "assumed knowledge" at initialization may promote genuine reasoning over memorization, improving generalization to novel situations.
- Mechanism: By preventing access to task-specific training examples, the system must infer rules and patterns from the current context alone, forcing contextual learning.
- Core assumption: Reasoning ability is better demonstrated by solving unfamiliar problems than by recognizing patterns from large training sets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "To truly assess common sense, the ARC challenge should enforce that the only prior knowledge an AI system has is the minimal set specified in the 'assumed knowledge' section"
  - [section 4.1] "Ensuring that AI systems begin with a clean slate regarding specific problem domains...mirrors how humans and animals encounter new situations"
  - [corpus] "Towards A Litmus Test for Common Sense" proposes an axiomatic approach combining minimal prior knowledge
- Break condition: If the problem requires domain-specific knowledge not derivable from first principles within reasonable compute, the constraint becomes counterproductive.

### Mechanism 3: Constrained Problem Space to Mitigate Theoretical Barriers
- Claim: Limiting the AI's problem space to well-defined domains may reduce susceptibility to No Free Lunch limitations and combinatorial explosion.
- Mechanism: Structured domains have inherent constraints (rules, finite scenarios, regularities) that reduce the effective search space, enabling efficient learning and generalization.
- Core assumption: General intelligence across all possible problem domains is not required; specialization to relevant, structured domains is sufficient for practical autonomy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] "By limiting the AI's problem space to specific, well-understood domains...we reduce the applicability of the NFL theorem"
  - [section 6.2] "Reduction of Possibility Space...narrowed to a finite, manageable set"
  - [corpus] Related papers focus on specific domains (physical reasoning, semantic relations) rather than general-purpose benchmarks
- Break condition: If domain boundaries are poorly defined or the environment shifts unpredictably outside the constrained scope, performance degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Embodied Cognition (Physical and Cognitive)**
  - Why needed here: The paper extends embodiment beyond physical robots to include abstract domains (e.g., puzzle-solving), grounding reasoning in interaction rather than static knowledge.
  - Quick check question: Can your system learn domain rules through interaction, or does it require pre-programmed knowledge?

- Concept: **Contextual Learning**
  - Why needed here: Enables real-time adjustment to novel situations based on present context, a core component of the paper's common sense definition.
  - Quick check question: Does your system adapt its behavior when encountering variations of previously seen problems?

- Concept: **Adaptive Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: Allows handling scenarios not explicitly encountered during training; the paper identifies this as missing in current autonomous systems.
  - Quick check question: When the usual solution path fails, can your system modify its reasoning strategy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Structured Domain Interface**: Perception-action mechanisms for physical or abstract environments
  - **Contextual Learning Module**: Real-time adaptation based on environmental feedback
  - **Adaptive Reasoning Engine**: Strategy modification for novel scenarios
  - **Minimal Knowledge Base**: Hard-coded "assumed knowledge" only (e.g., core physics, basic logic)
  - **Hierarchical/Modular Processing**: Layered abstraction to manage complexity

- Critical path:
  1. Define the structured domain and its governing rules/constraints
  2. Implement minimal knowledge base (explicit enumeration of what counts as "assumed")
  3. Build perception-action loops for domain interaction
  4. Design feedback mechanisms to support contextual learning
  5. Create evaluation metrics that assess reasoning process, not just outcomes

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Tabula rasa strictness vs. sample efficiency**: Strict minimal knowledge improves generalization assessment but may require more interaction steps
  - **Domain specificity vs. transfer potential**: Tighter constraints improve within-domain performance but may reduce cross-domain applicability
  - **Process observability vs. performance**: Requiring explainable reasoning adds overhead but enables common sense verification

- Failure signatures:
  - System achieves high benchmark scores but fails on slight problem variations (memorization over reasoning)
  - Performance requires disproportionate compute resources (approaching AIXI-style asymptotic limits)
  - Inability to operate without remote intervention in edge cases (Level 4 ceiling in autonomous systems)
  - No improvement in sample efficiency over time

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **ARC with strict knowledge constraints**: Implement an ARC solver with access only to the official "assumed knowledge" (core knowledge priors); measure performance gap vs. current approaches that use training examples
  2. **Domain transfer test**: Train a system in one structured abstract domain (e.g., grid puzzles), then evaluate zero-shot transfer to a structurally similar but novel domain
  3. **Edge case probe for autonomy**: For an embodied system (physical or simulated), identify failure modes requiring intervention; quantify what fraction stem from lack of contextual understanding vs. sensor/actuator limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What specific architectural components must be introduced to the AI software stack to natively support common sense reasoning and adaptive autonomy?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The author argues that "achieving true autonomy may necessitate a fundamental redesign of AI software architectures to incorporate mechanisms that enable contextual learning, adaptive reasoning, and embodiment."
- **Why unresolved:** Current software stacks are built for statistical pattern matching rather than the proposed contextual or embodied reasoning, and the paper offers a philosophical shift rather than a concrete architectural blueprint.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A functional AI architecture that solves novel reasoning tasks using only "assumed knowledge" without relying on massive, pre-trained datasets.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can benchmarks like the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) be rigorously constrained to enforce "Tabula Rasa" conditions and prevent data leakage?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The text notes that "to truly assess common sense, the ARC challenge should enforce that the only prior knowledge an AI system has is the minimal set specified in the 'assumed knowledge' section."
- **Why unresolved:** Current evaluation methods often allow systems to indirectly access test problems or leverage massive unrelated datasets, conflating memorization with genuine reasoning.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified evaluation protocol where an AI system demonstrates high performance on ARC tasks while strictly verifiable as having access only to the specified minimal priors.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What constitutes the "minimal set of innate priors" (assumed knowledge) required for a system to effectively reason from a Tabula Rasa?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper defines common sense as "Starting from a Tabula Rasa" (minimal prior knowledge) but simultaneously acknowledges the need for "assumed knowledge" (Section 3.1). The exact boundary between these two remains ambiguous.
- **Why unresolved:** There is no consensus on what constitutes the irreducible core of knowledge (e.g., object permanence, basic logic) necessary for an agent to bootstrap learning in novel environments.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The identification of a specific, minimal knowledge set that enables generalization across multiple distinct abstract domains without domain-specific fine-tuning.

## Limitations
- No concrete implementation guidance or specific algorithms provided
- Benchmark redesign specifications remain vague and unoperationalized
- No empirical validation or experimental results presented

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- Current AI systems lack common sense reasoning
- Embodiment principles apply to abstract domains
- Existing benchmarks inadequately assess common sense

**Medium Confidence**:
- Structured domains can mitigate No Free Lunch theorem limitations
- Minimal prior knowledge improves reasoning generalization
- Common sense integration is essential for reliable autonomy

**Low Confidence**:
- Specific redesign of ARC and Turing Test will yield meaningful progress
- Proposed cognitive science integration methods will be effective
- Tabula rasa approach will outperform current methods

## Next Checks
1. **ARC Constraint Experiment**: Implement and test an ARC solver with strict "assumed knowledge only" constraints (no access to training examples). Measure performance gap versus unconstrained approaches and assess whether the constraint actually promotes reasoning over pattern matching.

2. **Domain Transfer Protocol**: Develop a standardized protocol for evaluating cross-domain transfer in structured abstract domains. Train systems in one domain (e.g., grid puzzles), then test zero-shot transfer to structurally similar but novel domains. Quantify transfer efficiency and identify failure modes.

3. **Common Sense Evaluation Suite**: Create a benchmark suite that explicitly measures contextual learning, adaptive reasoning, and embodiment across physical and abstract domains. Include edge case scenarios requiring genuine reasoning rather than memorized responses, with process-level evaluation metrics beyond simple accuracy.
