# Robust Multimodal Learning Framework For Intake Gesture Detection Using Contactless Radar and Wearable IMU Sensors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07261
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07261
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: MM-TCN-CMA model achieves 4.3% and 5.2% F1-score improvements over unimodal baselines while maintaining 1.3%-2.4% gains under simulated missing modality conditions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multimodal framework that fuses radar and wrist-worn IMU data to detect eating and drinking gestures during meal sessions. It addresses the challenge of missing modalities by incorporating modality adaptation and cross-modal attention, enabling robust performance even when one sensor is unavailable. A dataset of 52 meal sessions with 3,050 eating and 797 drinking gestures was collected and made public. The proposed MM-TCN-CMA model improves segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal radar and IMU baselines, respectively. Under missing modality conditions, it still outperforms unimodal approaches by 1.3%–2.4%, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization for continuous fine-grained human activity recognition.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates temporal convolutional networks with modality adaptation modules and cross-modal attention mechanisms to fuse radar and IMU sensor streams. The system processes continuous sensor data streams, extracting temporal features from each modality before applying attention-based fusion. A novel modality adaptation component handles missing data scenarios through learned transformations that maintain representation quality when one sensor stream is unavailable. The model is trained end-to-end on synchronized multimodal meal session data collected from 12 participants.

## Key Results
- MM-TCN-CMA achieves 4.3% F1-score improvement over radar-only baseline and 5.2% over IMU-only baseline
- Under simulated missing modality conditions (drop rates), the model maintains 1.3%-2.4% performance advantage over unimodal approaches
- Cross-modal attention contributes 2.1% absolute F1-score gain in complete modality scenarios
- The model demonstrates robustness to modality missing with minimal performance degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages complementary sensor characteristics: radar captures macro-motion patterns and environmental context while IMU provides fine-grained wrist kinematics. Cross-modal attention allows the model to dynamically weight each modality's contribution based on local feature quality and context. Modality adaptation enables the system to learn robust representations that can handle missing data through learned transformations rather than simple imputation.

## Foundational Learning
- Temporal Convolutional Networks: Needed for capturing long-range temporal dependencies in continuous gesture sequences; quick check: receptive field size must exceed typical gesture duration
- Cross-Modal Attention: Enables dynamic fusion of complementary sensor information; quick check: attention weights should reflect known sensor strengths (IMU for fine motion, radar for context)
- Modality Adaptation: Handles missing data through learned transformations; quick check: performance should degrade gracefully under missing modality conditions
- Multimodal Fusion: Combines heterogeneous sensor streams for improved robustness; quick check: fusion should outperform best individual modality
- Segmental F1-score: Evaluation metric for continuous activity recognition; quick check: accounts for temporal misalignment in gesture boundaries

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Radar Stream -> Temporal CNN -> Modality Adaptation -> Cross-Modal Attention <- IMU Stream -> Temporal CNN -> Modality Adaptation

Critical Path: Sensor Input -> Temporal Feature Extraction -> Modality Adaptation -> Cross-Modal Fusion -> Gesture Classification

Design Tradeoffs: 
- Single-stream vs dual-stream architecture: Dual-stream preserves modality-specific feature learning but increases parameter count
- Attention vs simple concatenation: Attention enables dynamic weighting but adds computational overhead
- Modality adaptation vs dropout: Adaptation learns explicit missing data handling while dropout provides implicit regularization

Failure Signatures: 
- Over-reliance on single modality when attention weights become imbalanced
- Performance degradation in noisy environments affecting radar signal quality
- Temporal misalignment between sensor streams causing fusion errors

First Experiments:
1. Ablation study removing cross-modal attention to quantify contribution (expected 2.1% F1-score drop)
2. Missing modality simulation with varying drop rates (0-50%) to test robustness bounds
3. Comparison against late fusion approaches to validate attention-based benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Simulated missing modality scenarios rather than real-world sensor failures limit ecological validity
- Sample size of 52 meal sessions across 12 participants may limit population generalizability
- Computational complexity analysis missing, raising concerns about real-time deployment feasibility
- Limited interpretability of cross-modal attention weights and consistency across subjects

## Confidence
High: Core MM-TCN-CMA model performance on collected dataset
Medium: Cross-modal attention contributions due to limited ablation detail
Low: Real-world deployment claims given absence of field testing beyond controlled meal sessions

## Next Checks
1. Test framework under actual sensor failures and environmental interference conditions (different utensils, food types, ambient electromagnetic noise)
2. Evaluate computational requirements and latency on embedded platforms to assess real-time feasibility
3. Conduct longitudinal studies with diverse participant demographics to establish cross-population generalization
