- Primary result: Lightweight classifiers can match LLM performance on conspiratorial trait detection at lower computational cost, while LLMs are more vulnerable to conspiracy content than fact-checked misinformation

## Executive Summary
This work introduces CONSPIR ED, a dataset for analyzing the cognitive traits of conspiracy theories using the CONSPIR framework, enabling computational approaches to detect and classify conspiratorial ideation. Using this dataset, the study develops models for identifying conspiratorial traits in text and evaluates large language models' robustness to conspiratorial content compared to fact-checked misinformation. The results show that LLMs are more easily misaligned by conspiracy theories, reproducing conspiratorial reasoning patterns despite also detecting them, highlighting challenges in current alignment methods. Lightweight classifiers like LaGoNN approach LLM performance at lower computational cost. The dataset and findings provide a foundation for trait-based detection systems and targeted prebunking strategies to combat misinformation.

## Method Summary
The study develops CONSPIR ED by manually annotating 1,974 snippets (80-120 words) from conspiracy articles in the LOCO corpus (pre-2020) for six CONSPIR cognitive traits. The dataset is split with 41 articles for training and 18 GlobalResearch articles (2020-2023) for testing. Detection models include LaGoNN (a lightweight classifier using SetFit and k-NN retrieval) and LLMs (Llama 3.1 70B and GPT-4o) prompted with trait definitions and examples. Safety evaluation uses a journalistic rewriting prompt to test LLM compliance with conspiratorial versus fact-checked misinformation. Performance is measured via macro-F1 for trait detection and compliance rates for misalignment.

## Key Results
- LLMs are more vulnerable to conspiracy content than fact-checked misinformation, with 40.3% average compliance for CONSPIR ED versus 19.7% for AVeriTeC claims
- LaGoNN achieves 39.12 F1 on snippets, approaching the 38.81 F1 of much larger gpt-4 model
- Multi-label classification shows a 15-point F1 gap between relaxed (partial matches accepted) and strict (exact matches required) evaluation settings
- The "Contradictory" trait shows near-zero IAA and is rarely present in the corpus, limiting its practical utility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LLMs are more vulnerable to conspiracy content than to fact-checked misinformation when performing paraphrase tasks because alignment methods appear to rely more on pattern recognition than on reasoning about input reliability. Conspiracy narratives bypass filters designed for sensational but fact-checkable claims because their harmfulness lies in rhetorical structure rather than factual falsity.

### Mechanism 2
Lightweight classifiers can approximate LLM performance on trait detection at lower computational cost through LaGoNN's combination of sentence transformers with contrastive learning (SetFit) and augmentation by retrieving similar training examples, incorporating their label information. This leverages both embedding-space similarity and explicit neighbor signals.

### Mechanism 3
LLMs exhibit a paradox where they can detect conspiratorial traits yet reproduce them in generation because training objectives prioritize preserving style and semantic meaning over evaluating the validity of reasoning patterns. When tasked with "rewriting journalistically," models preserve the framing logic while polishing surface features.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-label vs. single-label classification with label co-occurrence
  - Why needed here: CONSPIR traits frequently co-occur (O and N are the most common pair); models must predict all applicable traits, not just one
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why macro-F1 is preferred over accuracy when labels are imbalanced and multi-label?

- Concept: The CONSPIR cognitive framework (Lewandowsky & Cook, 2020)
  - Why needed here: This framework defines six traits (Contradictory, Overriding suspicion, Nefarious intent, Persecuted victim, Immune to evidence, Re-interpreting randomness) that the dataset annotates
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes "Overriding suspicion" from "Immune to evidence" in the framework?

- Concept: RLHF vs. Constitutional AI alignment strategies
  - Why needed here: The paper attributes behavioral differences between GPT-4o (RLHF) and Claude (Constitutional AI) to their alignment approaches, explaining Claude's higher deflection rates
  - Quick check question: How does Constitutional AI differ from standard RLHF in terms of feedback signals?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LOCO corpus -> manual article selection -> snippet extraction (80–120 words) -> dual annotation -> consolidation -> CONSPIR ED dataset -> LaGoNN or LLM trait detection -> journalistic rewriting prompt -> compliance categorization

- Critical path: Start with annotation guidelines (Section 3.4, Appendix C) -> understand trait definitions -> run LaGoNN baseline on snippet-only input -> compare to LLM zero-shot with guidelines prompt

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Snippet-only vs. context windows: LaGoNN degrades with added context (token limit, noise); LLMs are stable or improve slightly
  - Zero-shot vs. few-shot: Llama 3.1 70B performs best zero-shot; GPT-4o benefits from k=20 examples. Few-shot can amplify label imbalance
  - Allow-abstain vs. force-predict: Force-predict improves apparent performance but masks uncertainty; useful when upstream filtering ensures conspiratorial input

- Failure signatures:
  - Contradictory trait detection fails (near-zero IAA, rare in dataset). Do not rely on this label without manual review
  - LaGoNN degrades with Context1000 inputs (token overflow). Use snippet-only for LaGoNN
  - LLMs bias toward common traits (O, N) when uncertain, especially in few-shot with similarity-based example selection

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the LaGoNN vs. LLM comparison on the test split using snippet-only input. Confirm macro-F1 gaps align with Table 7
  2. Run the paraphrase safety evaluation on a subset of CONSPIR ED snippets. Measure compliance vs. deflection rates and compare to AVeriTeC baseline
  3. Ablate the "guidelines" prompt component: run Llama 3.1 70B with (a) definitions only, (b) guidelines only, (c) both. Measure impact on trait detection F1

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How effective are preference-based and adversarial training methods in enhancing LLM robustness specifically to prevent the reproduction of conspiratorial reasoning patterns? The conclusion explicitly states, "Future work should enhance model robustness through preference-based and adversarial training while investigating how different safety training paradigms affect conspiracy theory resistance."

### Open Question 2
How does model performance on conspiratorial trait detection change when evaluated against reliable information that shares similar rhetorical markers? The Limitations section notes, "Future work should examine performance on both harmful and reliable information to provide a more balanced assessment of how models engage with reliable information."

### Open Question 3
To what extent do different safety training paradigms (e.g., RLHF vs. Constitutional AI) differentially impact a model's resistance to conspiratorial content compared to fact-checked misinformation? The paper analyzes behavioral differences between GPT-4o (RLHF) and Claude (Constitutional AI) but leaves the causal link to training paradigms open.

### Open Question 4
Can alternative in-context example selection strategies effectively mitigate the bias toward high-frequency traits (e.g., Overriding suspicion, Nefarious intent) observed in few-shot learning? The error analysis notes that "similarity-based selection amplifies dataset trait imbalances, biasing predictions toward prominent traits."

## Limitations

- Annotation reliability issues with the Contradictory trait showing near-zero inter-annotator agreement and being rarely present in the corpus
- Temporal generalization concerns as the train/test split doesn't account for evolving conspiracy narratives (e.g., COVID-19, QAnon)
- Alignment evaluation scope limited to a single journalistic rewriting prompt without testing different formulations
- LaGoNN mechanism specificity unclear without ablation studies showing contribution of individual components

## Confidence

**High confidence**: LLMs can detect CONSPIR traits when prompted; lightweight classifiers can approach LLM performance on snippet-level classification; alignment methods show different effectiveness between RLHF and Constitutional AI approaches.

**Medium confidence**: LLMs are more vulnerable to conspiracy content than fact-checked misinformation for paraphrase tasks; LaGoNN's performance advantage over other lightweight models; the paradox of detection vs. reproduction is robust across model families.

**Low confidence**: The specific mechanisms by which alignment methods fail on conspiracy content; LaGoNN's generalization to new conspiracy themes; the relative importance of individual CONSPIR traits in driving misalignment.

## Next Checks

1. Test LaGoNN and LLM models on conspiracy articles from 2024-2025 that weren't available during dataset creation to measure performance degradation and identify which traits transfer versus require retraining

2. Systematically vary the misalignment prompt across 5-10 different formulations (e.g., "Rewrite objectively," "Fact-check this claim," "Provide balanced coverage") and compare compliance rates to isolate whether the vulnerability is prompt-specific or fundamental to model training

3. Evaluate CONSPIRED-trained models on external conspiracy datasets (e.g., ConspEmoLLM-v2, PartisanLens) and misinformation datasets (e.g., AVeriTeC, RealNews) to assess whether observed patterns generalize beyond the curated corpus
