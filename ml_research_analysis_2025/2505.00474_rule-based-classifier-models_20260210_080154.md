# Rule-based Classifier Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.00474
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00474
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: A formal framework for rule-based classifiers in legal reasoning that incorporates legal rules and precedential constraint

## Executive Summary
This paper extends the formal framework of classifier models in the legal domain by incorporating sets of rules, not just facts, into the classification process. The authors build on the hierarchical factor model of precedential constraint and define a rule-based classifier model (RCM) where states are described by both facts and admissible rules (solutions). They introduce a relevance relation between states to model precedential constraint, enabling the inference of decisions for new cases based on binding precedents. The decision-making process iteratively applies this relevance relation, considering intermediate concerns, to determine admissible rules for the new case.

## Method Summary
The method involves encoding a factor hierarchy as an acyclic DAG, building a case base from precedents with their fact situations, applicable solutions, and outcomes, and implementing a decision-making process that iteratively resolves concerns by degree. For each new case, the framework computes sets of factors favoring each concern, finds relevant precedents via a formal relevance relation, and collects outcomes to determine the final decision. The framework can handle conflicts arising from inconsistent case bases and can be further enriched by incorporating time elements and court hierarchy to resolve such conflicts.

## Key Results
- Rule-based classifier models (RCMs) extend classifier models by incorporating admissible rules alongside facts in states
- A formal relevance relation captures precedential constraint, formalizing a fortiori reasoning between cases
- The decision-making process can produce unambiguous outcomes even when the case base contains inconsistencies
- Conflicts from inconsistent case bases can be resolved by incorporating court hierarchy and temporal elements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Multi-step hierarchical reasoning captures how judges actually derive decisions from facts through intermediate conclusions. Base factors (factual evidence) → intermediate factors (legal determinations) → final decision (0/1). Each step uses rules whose antecedents must be supported by earlier-step conclusions or base facts. Concerns are resolved sequentially by degree (lowest first). Core assumption: Legal reasoning is not a single-step fact-to-outcome mapping but follows a structured hierarchy where intermediate determinations constrain higher-level decisions.

### Mechanism 2
States defined as (fact situation, solution) pairs enable rule-level precedent tracking beyond mere fact-pattern matching. A state s = (B, Sol) pairs base facts B with an applicable solution Sol (a set of admissible rules). Each rule r: ψ → φ has antecedent ψ (reasons) and conclusion φ. Constraint C2 ensures classification matches the rule conclusion for the 0/1 concern. Core assumption: Ratio decidendi and intermediate rules ("precedent constituents") should constrain later cases, not just final outcomes.

### Mechanism 3
Precedential constraint can be computed via a concern-based relevance relation that formalizes a fortiori reasoning. (Δ, Λ, s, s*) ∈ R_c iff Reas_c(s) ⊆ Reas_c(s*) ∪ Δ and Reas_c(s*) ∪ Λ ⊆ Fav_c(s). For decided cases with opposite outcomes on concern c, this captures when one should have followed the other. Prop 12 proves equivalence with case base inconsistency. Core assumption: A case establishes priority orderings among reasons; subsequent cases must respect these orderings or create inconsistency.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Factor Hierarchies (Horty/Canavotto framework)**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework assumes factors are organized in a DAG where edges indicate "favors" relationships. Understanding degree calculation and concern ordering is prerequisite to following the decision procedure.
  - Quick check question: Given hierarchy with edges f1 → d, f2 → ¬d, d → e, what is deg(d/¬d) and which factors favor e?

- **Concept: Precedential Constraint (Reason Model)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's relevance relation and consistency definitions derive from Horty's reason model—cases establish priority orderings that constrain future decisions.
  - Quick check question: If case c1 decides {r1} < {r2} for concern x and case c2 decides {r2} < {r1}, is the case base consistent wrt x?

- **Concept: Rule Admissibility in a Hierarchy**
  - Why needed here: Not all rules are valid—only those whose antecedents favor the conclusion per the hierarchy. This prevents arbitrary rule construction.
  - Quick check question: In hierarchy H with edge a → b but no edge a → ¬b, is rule r: {a} → ¬b admissible?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** States S ⊆ 2^{Atm_0} × Sol: (base facts, applicable solution) → Classification function f: S → {0, 1, ?} → Factor hierarchy H: Acyclic DAG over Atm_0 ∪ Int ∪ {0,1} → Solutions Sol ⊆ Rules: Sets of admissible rules, one per raised concern, with chained antecedent support → Relevance relations R_c ⊆ 2^{Factors} × 2^{Factors} × S × S for each concern c → Decision process h*_c: Iteratively resolves concerns by degree, collecting relevant precedents

- **Critical path:** 1. Encode domain factor hierarchy H (domain expert task) 2. Extract cases: For each precedent, parse (B, opinion, outcome) where opinion = sequence of resolutions per degree 3. Build RCM: States from cases, f(s) = outcome for precedents, ? for new cases 4. For new case s*: Run h* from degree 1 to deg(0/1), accumulating relevant precedents per concern 5. If |h*_{0/1}(s*)| = 1, construct conflict-free partition and generate admissible solution

- **Design tradeoffs:** Expressiveness vs. decidability: Hierarchical multi-step reasoning captures more legal nuance but may produce ambiguous outputs when precedents conflict. Explicit rule extraction vs. automation: Requires manual/legal-expert extraction of rules from opinions; no automatic rule mining proposed. Flat vs. hierarchical case authority: Section 4 sketches court hierarchy integration but the core framework treats all precedents equally.

- **Failure signatures:** Empty solution set: No applicable solution for B (missing rules for raised concerns). Ambiguous h*_c(s*) = {both sides}: Conflicting relevant precedents; requires external resolution (time/court hierarchy). Inconsistent starting case base: Pre-existing precedent conflicts propagate; decision process may still produce unambiguous top-level outcome (see Example 18). Partition construction fails: F^s* contains both c and ¬c for some concern, but no conflict-free subset supports the determined outcome.

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Synthetic validation: Construct a minimal consistent case base (3-5 cases) over the Figure 1 hierarchy; verify h* produces expected outcomes on held-out fact patterns; confirm Prop 17 (consistency implies unambiguity). 2. Inconsistency detection test: Create inconsistent case bases by introducing conflicting priority orderings; verify Prop 12 equivalence between relevance and inconsistency; test whether top-level decisions can still be unambiguous when intermediate concerns are negligible (Example 18 pattern). 3. Court hierarchy resolution prototype: Implement the Section 4 sketch—assign courts and timestamps to cases; define overruling and per incuriam detection; verify that ambiguous decisions become resolvable when non-binding precedents are filtered.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the hierarchical and temporal elements (court hierarchy and case timing) be formally integrated into the rule-based classifier framework? The conclusion states: "We aim to import the hierarchical and temporal elements, as defined in [11], into the framework of classifier models described in this paper." This remains unresolved as the current work focuses on incorporating rules without court hierarchy or time.

### Open Question 2
How should the framework handle cases decided per incuriam that remain binding for subsequent cases? Section 4 notes: "The impact of these nuanced considerations [regarding per incuriam remaining binding] on our classifier framework will be explored in future research." The example in Section 4 simplifies the per incuriam concept, not addressing situations where a lower court's per incuriam decision remains binding despite ignoring higher court precedent.

### Open Question 3
How can the framework formally characterize partial overruling of precedents at specific concerns rather than entire cases? Section 4 mentions "partial overruling" where one case overrules another "only with respect to a specific concern," but this concept is not formalized in the definitions. Current definitions treat precedential constraint at the concern level but overruling is only illustrated through example without formal treatment.

## Limitations
- Manual rule extraction requirement with no proposed automation mechanism for rule mining from text
- No empirical validation on real legal datasets; all examples remain synthetic
- Unclear complexity and scalability of relevance relation computation for large case bases
- Court hierarchy and temporal resolution mechanisms are only sketched without formal implementation

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The formal definitions and logical consistency of the RCM framework (Propositions 12 and 17 are proven within the model)
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that hierarchical multi-step reasoning better captures legal decision-making than flat models (supported by mechanism but lacks empirical validation)
- **Low confidence**: The practical applicability to real legal domains given the manual rule extraction requirement and lack of performance benchmarks

## Next Checks

1. Implement the decision process h* on the Figure 1 hierarchy with a synthetic case base of 3-5 cases; verify it produces expected outcomes on held-out fact patterns
2. Construct an inconsistent case base by introducing conflicting priority orderings; test whether Proposition 12 correctly identifies the inconsistency via the relevance relation
3. Implement the court hierarchy resolution from Section 4 sketch; verify that adding timestamps and court levels resolves ambiguities that arise from conflicting precedents
