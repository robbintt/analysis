# Bayesian Federated Learning for Continual Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.15328
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15328
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Posterior-aided Continual Learning (P-CL) reduces iterations to reach 85% accuracy by 40-50% compared to full retraining while improving calibration

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses continual adaptation in Federated Learning (FL) where data distributions shift over time, such as in human-robot interaction environments monitored by radar sensors. The authors propose a Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) framework that uses posterior distributions from previous training tasks as priors for subsequent tasks, enabling efficient continual learning. The approach is evaluated on an industrial IoT use case involving human sensing with mmWave MIMO radar data collected over multiple days. Results demonstrate that P-CL achieves comparable accuracy to full model retraining while significantly reducing communication overhead (up to 50% fewer iterations) and improving model calibration through Bayesian uncertainty quantification.

## Method Summary
The method employs Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to approximate posterior distributions in a federated setting. Each of N=10 federated nodes runs SGLD locally for T=100 iterations, with the first Tb=50 samples discarded as burn-in. The remaining Ts=50 samples are used to compute posterior mean μ and covariance Σ, which are aggregated at a parameter server. For Day 1, the prior is N(0, I), but for subsequent days d>1, the prior becomes N(μ^{d-1}, Σ^{d-1}) from the previous day's posterior. The SGLD update includes noise injection: θ_{k+1} = θ_k − η∇L(θ_k) + √(2η)ξ_{k+1}, where ξ ~ N(0, I). The model is a LeNet architecture (~1.4M parameters) trained on range-azimuth maps (256×63) from mmWave MIMO radar to classify 10 ROI classes representing human proximity levels.

## Key Results
- P-CL reduces iterations to reach 85% accuracy by 40-50% compared to full retraining
- P-CL achieves lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) than both Transfer Learning and full retraining baselines
- The approach maintains accuracy while significantly reducing communication overhead in multi-day continual learning scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Using the posterior distribution from a previous time period as the prior for subsequent training accelerates convergence and improves model calibration in gradually-shifting environments.
- **Mechanism:** The posterior from day d-1 encodes learned knowledge about the parameter space. When used as the prior for day d, it biases the optimization toward regions already known to be plausible, reducing the search space. This is formalized as p(θ^d) ~ N(μ(θ^{d-1}), Σ(θ^{d-1})).
- **Core assumption:** Data distribution shifts between time periods are non-abrupt; previous posterior remains partially relevant.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "leveraging past posteriors to construct the prior for the new tasks"
  - [section V, Table I]: P-CL reduces iterations to reach 85% accuracy by 40-50% compared to full retraining
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus support; neighboring papers address Bayesian FL but not posterior-prior temporal transfer specifically
- **Break condition:** Abrupt distribution shifts (e.g., sudden environment changes, new sensor modalities) where previous posterior is misaligned with new data.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** SGLD enables distributed posterior approximation by combining gradient descent with calibrated noise injection, avoiding point estimates.
- **Mechanism:** SGLD update θ_{k+1} = θ_k - η∇L(θ_k) + √(2η)ξ_{k+1} injects Gaussian noise into SGD, causing the trajectory to explore the parameter space rather than converge to a single point. After burn-in, collected samples approximate the posterior distribution.
- **Core assumption:** Markov chain reaches stationary distribution after Tb burn-in samples; learning rate η is appropriately scaled.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section II, Eq. 2-4]: Formal SGLD update equations with noise term
  - [section V]: Burn-in of Tb=50 with Ts=50 samples used for posterior approximation
  - [corpus]: "Cost-Free Personalization via Information-Geometric Projection in Bayesian Federated Learning" confirms MCMC sampling as standard BFL approach
- **Break condition:** Insufficient burn-in period; learning rate too large causing poor mixing; too few samples for reliable covariance estimation.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Bayesian uncertainty quantification through posterior sampling improves model calibration (lower ECE) compared to frequentist retraining.
- **Mechanism:** By maintaining distributional estimates rather than point estimates, predictions incorporate uncertainty. This prevents overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution samples, aligning predicted confidence with actual accuracy.
- **Core assumption:** Posterior samples capture meaningful uncertainty; Gaussian approximation of posterior is sufficient.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section V, Fig. 3]: P-CL shows smaller calibration gap than Retr. baseline
  - [section V, Eq. 7-9]: ECE formalizes accuracy-confidence mismatch
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for calibration improvement mechanism in continual BFL
- **Break condition:** Highly multi-modal posteriors poorly approximated by Gaussian; small sample sizes leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bayes' Theorem and Posterior Updates**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework rests on p(θ|D) ∝ p(θ)p(D|θ); understanding how priors influence posteriors is essential.
  - Quick check question: If your prior is N(0, I) and you observe data with strong signal, will your posterior shift away from zero? In what direction?

- **Concept: MCMC Sampling and Burn-in**
  - Why needed here: SGLD requires discarding early samples (burn-in) before the chain converges to stationary distribution.
  - Quick check question: Why would samples from early iterations NOT represent the true posterior?

- **Concept: Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**
  - Why needed here: Paper uses ECE as primary reliability metric; you must interpret what "well-calibrated" means.
  - Quick check question: A model predicts with 90% confidence but achieves only 60% accuracy—would ECE be high or low?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** N=10 radar sensor nodes → Local SGLD computation → Parameter Server (PS) → Weighted parameter averaging → Posterior mean/covariance computation

- **Critical path:**
  1. Day 1: Initialize p(θ¹) ~ N(0, I); run SGLD for T=100 iterations
  2. Discard first Tb=50 samples; collect Ts=50 posterior samples
  3. Compute sample mean μ and covariance Σ from collected samples
  4. Day d>1: Set prior p(θ^d) ~ N(μ^{d-1}, Σ^{d-1}); repeat sampling
  5. PS aggregates node updates each iteration; evaluate on day-specific validation

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Burn-in length vs. sample efficiency: Longer Tb improves chain convergence but reduces usable samples
  - Gaussian prior assumption vs. expressiveness: Simple but may not capture multi-modal posteriors
  - Communication frequency vs. convergence: More iterations improve accuracy but increase bandwidth

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Accuracy degrades across days without updates: TL baseline drops from 95.5% → 72.7%
  - High ECE with acceptable accuracy: Indicates overconfidence (seen in Retr. baseline)
  - Covariance collapse: Σ → 0 if too few samples or overfitting, causing prior to become uninformative or degenerate

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce the three baselines (TL, Retr., P-CL) on your own temporal data; verify P-CL achieves comparable accuracy to Retr. with lower ECE.
  2. Ablate burn-in period: Test Tb ∈ {25, 50, 75} with fixed T=100; measure impact on Day 2 convergence speed.
  3. Stress-test distribution shift: Artificially vary shift magnitude between days to identify the threshold where P-CL advantage degrades.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can hierarchical Bayesian models or nonparametric approaches (e.g., Gaussian Processes) provide better adaptability than the Gaussian approximation used in this framework?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly states that future work will involve the "exploration of more expressive priors, such as hierarchical Bayesian models or nonparametric approaches."
  - Why unresolved: The current method assumes a Gaussian distribution for the prior ($p(θ^d) \sim N(\mu, \Sigma)$) derived from previous posteriors, which simplifies computation but may not capture complex, multimodal parameter uncertainties.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments evaluating convergence speed and accuracy on the same radar dataset when using Gaussian Processes or hierarchical models versus the current Gaussian assumption.

- **Question:** Can privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy be integrated without degrading the uncertainty quantification capabilities of the BFL framework?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify the need for "exploration of privacy-preserving techniques in combination with our approach, such as differential privacy or homomorphic encryption," as a direction for real-world deployment.
  - Why unresolved: While FL keeps data local, the communication of posterior parameters (means and covariances) could leak information; adding noise for differential privacy might conflict with the noise injection used for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD).
  - What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of the trade-off between privacy budgets (epsilon) and model reliability metrics (Expected Calibration Error) in the continual learning setup.

- **Question:** How does the Posterior-aided Continual Learning (P-CL) method perform under abrupt distribution shifts compared to gradual changes?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note the effectiveness relies on "non-abrupt dynamic environments, which is the main assumption of this work," implying the robustness to sudden shifts is untested.
  - Why unresolved: If the data distribution changes drastically (e.g., a completely new environment), using the previous posterior as a strong prior could hinder convergence or cause negative transfer, a limitation not explored in the incremental day-by-day results.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies simulating sudden, radical changes in the operational environment (e.g., changing sensor hardware or room layout) to observe if P-CL outperforms model retraining from scratch.

## Limitations
- The framework assumes non-abrupt, gradual distribution shifts between time periods, which breaks down under sudden environmental changes
- The Gaussian approximation of the posterior may be insufficient for highly multi-modal parameter distributions
- Evaluation is limited to a single application domain (radar-based human sensing) with relatively small sample sizes

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1 (Posterior-prior transfer improves convergence):** Medium confidence. Supported by iteration reduction results (40-50% faster to 85% accuracy) and the logical framework of search space reduction, but the assumption of non-abrupt shifts is critical and not thoroughly stress-tested.
- **Mechanism 2 (SGLD enables posterior approximation):** High confidence. Well-established theoretical foundation with clear mathematical formulation and standard burn-in practices. The SGLD update equation and sampling procedure are explicitly specified.
- **Mechanism 3 (Bayesian calibration improvement):** Low confidence. While ECE improvements are observed empirically, the underlying mechanism connecting posterior uncertainty to calibration is not well-explained in the literature, and no direct corpus evidence supports this specific continual BFL calibration effect.

## Next Checks
1. **Stress-test distribution shift magnitude:** Systematically vary the degree of distributional change between days (using techniques like importance weighting or adversarial shifts) to identify the threshold where P-CL advantage degrades relative to baselines. This validates the non-abrupt shift assumption.

2. **Ablate burn-in period:** Run controlled experiments with Tb ∈ {25, 50, 75} while keeping T=100 fixed. Measure impacts on Day 2 convergence speed and ECE to quantify the trade-off between burn-in length and sample efficiency.

3. **Test multi-modality sensitivity:** Evaluate the framework on a synthetic task with known multi-modal posteriors (e.g., mixture of Gaussians in parameter space). Compare Gaussian approximation performance against alternative posterior representations to assess the limitation of assuming Gaussian posteriors.
