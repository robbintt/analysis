core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of improving interpretability
  and performance in sequential recommendation systems that integrate large language
  models (LLMs). The core idea is to use LLMs as auxiliary tools to generate guided
  embeddings based on domain-specific, interpretable attributes (e.g., "story complexity",
  "emotional intensity" for movies) instead of relying on them as the main backbone.

# Improving LLM Interpretability and Performance via Guided Embedding Refinement for Sequential Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.11658
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11658
- Reference count: 27
- This paper presents a method to improve interpretability and performance in sequential recommendation systems using LLM-guided embedding refinement.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance both interpretability and performance in sequential recommendation systems by leveraging large language models (LLMs) as auxiliary tools for generating guided embeddings. Instead of using LLMs as the primary backbone, the method employs them to create attribute-based embeddings based on domain-specific interpretable features (e.g., "story complexity" or "emotional intensity" for movies). These guided embeddings are combined with base embeddings from traditional recommendation models like SASRec or BERT4Rec to form refined embeddings, which are then used for training and inference. The approach achieves significant improvements in recommendation accuracy (10%–50% gains in MRR, Recall, and NDCG) while also providing interpretable insights through explainable attribute-based scoring. The method is shown to be generalizable across different recommendation tasks.

## Method Summary
The proposed method integrates LLMs as auxiliary tools to generate guided embeddings based on interpretable attributes specific to the recommendation domain. These guided embeddings are combined with base embeddings from traditional sequential recommendation models (e.g., SASRec, BERT4Rec) to create refined embeddings. The refined embeddings are then used for training and inference, enhancing both recommendation accuracy and interpretability. The approach leverages the strengths of LLMs in understanding domain-specific attributes while maintaining the efficiency of traditional recommendation models.

## Key Results
- Achieves 10%–50% improvements in MRR, Recall, and NDCG metrics.
- Refined embeddings outperform higher-dimensional base embeddings.
- The approach is generalizable across different recommendation tasks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging LLMs to generate attribute-based embeddings that capture domain-specific, interpretable features. These guided embeddings are combined with base embeddings from traditional recommendation models, creating refined embeddings that enhance both accuracy and interpretability. The LLM-generated attributes provide explainable insights into the recommendation process, while the combination with base embeddings ensures robust performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **LLM-Generated Embeddings**: Why needed? To capture domain-specific, interpretable features that enhance recommendation accuracy. Quick check: Verify the relevance and quality of LLM-generated attributes for the target domain.
- **Base Embeddings**: Why needed? To provide a foundation for recommendation performance from traditional models. Quick check: Ensure the base embeddings are trained effectively on the recommendation task.
- **Refined Embeddings**: Why needed? To combine the strengths of LLM-generated and base embeddings for improved accuracy and interpretability. Quick check: Validate the performance gains of refined embeddings over base embeddings.
- **Attribute-Based Scoring**: Why needed? To provide interpretable insights into the recommendation process. Quick check: Assess the explainability and relevance of the attribute-based scoring system.
- **Generalizability**: Why needed? To ensure the method can be applied across different recommendation tasks. Quick check: Test the approach on diverse datasets and recommendation scenarios.
- **Scalability**: Why needed? To evaluate the method's effectiveness on larger-scale datasets. Quick check: Assess performance and interpretability on larger datasets.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Traditional Recommendation Model (e.g., SASRec, BERT4Rec) -> Base Embeddings -> LLM-Generated Guided Embeddings -> Refined Embeddings -> Training/Inference
- **Critical Path**: The critical path involves generating guided embeddings using LLMs, combining them with base embeddings, and using the refined embeddings for training and inference.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades off the computational overhead of LLM-generated embeddings for improved interpretability and performance. The reliance on manual attribute selection may limit generalizability.
- **Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include inconsistent quality of LLM-generated embeddings across domains, biases in the attribute selection process, and scalability issues with larger datasets.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Evaluate the performance of refined embeddings on a smaller dataset (e.g., MovieLens) to validate the approach.
  2. Test the generalizability of the method across different recommendation tasks (e.g., news recommendation, e-commerce).
  3. Assess the interpretability of the attribute-based scoring system through human evaluation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method has not been tested on larger-scale datasets, raising questions about scalability.
- The reliance on manual attribute selection may limit generalizability across domains.
- The interpretability gains depend on the quality of LLM-generated embeddings, which may vary across domains.
