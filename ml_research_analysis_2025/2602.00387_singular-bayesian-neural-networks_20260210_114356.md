- Introduces low-rank variational inference for BNNs with rank-r parameterization

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to Bayesian neural networks by parameterizing weights as W=AB⊤, reducing parameters from O(mn) to O(r(m+n)) while inducing a singular posterior distribution. The method captures structured weight correlations through shared latent factors and provides PAC-Bayes generalization bounds that scale with rank rather than ambient dimension. Empirically, the approach achieves competitive predictive performance using up to 15× fewer parameters than full-rank methods, with particular strength in out-of-distribution detection tasks.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a low-rank variational inference framework where neural network weights are parameterized as the product of two low-rank matrices W=AB⊤. This parameterization induces a singular posterior distribution with respect to Lebesgue measure, concentrating on a rank-r manifold. The approach uses shared latent factors to capture structured weight correlations and provides PAC-Bayes generalization bounds scaling with rank rather than ambient dimension. The framework includes loss bounds via the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem and demonstrates Gaussian complexity transfer from deterministic to Bayesian predictors.

## Key Results
- Achieves AUROC=0.895 on MIMIC-III mortality prediction with 15× fewer parameters
- Attains AUROC-OOD=0.640 on SST-2 sentiment classification with 13× fewer parameters than full-rank BBB
- Demonstrates superior OOD detection (AUC-OOD=0.802) compared to full-rank methods
- Shows consistent calibration-OOD detection trade-offs favoring uncertainty quantification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The low-rank parameterization W=AB⊤ creates a structured posterior that concentrates on a rank-r manifold, inducing a singular measure with respect to Lebesgue measure. This singularity arises because the parameterization restricts the posterior to a lower-dimensional subspace, effectively reducing the effective parameter space. The shared latent factors between A and B create structured correlations across weight matrices, capturing dependencies that full-rank methods cannot efficiently represent. The PAC-Bayes bounds leverage this structure by scaling with rank r rather than the ambient dimension mn.

## Foundational Learning
- **Singular measures**: Probability distributions with respect to which Lebesgue measure is zero; needed for understanding the induced posterior structure; quick check: verify the posterior concentrates on the rank-r manifold
- **PAC-Bayes bounds**: Generalization bounds for Bayesian predictors; needed for theoretical justification of rank-based complexity; quick check: confirm bound scaling with rank r
- **Low-rank matrix factorization**: Decomposing matrices into products of lower-rank matrices; needed for parameter reduction and structured correlations; quick check: validate rank-r approximation quality
- **Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem**: Provides optimal low-rank matrix approximation; needed for loss bounds in the low-rank setting; quick check: verify approximation error bounds
- **Gaussian complexity**: Measure of function class complexity; needed for transferring complexity from deterministic to Bayesian predictors; quick check: confirm complexity transfer assumptions
- **Epistemic uncertainty**: Uncertainty due to lack of knowledge; needed for OOD detection and calibration analysis; quick check: evaluate uncertainty calibration

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Encoder (low-rank) -> Latent factors (A,B) -> Output layer

**Critical Path**: Data → Low-rank parameterization (W=AB⊤) → Variational inference → Predictive distribution

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Rank r vs. Expressivity: Higher rank increases capacity but reduces parameter savings
- Prior choice vs. Posterior singularity: Prior must respect rank structure for valid inference
- Computational efficiency vs. Uncertainty quality: Low-rank methods favor uncertainty over sharp predictions

**Failure Signatures**:
- Poor MCMC convergence due to singular posterior structure
- Underfitting when rank r is too low for target function complexity
- Degenerate latent factor distributions indicating prior-misspecification

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify MCMC convergence properties under the singular posterior measure using diagnostic tools
2. Conduct ablation studies varying rank r to quantify the relationship between rank constraint and weight correlation structure
3. Test the Gaussian complexity transfer claim on additional architectures and datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges major uncertainties regarding the theoretical implications of the singular posterior structure. Specifically, it's unclear whether standard MCMC or variational inference algorithms remain valid or require modification under this singular measure. The claim that low-rank BNNs naturally capture structured weight correlations through shared latent factors needs more rigorous justification. The PAC-Bayes generalization bounds rely on specific assumptions about the posterior distribution that may not hold in practice. The transfer of Gaussian complexity from deterministic to Bayesian predictors assumes certain regularity conditions that are not explicitly verified.

## Limitations
- Theoretical implications of singular posterior structure remain incompletely characterized
- MCMC convergence properties under singular measure require verification
- Empirical results sensitive to specific OOD datasets and evaluation protocols
- Calibration-uncertainty trade-off lacks formal Pareto frontier analysis

## Confidence
- Theory (singular posterior): Medium - mathematical consequences not fully characterized
- Theory (PAC-Bayes bounds): Medium - relies on unverified assumptions
- Empirical (standard benchmarks): High - consistent across multiple datasets
- Empirical (OOD detection): Medium - sensitive to dataset choice
- Architecture generality: Medium - tested on limited architectures

## Next Checks
1. Verify MCMC convergence properties under the singular posterior measure using diagnostic tools
2. Conduct ablation studies varying rank r to quantify the exact relationship between rank constraint and weight correlation structure
3. Test the Gaussian complexity transfer claim on additional architectures and datasets to establish robustness beyond the reported cases
