  models not only to identify all valid answers but also to detect specific conflicting
  answer pairs. To support this task, a novel cost-effective methodology is introduced

# Consensus or Conflict? Fine-Grained Evaluation of Conflicting Answers in Question-Answering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.12355
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12355
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Models achieve high precision but fail to detect conflicts and output all correct answers

## Executive Summary
This work introduces NATCONFQA, a novel benchmark for conflict-aware multi-answer question answering that requires models to identify both valid answers and detect conflicting answer pairs. The benchmark is constructed using a cost-effective methodology that leverages fact-checking datasets, enriched with detailed conflict labels for all answer pairs. The evaluation of eight high-end LLMs reveals significant fragility in handling various types of conflicts, with models struggling to distinguish between conflicting and non-conflicting answer pairs despite achieving high precision. The study demonstrates that current LLMs employ flawed strategies to resolve conflicts and highlights the need for more sophisticated conflict detection mechanisms in QA systems.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a novel methodology to construct NATCONFQA by leveraging fact-checking datasets, enabling cost-effective creation of a benchmark for conflict-aware multi-answer QA. This approach enriches existing datasets with detailed conflict labels for all answer pairs, creating realistic scenarios where models must identify both valid answers and detect specific conflicts between them. The benchmark evaluates models across multiple dimensions including answer extraction, conflict detection, and overall conflict resolution capability, providing a fine-grained assessment of LLM performance in handling conflicting information.

## Key Results
- Models generally achieve high precision but fail to output all correct answers, indicating recall limitations
- Fine-grained evaluation reveals significant struggles in distinguishing between conflicting and non-conflicting answer pairs
- LLMs demonstrate fragility when handling various types of conflicts, employing flawed resolution strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by leveraging existing fact-checking datasets which inherently contain contradictory claims and their resolutions. By repurposing this structured conflict information, the approach creates realistic QA scenarios that mirror real-world information conflicts. The fine-grained labeling of all answer pairs enables detailed analysis of model behavior at the conflict level rather than just aggregate performance metrics, revealing specific weaknesses in conflict detection and resolution that would be obscured by traditional evaluation methods.

## Foundational Learning

**Fact-checking datasets** - Structured collections of claims with evidence and verdicts (true/false/conflict)
*Why needed*: Provide the foundational conflict information for benchmark construction
*Quick check*: Verify dataset contains labeled conflicting claims with resolution evidence

**Multi-answer QA evaluation** - Assessment framework for questions with multiple valid answers
*Why needed*: Establishes baseline for comparing conflict-aware performance
*Quick check*: Ensure metrics capture both precision and recall across answer sets

**Conflict detection metrics** - Evaluation measures specific to identifying conflicting information
*Why needed*: Enables fine-grained analysis beyond traditional accuracy metrics
*Quick check*: Validate metrics correctly identify known conflict patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Fact-checking dataset -> Conflict extraction -> Answer pair labeling -> Benchmark construction -> LLM evaluation

**Critical path**: The core evaluation pipeline where models process questions, generate answer sets, and are assessed on both completeness and conflict detection accuracy. Performance degradation typically occurs at the conflict detection stage where models fail to properly identify contradictory answer pairs.

**Design tradeoffs**: The methodology trades complete control over question selection for the benefit of using naturally occurring conflicts from fact-checking data. This provides realism but may introduce domain-specific biases from the source datasets.

**Failure signatures**: Models exhibit systematic failure to identify conflicts between factually incompatible answers, often conflating genuine conflicts with superficial differences in phrasing or context. High precision but low recall indicates selective answer generation rather than comprehensive coverage.

**First experiments**:
1. Evaluate baseline LLM performance on NATCONFQA to establish initial conflict detection capabilities
2. Conduct ablation study removing conflict labels to measure impact on overall QA performance
3. Test model performance across different conflict types (factual, temporal, contextual) to identify specific weakness patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to only eight high-end LLMs, potentially missing model family-specific behaviors
- Benchmark coverage may not fully represent the diversity of real-world conflict scenarios
- Cost-effective methodology may introduce biases from source fact-checking datasets

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The methodology for benchmark construction is sound and evaluation framework is rigorous
- **Medium confidence**: Results generalize to broader LLM population and conflict types
- **Medium confidence**: Automatic conflict labels accurately reflect true conflict relationships

## Next Checks
1. Replicate conflict identification experiments using additional LLM families (e.g., Claude, Gemini) to assess whether observed fragility is model-specific or a broader LLM characteristic
2. Conduct ablation studies on the conflict annotation pipeline to quantify how much bias is introduced from the source fact-checking datasets
3. Perform human evaluation on a subset of NATCONFQA instances to validate the automatic conflict labels and identify any systematic annotation errors
