## Executive Summary
SecoustiCodec introduces a streaming speech codec that achieves high-quality reconstruction at very low bitrates by separately modeling acoustic, semantic, and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook space. The approach uses a novel VAE+FSQ-based semantic quantization method combined with contrastive learning for cross-modal alignment between speech and text. The architecture employs a three-stage optimization strategy to ensure robust convergence, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining streaming capability.

## Method Summary
The method involves a three-stage training process: Stage 1 trains acoustic modeling only using a causal SeaNet encoder-decoder to reconstruct mel spectrograms; Stage 2 freezes Stage 1 and trains semantic and paralinguistic encoders with contrastive learning between speech and phonemes, plus VAE-FSQ quantization; Stage 3 fine-tunes the complete system. The model uses causal convolutions for streaming, an 8-layer causal transformer for semantic projection, and a separate paralinguistic VAE encoder to capture speaker traits. Text-speech alignment is enforced through frame-level contrastive learning, while FSQ quantization addresses the long-tail distribution problem in traditional VQ methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves PESQ score of 1.77 at 0.27 kbps and 2.58 at 1 kbps
- Reaches codebook utilization of 98.06% using VAE-FSQ
- Maintains streaming capability with 12.08ms encoding latency and 0.038 RTF decoding speed
- Outperforms existing single-codebook codecs in both low-bitrate and streaming scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Frame-Level Contrastive Disentanglement
The model aligns speech and phonemes in a joint frame-level space using a similarity matrix and symmetric cross-entropy loss. This forces the semantic encoder to strip paralinguistic information by maximizing similarity only along the diagonal (matching frames) and minimizing it for off-diagonal elements (distractors). The ground-truth duration alignment stretches phoneme sequences to match speech frame lengths, allowing the contrastive loss to converge without label noise.

### Mechanism 2: Paralinguistic Bridging for Reconstruction
A separate global paralinguistic encoder (VAE) compresses speaker traits into a continuous vector that bridges the information gap between discrete semantic tokens and the continuous acoustic target. The architecture enforces a relationship where Semantic + Paralinguistic ≈ Acoustic, with the Semantic Connector taking both as input to predict the acoustic embedding. This enables high-fidelity reconstruction from a single codebook while maintaining speaker identity.

### Mechanism 3: VAE + Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ)
FSQ replaces traditional VQ by bounding latent dimensions to a specific range and rounding them to discrete levels, creating an "implied codebook" as the product of scalar levels. This approach alleviates the long-tail distribution problem of tokens and improves codebook utilization (98.06%) by preventing the unbounded distribution issues of standard VAEs and the under-utilization of VQ codebooks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Causal Convolutions & Masking**
  - Why needed: Streaming support requires avoiding future context to minimize latency
  - Quick check: Does the 12.08ms latency budget account for kernel size and stride of causal layers?

- **Concept: VAE Reparameterization & KL Collapse**
  - Why needed: Paralinguistic encoder is a VAE that can suffer from KL collapse where latent variance becomes huge
  - Quick check: If KL loss drops to near zero before margin is applied, is the model learning distinct paralinguistic features?

- **Concept: Straight-Through Estimator (STE)**
  - Why needed: FSQ rounding has zero gradient almost everywhere; STE bypasses this by passing gradients through rounding as identity
  - Quick check: Are gradients flowing correctly through FSQ bounds, or vanishing in deep layers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Speech Encoder (Causal SeaNet) → Semantic Projection (Causal Transformer + VAE) → FSQ → Semantic Connector → Decoder; Paralinguistic Encoder (VAE) → Global Vector; Phoneme Encoder + Length Regulator → Contrastive Loss

- **Critical path:** Acoustic-Constrained Multi-Stage Optimization (Algorithm 1). Semantic/Paralinguistic modules cannot train until Stage 1 acoustic modeling converges, as Semantic Connector predicts frozen acoustic projection.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Global paralinguistic vector (3s window) simplifies disentanglement but trades fine-grained prosody control for cleaner semantic separation; FSQ (single codebook) simplifies LLM modeling but constrains bitrate capacity vs. RVQ.

- **Failure signatures:** High WER indicates semantic encoder failure (contrastive loss or FSQ capacity issue); low speaker similarity indicates paralinguistic encoder failure or over-smoothing by Semantic Connector; mode collapse from skipping multi-stage optimization results in semantic tokens containing speaker info.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Verify Stage 1 acoustic convergence by training speech encoder + decoder isolation with L_mel only
  2. Visualize FSQ latent dimension histogram to check if values hit bounds or cluster in center
  3. Ablate paralinguistic input by using zero-vector G while keeping S fixed to test disentanglement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Unsupervised Disentanglement:** Can unsupervised methods replace labeled text-phoneme pairs while maintaining semantic alignment? Current model depends on ground-truth duration and phoneme inputs, limiting training to labeled datasets.

- **Multilingual Generalization:** How well does the model generalize to languages with phonetic/prosodic structures distinct from English and Chinese? Cross-modal alignment may not transfer zero-shot to unrepresented languages.

- **Subjective Quality Validation:** Do objective PESQ improvements correlate with perceptual quality in human listening tests? At extreme low bitrates, objective scores may not capture subtle artifacts perceptible to humans.

- **Decoding Latency Optimization:** Can decoding latency be optimized for true real-time interaction given external vocoder bottlenecks? While architecture is causal, vocoder computational cost may hinder low-latency deployment.

## Limitations

- Streaming latency claim (12.08ms) is difficult to verify without full architectural details, particularly causal convolution kernel sizes and transformer layer cumulative effects
- Phoneme duration alignment method described only as "length regulator" without specifying tool or algorithm, creating reproducibility issues
- Cross-modal alignment effectiveness depends heavily on accurate duration alignment; misalignment would directly degrade semantic quality through incorrect contrastive loss pairs

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in fundamental architecture design (VAE+FSQ semantic quantization + paralinguistic bridging) and multi-stage optimization approach
- **Medium confidence** in claimed PESQ scores and streaming latency, as experimental setup is partially described but key implementation details are missing
- **Low confidence** in direct reproducibility without access to exact duration alignment pipeline and complete hyperparameter specifications

## Next Checks

1. Implement and validate duration alignment mechanism independently using Montreal Forced Aligner on AISHELL-3 and LibriTTS, then test contrastive loss stability with artificially misaligned pairs to establish sensitivity thresholds

2. Replicate VAE+FSQ quantization module with different L and d combinations (L=2-4, d=4-10) to empirically determine relationship between codebook size and semantic quality (WER) for claimed 6561 codebook

3. Measure end-to-end streaming latency by instrumenting causal SeaNet encoder and 8-layer transformer with actual frame-by-frame processing, accounting for kernel sizes, strides, and batch processing overhead
