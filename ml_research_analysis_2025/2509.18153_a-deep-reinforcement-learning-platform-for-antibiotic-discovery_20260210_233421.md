# A deep reinforcement learning platform for antibiotic discovery

## Quick Facts

- 100/100 hit rate in vitro testing of designed peptides against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria

## Executive Summary
ApexAmphion is a deep reinforcement learning platform that combines a 6.4-billion-parameter protein language model with reinforcement learning to generate novel antimicrobial peptides. The model first fine-tunes on curated AMP data to capture antimicrobial sequence patterns, then optimizes via proximal policy optimization using a composite reward combining predicted minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and physicochemical objectives. In vitro testing of 100 designed peptides showed 100% hit rate with low MIC values (nanomolar range in some cases) and 99/100 exhibiting broad-spectrum activity against at least two clinically relevant bacteria. The peptides primarily kill bacteria by potently targeting the cytoplasmic membrane. This approach rapidly produces diverse, potent candidates and offers a scalable route to peptide antibiotics.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a two-stage transfer learning pipeline: first, ProGen2-xlarge (6.4B parameters) is fine-tuned on 27,148 curated AMP sequences using LoRA adapters to capture antimicrobial patterns. Second, proximal policy optimization (PPO) aligns the generator to a composite reward combining a learned MIC classifier (ApexMIC) with differentiable physicochemical objectives. The ApexMIC classifier uses an ESM2-8M backbone with an MLP head trained on 38,623 MIC-labeled sequences. Generated peptides are filtered by predicted MIC, physicochemical constraints, and novelty before experimental validation.

## Key Results
- 100% hit rate: All 100 tested peptides showed activity against at least one pathogen
- Broad-spectrum activity: 99/100 peptides active against ≥2 clinically relevant bacteria
- Low MIC values: Several peptides showed nanomolar-range MICs
- Membrane-targeting mechanism: Amphionins primarily cause cytoplasmic membrane depolarization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Two-Stage Transfer Learning with RL Alignment
Fine-tuning a large protein language model first on AMP sequences via supervised learning, then via reinforcement learning with PPO, produces higher-fidelity AMP candidates than direct generation or single-stage approaches. The pretrained ProGen2 model encodes broad evolutionary patterns, which LoRA-based supervised fine-tuning aligns to the AMP distribution without catastrophic forgetting. A second RL stage then steers generation toward low-MIC sequences using a composite reward.

### Mechanism 2: Composite Reward for Multi-Objective Optimization
Combining a learned MIC predictor with differentiable physicochemical objectives in a weighted reward function enables simultaneous optimization of antimicrobial potency and developability-related properties. The ApexMIC classifier outputs a probability of low MIC (≤32 µmol L⁻¹), combined with property-based rewards for charge, hydrophobicity, hydrophobic moment, length, and isoelectric point via clamp functions.

### Mechanism 3: Membrane-Disruptive Mechanism of Action
The generated amphionin peptides exert antimicrobial effects primarily by depolarizing the cytoplasmic membrane, rather than via outer membrane permeabilization or intracellular targets. Amphipathic, cationic peptides enriched in lysine and hydrophobic residues insert into bacterial membranes, causing rapid loss of transmembrane potential.

## Foundational Learning

- **Protein Language Models (pLMs)**: Why needed: ProGen2 is a GPT-style autoregressive pLM pretrained on billions of protein sequences; understanding its tokenization, attention mechanism, and generative sampling is prerequisite to fine-tuning. Quick check: Can you explain how autoregressive language models generate sequences token-by-token, and why next-token prediction pretraining encodes structural/functional information?

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Why needed: The paper uses LoRA to efficiently adapt a 6.4B-parameter model with minimal trainable parameters, preserving pretrained knowledge while specializing to AMPs. Quick check: How does LoRA decompose weight updates into low-rank matrices, and why does this reduce overfitting risk compared to full fine-tuning?

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Why needed: PPO is the RL algorithm used to align the generator with the reward function; understanding policy gradients, advantage estimation, and clipping is essential for debugging training instability. Quick check: What is the role of the clipping term in PPO's objective function, and how does it prevent overly large policy updates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: ProGen2-xlarge (6.4B params) -> LoRA adapters -> Supervised fine-tuning (Amphion-SFT) -> PPO optimization (Amphion-RL) -> ApexMIC classifier (ESM2-8M + MLP) -> Composite reward (MIC + physicochemical) -> Generated peptides

- **Critical path**: Curate AMP dataset → supervised LoRA fine-tuning (Amphion-SFT) → train ApexMIC classifier on MIC-labeled data → define composite reward (MIC + properties) → PPO fine-tuning → Amphion-RL → generate → screen → prioritize candidates for synthesis

- **Design tradeoffs**: Reward weight λ=0.5 balances potency vs. properties; tuning this shifts exploration-exploitation. ApexMIC threshold (0.4 vs. 0.5) trades inclusivity vs. precision in candidate selection. LoRA rank and learning rate control adaptation speed vs. forgetting risk

- **Failure signatures**: Mode collapse: Generated sequences converge to low diversity (monitor perplexity, unique sequence count). Reward hacking: High predicted MIC but low experimental activity (validate ApexMIC on held-out data). Training instability: Loss spikes or NaN values (check reward scaling/normalization)

- **First 3 experiments**: Validate ApexMIC on held-out test set (n=3,856) to establish classifier reliability before RL. Generate 1,000 sequences from Amphion-SFT vs. Amphion-RL; compare amino acid composition and property distributions against natural AMPs. Run ablation: train without property reward (λ=0) and assess whether generated sequences violate physicochemical constraints

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- ApexMIC classifier performance on truly out-of-distribution sequences remains uncertain; validation relied on cross-validation rather than external test sets with experimental MIC data
- Physicochemical reward constraints may bias generation toward membrane-targeting peptides at the expense of intracellular-acting candidates
- LoRA configuration and PPO hyperparameters are not fully specified, which may impact reproducibility and optimization stability

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Two-stage fine-tuning approach is technically sound and well-supported by literature; experimental validation of amphionins (100/100 hit rate, membrane depolarization mechanism) is robust
- **Medium confidence**: ApexMIC classifier reliability for guiding RL; generalizability of physicochemical constraints to diverse AMP mechanisms
- **Low confidence**: Optimal hyperparameter choices for LoRA and PPO; exact correlation between predicted and experimental MIC values for generated sequences

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ApexMIC calibration on a held-out test set of AMPs with experimentally measured MIC values to quantify true-positive/false-positive rates on novel sequences
2. Generate a diverse set of peptides with and without physicochemical constraints (λ=0 vs. λ=0.5) and test whether constraints eliminate non-viable candidates without excluding functional AMPs
3. Conduct a head-to-head comparison of Amphion-SFT versus Amphion-RL candidates on the same pathogen panel to isolate the contribution of RL optimization to potency and spectrum
