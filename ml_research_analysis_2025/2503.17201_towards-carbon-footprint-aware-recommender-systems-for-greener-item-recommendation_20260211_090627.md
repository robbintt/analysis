# Towards Carbon Footprint-Aware Recommender Systems for Greener Item Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.17201
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17201
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes RecipeEmission dataset and a reranking strategy achieving up to 89.1% greenness improvement with ~11% NDCG loss

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the environmental impact of recommender systems by introducing RecipeEmission, the first dataset incorporating carbon footprint data for recommendations. The authors benchmark nine conventional RecSys methods and demonstrate they consistently ignore sustainability when optimized for accuracy. They propose a simple modular reranking strategy that balances accuracy and greenness via a utility score, achieving significant carbon footprint reductions with minimal accuracy loss. The work establishes a foundation for greener recommender systems and offers practical insights for improving recommendation sustainability across algorithms and list lengths.

## Method Summary
The study introduces RecipeEmission, a dataset of 32,093 users and 5,605 recipes with user ratings and CO2-equivalent carbon footprint values. Nine conventional algorithms (Random, Global Mean, ItemKNN, UserKNN, SVD, SVD++, CoClustering, Slim, GNN) are benchmarked using NDCG for accuracy and GNDCG for greenness. The proposed method applies post-hoc reranking using a utility score that combines predicted relevance and greenness scores. This modular approach can be applied to any RecSys algorithm without retraining. The evaluation uses 60/20/20 data splits and random batch sampling to handle rating bias.

## Key Results
- Longer recommendation lists are inherently greener but less accurate
- Simple reranking strategy achieves up to 89.1% improvement in greenness with ~11% accuracy loss
- SVD and ItemKNN show the best accuracy-greenness trade-off among benchmarked algorithms
- Carbon footprint-aware recommendations are achievable without fundamental changes to existing algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Utility-Based Reranking
The system calculates a utility score $\mu_{u,i} = \alpha \hat{r}_{u,i} + (1 - \alpha) g_i$ combining predicted rating and greenness score. By sorting on this composite rather than rating alone, lower carbon footprint items are promoted. This works under the assumption that user utility isn't solely defined by predicted accuracy.

### Mechanism 2: List Length as a Greenness Lever
Longer recommendation lists inherently expose users to greener item distributions due to long-tail dynamics. Shorter lists are dominated by high-relevance/high-impact items, while expansion forces the algorithm to include greener mid-tail items.

### Mechanism 3: Post-Hoc Decoupling
Sustainability goals are decoupled from model training, treating greenness as a modular constraint applied after inference. The underlying RecSys model remains unaltered, allowing legacy systems to be "greenified" without retraining.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)
  - **Why needed:** Understanding NDCG is essential to interpret the "accuracy" metric and GNDCG for environmental impact
  - **Quick check:** Does NDCG penalize a relevant item more if it appears at position 10 or position 1?

- **Concept:** Reranking / Post-Processing
  - **Why needed:** The solution is a reranking step, not a new neural architecture; understanding post-processing trade-offs is crucial
  - **Quick check:** Why might reranking be preferred over modifying the loss function of a deep learning model for secondary objectives like greenness?

- **Concept:** Collaborative Filtering (SVD / KNN)
  - **Why needed:** Understanding neighborhood-based (KNN) vs factorization-based (SVD) methods is required to interpret results showing factorization has better accuracy-greenness trade-off
  - **Quick check:** Which method typically handles sparse data better for ranking tasks: User-based KNN or Matrix Factorization (SVD)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Base Recommender -> Greenness DB -> Utility Reranker
- **Critical path:** User Request → Base Model Inference (Generate top-N candidates) → Fetch Greenness Scores → Compute Utility μ → Sort & Truncate to k → Display
- **Design tradeoffs:** The α parameter is the primary lever; high α prioritizes traditional accuracy, low α prioritizes carbon reduction. Accuracy vs. satisfaction trade-off exists as user satisfaction may not be linear with NDCG.
- **Failure signatures:** The "Price-Greenness" Trap (recommending greener but more expensive items), uniform lists when candidate pool is too homogeneous, and cold start issues for items without greenness data.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Establish baseline with Base Recommender measuring NDCG@k and GNDCG@k without reranking (α=1), 2) Calibrate α by running Reranker with varying α values to plot Pareto frontier, 3) Ablation on list length by repeating best α setting for different k values (10, 20, 50).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Do deep learning-based recommender algorithms perform differently regarding greenness compared to conventional baselines?**
  - The authors hypothesize deep learning models might be less green due to overparameterization and overfitting, but only conventional methods were benchmarked.

- **How does incorporating greenness into multidimensional optimization affect the trade-off with accuracy?**
  - The authors suggest future studies could consider multi-objective optimization including diversity, novelty, and serendipity alongside greenness.

- **Are the observed greenness distributions and trade-offs generalizable to other domains beyond food recommendations?**
  - The authors call for research to mine other real datasets to determine if these distributions are specific to food or hold across domains.

## Limitations
- The greenness metric (CO2-eq) is static and derived from ingredient-level data, not accounting for real-world variations in supply chains or user location
- Empirical evaluation is confined to a single food recommendation dataset, raising generalizability questions
- The study does not explore user satisfaction or conversion impacts beyond NDCG metrics
- Dynamic carbon footprints (varying by time or location) are not considered in the static post-hoc reranking approach

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The observation that longer recommendation lists are inherently greener (supported by empirical results)
- **Medium Confidence:** The effectiveness of the modular reranking strategy achieving significant greenness improvements with minimal accuracy loss
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about user tolerance for accuracy loss in favor of sustainability, as user satisfaction was not directly measured

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Transfer Test:** Apply the reranking strategy to a non-food dataset (e.g., movie or product recommendations) to verify if the accuracy-greenness trade-off holds across domains

2. **Dynamic Greenness Evaluation:** Introduce time-varying or location-dependent carbon footprints to test if the static post-hoc reranking still performs well under dynamic conditions

3. **User-Centric Validation:** Conduct an A/B test measuring not just NDCG, but also click-through rate, conversion, and qualitative feedback to assess real-world user acceptance of greener recommendations
