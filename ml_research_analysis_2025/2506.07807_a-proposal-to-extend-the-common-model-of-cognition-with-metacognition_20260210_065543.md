# A Proposal to Extend the Common Model of Cognition with Metacognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.07807
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07807
- Reference count: 18
- The paper proposes extending the Common Model of Cognition to integrate metacognition as a unified component of cognition rather than a separate hierarchical layer.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes extending the Common Model of Cognition (CMC) to integrate metacognition as a unified component of cognition rather than a separate hierarchical layer. The authors argue that metacognition should involve reasoning over explicit representations of an agent's cognitive capabilities and processes within working memory. The proposal introduces minimal architectural extensions: process-state buffers for each module to provide real-time information about module states, episodic memory to reconstruct past reasoning trajectories, and hypothetical state representations to enable future/past reasoning without confusion. The approach leverages existing CMC capabilities and knowledge structures rather than creating new modules. Three examples demonstrate the proposal: Wordle word retrieval (using process-state information to infer word familiarity), chess move selection (using hypothetical state exploration), and robot task optimization (using episodic memory for retrospective analysis). The unified approach allows seamless transitions between base-level reasoning and metareasoning, treating the only difference as whether working memory structures concern the agent's cognitive capabilities.

## Method Summary
The proposal extends the CMC with three minimal architectural additions to support metacognition. First, each module (procedural memory, declarative memory, perception, motor) maintains a process-state buffer in working memory that reports real-time status—success/failure, confidence levels, partial results, or "feeling of knowing." Second, episodic memory provides the ability to reconstruct past reasoning trajectories for retrospective analysis. Third, substate mechanisms create hypothetical representations in working memory that allow base-level procedural knowledge to operate on them while including distinguishing features to prevent confusion with current reality. The approach requires no new modules—metacognition operates through existing CMC capabilities with enhanced working memory content. The unified framework treats metacognition as reasoning about cognitive processes rather than as a separate hierarchical layer.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates that metacognition can be integrated into the CMC through minimal architectural extensions rather than new modules
- Shows three concrete examples where metacognition improves performance: Wordle word retrieval, chess move selection, and robot task optimization
- Proposes that the only difference between base-level reasoning and metareasoning is whether working memory structures concern the agent's cognitive capabilities or the external task
- Introduces process-state buffers, enhanced episodic memory, and hypothetical state representations as the minimal requirements for cognitive-level metacognition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Process-State Buffers Enable Metacognitive Initiation
- Claim: Metacognition can be triggered when module process-state information signals processing deviations in working memory.
- Mechanism: Each module maintains a process-state buffer in working memory that reports real-time status—success/failure, confidence levels, partial results, or "feeling of knowing." These signals allow procedural knowledge to detect when base-level reasoning has stalled or failed.
- Core assumption: Agents require explicit, queryable representations of their own cognitive processing states to initiate targeted metareasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "metacognition involves reasoning over explicit representations of an agent's cognitive capabilities and processes in working memory"
  - [section 4.1] "each module has a process-state buffer added to working memory. It summarizes information about the module's state that can be a signal to initiate metareasoning"
- Break condition: If modules do not expose state information to working memory, metacognition cannot be triggered by internal processing failures.

### Mechanism 2: Episodic Memory Reconstructs Reasoning Trajectories
- Claim: Agents can perform retrospective metacognition by retrieving past reasoning sequences from episodic memory into working memory.
- Mechanism: Episodic memory incrementally and automatically acquires episodes with temporal relations. When triggered, agents retrieve reasoning traces into working memory, enabling analysis of past decisions, error detection, and strategy learning.
- Core assumption: Metacognition requires access to reasoning history, not just instantaneous states; temporal structure matters for retrospective analysis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "The ability to reconstruct prior reasoning trajectories is precisely what episodic memory can provide"
  - [section 5.3] Robot retrieves behavioral trace from episodic memory, detects redundant refrigerator door operations, learns to inhibit unnecessary actions
- Break condition: If episodes are not stored with temporal relations or cannot be retrieved due to interference, retrospective metacognition fails.

### Mechanism 3: Hypothetical State Representations Enable Simulation Without Confusion
- Claim: Agents can explore counterfactual or future states using base-level knowledge without conflating them with reality.
- Mechanism: Substate mechanisms create hypothetical representations in working memory that (1) allow base-level procedural knowledge to operate on them, and (2) include distinguishing features to prevent hallucination. This supports planning, retrospective reconsideration, and strategy evaluation.
- Core assumption: Base-level reasoning knowledge can be reused for metareasoning if hypothetical states are properly contextualized and marked as non-current.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "means of creating past or future hypothetical states in working memory with two seemingly contradictory properties"
  - [section 4.1] "The substate mechanisms in Sigma and Soar provide concurrent representations of the current situation for base-level reasoning and hypothetical states"
  - [section 5.2] Chess example uses substate to internally try different moves on copies of current state
- Break condition: If hypothetical states cannot be distinguished from current reality, agents will hallucinate or disrupt ongoing task reasoning.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cognitive Cycle (CMC Core)**
  - Why needed here: The unified approach operates metacognition through the same cognitive cycle as base-level reasoning—procedural memory responds to working memory changes each cycle.
  - Quick check question: Can you describe how procedural memory selects actions based on working memory contents on each cognitive cycle?

- **Concept: Working Memory Buffers**
  - Why needed here: Process-state buffers extend the existing buffer architecture; understanding module buffers is prerequisite to implementing the proposed extensions.
  - Quick check question: What role do module buffers play in connecting perception, memory, and motor systems to working memory?

- **Concept: Base-level vs. Metareasoning Distinction**
  - Why needed here: The unified approach treats these as the same architectural process differing only in subject matter; this is the core philosophical shift from hierarchical models.
  - Quick check question: In the unified approach, what is the only difference between base-level reasoning and metareasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Working Memory: Central hub containing task buffers + process-state buffers + hypothetical substates
  - Procedural Memory: Action selection; can create substates on impasse (Sigma/Soar)
  - Declarative Memory: Now separated into Semantic + Episodic (proposal extension)
  - Perception/Motor Modules: Each has associated process-state buffer
  - Substate Mechanism: Creates hypothetical states (native in Sigma/Soar; knowledge-based convention in ACT-R)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Implement process-state buffers for each module (including procedural memory)
  2. Add or distinguish episodic memory functionality from semantic memory
  3. Implement hypothetical state representation mechanism (substates or equivalent)
  4. Verify procedural knowledge can operate on metacognitive content in working memory

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Unified vs. Hierarchical: Paper chooses unified—no separate metacognitive module. Trades specialized processing for architectural simplicity and seamless transitions.
  - Restricted LTM access: Only working memory contents are reasoning-accessible. Trades omniscient metareasoning for efficiency and neural plausibility.
  - Architecture-specific implementation: ACT-R lacks native substates—requires knowledge conventions. Sigma/Soar have native support.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Hallucination: Hypothetical states not properly distinguished from current state
  - Metacognitive blindness: Process-state buffers not populated or not monitored by procedural knowledge
  - Frozen reasoning: Substates created but not terminating when resolution found
  - Retrieval interference: Episodic memory returns wrong/no episodes (Wordle example mentions interference from hundreds of prior games)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement process-state buffers; test failure detection by having declarative memory return low-familiarity results and verify agent can reason about unfamiliarity (analogous to Wordle example).
  2. Test episodic retrieval for retrospective analysis by logging agent actions during a multi-step task, then triggering post-hoc review to detect inefficiencies (analogous to robot refrigerator example).
  3. Implement substates/hypothetical representations; test decision-making under uncertainty by forcing impasse and verifying agent explores alternatives internally before acting (analogous to chess example).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific long-term knowledge structures (procedural and declarative) are minimally required for an agent to engage in human-like metacognition within this unified framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Our proposal is a framework, but it does not specify in detail the diverse and extensive indirect learned or pre-encoded long-term knowledge needed for an agent to engage in the forms of metacognition found in humans."
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on architectural extensions but deliberately leaves open the knowledge engineering challenge of what content must be encoded or learned.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies implementing agents with varying knowledge configurations, identifying which knowledge elements are necessary and sufficient for specific metacognitive tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the precise trade-off between restricting long-term memory access (preventing omniscient metareasoning) and metacognitive capability, and does this trade-off align with human cognitive limitations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Restricting access to long-term memories sacrifices omniscient metareasoning but enables efficient processing and memory functionalities consistent with neural memory models."
- Why unresolved: The paper asserts this design choice improves efficiency and neural plausibility but provides no quantitative comparison of capability loss versus efficiency gains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments measuring metacognitive performance and processing time between architectures with restricted versus full memory access, correlated with human behavioral data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How should process-state buffer content be standardized across modules, and what metadata dimensions (certainty, partial results, feeling-of-knowing) are universally necessary versus domain-specific?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper lists example process-state information types but notes that ACT-R, Sigma, and Soar implement these inconsistently—Sigma and Soar include procedural process-state information while ACT-R does not.
- Why unresolved: The proposal provides examples but no systematic specification of required versus optional process-state information across module types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-architecture implementation studies identifying which process-state information types are required to support the three example scenarios and additional metacognitive tasks.

## Limitations
- The proposal provides a high-level architectural framework but lacks specific implementation details for knowledge encoding and production rules necessary to replicate the demonstrated scenarios
- While the theoretical integration of metacognition into the CMC is sound, empirical validation across diverse cognitive architectures (particularly ACT-R without native substates) remains to be demonstrated
- The paper assumes existing CMC knowledge structures can support metacognitive reasoning without modification, but the sufficiency of these structures for complex metareasoning tasks is unverified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The unified architectural approach treating metacognition as reasoning over explicit cognitive representations (process states, episodic traces, hypothetical states) is theoretically coherent and aligns with established cognitive science principles
- **Medium Confidence**: The minimal extensions (process-state buffers, enhanced episodic memory, substate mechanisms) are sufficient to enable metacognition, as the proposal demonstrates plausible integration with existing CMC capabilities
- **Low Confidence**: The practical implementation feasibility across all CMC variants (particularly ACT-R) and the sufficiency of base-level knowledge structures for complex metareasoning without architectural modifications

## Next Checks
1. **Process-State Implementation**: Implement module process-state buffers in a CMC implementation and verify metacognitive initiation through simulated processing failures (e.g., low-confidence retrieval signals triggering metareasoning)
2. **Episodic Retrieval Validation**: Test retrospective metacognition by logging agent reasoning trajectories, introducing controlled errors, and verifying the agent can retrieve and analyze past episodes to detect and correct reasoning failures
3. **Substate Discrimination Testing**: Implement hypothetical state representations and validate that the agent can distinguish between current reality and hypothetical scenarios, preventing hallucination while enabling effective planning and reconsideration
