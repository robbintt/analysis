# Robust Differentiable Collision Detection for General Objects

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.06267
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06267
- Authors: Jiayi Chen; Wei Zhao; Liangwang Ruan; Baoquan Chen; He Wang

- Primary result: Median error below 0.1mm and accuracy improvements exceeding 40% over baselines on DexGraspNet and Objaverse datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a robust differentiable collision detection framework that computes gradients of witness points for both convex and concave objects. The method introduces distance-based randomized smoothing with adaptive sampling and equivalent gradient transport to handle complex geometries and scales. Experiments show significant improvements over baselines in terms of accuracy and robustness, particularly for concave objects and when only optimizing a single object.

## Method Summary
The framework uses distance-based softmax smoothing to approximate the non-differentiable witness point selection, with adaptive sampling to focus on relevant surface regions. It employs equivalent gradient transport to enable efficient single-object optimization. The method is evaluated on DexGraspNet and Objaverse datasets with 100 object pairs × 1024 tasks, using loss functions based on witness point alignment with target points.

## Key Results
- Median error below 0.1mm on DexGraspNet and Objaverse datasets
- Accuracy improvements exceeding 40% over baselines for collision detection tasks
- Demonstrated success in dexterous grasp refinement task with improved contact alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Distance-based Smoothing
Distance-based smoothing restores gradient flow for witness points on general geometries by using squared Euclidean distance scores instead of direction vectors, which fail in concave regions.

### Mechanism 2: Adaptive Sampling
Adaptive sampling stabilizes gradient quality by dynamically adjusting the sampling radius based on the distance between current witness points and targets, preventing sampling regions from being too small or too large.

### Mechanism 3: Equivalent Gradient Transport
Equivalent Gradient Transport allows efficient single-object optimization by simulating relative pose updates through the Adjoint operator, enabling gradient updates to be effectively applied to the optimized object.

## Foundational Learning

- **Witness Points**: Closest/penetration points between objects needed for collision detection and optimization. Quick check: For intersecting spheres, witness points lie on the line connecting centers at deepest penetration.

- **Randomized Smoothing/Softmax Relaxation**: Used to approximate non-differentiable argmax with differentiable probability distributions. Quick check: Low temperature τ in softmax approaches hard maximum as distribution becomes peaky.

- **Lie Groups and SE(3)**: Required to understand pose representation and gradient transport using Adjoint operators. Quick check: Adjoint operator $Ad_T$ transforms spatial velocity from one frame to another.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (meshes, poses, targets) -> Preprocessing (candidate point pools) -> Forward Pass (collision detection) -> Sampling (filter candidates) -> Softmax (compute weights) -> Backward Pass (compute Jacobians) -> Equivalent Gradient Transport (if single object)

- **Critical path**: Adaptive Sampling and Gradient Transport are critical; if sampling misses relevant geometry, gradients vanish or point incorrectly.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Distance vs Direction Smoothing (distance robust to concavity but computationally heavier); Fixed vs Adaptive (adaptive better for complex shapes but adds runtime overhead).

- **Failure signatures**: Stalling on planes due to discontinuity; sensitivity to $\beta$ parameter in direction-based baselines; witness points on vertices yield zero derivatives.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Convex Sanity Check - verify gradient descent on convex objects; 2) Concave Stress Test - test on concave objects where direction methods fail; 3) Transport Ablation - optimize only T2 with/without EG enabled.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can manual annotation of target contact points be eliminated by integrating with differentiable grasp quality metrics?
- Can Hydroelastic contact models be integrated to resolve discontinuity issues in point-contact models for face-face interactions?
- How can optimization landscape be improved to escape local minima when targets are on opposing sides of objects?
- Does the method maintain robustness when integrated into full planning and control pipelines for contact-rich manipulation?

## Limitations
- Point-contact model breaks down for large planar contacts, causing optimization to stall
- Performance depends heavily on candidate set density for adaptive sampling
- Optimization can get trapped in local minima when target points are on opposing sides of objects

## Confidence
- High - Convex object gradient accuracy and DexGraspNet median error results (<0.1mm)
- Medium - Adaptive sampling improvements on concave objects (Table II, accuracy gains ~7%)
- Low - Generalization to real-world grasp refinement without retraining on task-specific data

## Next Checks
1. Test robustness to mesh resolution by running experiments on same objects with varying vertex densities
2. Evaluate performance on objects with large planar contact areas where point-contact assumption breaks down
3. Validate equivalent gradient transport in multi-object scenarios with kinematic constraints
