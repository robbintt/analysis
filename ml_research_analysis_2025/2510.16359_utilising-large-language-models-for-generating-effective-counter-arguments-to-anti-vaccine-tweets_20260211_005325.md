# Utilising Large Language Models for Generating Effective Counter Arguments to Anti-Vaccine Tweets

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.16359
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16359
- **Reference count**: 7
- **Primary result**: LLM-based pipelines with label-aware prompting outperform generic generation for countering anti-vaccine tweets.

## Executive Summary
This work explores using large language models (LLMs) to generate effective counter-arguments for anti-vaccine tweets. It introduces a multi-step pipeline that first classifies tweets into misinformation themes and then generates tailored rebuttals using label-aware prompts. Experiments compare different prompting strategies and fine-tune small language models on curated datasets of counter-arguments. Human and LLM-based evaluations show that incorporating label descriptions improves argument quality and persuasiveness. The approach demonstrates that structured reasoning and prompt engineering significantly enhance automated counter-misinformation efforts.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a two-step pipeline: (1) multi-label classification of tweets into 11 anti-vaccine misinformation themes using fine-tuned models (T5-Base/Large, RoBERTa-Large), and (2) generation of counter-arguments using either GPT-4o or fine-tuned small language models (Gemma-2B, LLaMA-3.2-3B/1B, etc.). Label descriptions are incorporated into prompts to guide generation. Knowledge distillation is used to fine-tune compact models on synthetic counter-arguments generated by GPT-4o-mini. The system is evaluated using ROUGE, BERTScore, human ratings, and LLM-based assessments.

## Key Results
- Two-step pipelines with label-aware prompting significantly outperform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in both generation quality and persuasiveness.
- Incorporating misinformation theme descriptions into prompts improves the relevance and depth of generated counter-arguments.
- Fine-tuned small language models achieve competitive quality at lower cost, enabling practical deployment.
- Label-aware models are preferred by human evaluators and score higher on factuality and coverage.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Incorporating descriptive labels of misinformation themes into prompts improves the quality and effectiveness of generated counter-arguments.
- **Mechanism**: Explicitly conditioning generation on specific labels and their descriptions (e.g., "Conspiracy theories suggesting hidden motives") directs model attention toward core argumentative structures. This reduces the search space, producing targeted rebuttals rather than generic responses.
- **Core assumption**: Classified labels accurately represent core concerns, and the LLM can effectively use these descriptions to modulate output.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Our findings demonstrate that integrating label descriptions and structured fine-tuning enhances counter-argument effectiveness..."
  - [section] "The counter-arguments generated using this enhanced prompt structure exhibited notable improvements in quality, demonstrating greater alignment with the tweet's underlying concerns..." (Section 3.2)
  - [corpus] Related paper "Working with Large Language Models to Enhance Messaging Effectiveness for Vaccine Confidence" supports tailored messaging but does not validate the label-based prompting mechanism specifically.
- **Break condition**: If label classification is inaccurate or descriptions are too vague, counter-arguments become irrelevant to the actual claim.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: A two-step pipeline with separate classification and generation stages outperforms single-model Chain-of-Thought approaches.
- **Mechanism**: Task decomposition separates semantic classification from conditional generation. Specialized fine-tuned models (e.g., T5-Base) perform classification more reliably than general-purpose models using implicit CoT reasoning. High-quality label descriptions then serve as strong conditioning signals.
- **Core assumption**: Specialized models outperform general models on combined reasoning+generation tasks; pipeline latency is acceptable.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "The analysis indicates that the Two-Step approach consistently outperforms CoT reasoning across both models... Two-Step surpasses the performance of Experiment 2 and closely approaches the results of Experiment 3..." (Section 5.3)
  - [abstract] "...allowing for more context aware rebuttals."
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is weak—no direct validation of two-step vs. CoT comparison in neighbor papers.
- **Break condition**: Classification errors propagate directly to generation. CoT may be more robust for implicit self-correction in some cases.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Knowledge distillation from large teacher models to small student models preserves generation capability while improving deployability.
- **Mechanism**: Fine-tuning compact SLMs (Gemma, LLaMA) on high-quality synthetic data from GPT-4o enables learning argumentative patterns and rhetorical strategies. LoRA and quantization enhance efficiency for resource-constrained deployment.
- **Core assumption**: Teacher outputs represent high-quality ground truth; student has sufficient capacity to learn the mapping.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "...knowledge distillation bridges the gap between state-of-the-art model performance and practical deployment requirements..." (Section 4.11)
  - [abstract] "...fine-tune small language models (SLMs) on curated datasets of counter-arguments."
  - [corpus] "Just as Humans Need Vaccines, So Do Models: Model Immunization" supports fine-tuning for specialized tasks.
- **Break condition**: Student models may struggle with edge cases or complex reasoning; may inherit teacher's factual inconsistencies.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-label Text Classification**
  - Why needed here: Critical first step—train models (T5, RoBERTa) to assign multiple thematic labels ('efficacy', 'political') to single texts, conditioning generation.
  - Quick check question: Given a tweet discussing both mandates and mercury fears, should the model output two separate labels, one combined label, or a probability distribution?

- **Prompt Engineering & Label-Aware Prompts**
  - Why needed here: Core mechanism requires structuring prompts to include predicted labels and descriptions to direct model attention.
  - Quick check question: How does `Generate a counter-argument for [text]. Discuss [Description 1] and [Description 2]` differ in effect from `Respond to this tweet: [text]`?

- **Knowledge Distillation & Supervised Fine-Tuning**
  - Why needed here: Deploy practical systems by training smaller models on teacher-generated data using ChatML formatting, LoRA, and appropriate loss functions.
  - Quick check question: Should training data consist of (tweet, human counter-argument) or (tweet, GPT-4o counter-argument) pairs for distillation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw Tweet → Classification Model → Predicted Labels → Sentence-BERT Mapping → Constructed Prompt → Generative Model → Counter-Argument

- **Critical path**: `Raw Tweet` → `Classification Model` → `Predicted Labels` → `Sentence-BERT Mapping` → `Constructed Prompt` → `Generative Model` → `Counter-Argument`. Label prediction accuracy is the primary bottleneck.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Two-Step vs. CoT: Higher accuracy/interpretability vs. simplicity/speed
  - Teacher vs. Student: Quality vs. cost/latency/deployment independence
  - Label Source: Human labels (impossible in production) vs. predicted labels (error source)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Misclassified Label: Counter-argument addresses wrong point
  - Generic Response: Bland/repetitive text indicates poor prompting or under-trained model
  - Multi-Label Mismatch: Only one concern addressed when multiple present

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Validate baseline generation with simple prompts (no labels) on test set; measure quality with BERTScore
  2. Test label-aware prompting: run classifier, construct enhanced prompts, compare output quality to baseline
  3. Distill to SLM: generate 2,000 training examples with GPT-4o, fine-tune student model (LLaMA-3.2-1B/Gemma-2B), evaluate quality-cost tradeoff against teacher

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Do the generated counter-arguments effectively reduce vaccine hesitancy or change user behavior in live social media environments?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper evaluates "persuasiveness" and "effectiveness" using offline human judgment (Section 4.1) and automatic metrics, rather than measuring actual stance shifts in real-time interactions with vaccine skeptics.
- **Why unresolved**: Survey-based annotations measure perceived quality, but they do not capture the dynamic psychological impact of a rebuttal on a skeptical user in the wild, nor do they validate the "mitigation" claims.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An intervention study where these models reply to live anti-vaccine tweets, measuring engagement metrics and stance changes in the original posters' subsequent tweets.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How does the quality of LLM-generated arguments compare to those written by domain experts (e.g., medical professionals) rather than generalist annotators?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] Section 3.1 notes the human baseline was generated by "two humans with average expertise," potentially setting a low bar for the LLMs to surpass.
- **Why unresolved**: It remains unclear if the LLMs are producing "expert-level" rebuttals or if they are merely outperforming average laypeople in terms of depth and factual accuracy.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A comparative evaluation where medical professionals review and rate LLM outputs against expert-written rebuttals for clinical accuracy and persuasive soundness.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Do human preferences for label-aware counter-arguments hold across a statistically significant and demographically diverse population?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] Section 4.3 explicitly states the survey recruited only 4 participants (2 pro-vaccine, 2 hesitant), which limits statistical power.
- **Why unresolved**: Such a small sample size makes the reported 3:1 vote ratios highly susceptible to individual annotator bias rather than reflecting generalizable human preference.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A replication of the human evaluation study with a sample size of $N > 100$ to validate the consistency of the preference for "Counter-Argument B" across diverse demographics.

## Limitations

- **Human evaluation protocol underspecified**: Key methodological details (evaluator expertise, blinding, rubric) missing, limiting confidence in reported quality improvements.
- **Label description quality dependence**: Effectiveness hinges on accuracy and comprehensiveness of 11 misinformation theme descriptions, which are not validated.
- **Real-world effectiveness untested**: Focus on technical metrics and proxy ratings; no evidence of actual persuasion outcomes or behavioral change in live environments.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Technical pipeline implementation and superiority of two-step over CoT are clearly specified and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence**: Label-aware prompting improves quality, but limited by methodological uncertainties in human evaluation design.
- **Low Confidence**: Knowledge distillation claims lack direct validation; no systematic comparison of student vs. teacher performance on same inputs.

## Next Checks

1. **Human Evaluation Replication**: Replicate human evaluation with documented evaluator expertise, blinding procedures, and detailed rubric. Verify improvements persist under more rigorous conditions.

2. **Teacher-Student Quality Gap Analysis**: Generate 500 counter-arguments using GPT-4o and best fine-tuned SLM. Compare quality using BERTScore and human evaluation. Calculate absolute quality difference to assess deployment viability.

3. **Real-World Effectiveness Test**: Conduct randomized controlled trial measuring differential changes in vaccine attitudes between label-aware and baseline counter-arguments. Track both immediate reactions and longer-term attitude changes.
