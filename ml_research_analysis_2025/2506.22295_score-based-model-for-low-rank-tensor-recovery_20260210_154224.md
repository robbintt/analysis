# Score-Based Model for Low-Rank Tensor Recovery

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.22295
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22295
- **Reference count**: 13
- **Key outcome**: Score-based tensor recovery method achieves state-of-the-art results with up to 11dB PSNR improvement on image recovery and RMSE of 0.811 on Alog dataset.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a score-based approach to low-rank tensor recovery that replaces traditional predefined contraction rules with a learned energy function. The method models the gradient of the joint probability density between tensor entries and shared factors using denoising score matching across multiple noise levels. Experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods on both synthetic and real-world data, including sparse tensors, continuous-time tensors, and visual data.

## Method Summary
The method employs an energy-based model Eθ(x, z) parameterized by a neural network that captures compatibility between tensor entries x and latent factors z without predefined algebraic relationships. Training uses denoising score matching across L noise levels to learn the score function, optimized via Adam. For inference, missing or noisy entries are recovered using annealed Langevin dynamics. The approach also includes smoothness regularization on the energy function with respect to perturbations in shared factors, providing efficient denoising without computing gradients on the full tensor.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on sparse tensor completion with RMSE of 0.811 vs 0.833 on Alog dataset
- PSNR improvements of up to 11dB on image recovery tasks compared to traditional methods
- Outperforms existing approaches on continuous-time tensor recovery and visual data denoising tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Learning Implicit Compatibility via Energy Functions
- Claim: Replacing predefined tensor contraction rules with a learned energy function captures complex, non-linear dependencies between entries and shared factors.
- Mechanism: Traditional methods model likelihood as a Dirac delta centered on contraction functions. This method models the joint distribution using an energy function, learning the gradient of the log-joint to capture compatibility without rigid algebraic relationships.
- Core assumption: The relationship between latent factors and tensor entries can be represented by a smooth energy landscape where lower energy correlates with higher data likelihood.
- Break condition: If data follows strict linear structure, the learned energy function may introduce unnecessary approximation error compared to exact algebraic solvers.

### Mechanism 2: Denoising Score Matching for Robust Gradient Estimation
- Claim: Training a network to estimate the gradient of log-probability density across multiple noise levels enables robust recovery from sparse or noisy observations.
- Mechanism: Uses Denoising Score Matching to smooth the probability density and allows sampling via Langevin dynamics to find optimal tensor entries.
- Core assumption: Data distribution can be recovered by traversing the gradient of its log-probability, with noise perturbations covering the space between prior and data distributions.
- Break condition: If noise schedule is poorly tuned, Annealed Langevin Dynamics may fail to mix properly and converge to local minima.

### Mechanism 3: Energy-Based Smoothness Regularization
- Claim: Penalizing variation of the energy function with respect to perturbations in shared factors provides computationally efficient smoothness prior.
- Mechanism: Introduces regularization term that minimizes energy for nearby configurations, promoting smoothness without calculating gradients on the full tensor.
- Core assumption: Underlying signal is locally smooth with respect to latent factor embeddings.
- Break condition: If data contains high-frequency discontinuities not reflected in latent factor distances, regularization may over-smooth critical details.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Tensor Decomposition (CP/Tucker)**
  - Why needed here: Paper frames contribution as generalization of classical methods. Understanding that traditional methods map factors to tensors via fixed sums of products is necessary to understand why energy-based approach is more flexible.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a CP decomposition implies a specific "contraction rule" between factor matrices and reconstructed tensor?

- **Concept: Score Matching & Langevin Dynamics**
  - Why needed here: Core mathematical engine. Paper learns the gradient of log-probability, not values directly. Must understand that sampling requires iteratively following this gradient (Langevin dynamics) to recover a value.
  - Quick check question: Why does the model require a sequence of noise levels (annealing) rather than a single noise level for sampling?

- **Concept: Energy-Based Models (EBM)**
  - Why needed here: Network outputs scalar "energy" E(x,z), not probability. Understanding link p(x) ∝ e^(-E(x)) is crucial for interpreting loss function and concept of compatible factor-entry pairs having low energy.
  - Quick check question: How does the "partition function" (denominator in Eq 5) pose a training challenge, and how does score matching avoid calculating it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Observed Tensor → Missing Index Set → Latent Factors Z + Network Weights θ → Noise-Conditional Score Network → Scalar Energy → Adam Optimizer + Annealed Langevin Dynamics → Recovered Tensor

- **Critical path**: 1) Initialize factor matrices Z 2) Training Loop: Sample observed entries → Add noise → Compute Denoising Score Matching Loss → Update θ and Z 3) Inference: For missing/noisy indices, run Langevin dynamics using trained score network

- **Design tradeoffs**: Fixed Rank vs. Flexible Energy - you still define rank R for factors Z; BCD vs. Joint Optimization - uses Block Coordinate Descent for stability on highly corrupted data

- **Failure signatures**: Mode Collapse (generic/average entries), Divergence in Langevin (improper step sizes/noise scales), Over-smoothing (excessive regularization blurs details)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Synthetic Distribution Fit: 2-mode tensors from Beta/MoG distributions to verify energy model captures complex PDFs 2) Sparse Completion (Alog/ACC): Real sparse count data with varying ranks R ∈ {3,5,8} 3) Image Denoising (MSI): Multispectral images with mixed noise using BCD algorithm

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the recovery process for discrete data be optimized to avoid computational cost of grid search?
- Basis in paper: Page 3 states "For handling discrete data like image data, we use grid search algorithm."
- Why unresolved: Grid search is computationally expensive and heuristic, potentially limiting scalability for high-dimensional discrete tensors compared to continuous Langevin dynamics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integrating discrete score matching or continuous relaxation techniques that outperform grid search in speed while maintaining accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is there theoretical or adaptive method to determine optimal noise schedule hyperparameters (σ_max, L)?
- Basis in paper: Appendix B notes "Selecting appropriate hyperparameter values is critical step... particularly choice of σ_max and number of noise levels L."
- Why unresolved: Paper relies on manual selection and ablation studies, suggesting lack of principled, automatic mechanism for setting sensitive parameters.
- What evidence would resolve it: Learning-based scheduler or theoretical bound that automates noise level selection without manual tuning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can model automatically determine optimal latent rank R without pre-specification?
- Basis in paper: While paper removes structural assumptions, Table 5 shows rank R is manually fixed (e.g., 256 for images) rather than learned.
- Why unresolved: Latent dimension size remains required hyperparameter, contradicting goal of eliminating prior knowledge regarding tensor structure.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending framework to include non-parametric priors (e.g., Indian Buffet Process) or pruning mechanisms that infer R directly from data.

## Limitations
- Learned energy function provides no insight into actual tensor structure, making it difficult to diagnose why certain patterns are captured or missed
- Computational complexity of sampling via annealed Langevin dynamics scales with number of missing entries and required steps, potentially limiting scalability
- Performance depends heavily on choice of noise schedule and regularization parameters, requiring extensive tuning for different data types

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Claims about performance improvements on standard benchmarks (PSNR gains on image recovery, RMSE improvements on sparse completion) are well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: Mechanism explanation for why energy-based learning outperforms predefined contraction rules is logically sound but lacks ablation studies isolating specific contribution
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim of superior flexibility in handling complex data distributions is supported by synthetic experiments but would benefit from testing on more diverse real-world distributions

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on Noise Schedule**: Run experiments varying number and range of noise levels (σ_l) to determine sensitivity of recovery performance to this hyperparameter
2. **Runtime Scalability Test**: Measure wall-clock time and memory usage for progressively larger tensors (128×128×128 to 512×512×512) to quantify practical scalability limits
3. **Structure Recovery Analysis**: For synthetic tensors with known low-rank structure, analyze whether learned energy function preserves or reconstructs interpretable factor relationships, or if it merely provides accurate numerical recovery without structural insight
