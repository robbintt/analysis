# AI Security Map: Holistic Organization of AI Security Technologies and Impacts on Stakeholders

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08583
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08583
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduced a holistic AI security map organizing relationships between AI security technologies, negative impacts, and stakeholder effects

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for understanding AI security risks by mapping relationships between technical vulnerabilities in AI systems and their broader societal impacts. The authors develop an AI Security Map structured around two key aspects: the Information System Aspect (ISA) covering technical elements like confidentiality and integrity, and the External Influence Aspect (EIA) addressing impacts on individuals and society. Through systematic literature review, they identify 13 negative impacts in the ISA and 20 in the EIA, with integrity violations identified as particularly influential. The map reveals how AI system compromises can cascade into social harms, and importantly shows that misuse of functional AI systems can cause harm even when technical security elements remain intact.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed the AI Security Map through manual literature review of 40 referenced papers, synthesizing taxonomies of negative impacts in both ISA and EIA. The ISA includes CIA triad elements plus explainability, fairness, and trustworthiness, while the EIA covers privacy, reputation, critical infrastructure, and other social elements. They validated the framework by using GPT-4.1 to automatically classify a news article about AI cyber attacks into the defined categories. The map was designed to clarify attack-defense relationships and inform development of targeted countermeasures.

## Key Results
- Identified 13 negative impacts in the ISA related to confidentiality, integrity, and availability violations
- Cataloged 20 EIA elements and 36 negative impacts including privacy violations, misinformation, and effects on critical infrastructure
- Demonstrated that integrity violations have the most widespread influence across other technical and social elements
- Showed that AI misuse can cause harm even when ISA elements remain intact
- Validated automated classification capability using GPT-4.1 for news article analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Integrity violations in the Information System Aspect (ISA) may act as the primary driver for cascading failures across other technical and social elements.
- **Mechanism:** The paper posits that compromising integrity (e.g., via poisoning or backdoors) degrades accuracy, controllability, and safety. This technical degradation then propagates to the External Influence Aspect (EIA), leading to misinformation or physical harm.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: Technical integrity is a prerequisite for higher-order system properties like trustworthiness and fairness.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 5, Section 4.1]: "It is clear that the compromise of integrity can lead to negative impacts on all the six [non-CIA] elements."
  - [Page 5, Section 4.1]: "In the context of AI security, our map made us realize that integrity is a crucial element that affects many other aspects."
- **Break condition:** If an AI system is designed with modular isolation where output manipulation (Integrity loss) does not affect decision-making processes (Safety/Trust), the cascade breaks.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Negative impacts on stakeholders can occur via an "intact-but-misused" pathway, independent of technical compromise.
- **Mechanism:** Even if ISA elements (like Confidentiality and Integrity) are fully functional, malicious actors can exploit the *availability* and *accuracy* of the AI to generate harmful content (e.g., disinformation or malware), bypassing traditional security defenses.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: Security is not merely the absence of compromise but the presence of safe usage constraints.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "...misuse of AI can lead to negative impacts even when ISA elements are intact."
  - [Page 4, Section 3.2]: "The negative impacts in this aspect [EIA] are assumed to arise not only from attacks on AI... but also from the misuse of AI."
- **Break condition:** If usage is gated by strict "Human-centric principle" controls or access restrictions that limit output generation capabilities, the misuse pathway is blocked.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Harm to non-consumers (external stakeholders) propagates primarily through indirect chains involving social or psychological intermediaries.
- **Mechanism:** A technical failure (e.g., integrity breach) leads to an intermediate social impact (e.g., Disinformation), which then manipulates human decision-making (Human-centric principle), ultimately causing financial or psychological harm to non-users.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: Information flows from AI systems directly influence human behavioral patterns in predictable ways.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 8, Section 4.4]: "The second type is the case where negative impacts affect individuals and society indirectly, through multiple negative impacts in the EIA."
  - [Page 9, Table 4]: Links "Using AI for cyber attacks" (Abuse) to "Financial harm to non-consumers" via intermediate impacts like "Cyber attack" and "Disinformation."
- **Break condition:** If intermediaries (e.g., Disinformation detection or public education) successfully decouple the AI output from human belief, the chain to physical or financial harm is severed.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **CIA Triad Extension (ISA)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper redefines the standard Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA) triad as just one layer of the ISA, which also includes Explainability, Fairness, and Trustworthiness. Understanding this expansion is required to map technical bugs to social risks.
  - **Quick check question:** Can a system maintain "Availability" while violating "Trustworthiness" according to this map?

- **Concept:** **Stakeholder Externalities (EIA)**
  - **Why needed here:** The map differentiates between "Consumers" (users) and "Non-consumers" (bystanders). A holistic view requires analyzing how AI misuse affects those who did not consent to using the system (e.g., deepfake victims).
  - **Quick check question:** Who bears the "Psychological impact" if an AI generates non-consensual imagery, and which aspect (ISA vs. EIA) categorizes the root cause?

- **Concept:** **Direct vs. Indirect Impact Chains**
  - **Why needed here:** Risk assessment relies on distinguishing immediate technical failures (Direct) from long-term social erosion (Indirect). The paper suggests that integrity failures often trigger these long, indirect chains.
  - **Quick check question:** Does a data leakage (Confidentiality breach) represent a direct or indirect chain to "Privacy violation" compared to a "Disinformation" campaign affecting "Economy"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  The architecture is a directed graph with two distinct layers:
  1. **ISA Layer (Internal):** Nodes include CIA, Explainability, Safety. Edges represent causal dependencies (e.g., Integrity -> Accuracy).
  2. **EIA Layer (External):** Nodes include Privacy, Reputation, Critical Infrastructure.
  3. **Bridge:** Connections exist where ISA failures (or misuse of functional ISA nodes) trigger EIA impacts.

- **Critical path:**
  The path of highest systemic risk identified is: **Integrity Compromise -> Controllability Loss -> Disinformation -> Human-centric Principle Violation -> Physical/Financial Harm.**
  *Engineers should prioritize monitoring Integrity and Controllability to prevent downstream EIA cascades.*

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Granularity vs. Utility:** The paper notes that defining "Consumer" broadly (e.g., lumping developers and decision-makers) may obscure specific risks.
  - **Automation vs. Accuracy:** Using LLMs to automate this mapping (suggested in Section 5.2) trades the nuance of manual expert review for speed and scalability.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **False Negative:** Detecting a technical attack (ISA) but failing to predict the social consequence (EIA), leading to unpreparedness for reputational damage.
  - **Scope Creep:** Focusing defenses solely on technical CIA while ignoring "Misuse" vectors that exploit *functional* AI capabilities.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Incident Retro-Map:** Take a past AI security incident (e.g., a prompt injection attack) and plot its path through the ISA (Integrity/Confidentiality) to the EIA (Reputation/Privacy) to validate the map's connectivity.
  2. **Integrity Stress Test:** Introduce adversarial perturbations (Integrity attack) and measure the degradation in "non-security" ISA elements like Explainability and Trustworthiness to verify the hypothesized "Integrity is most influential" claim.
  3. **Automated Classification:** Implement the Section 5.2 use case: feed a real-time news feed into an LLM prompted with the AI Security Map definitions to classify emerging threats into ISA/EIA categories automatically.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**
  - Question: How can the degree of risk associated with each negative impact be quantified to transition the AI Security Map from a relational model to a quantitative risk assessment tool?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that currently "only the relationships among various factors are identified, and quantitative risk assessment has not yet been addressed."
  - Why unresolved: The map currently operates qualitatively, identifying *if* a relationship exists (e.g., Integrity breach leading to Disinformation) but not the magnitude or probability of that risk, which is necessary for prioritizing defenses.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A formal methodology or metric that assigns severity weights to impact chains, validated by correlating map predictions with real-world incident data.

- **Open Question 2**
  - Question: How can the definition and classification of security elements and negative impacts be automated to manage the rapid evolution of AI technologies?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify the "Automation of the Definition and Classification of Negative Impacts and Elements" as an open problem, noting manual curation is difficult "without omissions."
  - Why unresolved: The manual survey method used to build the current map cannot scale effectively with the speed of modern AI development, potentially rendering the map obsolete quickly.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A system (potentially LLM-based) that can autonomously ingest new security literature and accurately update the map's taxonomies and relationships.

- **Open Question 3**
  - Question: What is the appropriate granularity for defining security targets (stakeholders) to ensure the map provides actionable insights for diverse groups like developers versus decision-makers?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "security targets in our map are defined in relatively broad categories" and that "it is necessary to establish a more detailed definition of stakeholders in future work."
  - Why unresolved: Broad categories like "Consumer" may lump together users with vastly different risk profiles and information needs, reducing the map's utility for specific governance or engineering tasks.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A revised stakeholder taxonomy that successfully differentiates the specific negative impacts and required countermeasures for distinct sub-groups.

## Limitations

- Relies on expert literature review without empirical validation of the proposed causal relationships
- Uses a single example to validate automated classification capability without performance metrics or cross-validation
- The map's architecture and proposed mechanisms remain theoretical without systematic testing against real-world incidents
- Manual curation approach may not scale effectively with the rapid evolution of AI technologies

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The basic structure of the two-aspect map (ISA/EIA) and the cataloging of 13 ISA and 20 EIA negative impacts. The distinction between direct and indirect impact chains is well-supported.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that integrity violations have the most widespread influence across other elements, based on qualitative mapping rather than quantitative analysis.
- **Low Confidence:** The specific causal pathways proposed, particularly the indirect chains from ISA to EIA impacts, which remain speculative without empirical evidence of actual propagation.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a retrospective analysis of 10-15 documented AI security incidents, mapping each through the ISA/EIA framework to verify the proposed causal relationships and identify missing elements.
2. Perform quantitative analysis of attack patterns in AI systems to measure actual correlation between integrity breaches and subsequent impacts on explainability, fairness, and safety elements.
3. Test the automated classification system (Section 5.2) on a larger dataset of 100+ AI security news articles, measuring precision and recall against expert human classification to validate the framework's practical utility.
