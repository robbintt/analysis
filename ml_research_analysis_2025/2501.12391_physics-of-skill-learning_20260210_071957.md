# Physics of Skill Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.12391
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12391
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces three progressively simplified models (Geometry, Resource, Domino) that explain sequential skill learning, scaling laws, and modularity benefits in neural networks.

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding skill learning in neural networks through three progressively simplified models. The authors observe that skills are learned sequentially in a "Domino effect," where some skills only begin to learn after others complete. This phenomenon is captured by the Geometry model through task vectors in parameter space, abstracted by the Resource model as competition for limited resources, and further simplified by the Domino model for strict sequential learning. The framework successfully explains scaling laws, optimizer behaviors (particularly SignGD's strong sequential learning), and modularity benefits, with learning time scaling as O(n_task) for non-modular networks versus O(√n_task) for modular networks.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces three progressively simplified models for skill learning. The Geometry model represents skills as linear directions in parameter space with task vectors and simulates full optimization dynamics. The Resource model abstracts this to a competition for limited resources among skills using ODEs with a phenomenological parameter N₀. The Domino model further simplifies to strict sequential learning where each skill takes fixed time t₀. The models are validated on synthetic tasks including sparse parity problems and regression tasks, with empirical studies on MLPs demonstrating the O(√n_task) scaling advantage of modularity.

## Key Results
- SignGD optimizer produces strong sequential learning (Domino effect) where low-frequency skills only progress after high-frequency skills complete, while SGD/Adam show weaker sequential dynamics
- Scaling laws follow power-law distributions with exponents α_N ≈ 0.34 and α_S ≈ 0.28-0.37, matching Chinchilla results
- Modular networks learn faster (O(√n_task)) than non-modular networks (O(n_task)) when task decomposition is known
- The Resource model captures dynamics through a conservation law u_i^(1/p_i) = C across skills

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The Domino effect (sequential skill learning) emerges when SignGD optimization dominates high-frequency tasks, blocking progress on low-frequency tasks until the former complete.
- **Mechanism:** SignGD applies element-wise sign operations to the total gradient. When gradient magnitudes differ significantly (||g₁|| ≫ ||g₂||), the dominant gradient "wins" almost all sign decisions, causing sign(g₁ + g₂) ≈ sign(g₁). Low-frequency skills only begin rapid progress after high-frequency skills complete (gradient magnitude drops near zero).
- **Core assumption:** Task vectors are approximately orthogonal in parameter space; gradients from different tasks do not cancel constructively.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 2.3]: "SignGD will step in a direction whose elementwise signs align perfectly with those of g₁ while completely ignoring g₂."
  - [Figure 4]: Shows t₂/t₁ saturates to 2 for SignGD as p₁/p₂ increases, while SGD grows linearly.
  - [corpus]: Weak direct support; neighbor papers address skill learning in RL/robotics contexts but not this specific gradient-competition mechanism.
- **Break condition:** When task frequencies are balanced (p₁ ≈ p₂) or when using SGD/Adam with high β₂, the Domino effect weakens significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Skill learning dynamics can be abstracted as resource competition, where gradient-aligned dimensions function as a conserved resource pool.
- **Mechanism:** Each skill's learning rate is proportional to its share of total gradient magnitude: dᵤᵢ/dt = -ηeff · (pᵢuᵢ) / (Σpⱼuⱼ + N₀). The phenomenological parameter N₀ captures wasted resources not allocated to any task, which depends on learning rate, noise, and batch size.
- **Core assumption:** Skills are independent (total loss is weighted average); the "resource" interpretation is a valid coarse-graining of high-dimensional optimization.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 2.4, Eq. 1]: Defines the Resource model ODE with conserved quantities u₁^(1/p₁) = u₂^(1/p₂) = ... = C.
  - [Figure 7]: Shows N₀ decreases with learning rate, increases with noise, and scales as ~1/batch_size.
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus validation; this is a novel phenomenological abstraction.
- **Break condition:** When tasks have strong negative correlations (Cᵢⱼ < 0 in correlation matrix), skills can exhibit non-monotonic dynamics or permanent interference.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Modularity reduces learning time from O(n_task) to O(√n_task) by enabling parallel skill acquisition.
- **Mechanism:** Non-modular networks must learn skills sequentially (each skill takes t₀ ∝ 1/√n_dim). Modular networks partition n_dim into n_task dedicated subspaces, allowing all skills to progress in parallel with effective learning rate ∝ √(n_dim/n_task).
- **Core assumption:** Skills can be cleanly decomposed; the task dependency structure is known a priori for modular partitioning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 6.1]: "TN ∝ n_task, TM ∝ √n_task, which means the modular networks learn faster than non-modular networks."
  - [Figure 19]: MLP experiments show t₂ ≥ 2t₁ for non-modular (sequential) vs t₂ ≈ t₁ for modular (parallel).
  - [corpus]: Neighbor paper "Task Adaptation from Skills" addresses skill disentanglement in RL but does not validate this specific O(√n) speedup claim.
- **Break condition:** When skill decomposition is incorrect or unknown, modular partitioning can harm performance (Figure 18 shows modular models underperform early in training).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Task Arithmetic / Linear Representation
  - **Why needed here:** The Geometry model assumes skills correspond to linear directions (task vectors tᵢ) in parameter space. Without understanding task arithmetic, the resource interpretation and scaling law derivations are opaque.
  - **Quick check question:** Given two fine-tuned models with parameters θ_A and θ_B for tasks A and B, what happens when you apply θ_new = θ_pretrain + (θ_A - θ_pretrain) + (θ_B - θ_pretrain)?

- **Concept:** Power-law / Zipfian Distributions
  - **Why needed here:** Task frequencies follow pᵢ ∝ i^(-α), which determines scaling exponents (α_N, α_S) and the strength of the Domino effect.
  - **Quick check question:** If α = 2 and n_task = 100, what fraction of total gradient signal comes from the top 10 most frequent tasks?

- **Concept:** Optimizer Mechanics (Adam vs SignGD vs SGD)
  - **Why needed here:** The Domino effect is optimizer-dependent. SignGD (β₁=β₂=0) produces strong sequential learning; Adam's momentum/adaptation weakens it.
  - **Quick check question:** In Adam, what do β₁ and β₂ control? What happens when β₂ → 1.0 vs β₂ → 0?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Geometry Model -> Resource Model -> Domino Model
- **Critical path:**
  1. Choose model complexity based on question (optimizer study → Geometry; scaling laws → Resource; modularity → Domino)
  2. Specify task frequencies (power-law α) and optionally correlation structure
  3. Tune N₀ to match target dynamics (if using Resource model)
  4. Run simulation and extract skill trajectories sᵢ(t)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Higher α (heavier tail) → stronger Domino effect, but worse low-frequency skill learning
  - Lower N₀ → faster learning but less stability (more sensitive to noise)
  - Modular design → faster convergence but requires known task decomposition; early-stage performance can be worse than non-modular

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Skills with negative correlation (Cᵢⱼ < 0) may exhibit non-monotonic learning or permanent interference (Figure 8, underparametrized regime)
  - Noisy tokens with high loss will receive excessive weight if using loss-based reweighting without quality filtering (Section 4.3)
  - Modularity fails when task decomposition is wrong (no speedup, potential degradation)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Two-task sparse parity with varying p₁/p₂ ratio:** Train Geometry model with SignGD vs SGD vs Adam. Verify t₂/t₁ saturation (SignGD) vs linear growth (SGD). Plot gradient-aligned dimensions n_align over time.
  2. **Scaling law extraction:** Train Geometry model (n_task=1000, varying n_dim) with different α values. Fit loss curves to extract α_N and α_S. Compare to Chinchilla exponents (α_N ≈ 0.34, α_S ≈ 0.28-0.37).
  3. **Modular vs non-modular MLP on imbalanced regression:** Implement the (x², y²) task from Figure 19. Compare t₂/t₁ distributions across 100 random seeds. Verify t₂ ≥ 2t₁ (non-modular) vs t₂ ≈ t₁ (modular).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** What is the analytical behavior of the Resource model in the underparametrized regime (n_task > n_dim)?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "The analytical behavior of the Resource model in the underparametrized regime is left for future work."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current theoretical derivation relies on the overparametrized assumption (n_dim ≥ n_task). In the underparametrized regime, the model exhibits complex dynamics like non-monotonic skill learning due to negative interference, which the current linear theory does not explain.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A closed-form solution or phase diagram that predicts non-monotonic dynamics and determines the conditions under which skills fail to be learned or become negatively correlated.

- **Open Question 2:** Can skill frequencies p be reliably inferred from training losses ℓ in realistic settings?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "A promising future direction would be inferring frequencies p based on losses ℓ... However, questions remain about how to estimate C [the conserved quantity]."
  - **Why unresolved:** While a conservation law (u^(1/p) = C) exists for the MSE loss with independent skills, it is unproven whether this mapping holds for cross-entropy loss, correlated skills, or compositional task structures found in real data.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A robust algorithm that successfully estimates skill frequencies and the conserved quantity C solely from loss curves in large-scale language models, leading to improved data reweighting.

- **Open Question 3:** How can the inverse problem of inferring skill dependency graphs from training dynamics be solved?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "The ultimate goal is the inverse problem – infer the skill dependency graph and skill frequencies from training dynamics. This is no doubt an extremely challenging problem."
  - **Why unresolved:** The proposed models currently solve the "forward problem" (simulating dynamics given a graph). Reversing this to recover the graph structure from complex, entangled training trajectories requires disentangling overlapping resource competitions and dependencies.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A method that can accurately reconstruct the topology and weights of a known dependency graph (e.g., in a controlled compositional task) purely from observed training dynamics.

- **Open Question 4:** Is there a general recipe for mapping raw data points to the abstract "skills" used in the theoretical models?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "Lastly, we did not provide a recipe to map concrete data/tasks into our abstract notation of 'skills'."
  - **Why unresolved:** The models assume data points belong to discrete, independent skills. However, real-world data (e.g., natural language) likely involves complex mixtures or superpositions of skills, making the definition of the atomic unit of skill ambiguous.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A principled framework for decomposing a dataset into constituent skills that aligns with the linear task vectors assumed in the Geometry model.

## Limitations
- The three progressively simplified models sacrifice realism for analytical tractability, with the Domino model's strict sequential learning assumption potentially not holding for complex, overlapping skill dependencies common in real-world tasks
- The framework assumes additive task decomposition (loss = weighted sum of skill losses), which breaks down when tasks have negative correlations or complex interference patterns
- Most empirical validation uses carefully constructed synthetic tasks rather than real-world datasets, leaving uncertainty about performance on naturalistic skill learning problems

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The geometric interpretation of skills as linear directions in parameter space (Geometry model) and the empirical observation that SignGD induces stronger sequential learning than other optimizers
- **Medium Confidence:** The Resource model's phenomenological abstraction and the O(√n_task) scaling advantage for modular networks
- **Low Confidence:** The Domino model's strict sequential learning assumption for tasks with strong hierarchical structures

## Next Checks
1. **Real-world Multitask Benchmark Validation:** Apply the Geometry model to a standard multitask learning benchmark (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE) to verify whether the observed sequential skill learning dynamics match theoretical predictions
2. **Negative Correlation Stress Test:** Design experiments where tasks have explicitly negative correlations (Cᵢⱼ < 0) to probe the limits of the additive task decomposition assumption
3. **Transfer Learning Scenario Testing:** Evaluate how the framework applies to transfer learning settings where tasks share partial skill overlap rather than being completely independent
