# Combining social relations and interaction data in Recommender System with Graph Convolution Collaborative Filtering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.02834
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02834
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Graph convolution-based collaborative filtering model with user correlation matrix achieves superior performance on four datasets compared to baseline models like NGCF, LightGCN, and SocialLGN.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of improving recommendation accuracy by leveraging both user interaction data and social relationships. The authors propose a graph convolution-based collaborative filtering model that incorporates a user correlation matrix to capture high-order connectivity patterns in user-item interactions. The model eliminates feature transformation matrices and non-linear activation functions, following the LightGCN approach, and introduces a weighted user correlation matrix to enhance signal propagation. Experiments on four datasets (Gowalla, Librarything, Ciao, and Epinions) show that the proposed model achieves superior performance compared to baseline models like NGCF, LightGCN, and SocialLGN. The model demonstrates improvements in precision, recall, and NDCG metrics, particularly when social relationship data is integrated. The study also highlights the model's faster convergence speed, attributed to the user correlation matrix, making it both effective and efficient for recommendation tasks.

## Method Summary
The proposed model builds upon the LightGCN architecture by introducing a user correlation matrix to capture social relationships between users. The model propagates embeddings through both the user-item interaction graph and the user correlation graph in parallel, then aggregates the resulting embeddings for final prediction. The key innovation is the use of a weighted user correlation matrix where weights are determined by the number of shared items between users, with higher weights assigned to users with more overlapping interactions. The model eliminates feature transformation matrices and non-linear activation functions to simplify the architecture and improve efficiency. The final prediction is made by combining embeddings from both propagation paths and applying a simple inner product between user and item embeddings.

## Key Results
- The proposed model achieves superior performance compared to baseline models (NGCF, LightGCN, SocialLGN) on all four datasets
- Integration of social relationship data improves recommendation accuracy, particularly for precision, recall, and NDCG metrics
- The model demonstrates faster convergence speed attributed to the user correlation matrix
- On Librarything dataset, social integration shows mixed results with -1.8% NDCG but +2.4% Recall improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model's effectiveness stems from its ability to capture high-order connectivity patterns in user-item interactions through graph convolution operations. By incorporating social relationships via the user correlation matrix, the model can propagate information beyond direct interactions, leveraging the principle that users with similar social connections tend to have similar preferences. The elimination of feature transformation matrices and non-linear activation functions reduces model complexity while maintaining expressive power, following the LightGCN approach. The parallel propagation through both interaction and correlation graphs allows the model to capture different types of relationships simultaneously, with the user correlation matrix providing additional signal that helps the model converge faster and make more accurate predictions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph convolution operations**: Used to propagate information through user-item interaction graphs and capture high-order connectivity patterns
- **User correlation matrices**: Represent social relationships between users based on shared interactions, enabling information propagation beyond direct connections
- **Parallel propagation architecture**: Allows simultaneous processing of interaction and social relationship data through separate branches
- **Embedding aggregation**: Combines information from multiple propagation paths to create comprehensive user and item representations
- **Inner product prediction**: Simple scoring mechanism that computes similarity between user and item embeddings
- **Loss functions for recommendation**: Typically use pairwise ranking losses or point-wise regression losses to optimize recommendation quality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User-item interaction graph -> User correlation graph -> Parallel propagation layers -> Embedding aggregation -> Prediction layer

**Critical Path:** Input embeddings → Graph convolution operations on interaction graph → Graph convolution operations on correlation graph → Embedding aggregation → Inner product prediction

**Design Tradeoffs:** The model trades off simplicity and efficiency (by eliminating feature transformations and non-linearities) against potential expressiveness of more complex architectures. The parallel propagation approach adds computational overhead but captures different relationship types effectively.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance may indicate insufficient social relationship data, overly sparse interaction graphs, or inappropriate weight discretization in the user correlation matrix. Degradation on specific datasets (like Librarything) suggests dataset-specific challenges with social signal quality.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Compare model performance with and without social relationship integration on each dataset
2. Test different discretization strategies for the user correlation weight function
3. Evaluate convergence speed across different datasets to validate the claimed efficiency improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the model be extended to generate recommendations for groups of users rather than single individuals?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section V.B (Future Work) explicitly identifies group recommendation as a future direction, noting it is "useful in contexts where a group of friends go to the movies together."
- **Why unresolved:** The current model architecture is designed to aggregate signals from neighbors to predict a score for a single target user; it lacks a mechanism to reconcile the preferences of multiple users into a single group output.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modification of the proposed model incorporating an aggregation layer for group embeddings, evaluated on a dataset containing group interaction logs.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Would integrating item attributes or clustering item catalogs improve accuracy over treating items as independent entities?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section V.B states that "items have been treated as individuals; they are not clustered or grouped into catalogs," and suggests this may have omitted valuable information.
- **Why unresolved:** The current propagation equations (Eq. 9–14) rely exclusively on user-item interaction graphs and user correlation matrices, ignoring latent relationships between items (e.g., genre, location, or commodity group).
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative experiments where an item-item correlation matrix is introduced into the propagation layers, testing whether catalog-level signals improve Recall and NDCG.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the specific discretization of user correlation weights (Table 2) optimal, or would a continuous or learned function yield better results?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section III.A.2 and Table 2 define a function $f$ that converts Jaccard indices into specific fixed values (0, 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 1.0) based on intervals.
- **Why unresolved:** The selection of these specific intervals and values appears heuristic; the paper does not provide an ablation study to determine if these specific cut-off points are the most effective for signal propagation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A sensitivity analysis testing different binning strategies or replacing the static function $f$ with a trainable parameter to see if model performance is sensitive to the specific values chosen.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Why does the exclusive use of social friendship data degrade NDCG performance on the Librarything dataset?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Table 8 shows that the "Our w/ social" model results in a -1.8% drop in NDCG compared to the LightGCN baseline, while Recall increases.
- **Why unresolved:** While the authors note that Librarything's social network is a "secondary function," they do not explain why this social signal actively harms the ranking quality (NDCG) even though it helps retrieval (Recall).
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An analysis of the social graph density and noise levels in Librarything compared to Gowalla, specifically examining if social edges in Librarything introduce popularity bias that dilutes personalized ranking.

### Open Question 5
- **Question:** Can social signals be effectively integrated directly into the interaction or correlation matrices rather than maintained as a separate propagation branch?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section III.A.3 states, "We leave research on integrating social signals into other matrices for future research," opting instead to keep the social matrix $S$ separate.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates that separate propagation works well, but it remains untested whether a fused approach (e.g., modifying the adjacency matrix $A$ with social weights) could capture higher-order social-interaction dependencies more efficiently.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing the current parallel propagation architecture against a unified architecture where social trust scores are used to weight the interaction graph edges.

## Limitations
- The model's performance improvements are validated on four specific datasets, which may limit generalizability to other domains or data types
- The study does not address potential biases in social relationship data or how the model performs in cold-start scenarios with limited interaction data
- The specific discretization of user correlation weights appears heuristic and may not be optimal for all datasets or domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The model's improved convergence speed and effectiveness on the tested datasets are well-supported by the experimental results.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim of superior performance compared to baseline models is substantiated, but the extent of improvement may vary across different datasets and domains.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of the model to other recommendation scenarios and its handling of potential biases in social data are not fully explored.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments on additional datasets from diverse domains (e.g., e-commerce, streaming services) to assess the model's generalizability and robustness.
2. Investigate the model's performance in cold-start scenarios and with sparse interaction data to evaluate its applicability in real-world settings.
3. Analyze the impact of social relationship data quality and potential biases on recommendation accuracy and fairness.
