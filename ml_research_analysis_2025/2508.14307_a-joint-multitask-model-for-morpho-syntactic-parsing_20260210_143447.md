# A Joint Multitask Model for Morpho-Syntactic Parsing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.14307
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14307
- **Reference count**: 5
- **Primary result**: Best overall performance on UniDive 2025 shared task with average MSLAS 78.7%, LAS 80.1%, Feats F1 90.3%

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a joint multitask model for morpho-syntactic parsing in the UniDive 2025 shared task, which requires predicting both dependency parsing and morphosyntactic features under a novel annotation scheme that unifies morphology and syntax. The authors propose a model with a shared XLM-RoBERTa encoder and three specialized decoders for content word identification, dependency parsing, and morphosyntactic feature prediction. The system achieved the best overall performance across nine languages, demonstrating that joint multitask learning effectively addresses the challenges of unified morphosyntactic parsing across typologically diverse languages.

## Method Summary
The model uses XLM-RoBERTa-large as a shared encoder, followed by a linear projection layer and separate decoders for each task. Content word identification uses a BiLSTM classifier, morphosyntactic features are predicted with multi-label sigmoid classification, and dependency parsing employs biaffine attention with CRF decoding over projective trees. Training uses AdamW with per-language loss weight tuning, and inference applies confidence thresholding. The architecture explicitly learns to distinguish content from function words, which is crucial since this distinction determines which words participate in the dependency tree versus contribute features.

## Key Results
- Achieved best overall performance with average MSLAS score of 78.7% across nine languages
- LAS of 80.1% and Feats F1 of 90.3% demonstrate strong joint parsing and feature prediction
- Ablation studies show gold tokenization and content word identification improve performance by up to 12 points MSLAS for some languages
- Error analysis reveals nominal features (Gender, Number, Case) and core grammatical cases are most challenging, particularly Nominative-Accusative confusions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Explicit content word identification as a learned classification task improves downstream parsing and feature prediction.
- Mechanism: The model trains a dedicated BiLSTM-based decoder to classify tokens as content vs. function words before parsing. This creates a structured cascade where identification errors are isolated rather than propagating silently into dependency and feature predictions.
- Core assumption: The content-function distinction is learnable from contextual embeddings without hand-crafted heuristics.
- Evidence anchors: Ablation shows Hebrew MSLAS improves from 75.2 (Full) to 85.7 (GoldWT), a +10.5 point gain.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Joint multitask learning with shared encoder and language-specific loss weights captures task interdependencies.
- Mechanism: The XLM-RoBERTa encoder produces representations shared across three decoders. Loss weights are tuned per-language (e.g., Turkish: 2.0:2.0:1.5 for parser:morph:CWI; English: 2.0:1.5:1.0), allowing morphologically complex languages to emphasize feature prediction.
- Core assumption: Morphosyntactic feature prediction and dependency parsing share underlying linguistic representations that benefit from joint learning.
- Evidence anchors: Loss function is weighted sum: L_total = w_parser × L_parser + w_morph × L_morph + w_CWI × L_CWI.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Biaffine attention with CRF over projective trees provides structured dependency prediction.
- Mechanism: Separate MLPs predict arc heads and relations using biaffine attention. The parser is framed as a CRF over projective trees (TorchStruct), ensuring globally valid tree structures rather than independent arc predictions.
- Core assumption: Projective tree assumption holds sufficiently for target languages.
- Evidence anchors: Turkish shows dispersed error patterns, suggesting "the current architecture may not be optimal for highly non-projective languages."

## Foundational Learning

- **Universal Dependencies (UD) annotation scheme**: The shared task uses a novel UD variant where function words contribute features to content words rather than appearing as nodes in the dependency tree. Quick check: Can you explain how the new scheme handles "From the AP" differently from standard UD?

- **Multi-label classification with sigmoid thresholding**: Morphosyntactic features can have multiple values per token (e.g., Case=Ine;Atr), requiring independent binary predictions per feature-value pair. Quick check: Why would softmax be inappropriate for predicting multiple Case values on a single token?

- **Biaffine attention for dependency parsing**: The parser uses biaffine attention to score head-dependent pairs, a standard architecture you'll need to understand for debugging and modification. Quick check: How does biaffine attention differ from standard dot-product attention in how it computes scores?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw text → Stanza tokenizer → tokens → XLM-RoBERTa-large + character embeddings → Shared linear(768→512) + ReLU + dropout → (1) BiLSTM(256) → Linear(2) → softmax (CWI) → (2) Linear(512→|feature-values|) → sigmoid (Morph) → (3) Biaffine MLPs (arc: 256, rel: 128) → CRF decoding (Parser) → CoNLL-U format

- **Critical path**: Tokenization quality → content word identification → (dependency arcs AND feature prediction). Errors in CWI directly limit both downstream tasks.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Filtering abstract nodes simplified parsing but lost implicit argument information. Projective CRF constraint improves efficiency but hurts Turkish (non-projective) performance. Per-language models vs. single multilingual model traded language-specific tuning against cross-lingual transfer.

- **Failure signatures**: All tokens predicted as function words → fallback forces first token as root. Nominative-Accusative case swaps (154 and 140 instances averaged across languages). nmod vs. obl confusion dominates dependency errors (67 and 63 instances). Turkish shows dispersed error pattern indicating architecture mismatch.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce ablation: Train with gold tokenization (GoldTok) vs. predicted tokenization on a single language to quantify tokenizer impact. Expect 5-10 point MSLAS difference. 2) Loss weight sensitivity: Sweep parser:morph:CWI weights on development set. Start with (2.0:1.5:1.0) for English-like languages and (2.0:2.0:1.5) for morphologically rich languages. 3) Error analysis replication: Extract confusion matrices for Case predictions on Czech development data. Verify Nom-Acc swaps are the dominant error pattern before attempting fixes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would a dedicated non-projective parsing algorithm significantly improve performance on typologically diverse languages with flexible word order, such as Turkish?
- Basis in paper: The authors state that "the current architecture may not be optimal for highly non-projective languages" and that "future work could explore specialized parsing algorithms designed for non-projective structures."
- Why unresolved: The current model uses a projective CRF parser; Turkish shows dispersed error patterns contrasting with concentrated confusions in other languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing performance of non-projective parsing algorithms on Turkish against the current projective baseline, with analysis of attachment accuracy on non-projective constructions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would explicit indexing of function word–to–content word relationships improve feature assignment accuracy and annotation transparency?
- Basis in paper: The authors propose that "an indexing system could explicitly link each function word to its target content word" to reduce ambiguity and improve interpretability.
- Why unresolved: Currently, function words are marked with '_' and their grammatical information is implicitly incorporated into related content words.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing the current implicit assignment against a scheme with explicit indices, measuring Feats F1 and human annotator comprehension.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can linguistically-informed post-processing constraints eliminate semantically incompatible feature combinations and improve overall feature prediction?
- Basis in paper: Error analysis shows the model occasionally predicts incompatible combinations (e.g., both "Fem" and "Fem,Masc" simultaneously) in fewer than 100 instances.
- Why unresolved: The multi-label sigmoid classifier operates independently per feature-value pair without enforcing mutual exclusivity constraints.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing rule-based post-processing to filter invalid combinations and measuring the change in Feats F1 and semantic consistency metrics.

## Limitations
- The model's strong performance may not generalize beyond this specific annotation scheme where function words contribute features rather than forming tree nodes
- Critical language coverage gaps remain, particularly for highly non-projective languages like Japanese or Warlpiri
- Several key hyperparameters remain unspecified, creating reproducibility barriers between reported results and faithful reproduction

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The joint multitask learning framework with shared encoder and specialized decoders is well-established in the literature. The reported MSLAS of 78.7%, LAS of 80.1%, and Feats F1 of 90.3% represent strong performance on a challenging multilingual task.
- **Medium confidence**: The specific architecture choices (biaffine attention + CRF over projective trees, per-language loss weighting) are theoretically sound but lack direct empirical validation on this novel annotation scheme.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about the model's generalizability to other annotation schemes or languages outside the nine tested remain speculative. The paper doesn't provide evidence for cross-linguistic transfer or robustness to domain shift.

## Next Checks
1. **Architecture generalization test**: Train the same model architecture on standard Universal Dependencies v2.16 for five languages (English, Czech, Turkish, Portuguese, Swedish) to assess performance drop when function words remain as tree nodes. Compare against strong single-task baselines to quantify multitask learning benefits outside the unified scheme.

2. **Non-projective dependency handling**: Implement a non-projective parser variant (e.g., spanning tree algorithm without projective constraint) and retrain on Turkish development data. Measure performance gains specifically on long-distance dependencies and coordination structures where projective constraints fail.

3. **Robustness to segmentation noise**: Create synthetic tokenization errors (random merges, splits, swaps) at 5%, 10%, and 15% rates and measure degradation in MSLAS, LAS, and Feats F1. This validates whether the content word identification decoder can recover from segmentation failures or if errors cascade catastrophically.
