# Enhancing Machine Learning for Imbalanced Medical Data: A Quantum-Inspired Approach to Synthetic Oversampling (QI-SMOTE)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.02863
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02863
- Reference count: 40
- Improves F1-score by 12.11% on MIMIC-III and 24.30% on MIMIC-IV over original datasets

## Executive Summary
This study introduces Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel oversampling technique that leverages quantum principles to generate synthetic minority class samples for imbalanced medical datasets. Unlike traditional methods, QI-SMOTE transforms features into quantum-like states, preserves feature relationships via layered entanglement, and optimizes the resulting distributions using a Variational Quantum Eigensolver-inspired process before classical interpolation. The method achieved statistically significant improvements (p < 0.002) in cross-validation tests on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV mortality prediction tasks, with particular strength under high class imbalance conditions.

## Method Summary
QI-SMOTE encodes minority class samples into quantum states using RY rotation gates on Hadamard-initialized qubits, applies layered entanglement (CNOT → CZ → Toffoli gates) to capture feature dependencies, then uses VQE optimization to evolve states toward low-energy configurations that represent the underlying data structure. The real parts of these evolved states are appended to original features and fed to classical SMOTE for interpolation. This quantum-classical hybrid approach aims to preserve physiological relationships while expanding feature space coverage beyond traditional linear interpolation.

## Key Results
- 12.11% F1-score improvement over original MIMIC-III dataset
- 24.30% F1-score improvement on MIMIC-IV dataset
- Statistically significant results (p < 0.002) in cross-validation tests
- Superior performance under high class imbalance conditions (IR=10, IR=20)
- Better physiological realism in synthetic samples compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Layered Entanglement Preserves Feature Correlations
Layered quantum entanglement captures multi-order feature dependencies that classical SMOTE's linear interpolation misses. Features are encoded into qubits via RY rotation gates, then sequential entanglement gates create conditional dependencies: CNOT for pairwise relationships, CZ for phase-based correlations, and Toffoli for three-way interactions (e.g., blood pressure ↔ heart rate ↔ oxygen saturation). This ensures synthetic samples respect physiological constraints rather than generating implausible combinations like "systolic BP 160 mmHg with heart rate 40 bpm."

### Mechanism 2: Superposition Expands Feature Space Coverage
Quantum superposition encoding allows each minority sample to represent a distribution of potential feature configurations, increasing synthetic diversity without extrapolation. Hadamard gates initialize qubits in equal superposition (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2, then RY rotations encode normalized feature values as rotation angles. This creates a probabilistic amplitude representation where each sample embodies multiple nearby states simultaneously, providing richer interpolation targets than single-point representations.

### Mechanism 3: VQE Optimization Filters Low-Quality Synthetic Candidates
Variational Quantum Eigensolver-inspired optimization minimizes a Hamiltonian energy function, selecting synthetic samples that conform to learned data structure. After entanglement, a Hamiltonian H = Σ(w_ij Z_i Z_j) + Σ(b_i Z_i) encodes feature couplings and individual contributions. VQE iteratively adjusts parameters θ to minimize ⟨ψ(θ)|H|ψ(θ)⟩, evolving states toward low-energy configurations. The real part of evolved states |ψ_real⟩ becomes the enriched feature representation fed to classical SMOTE interpolation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Class imbalance and SMOTE fundamentals**
  - Why needed here: QI-SMOTE is a modification of SMOTE; understanding the baseline problem (minority class underrepresentation → classifier bias) and standard solution (k-NN interpolation) is essential to evaluate what the quantum-inspired additions contribute.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why SMOTE's linear interpolation might generate unrealistic samples when features have strong non-linear correlations?

- **Concept: Quantum gates and state representation**
  - Why needed here: The method relies on Hadamard (superposition), RY (rotation encoding), CNOT/CZ/Toffoli (entanglement) gates. Without understanding these operations, you cannot debug or modify the encoding scheme.
  - Quick check question: What does a CNOT gate do to a two-qubit system, and how would this model a dependency between two medical features?

- **Concept: Hamiltonian optimization and VQE**
  - Why needed here: The "evolution" step uses VQE to minimize an energy function. This is the optimization loop that differentiates QI-SMOTE from simpler quantum encoding approaches.
  - Quick check question: In VQE, what is the role of the ansatz, and why does the choice of optimizer (e.g., COBYLA) matter for convergence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
Minority samples (X_minority) -> [Feature Normalization] -> [Quantum Encoding Layer] -> [Layered Entanglement] -> [Hamiltonian Construction] -> [VQE Optimization] -> [State Extraction] -> [Classical SMOTE] -> Resampled dataset (X_res, y_res)

- **Critical path:** The entanglement-VQE chain (steps 3-6) is the novel contribution. If weights w_ij and b_i are poorly initialized, or if entanglement depth is too shallow, the optimization yields marginal gains. The paper uses 2 entangling layers with CZ gates; reducing this to 1 layer degraded results in preliminary tests.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Computational cost vs. synthetic quality: QI-SMOTE requires 50-100× more runtime and ~200× more memory than classical SMOTE. This is acceptable for offline medical model training but prohibitive for real-time applications.
  - Entanglement depth vs. overfitting risk: Deeper entanglement captures more complex correlations but may overfit to noise in small minority classes.
  - VQE iterations vs. convergence: 100 iterations worked for 3-9 feature datasets; higher-dimensional data may require more iterations or different optimizers.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Synthetic samples clustering at feature space boundaries → normalization issue (check min-max scaling)
  - F1-score not improving over baseline SMOTE → VQE not converging (increase iterations, check Hamiltonian weights)
  - Implausible feature combinations persist → entanglement too weak (add layers or verify gate application order)
  - Memory overflow on large datasets → QI-SMOTE scales poorly; consider chunked processing or dimensionality reduction first

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline comparison on subset: Take 100 minority samples from MIMIC-IV, run QI-SMOTE vs. SMOTE vs. SMOTE-ENN. Verify F1 improvement and inspect synthetic samples for physiological plausibility.
  2. Ablation on entanglement depth: Run QI-SMOTE with (a) CNOT only, (b) CNOT + CZ, (c) CNOT + CZ + Toffoli. Measure F1-score delta to quantify each layer's contribution.
  3. VQE convergence diagnostic: Log Hamiltonian expectation values across iterations. If plateau occurs before iteration 50, test alternative optimizers (SPSA, ADAM) or adjust ansatz depth.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How do noise profiles and hardware-specific errors in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices impact the fidelity and physiological realism of synthetic samples compared to the noise-free classical simulations presented?
2. Can the layered entanglement architecture effectively preserve feature correlations in non-tabular data structures, such as high-dimensional time-series or multimodal medical records?
3. What is the trade-off between the computational cost of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) optimization and classification performance on extremely large datasets?
4. How sensitive is the VQE convergence and resulting minority class distribution to the specific choice of ansatz structure and optimization hyperparameters?

## Limitations
- Computationally intensive, requiring 50-100× longer runtime than classical SMOTE
- Hamiltonian definition ambiguity between outer product and Ising formulations
- Circuit topology unspecified for >3 features, limiting reproducibility
- Poor scalability beyond ~10 features due to exponential state vector growth
- Limited validation to static tabular medical data, not tested on time-series or imaging

## Confidence
- High confidence: F1-score improvements over baselines are well-supported by cross-validation results and statistical testing
- Medium confidence: VQE optimization's role in filtering low-quality synthetic samples is supported but specific Hamiltonian formulation remains unclear
- Low confidence: Computational scalability claims and exact entanglement topology are insufficiently specified for faithful reproduction

## Next Checks
1. Runtime profiling: Measure QI-SMOTE execution time on 10-100 minority samples with 3-9 features to verify the 50-100s claim and identify memory bottlenecks
2. Hamiltonian clarification: Implement both outer product and Ising Hamiltonian variants; compare synthetic sample quality and VQE convergence to determine the intended formulation
3. Topological ablation: Test QI-SMOTE with linear vs. circular vs. all-to-all qubit connectivity for 4-6 features; measure impact on F1-score and synthetic physiological plausibility
