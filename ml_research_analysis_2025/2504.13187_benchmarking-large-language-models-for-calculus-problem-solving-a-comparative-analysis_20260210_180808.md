# Benchmarking Large Language Models for Calculus Problem-Solving: A Comparative Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.13187
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13187
- Authors: In Hak Moon
- Reference count: 12
- Chat GPT 4o achieved 94.71% success rate, highest among 5 evaluated models

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluated five leading large language models on 13 fundamental calculus differentiation problems using a cross-evaluation framework. Chat GPT 4o achieved the highest overall success rate at 94.71%, followed by Claude Pro (85.74%), Gemini Advanced (84.42%), Copilot Pro (76.30%), and Meta AI (56.75%). While all models excelled at procedural differentiation tasks, significant performance disparities emerged on conceptual applications, with problems involving increasing/decreasing intervals and optimization word problems proving most challenging. Claude Pro generated the most difficult problems for other models to solve, revealing distinct capabilities between problem generation and problem-solving. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs as calculus learning tools, emphasizing the continued importance of human instruction for developing deeper mathematical comprehension.

## Method Summary
The study employed a cross-evaluation framework where five LLMs (Chat GPT 4o, Copilot Pro, Gemini Advanced, Claude Pro, and Meta AI) each generated 20 problems for 10 calculus types and 5 problems for 3 complex types. Each model then solved all problems generated by all models, creating 5×5×N evaluation matrices. Solutions were scored binary correct/incorrect against ground truth, with errors classified as procedural, algebraic, or conceptual. The methodology prioritized process and correctness over explanation quality, using only first valid responses to ensure standardized comparison.

## Key Results
- Chat GPT 4o achieved highest overall success rate (94.71%) with only 5 errors across all problem types
- All models achieved 100% on procedural tasks (limit process, chain rule) but struggled with conceptual applications (49% on increasing/decreasing intervals)
- Meta AI showed highest algebraic error rate (62% of incorrect solutions involved algebraic manipulation errors)
- Claude Pro generated problems that were most difficult for other models to solve, indicating distinct problem generation capability
- Word problems were universally challenging, with Meta AI scoring only 4% on optimization problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs encode procedural differentiation rules as reproducible patterns but lack integrated conceptual reasoning chains connecting symbolic operations to their mathematical meanings.
- Mechanism: Pattern-matching architectures align with algorithmic differentiation procedures (limit definitions, chain rule), but interpreting derivative significance—e.g., connecting sign changes to increasing/decreasing behavior—requires multi-step semantic mapping not reliably captured in training distributions.
- Core assumption: Procedural fluency in training data (textbooks, solutions) is more abundant and regular than conceptual explanation patterns.
- Evidence anchors: All models excelled at procedural differentiation but showed significant performance disparities on conceptual applications; errors in conceptual understanding revealed fundamental limitations in linking operations to meanings.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Problem generation capability diverges from problem-solving capability because generation requires inverse reasoning from desired properties to function structures.
- Mechanism: Creating valid problems with specific derivative characteristics demands backward inference—reasoning from constraints (e.g., "f'(x)=0 must have rational solutions") to appropriate function forms—which is not the same forward pattern-matching used in solving.
- Core assumption: Inverse reasoning tasks are underrepresented in training or require architectural features beyond next-token prediction.
- Evidence anchors: Claude Pro generated the most difficult problems for other models to solve; models struggled especially with creating functions that have specific derivative properties requiring inverse reasoning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Algebraic manipulation errors persist after correct rule application because symbolic simplification requires precise multi-step arithmetic that compounds token-level prediction uncertainty.
- Mechanism: Even when differentiation rules are correctly identified and applied, subsequent polynomial expansion, factoring, or fraction simplification involves longer computation chains where single-token errors propagate—LLMs lack external symbolic verification loops.
- Core assumption: Language models lack intrinsic algebraic consistency checking; errors are not self-corrected without external tools.
- Evidence anchors: The most common error across all models was algebraic manipulation, with Meta AI demonstrating approximately 62% of incorrect solutions involving algebraic errors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Procedural vs. conceptual mathematical competence**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central finding is that high procedural accuracy (100% on limit/chain rule) does not imply conceptual reliability (49% on interval analysis). Evaluators must separate these dimensions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model might correctly compute f'(x) but fail to determine where f(x) is increasing?

- **Concept: Cross-evaluation matrices for capability assessment**
  - Why needed here: The study uses a 5×5×N matrix where each model solves problems generated by all models, revealing that problem source difficulty is independent of solver capability.
  - Quick check question: If Model A generates problems that are hardest for all models to solve, what does this imply about Model A's capabilities?

- **Concept: Error taxonomy (procedural, algebraic, conceptual)**
  - Why needed here: The paper classifies errors hierarchically—procedural (<20% for most models), algebraic (majority), conceptual (most educationally concerning). This guides targeted improvement.
  - Quick check question: Which error type would be most concerning for a student using an LLM as a calculus tutor, and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Problem generation -> Cross-evaluation engine -> Error classifier -> Success rate aggregator
- **Critical path:** 1) Define 13 problem types with constraint specifications 2) Generate problems per model with iterative refinement if constraints violated 3) Run cross-evaluation (each model solves all generated problems) 4) Classify errors and compute success matrices
- **Design tradeoffs:** Problem count (20 vs. 5) increases statistical power but amplifies generation failures for complex types; single-attempt recording ensures standardization but may underrepresent real-world usage; binary correctness scoring is objective but may mask nuanced performance differences.
- **Failure signatures:** Models generate invalid problems violating constraints; high algebraic error rates on problems requiring simplification after differentiation; performance collapse on word problems indicating formulation failures.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Replicate cross-evaluation matrix on subset (Problems 1, 5, 8, 10) to validate reproducibility with current model versions. 2) Add symbolic verification step (CAS integration) and measure algebraic error reduction—hypothesis: >50% of algebraic errors become correctable. 3) Extend to integration problems to test whether procedural-conceptual gap patterns generalize beyond differentiation domain.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the performance hierarchies and error patterns observed in differentiation generalize to other calculus domains such as integration and differential equations?
- Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge the problem set covers only differentiation, noting that "Performance on these problems may not generalize to other calculus domains, such as integration or differential equations, which involve distinct patterns of mathematical reasoning."
- Why unresolved: This study restricted its scope to 13 types of differentiation problems; therefore, the capabilities of LLMs on the inverse operations of integration or the distinct logic of differential equations remain untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: A replication of this benchmarking methodology applied to a standardized set of integration and differential equation problems to compare success rates and error types.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the pedagogical utility of these models change when evaluating the clarity and correctness of explanations alongside the final answer?
- Basis in paper: The authors state that "the evaluation prioritized process and correctness over the quality of explanations" due to subjectivity, despite noting that "explanatory clarity is crucial for educational applications."
- Why unresolved: Since the study focused on binary correctness and procedural accuracy, it is unknown if models providing correct answers also provide pedagogically sound or conceptually accurate explanations for students.
- What evidence would resolve it: A qualitative analysis or a newly developed rubric assessing the mathematical soundness and educational value of the step-by-step explanations provided by the LLMs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the use of standardized, single-prompt inputs underrepresent the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs compared to iterative, conversational interactions?
- Basis in paper: The methodology section notes that the standardized prompting approach "may not reflect how students and educators typically interact with these models in practice, where iterative prompting and clarification are common."
- Why unresolved: The study utilized controlled single-prompt inputs for fair comparison, which prevents the assessment of whether models could achieve higher success rates if allowed to self-correct or seek clarification through dialogue.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study measuring success rates between single-shot prompting and multi-turn conversational strategies where the model is allowed to ask clarifying questions or retry after errors.

## Limitations
- Binary correctness scoring may mask nuanced performance differences and partial solutions
- Only first valid response recorded, not reflecting real-world iterative prompting usage
- Problem generation for complex types (11-13) used only 5 problems per model, reducing statistical power
- Lacks transparency regarding exact model versions, prompting templates, and temperature settings

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Chat GPT 4o demonstrates superior overall performance (94.71%) across the 13 problem types; all models show strong procedural differentiation skills but weaker conceptual application abilities; algebraic manipulation errors represent the most common failure mode across models
- **Medium Confidence:** Claude Pro's ability to generate more challenging problems indicates a distinct capability from problem-solving; the procedural-conceptual gap pattern generalizes to calculus education contexts; problem source difficulty is independent of solver capability
- **Low Confidence:** The specific error type distributions for individual models beyond Meta AI; the exact mechanisms explaining why Claude Pro generates harder problems; how these findings would translate to real-world calculus tutoring scenarios with iterative prompting

## Next Checks
1. **Reproducibility validation:** Replicate the cross-evaluation matrix on a subset of 4-5 problem types using current model versions to verify the stability of the procedural-conceptual performance gap.

2. **Error reduction assessment:** Integrate symbolic algebra verification for all solutions and measure the reduction in algebraic manipulation errors—hypothesis predicts >50% correction rate for this error class.

3. **Domain generalization test:** Extend the evaluation framework to integration problems to determine whether the procedural-conceptual performance pattern observed in differentiation applies to other calculus domains.
