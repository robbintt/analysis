# Reinforcement Learning-based Task Offloading in the Internet of Wearable Things

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07487
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07487
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents a Reinforcement Learning-based framework for task offloading in the Internet of Wearable Things (IoWT), addressing the challenge of limited computational resources and battery power in wearable devices.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Q-learning-based framework for optimizing task offloading decisions in the Internet of Wearable Things (IoWT). The framework addresses the fundamental challenge of limited computational resources and battery power in wearable devices by enabling them to learn optimal offloading policies to nearby edge devices like smartphones. The approach formulates the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a discrete state space defined by task characteristics, and uses a weighted cost function to balance energy consumption against task accomplishment time. Through extensive ns-3 simulations, the proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in both energy efficiency and task completion time compared to traditional local execution and always-offload strategies.

## Method Summary
The framework employs tabular Q-learning where the wearable device acts as an RL agent making binary offloading decisions (local execution vs. smartphone offloading). Tasks are characterized by input data size (Di) and computational intensity (Ci), forming the state space. The agent uses an ε-greedy policy with decaying exploration rate (ε = 1000/(2000 + 50*k)) to balance exploration and exploitation. The cost function combines normalized energy and time costs using tunable weights βE and βT, where βE + βT = 1. The system is evaluated through ns-3 simulations across four application types (IoT Sensors, 4-queens, 5-queens, Face Recognition) with 300 tasks per simulation, comparing against Local-only and Offload-only baselines.

## Key Results
- Q-learning approach achieves up to 85% energy savings compared to always-offloading strategy
- Task accomplishment time reduced by up to 38% compared to local-only execution for computationally intensive applications
- Optimal βE/βT parameter settings show heavy applications benefit more from offloading while light tasks perform better locally
- The proposed framework effectively learns near-optimal policies without prior knowledge of network conditions or task distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Q-learning enables wearable devices to learn near-optimal offloading policies without prior knowledge of network conditions or task distributions.
- **Mechanism:** The wearable acts as an RL agent that iteratively explores actions (local execution vs. offloading) across discrete states defined by task characteristics. After each action, it receives a cost signal based on observed energy consumption and task accomplishment time. Q-values are updated via Bellman's equation (Eq. 17), gradually improving the policy through exploration-exploitation balance using a decaying ε-greedy strategy (ε = 1000/(2000 + 50*k)).
- **Core assumption:** The state space remains sufficiently discrete and bounded that Q-learning can explore all relevant state-action pairs within practical training time; the environment dynamics are approximately stationary during learning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task offloading decisions without prior knowledge"
  - [section IV] MDP formulation with state space S = {(Di, Ci)} and action space A = {0, 1}
  - [corpus] Related work [25-30] consistently shows Q-learning effective for MDP-formulated offloading; corpus evidence supports RL-based approaches generally but lacks comparative data for this specific IoWT-wearable configuration
- **Break condition:** Highly dynamic environments with rapidly changing channel conditions or non-stationary task distributions may prevent Q-table convergence; extremely large or continuous state spaces would exceed Q-learning's tabular capacity.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** A weighted-sum cost function with tunable coefficients (βE, βT) allows systematic tradeoff control between energy conservation and latency reduction.
- **Mechanism:** The immediate cost ψ(s, ai,s) combines normalized energy and time costs using weights βE and βT (where βE + βT = 1). Normalization uses fixed maxima (Emax, Tmax) derived from local execution of the heaviest expected task class. By adjusting βE upward, the agent prioritizes energy savings (more local execution); increasing βT prioritizes speed (more offloading).
- **Core assumption:** The fixed normalization constants adequately bound the cost space across all task types; the weighted-sum approach captures user preferences sufficiently.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section IV.A.4] Equations 11-12 define the cost function with βE and βT coefficients
  - [section VI.C.2] Figures 6-9 demonstrate parameter effects: for Face Recognition, βE=0→1 increases task time by 31.55% but reduces energy by 68.26%
  - [corpus] Related papers [27, 28, 30] also employ weighted objective functions; no corpus evidence contradicts this approach, but alternative multi-objective methods (Pareto optimization) are not compared
- **Break condition:** If application requirements are not adequately captured by a single weighted scalar (e.g., strict latency deadlines with energy budgets), the cost function may produce suboptimal or infeasible policies.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Including idle energy consumption during offloaded task execution significantly affects total energy accounting, particularly for computationally intensive tasks.
- **Mechanism:** When a task is offloaded, the wearable consumes idle power (Pi,idleW) while waiting for the smartphone to complete execution (Eq. 10). This contribution is added to transmission energy and smartphone-side energy. For heavy applications like Face Recognition, idle energy constitutes 11.35% of total wearable energy consumption during offloading.
- **Core assumption:** Idle power remains approximately constant during remote execution; the wearable cannot enter deeper sleep states while awaiting results.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section III.C] Equation 6 includes Ei,idleW oS term; Equation 10 defines idle energy calculation
  - [section VI.C.1] Figure 5 shows energy breakdown; text notes 11.35% idle contribution for Face Recognition
  - [corpus] Corpus does not explicitly address idle energy in offloading models; this appears to be a novel contribution relative to compared literature
- **Break condition:** If the wearable can aggressively power-gate or sleep during offloaded execution, the idle energy model overestimates actual consumption; conversely, if background processes keep the device active, it may underestimate.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
  - **Why needed here:** The entire offloading problem is formulated as an MDP where states represent task attributes, actions represent execution location choices, and costs represent performance penalties. Understanding state transitions, policies, and the Bellman equation is essential to grasp how Q-learning derives optimal decisions.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why task offloading can be modeled as a sequential decision process where the next state depends only on the current state and action, not the full history?

- **Concept:** Q-learning and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff
  - **Why needed here:** The algorithm relies on Q-learning's model-free property to learn without knowing transition probabilities. The ε-greedy strategy balances exploring new actions versus exploiting learned knowledge. Without understanding Q-value updates and convergence conditions, the algorithm's behavior is opaque.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the ε-greedy strategy decay over time (ε = 1000/(2000 + 50*k)), and what would happen if ε remained constant?

- **Concept:** Energy models for computation and communication in mobile devices
  - **Why needed here:** The cost function depends on accurate energy modeling: local execution energy (αc·F²·(D×C)), transmission energy (Ptx·D/R), and idle energy (Pidle·Texec). Understanding how CPU frequency, effective switched capacitance, and wireless transmission power contribute to total consumption is critical for interpreting results.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does local computation energy scale quadratically with CPU frequency (F² in Eq. 2), and how does this justify offloading to a more powerful device?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Wearable device (Agent) -> Q-table -> Cost function module -> Action selection (ε-greedy)
  - Wearable device -> Wi-Fi link (ns-3 simulated) -> Smartphone (Edge node)
  - Smartphone -> Task execution -> Results transmission

- **Critical path:**
  1. Task generation → state extraction (Di, Ci)
  2. Action selection via ε-greedy (exploit best Q-value or explore randomly)
  3. Task execution (local or remote) → measure actual energy/time
  4. Cost calculation → Q-value update via Eq. 17
  5. State transition to next task → repeat until convergence

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Tabular Q-learning vs. Deep RL:** Paper deliberately chooses lightweight tabular Q-learning for wearable feasibility, sacrificing scalability to continuous/large state spaces
  - **Single-edge vs. multi-tier architecture:** Current design offloads only to paired smartphone; future extension to fog/cloudlets would increase complexity but improve scalability
  - **Atomic task model vs. partitionable tasks:** Tasks are assumed indivisible; partitioning could enable finer-grained optimization but adds scheduling complexity
  - **Fixed vs. adaptive βE/βT:** Coefficients are manually set; adaptive adjustment based on battery level or deadline urgency is not explored

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Non-convergence:** Q-values oscillate without stabilizing → check if all state-action pairs are being explored sufficiently; ε decay may be too fast
  - **Suboptimal offloading for light tasks:** Lightweight applications (e.g., IoT Sensors) show worse performance when offloaded → expected behavior; cost function correctly penalizes communication overhead
  - **Energy overestimation:** Measured energy significantly differs from model → verify idle power assumption; check if device enters sleep states during offloading
  - **Stale Q-values in dynamic environments:** Performance degrades after channel condition changes → Q-learning assumes stationarity; may need periodic re-exploration or sliding-window updates

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Replicate the Local vs. Offloading vs. Q-learning comparison (Figure 3-4) for one application (e.g., Face Recognition) to validate ns-3 simulation setup and cost function implementation. Confirm Q-learning achieves intermediate performance (~4.6% time reduction vs. Local, ~83.5% energy savings vs. Offloading).
  2. **Parameter sensitivity sweep:** Vary βE from 0 to 1 in 0.2 increments for two application types (light: IoT Sensors, heavy: Face Recognition) to reproduce Figures 6-8 trends. Verify that increasing βE reduces energy but increases task time, with heavier applications showing larger sensitivity.
  3. **Exploration strategy ablation:** Test alternative ε decay schedules (e.g., ε = 1/k, fixed ε = 0.1) and measure convergence speed (iterations to stable Q-values) and final policy quality. Compare against the proposed ε = 1000/(2000 + 50*k) to assess exploration-efficiency tradeoffs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the proposed framework perform when extended to a multi-layer architecture involving fog nodes, cloudlets, and dedicated edge servers?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states the intent to "introduce an additional offloading layer... [to] lay the foundation for a multi-layer, multi-agent RL-based task offloading system."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study is limited to a single offloading target (the smartphone), and the scalability of the single-agent Q-learning algorithm to multiple tiers is untested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Simulation or emulation results demonstrating convergence time and cost function values in a network topology with three or more hierarchical computation layers.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What efficiency gains are achievable by implementing task partitioning compared to the current atomic task model?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note, "Future work will explore more complex task models that support task partitioning, enabling finer-grained offloading decisions."
- **Why unresolved:** The mathematical model and simulation assume tasks are atomic and indivisible, which restricts the agent to binary offloading decisions rather than partial execution strategies.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative performance analysis between the atomic model and a partitioned task model measuring energy consumption and latency for divisible workloads.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How do empirical energy consumption and latency compare to ns-3 simulation results when the algorithm is deployed on physical wearable hardware?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state they "intend to prototype and test the solution using real wearable devices, empirical energy consumption measurements... to assess its practical feasibility."
- **Why unresolved:** All presented results are derived from the ns-3 simulator, which abstracts hardware limitations and physical layer intricacies that might affect the online learning process.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Data from a hardware testbed validating the Q-learning convergence rate and actual battery drain under realistic usage scenarios.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Does the exclusion of the smartphone's real-time battery status and CPU load from the MDP state space result in sub-optimal offloading decisions?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The state space definition in Section IV-A relies solely on task attributes ($D_i, C_i$), assuming the smartphone is a static resource rather than a constrained device.
- **Why unresolved:** The wearable agent cannot assess if the smartphone is low on battery or overloaded, potentially offloading tasks when local execution would be objectively better for the system.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study where the MDP state space is expanded to include edge device status, compared against the proposed model under variable smartphone load conditions.

## Limitations

- The evaluation relies on ns-3 simulations with specific hardware parameters that may not generalize to all wearable devices.
- The fixed normalization constants (Emax, Tmax) are derived from local execution of the heaviest task but their applicability across different device configurations is not validated.
- The Q-learning approach assumes stationary environments and discrete state spaces, which may not hold in highly dynamic real-world IoWT scenarios.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core Q-learning mechanism and MDP formulation are well-established and correctly implemented. The mathematical model for energy and time costs is internally consistent and follows standard mobile computing principles.
- **Medium Confidence:** The simulation parameters and hardware characteristics are reasonable but not empirically validated on actual devices. The cost function design and parameter tuning effects are demonstrated through simulation but may not capture all real-world constraints.
- **Medium Confidence:** The comparison with baseline strategies (Local-only, Offload-only) shows clear performance improvements, but the absolute performance numbers depend on the specific simulation setup and may vary with different network conditions or device capabilities.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Validation:** Implement the Q-learning offloading framework on actual wearable-smartphone pairs to validate simulation results and measure real-world energy savings and latency improvements across the four application types.

2. **Robustness Testing:** Evaluate the framework's performance under varying network conditions (channel quality, interference) and task arrival patterns to assess its adaptability to non-stationary environments and its ability to maintain convergence.

3. **Scalability Assessment:** Extend the architecture to support multi-edge offloading scenarios with multiple smartphones/fog nodes to evaluate the framework's effectiveness in more complex IoWT environments and its ability to handle larger state spaces through function approximation or hierarchical Q-learning.
