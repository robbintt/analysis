# TVWorld: Foundations for Remote-Control TV Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.13142
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13142
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces TVWorld benchmark and Topology-Aware Training framework, achieving 68.3% success rate on TVWorld-N and 81.8% accuracy on TVWorld-G

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in GUI agent research by focusing on remote-control (RC) TV navigation, which differs fundamentally from point-and-click interaction. The authors introduce TVWorld, an offline graph-based abstraction of real-world TV navigation that enables reproducible evaluation without requiring physical hardware. Based on this abstraction, they develop TVTheseus, a foundation model for TV navigation that achieves state-of-the-art performance through a two-stage Topology-Aware Training framework combining supervised fine-tuning with topology-primed rationales and reinforcement learning using hitting-time rewards.

## Method Summary
The approach constructs a TV Navigation Graph through BFS crawling of physical TVs, where nodes represent UI states (screenshots + focus) and edges represent deterministic key-press transitions. Training occurs in two stages: Stage I uses supervised fine-tuning with three trace types (Geodesic Guidance, Detour Reflection, Stagnation Escape) and Gemini 3 Pro-generated rationales; Stage II employs reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization using topology-aware rewards based on hitting time. The model takes as input current and historical screenshots plus action history to predict the next key press.

## Key Results
- TVTheseus achieves 68.3% success rate on TVWorld-N, surpassing Gemini 3 Flash and establishing state-of-the-art performance
- TVTheseus attains 81.8% accuracy on TVWorld-G despite receiving no grounding-specific supervision
- Ablation studies show topology-aware rewards (hitting time) are critical, with Shortest Path rewards performing significantly worse
- The two-stage training approach demonstrates consistent improvements over single-stage methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Graph-Based Abstraction for Deterministic Policy Evaluation
The authors model TV navigation as a finite directed multigraph where nodes are UI states and edges are key-press transitions. This enables precise graph-distance metrics like Hitting Time to quantify progress toward goals, supporting topology-augmented RL with dense reward signals impossible in stochastic environments.

### Mechanism 2: Topology-Priming via Synthetic Rationales (SFT)
Supervised Fine-Tuning uses three trace types—Geodesic Guidance (shortest paths), Detour Reflection (error recovery), and Stagnation Escape (loop breaking)—with teacher model rationales to inject inductive bias for focus awareness and error recovery before policy optimization.

### Mechanism 3: Reinforcement Learning with Hitting-Time Rewards
Group Relative Policy Optimization optimizes policies using rewards based on hitting time, which accounts for navigation uncertainty and dead ends. This provides denser signals than sparse success/failure rewards and penalizes actions that increase distance to the goal.

## Foundational Learning

- **Focus-Based Navigation vs. Point-and-Click**: RC TV agents use discrete moves (Up/Down) to shift focus highlights rather than absolute coordinates. This shifts from spatial to topological search as the central problem.
  - *Quick check*: If a TV screen has 5 items in a vertical list and focus is on item 2, what is the topological distance to item 5 in terms of RC actions?

- **Graph Distance Metrics (Hitting Time vs. Shortest Path)**: Hitting Time considers probability of getting stuck in loops or dead ends, providing denser signals for navigation difficulty than simple step counting.
  - *Quick check*: Why would a "Shortest Path" reward fail to penalize an agent that walks into a dead-end submenu before finding the correct path?

- **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)**: The agent sees only screenshots (observations) not the full graph map, requiring maintenance of internal belief state for navigation.
  - *Quick check*: Why does the architecture require "historical screenshots" and "action history" as input, rather than just the current frame?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Environment (TVWorld Graph) -> Agent (TVTheseus) -> Training Pipeline (SFT Traces + Gemini Rationales -> GRPO + Topology-Aware Rewards)

- **Critical path**: Graph Construction (BFS crawl) → Trace Synthesis (paths + rationales) → SFT (fine-tuning on traces) → RL (GRPO optimization)

- **Design tradeoffs**: Offline Graph vs. Live Environment (fidelity vs. speed/reproducibility); Hitting Time vs. Shortest Path (simplicity vs. accounting for uncertainty)

- **Failure signatures**: Stagnation (repeated invalid actions); Detour (increasing graph distance to goal)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline validation with base model on TVWorld-N; 2) SFT ablation (Geodesic-only vs. all three trace types); 3) Reward metric comparison (Shortest-Path vs. Hitting Time)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Scaling study necessity**: Does the Topology-Aware Training framework maintain efficacy at larger model scales (70B+), or does it primarily correct deficiencies specific to smaller models? The paper acknowledges focusing on "practical model scale" without exhaustive scaling study.

2. **Sim-to-real performance gap**: How does performance degrade when transferred from static TVWorld graph to live TV environments with dynamic latency and asynchronous UI events? The offline evaluation doesn't account for real-world deployment challenges.

3. **Reasoning trace effectiveness**: Why does explicit multi-step reasoning degrade grounding performance, and does this imply RC navigation relies more on intuitive pattern matching than deliberative logic? The paper observes this phenomenon but doesn't analyze failure modes.

## Limitations
- TV interface fidelity assumptions may not hold for dynamic content or time-sensitive interfaces not captured during BFS crawl
- Heavy dependency on Gemini 3 Pro Preview for rationale synthesis without ablation studies on rationale quality
- Limited generalizability to TV brands beyond TCL and Google TV systems with different navigation paradigms

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Topological reward mechanism using Hitting Time is well-justified with ablation support
- **Medium confidence**: Two-stage training approach shows consistent improvements but relative contributions aren't fully isolated
- **Low confidence**: Real-world deployment readiness claims are limited by offline evaluation setup

## Next Checks
1. **Dynamic content robustness test**: Evaluate TVTheseus on TV interfaces with time-varying content to assess performance when offline graph becomes stale
2. **Cross-manufacturer generalization**: Test agent on TV interfaces from Samsung, LG, Sony to quantify topology awareness transfer across different UI paradigms
3. **Rationale quality ablation**: Replace Gemini 3 Pro rationales with synthetic or rule-based rationales to measure impact on final performance
