# Structured Temporal Causality for Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16511
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16511
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: OracleAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets for unsupervised MTS anomaly detection with interpretable root-cause localization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time series, where anomalies are rare, unlabeled, and often affect only a subset of variables. The proposed OracleAD framework models temporal causality at the variable level using per-variable LSTM encoders that produce causal embeddings. These embeddings are refined through self-attention to capture dynamic inter-variable relationships, and anomalies are detected by comparing current latent structures to a learned Stable Latent Structure (SLS). OracleAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, significantly improving detection accuracy, anomaly localization, and interpretability.

## Method Summary
OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a causal embedding using per-variable LSTM encoders, then applies multi-head self-attention to capture inter-variable dependencies. The framework jointly predicts the next timestep and reconstructs the input window, while learning a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) from pairwise dissimilarity matrices during training. Anomalies are detected using a dual scoring mechanism combining prediction error and deviation from the SLS. The model is trained with a composite loss function and achieves interpretable results by identifying root-cause variables through the deviation matrix.

## Key Results
- OracleAD achieves superior F1 scores and VUS metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods across SMD, PSM, and SWaT datasets
- The dual scoring mechanism significantly outperforms single-metric variants, with ablation showing 10-15% F1 improvement
- OracleAD successfully localizes root-cause variables, with deviation matrices highlighting affected variables in anomaly windows
- The framework demonstrates robustness across datasets with different characteristics, maintaining high performance despite varying variable counts and temporal patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Per-Variable Temporal Causality Encoding
Independent variable-specific encoders capture heterogeneous temporal dynamics more effectively than shared architectures when anomalies affect only variable subsets. Each variable processes its past observations through a dedicated LSTM encoder, producing causal embeddings that are attention-pooled. This approach prevents entanglement of unrelated temporal patterns and improves both detection sensitivity and interpretability.

### Mechanism 2: Stable Latent Structure (SLS) as Normal-State Reference
Aggregating pairwise dissimilarity matrices across training epochs yields a stable reference that captures consistent inter-variable relationships under normal conditions. The SLS serves as a statistically derived reference structure that enables detection of anomalies that disrupt normal relational patterns without necessarily affecting individual predictions.

### Mechanism 3: Multiplicative Dual Scoring for Complementary Detection
Combining prediction score (temporal precision) and deviation score (structural sensitivity) through multiplication balances sharp detection at disruption onset with sustained coverage across anomaly segments. This joint scoring mechanism suppresses false positives and recovers false negatives by requiring both temporal and structural violations for high anomaly scores.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: LSTM sequence encoding
  - Why needed here: Each per-variable encoder must compress temporal history into a latent state
  - Quick check: Can you explain how an LSTM's forget gate determines which past information to retain vs. discard?

- **Concept**: Multi-head self-attention
  - Why needed here: MHSA mixes per-variable embeddings to capture dynamic inter-variable dependencies
  - Quick check: Given query, key, and value projections, how does scaled dot-product attention compute output for a single head?

- **Concept**: Reconstruction vs. prediction objectives in anomaly detection
  - Why needed here: OracleAD jointly trains both to balance context memory and causal enforcement
  - Quick check: Why might a model that only reconstructs fail to detect anomalies that violate causal temporal structure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw input → Per-variable LSTM Encoders → Attention Pooling → Multi-Head Self-Attention → LSTM Decoders (reconstruct + predict) AND Dissimilarity Matrix Computation → SLS Aggregation → Dual Scoring

- **Critical path**: Understand how causal embeddings flow: raw input → encoder → attention pooling → MHSA → decoder outputs AND dissimilarity matrix → SLS comparison. The embedding quality gates both prediction accuracy and structural sensitivity.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Window length L: Longer windows capture more context but may dilute localized anomalies (L=10–20 optimal). λ_dev weight: Higher values strengthen structural regularization but may over-penalize benign variations. Number of layers: 2 layers balance capacity vs. overfitting.

- **Failure signatures**: High variance in dissimilarity matrices across epochs → SLS unstable, deviation scores noisy. Prediction-only anomalies missed → D_score may be low if structure preserved. Structural-only anomalies missed → P_score may be low if individual predictions accurate. False positives in recovery periods → deviation score exhibits lag due to windowed nature.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce ablation study on a single dataset: full model vs. w/o reconstruction loss vs. prediction-only vs. deviation-only scoring. 2) Hyperparameter sweep on λ_dev (0.5, 1, 3, 5) and window length (5, 10, 20) using validation split. 3) Visualize deviation matrices at known anomaly timestamps to verify alignment with ground-truth root-cause variables.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the OracleAD framework be extended to seamlessly handle heterogeneous variable types, such as categorical and discrete signals, alongside continuous data? The current architecture utilizes per-variable LSTM encoders designed for continuous temporal dynamics, which may not suitably represent discrete or categorical state changes. Successful anomaly detection performance on industrial benchmarks containing mixed sensor types without requiring separate preprocessing pipelines.

### Open Question 2
Can the Stable Latent Structure (SLS) be adapted to update dynamically during inference to accommodate non-stationary environments? The current SLS is aggregated during training and treated as a static reference, which may fail if the definition of "normal" relationships drifts over time. Experiments demonstrating maintained detection accuracy on datasets with significant concept drift or gradual system evolution without the need for model retraining.

### Open Question 3
How can the assumption of globally consistent inter-variable relationships be relaxed to improve performance in complex, multimodal systems? The model currently learns a single global SLS, which may be insufficient for systems that operate in distinct modes with fundamentally different relational structures. Improved anomaly localization scores on multimodal datasets compared to the current static, global SLS approach.

## Limitations

- Several architectural hyperparameters (hidden dimension, number of attention heads) are not explicitly specified, requiring reasonable assumptions for reproduction
- The exact training duration and early stopping criteria are unspecified, potentially affecting reproducibility
- The model's performance may degrade when normal behavior is multimodal or time-varying, as the static SLS may blur mode-specific structure

## Confidence

- **High**: Per-variable causality encoding mechanism and its benefits for interpretability and heterogeneous dynamics modeling
- **High**: Stable Latent Structure concept and its role as a normal-state reference
- **High**: Multiplicative dual scoring approach and its effectiveness over single-metric variants
- **Medium**: Optimal hyperparameter settings across diverse datasets
- **Medium**: Generalization to datasets with significantly different temporal patterns or noise characteristics

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a systematic ablation study comparing OracleAD against state-of-the-art methods (GCAD, Causality-Aware Contrastive Learning) on a unified benchmark with standardized evaluation protocols

2. Perform robustness analysis by injecting synthetic anomalies with varying characteristics (structural only, prediction only, both) to verify dual scoring complementarity

3. Evaluate SLS stability across datasets with different operational modes or multimodal normal behavior to identify conditions where static aggregation may fail
