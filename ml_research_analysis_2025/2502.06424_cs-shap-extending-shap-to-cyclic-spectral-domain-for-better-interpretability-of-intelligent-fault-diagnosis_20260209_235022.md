# CS-SHAP: Extending SHAP to Cyclic-Spectral Domain for Better Interpretability of Intelligent Fault Diagnosis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.06424
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06424
- Reference count: 40
- Proposes CS-SHAP method achieving 99.98% accuracy on simulation dataset and 100% on CWRU and private gearbox datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CS-SHAP, an extension of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the cyclic-spectral domain for improved interpretability in intelligent fault diagnosis. The method addresses limitations of existing approaches that focus on single frequency perspectives by simultaneously analyzing carrier and modulation frequencies through cyclic-spectral transforms. By preprocessing vibration signals in this domain, CS-SHAP provides clearer attribution analysis that better aligns with physical fault mechanisms. The approach is validated across three datasets including simulation, CWRU bearing, and a private helical gearbox dataset, demonstrating superior performance in distinguishing close fault components and maintaining robustness under high noise conditions.

## Method Summary
CS-SHAP extends the SHAP framework by incorporating cyclic-spectral transforms to preprocess vibration signals before applying attribution analysis. The method derives cyclic-temporal moment functions that capture both carrier and modulation frequency components, enabling simultaneous analysis of multiple frequency perspectives. This transformation allows the attribution methodology to identify feature contributions that are more aligned with physical fault mechanisms compared to traditional frequency-domain approaches. The cyclic-spectral preprocessing is integrated into the SHAP framework through modified kernel functions that account for the cyclic properties of the transformed signal, resulting in attribution maps that better reflect the underlying fault characteristics.

## Key Results
- Achieved 99.98% test accuracy on simulation dataset with close fault components
- Perfect 100% accuracy on CWRU bearing dataset and private helical gearbox dataset
- Demonstrated superior performance in distinguishing closely spaced fault frequencies and maintaining robustness under high noise conditions compared to conventional SHAP approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CS-SHAP works by transforming vibration signals into the cyclic-spectral domain before applying SHAP attribution analysis. This transformation captures both carrier frequencies (associated with rotational speed) and modulation frequencies (associated with fault-induced amplitude and frequency modulations) simultaneously. Traditional fault diagnosis methods often focus on single frequency perspectives, which can miss critical information about fault mechanisms that involve interactions between multiple frequency components. By operating in the cyclic-spectral domain, CS-SHAP can identify feature contributions that reflect these interactions, providing explanations that are more consistent with the physical mechanisms of bearing and gear faults. The cyclic-temporal moment functions used in the transform are specifically designed to highlight these fault-related modulations while suppressing irrelevant noise components.

## Foundational Learning

**Cyclic-Spectral Analysis**: A signal processing technique that reveals periodicities in the frequency domain by computing correlations between frequency-shifted versions of a signal. Why needed: Captures both carrier and modulation frequencies simultaneously, essential for identifying fault-related frequency interactions. Quick check: Verify that cyclic power spectral density shows peaks at expected modulation frequencies for known fault conditions.

**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: A game-theoretic approach for interpreting model predictions by calculating feature contributions based on Shapley values. Why needed: Provides mathematically sound attribution that fairly distributes prediction credit among features. Quick check: Confirm that SHAP values sum to the difference between model prediction and baseline for each instance.

**Cyclic-Temporal Moment Functions**: Statistical functions that measure higher-order correlations in cyclostationary signals. Why needed: Capture non-linear relationships between frequency components that indicate fault presence. Quick check: Validate that cyclic moments show enhanced values at fault-specific cyclic frequencies.

**Vibration Signal Preprocessing**: Signal conditioning techniques including filtering and normalization applied before cyclic-spectral transformation. Why needed: Ensures consistent signal quality and removes irrelevant frequency components. Quick check: Verify that preprocessing maintains signal-to-noise ratio while eliminating high-frequency noise.

**Fault Mechanism Alignment**: The degree to which model explanations correspond to known physical fault processes. Why needed: Ensures interpretability has practical diagnostic value beyond statistical correlation. Quick check: Compare attribution maps with known fault frequency signatures from vibration theory.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Vibration Signals -> Cyclic-Spectral Transform -> SHAP Attribution Engine -> Interpretable Feature Maps -> Diagnostic Decision Support

**Critical Path**: The most time-sensitive sequence is the cyclic-spectral transform followed by SHAP computation. The transform requires sufficient data length to achieve frequency resolution, while SHAP attribution depends on model prediction speed and sampling strategy for Shapley value estimation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method balances computational complexity against interpretability quality. Longer signal segments improve cyclic-spectral resolution but increase computation time. The choice of cyclic order (first-order vs higher-order moments) affects both sensitivity to fault signatures and computational requirements.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor cyclic-spectral resolution can lead to merged fault frequency components, reducing attribution clarity. Insufficient signal length may result in unreliable cyclic statistics. Model architecture choices that don't preserve cyclic features can degrade attribution quality despite proper preprocessing.

**First Experiments**: 1) Apply cyclic-spectral transform to synthetic signals with known fault frequencies to verify correct frequency component separation. 2) Compare SHAP attributions from cyclic-spectral features against ground truth fault locations in controlled test cases. 3) Evaluate attribution robustness by adding increasing levels of noise to benchmark signals and measuring attribution stability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Generalizability beyond the three tested datasets remains unproven for diverse fault types and machine configurations
- Lack of comparative analysis against alternative cyclic-spectral interpretability methods makes it difficult to assess unique advantages
- Computational complexity of cyclic-spectral transforms and impact on real-time diagnostic applications not addressed

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The mathematical framework for extending SHAP to cyclic-spectral domain appears sound and well-defined. The attribution methodology using cyclic-temporal moment functions is clearly articulated and theoretically justified.

**Medium Confidence**: The reported test accuracies (99.98% for simulation, 100% for CWRU and private datasets) are impressive but may not fully represent real-world diagnostic performance. These results could be influenced by dataset characteristics, preprocessing choices, or model architectures that may not generalize.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about CS-SHAP providing "clearer and more accurate explanations aligned with fault mechanisms" are difficult to verify without independent validation of the interpretability claims. The connection between cyclic-spectral features and physical fault mechanisms, while plausible, requires more rigorous demonstration.

## Next Checks

1. Test CS-SHAP on at least three additional diverse datasets covering different fault types, machine configurations, and operating conditions to assess generalizability

2. Compare CS-SHAP explanations with ground truth fault mechanisms from controlled experiments to validate the interpretability claims

3. Benchmark CS-SHAP computational efficiency and runtime performance against existing SHAP-based interpretability methods for real-time diagnostic applications
