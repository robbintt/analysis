# Interpretable Reinforcement Learning for Load Balancing using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.14459
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14459
- **Reference count**: 22
- **Primary result**: Proposes using 1-layer KAN actors in PPO for interpretable load balancing policies, achieving performance parity with standard PPO while enabling symbolic policy extraction

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the interpretability challenge in deep reinforcement learning for network load balancing by proposing a PPO-based RL framework with a 1-layer Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as the actor model. KANs decompose the policy function into sums of univariate learnable functions, enabling symbolic extraction of interpretable controller equations. The method trains a KAN actor alongside an MLP critic, achieving performance comparable to standard PPO while providing moderate interpretability through extracted symbolic policies.

## Method Summary
The approach uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a hybrid architecture: a 1-layer KAN actor (10 state features → 1 action) and an MLP critic (2 layers, 64 units each). The KAN actor learns load balancing policies through B-spline-based activation functions on edges, which are later extracted via symbolic regression to produce interpretable equations. Training occurs in an NS-3 packet-level simulator connected via ns3gym, with rewards based on throughput utility and loss minimization. After training, the learned activation functions are approximated by symbolic expressions (x, x², exp, log, tanh) to create human-readable controller equations.

## Key Results
- PPO-KAN method matches standard PPO performance while offering moderate interpretability
- Extracted symbolic policies achieve similar performance to parent models while being highly interpretable
- Around 20% more cases achieve similar or better throughput utility compared to baseline
- Up to 8% fewer cases experience packet loss
- Clear insight into how features like load, delay, and loss influence balancing decisions through extracted equations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Univariate Function Decomposition for Policy Transparency
The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem enables decomposition of multi-dimensional policy functions into sums of learnable univariate functions. KAN implements this by replacing weight matrices with learnable spline-based activation functions, allowing direct tracing of each input feature's contribution to output decisions. This decomposition is particularly valuable for load balancing as it clarifies how demand, delay, and loss individually influence traffic distribution.

### Mechanism 2: Spline-Based Activation Learning Enables Symbolic Extraction
Each KAN edge learns a spline function parameterized as a linear combination of B-splines. After training, these learned curves can be approximated by simple symbolic functions (x², exp, tanh) via regression. This two-stage process bridges neural network flexibility with mathematical interpretability, enabling closed-form controller equations.

### Mechanism 3: Hybrid Actor-Critic with KAN Actor and MLP Critic
Using KAN only for the actor while retaining MLP for the critic preserves interpretability where it matters most. Since only the actor's policy needs to be interpretable for network operators, the critic can remain a black-box MLP. This asymmetric design reduces KAN's training complexity while still enabling symbolic policy extraction from the actor alone.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
  - Why needed: PPO is the underlying RL algorithm; understanding its clipping objective and advantage estimation is required to modify the actor architecture without breaking training
  - Quick check: Can you explain why PPO uses a clipped surrogate objective rather than direct policy gradient updates?

- **Concept: B-Splines and Spline Interpolation**
  - Why needed: KAN's learnable activations are parameterized as B-spline combinations; understanding basis functions and spline smoothness is essential for debugging activation shapes
  - Quick check: What happens to spline approximation quality if the number of spline knots is too low for a rapidly-varying function?

- **Concept: Symbolic Regression**
  - Why needed: The extraction of interpretable equations from trained KAN relies on fitting symbolic expressions to learned splines
  - Quick check: Why might restricting the symbolic function library to monotonic functions improve interpretability even if it reduces fitting accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: NS-3 simulator → State observation (10 features) → KAN actor (10→1) → Action execution → Reward computation → PPO update → MLP critic → Repeat
- **Critical path**: Environment step → State observation collected from NS-3 → Actor forward pass → KAN computes univariate activations and sums them to produce action → Action execution → Controller steers flow placement based on ratio → Reward computation → PPO update → Post-training extraction → Symbolic regression fits equations to learned KAN activations
- **Design tradeoffs**: 1-layer vs. deeper KAN (interpretability vs. performance), clamp vs. tanh activation (linearity vs. smoothness), throughput utility vs. loss reward (complexity vs. simplicity)
- **Failure signatures**: Action collapse to ±1 (vanishing gradients), symbolic extraction error >10% (approximation failure), reward volatility (environment stochasticity dominance)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline replication: Train standard PPO-MLP actor with identical hyperparameters and compare performance; 2) Symbolic extraction fidelity: Extract symbolic policy and evaluate directly in NS-3 scenarios; 3) Ablation on KAN layer depth: Train 2-layer KAN actor and compare interpretability and performance vs. 1-layer

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- Interpretability vs. Performance Trade-off: Extracted symbolic policies do not fully match parent KAN performance due to potential approximation errors during symbolic extraction
- Single-Layer Architecture Constraint: 1-layer KAN design may limit ability to capture complex feature interactions that could improve performance
- Simulation-Only Validation: Results based on NS-3 simulations with synthetic traffic; real-world deployment may reveal gaps not captured in simulation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core mechanism of KAN enabling interpretable policy extraction via univariate decomposition and spline-based activations is well-supported
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance parity claim holds in throughput utility reward setting but not in loss-based reward setting, suggesting conditional validity
- **Low Confidence**: Scalability of symbolic extraction to deeper KAN architectures or more complex network topologies remains untested

## Next Checks

1. Real-World Deployment Test: Deploy extracted symbolic policy in small-scale operational network to validate simulation-to-reality transfer
2. Symbolic Extraction Error Analysis: Quantify approximation error between learned KAN splines and symbolic fits across all activation functions
3. Multi-Layer KAN Performance-Interpretability Trade-off: Train 2-layer KAN actors and measure degradation in symbolic extraction fidelity and any performance gains
