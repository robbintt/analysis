- This paper proposes a two-stage framework leveraging structural function recognition for abstractive summarization of scientific papers, achieving superior performance over advanced baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of abstractive summarization of scientific papers by proposing a two-stage framework that leverages automatic recognition of structural functions within papers. The method involves standardizing chapter titles according to the IMRaD format to construct a large-scale dataset, training a classifier to identify key structural components (e.g., Background, Methods, Results, Discussion), and using Longformer to generate context-aware summaries. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms advanced baselines, generating more comprehensive summaries. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/tongbao96/code-for-SFR-AS.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework consists of two main stages: First, it standardizes chapter titles according to the IMRaD format to construct a large-scale dataset, then trains a classifier to automatically identify the structural functions of chapters (e.g., Background, Methods, Results, Discussion). Second, it uses Longformer to generate context-aware summaries by leveraging the identified structural information. The approach focuses on recognizing the functional roles of different sections within scientific papers to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of generated summaries.

## Key Results
- The proposed two-stage framework outperforms advanced baselines in abstractive summarization of scientific papers
- Achieves superior performance on two datasets (OPEC/RLCS with 161 and 204 papers respectively)
- Generates more comprehensive summaries by leveraging structural function recognition
- Code and dataset publicly available at https://github.com/tongbao96/code-for-SFR-AS

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by first recognizing the structural functions of chapters in scientific papers (e.g., Background, Methods, Results, Discussion) through a trained classifier, then using this structural information to guide the Longformer-based summarization process. By standardizing chapter titles according to the IMRaD format and identifying key structural components, the system can generate more context-aware and comprehensive summaries that capture the essential information from each functional section of the paper.

## Foundational Learning
- **IMRaD Structure**: The standardized format (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) used in scientific papers - needed to organize and identify key sections for summarization; quick check: verify paper follows this structure
- **Structural Function Recognition**: Automatic identification of what role each section plays in the paper - needed to understand context for summary generation; quick check: classifier achieves 82.5% accuracy on test set
- **Longformer Architecture**: A transformer model designed for long documents - needed to handle the length of scientific papers; quick check: can process full paper context effectively
- **Two-Stage Framework**: Separate processes for structure recognition and summary generation - needed to systematically approach the summarization task; quick check: each stage performs as expected independently
- **Dataset Standardization**: Converting various paper formats to a consistent structure - needed for training reliable models; quick check: dataset covers diverse scientific domains

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Classifier (IMRaD standardization + function recognition) -> Longformer (context-aware summarization)

**Critical Path**
1. Standardize chapter titles to IMRaD format
2. Train classifier to identify structural functions (Background, Methods, Results, Discussion)
3. Apply Longformer with structural information for summary generation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Trade accuracy for generalization by using automatic structure recognition rather than manual annotation
- Prioritize comprehensiveness over brevity by leveraging full structural context
- Accept potential domain limitations for the benefit of improved performance on IMRaD-structured papers

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance on non-IMRaD structured papers (humanities, social sciences)
- Cascading errors from misclassified structural functions affecting summary quality
- Limited generalizability due to small dataset sizes (161-204 papers)

**First 3 Experiments to Run**
1. Test framework on papers from non-IMRaD domains (mathematics, philosophy) to assess cross-domain performance
2. Compare performance with oracle section labels to isolate impact of classification errors
3. Scale up to larger corpus (1,000+ papers) to verify robustness and generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on IMRaD structure may not generalize to non-standard scientific paper formats
- Automatic structural function recognition (82.5% accuracy) may propagate errors to downstream summarization
- Experiments conducted on relatively small datasets (161-204 papers) raise concerns about robustness

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical methodology and implementation details
- Medium confidence in empirical results due to limited dataset sizes
- Low confidence in cross-domain applicability claims without additional validation

## Next Checks
1. **Domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate the framework on scientific papers from non-IMRaD domains (e.g., mathematics, philosophy, or engineering disciplines with different organizational structures) to assess cross-domain performance.

2. **Error Propagation Analysis**: Conduct an ablation study isolating the impact of structural function classification errors on final summary quality by comparing with oracle section labels.

3. **Scale-Up Experiment**: Test the approach on a larger corpus (minimum 1,000 papers) spanning multiple journals and disciplines to verify scalability and robustness of the reported improvements.
