# LiveResearchBench: A Live Benchmark for User-Centric Deep Research in the Wild

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.14240
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14240
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces LiveResearchBench with 100 expert-curated tasks and DeepEval evaluation suite for deep research systems

## Executive Summary
LiveResearchBench presents a novel benchmark for evaluating deep research systems that perform real-time web search and synthesize long-form reports. The benchmark consists of 100 expert-curated tasks designed around four key principles: user-centric focus, unambiguous requirements, dynamic content, and multi-faceted search intensity. The accompanying DeepEval evaluation suite provides comprehensive assessment across six dimensions including presentation, factual consistency, coverage, analysis depth, citation association, and citation accuracy. The evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art systems reveals significant gaps in citation reliability and analytical depth, despite reasonable performance in information gathering and organization.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces LiveResearchBench, a benchmark comprising 100 expert-curated tasks for evaluating deep research systems. Each task requires real-time web search and synthesis of comprehensive reports. The benchmark is guided by four principles: user-centric design, unambiguous task definition, dynamic content requirements, and multi-faceted search intensity. To evaluate generated reports, the authors developed DeepEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite that assesses six dimensions: presentation & organization, factual & logical consistency, coverage & comprehensiveness, analysis depth, citation association, and citation accuracy. DeepEval employs four tailored evaluation protocols to ensure reliable assessment. The benchmark was used to evaluate 17 state-of-the-art deep research systems, revealing systematic strengths and weaknesses across different architectural approaches.

## Key Results
- Multi-agent systems lead in presentation and citation association, while single-agent web models excel in factual consistency
- Citation accuracy remains a persistent bottleneck, with even top systems generating non-trivial errors
- Models can effectively gather and organize information but struggle with analytical depth and reliable source attribution
- The evaluation framework successfully distinguishes between different system architectures and identifies specific failure modes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark succeeds by creating realistic, user-centric tasks that require genuine deep research capabilities rather than surface-level information retrieval. The multi-faceted evaluation approach captures the complexity of deep research through diverse metrics that assess not just factual accuracy but also presentation quality, analytical depth, and citation reliability. The real-time web search requirement ensures systems must handle dynamic content and current information, making the benchmark more representative of actual research needs. The combination of automated metrics with human evaluation provides both scalability and nuanced assessment of report quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **User-centric task design**: Why needed - ensures benchmark reflects actual research needs rather than artificial constraints; Quick check - tasks should be framed from user perspective with clear end goals
- **Multi-faceted evaluation**: Why needed - deep research requires diverse skills beyond simple accuracy; Quick check - assessment should cover presentation, analysis, and citation reliability
- **Real-time search requirement**: Why needed - ensures systems handle current, dynamic information; Quick check - tasks should require up-to-date information not available in static datasets
- **Citation accuracy metrics**: Why needed - source attribution is critical for research credibility; Quick check - evaluation should verify both citation presence and accuracy
- **Analysis depth assessment**: Why needed - distinguishes surface-level reporting from genuine insight; Quick check - evaluation should measure synthesis and critical thinking

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Query -> Task Processor -> Search Engine -> Information Gatherer -> Synthesis Engine -> Report Generator -> DeepEval Evaluator

**Critical Path**: Query understanding → Web search execution → Information extraction → Report synthesis → Multi-dimensional evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Multi-agent systems offer better presentation and citation handling but may struggle with consistency; single-agent models provide better factual accuracy but weaker analytical depth. Real-time search capability vs. computational efficiency represents a key architectural tension.

**Failure Signatures**: Citation errors typically manifest as hallucinated sources or incorrect attribution; analysis depth failures appear as surface-level reporting without synthesis; consistency issues emerge as contradictory claims within reports.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Run baseline evaluation with a single state-of-the-art system to verify benchmark functionality
2. Test cross-evaluator reliability by having multiple graders assess the same reports
3. Conduct ablation study on individual DeepEval metrics to understand their relative importance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the long-term stability of the benchmark, the generalizability of results to other domains and languages, and the potential for automated metrics to fully capture human judgment nuances in research quality assessment.

## Limitations
- Expert-curated task design may introduce subjectivity in task framing and grading criteria
- Evaluation framework's reliance on automated metrics may not fully capture human judgment nuances
- Benchmark scope limited to English-language content, potentially limiting generalizability
- Relatively small benchmark size (100 tasks) could affect statistical power of system comparisons

## Confidence

**High**: Task design principles, evaluation framework structure, basic system performance trends

**Medium**: Specific metric implementations, cross-system performance comparisons

**Low**: Long-term benchmark stability predictions, generalizability to other domains

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-rater reliability analysis with additional expert graders on a subset of tasks to validate consistency of human evaluation
2. Test benchmark transferability by applying it to non-English domains and specialized technical fields
3. Implement ablation studies on the evaluation metrics to assess their individual contribution to overall assessment reliability
