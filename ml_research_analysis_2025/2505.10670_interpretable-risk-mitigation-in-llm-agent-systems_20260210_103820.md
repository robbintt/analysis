- Key outcome: SAE-based steering achieves 28 percentage point reduction in LLM agent defection probability in Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method for mitigating risks in LLM agent systems by steering model behavior using interpretable features from sparse autoencoders (SAEs). The approach focuses on improving agent strategy in an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game-theoretic setting, achieving a 28 percentage point reduction in average defection probability through steering with a "good-faith negotiation" feature. The study identifies effective steering ranges for multiple open-source LLM agents (Gemma-2B, Gemma2-2B, LLaMA3-8B) and demonstrates how interpretable AI techniques can enhance alignment and reliability of LLM agents in high-stakes applications.

## Method Summary
The method hooks pre-trained SAEs to the residual stream of LLM agents, modifying activations by adding decoded feature vectors to bias token predictions. Researchers identify interpretable features that activate on game prompts, then systematically sweep steering strength parameters to measure effects on cooperation/defection behavior across all possible game states. The approach validates steering effectiveness through quantifiable changes in defection probability while monitoring for context coherence.

## Key Results
- 28 percentage point reduction in average defection probability using "good-faith negotiation" feature
- Steering works across multiple models (Gemma-2B, Gemma2-2B, LLaMA3-8B) with model-specific optimal ranges
- Monosemantic features show more reliable steering than polysemantic features
- Context coherence breaks down when P('green') + P('blue') approaches zero

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Adding interpretable SAE feature vectors to the residual stream shifts action probabilities toward semantically-aligned outcomes. During inference, a decoded sparse feature vector is added to the residual stream at layer l: x′l = xl + ωWdec(fID). This biases the next-token distribution without changing model weights or prompts. The feature direction corresponds to a human-interpretable concept that causally influences downstream token predictions.

### Mechanism 2
Monosemantic features enable more predictable and reliable steering than polysemantic features. Monosemantic features exhibit bimodal activation distributions with a second mode at high activation values, indicating single-concept dominance. This reduces interference from unintended concepts during steering. Activation density histograms validly proxy semantic specificity; features with clustered high-activation tails correspond to single human-relatable concepts.

### Mechanism 3
Game-theoretic environments provide controlled testbeds for quantifying steering effectiveness on strategic decisions. IPD setup isolates cooperative vs defective actions with clear token mappings ('green'=cooperate, 'blue'=defect). By enumerating all 64 possible 3-round histories, researchers measure δ (steering effect size) across consistent game states. Defection probability changes generalize from IPD to real-world agent alignment scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**
  - Why needed here: SAEs decompose dense residual stream representations into sparse, interpretable features. Understanding the L1 sparsity penalty and reconstruction loss tradeoff is essential for interpreting feature quality.
  - Quick check question: Why does L1 regularization promote sparsity, and how does this affect feature monosemanticity?

- **Concept: Transformer Residual Stream**
  - Why needed here: The residual stream is the intervention point for steering. You must understand how activations flow through layers and how additive modifications propagate to token predictions.
  - Quick check question: At which layer would you hook an SAE for maximum steering effect, and why might earlier vs later layers produce different results?

- **Concept: Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD)**
  - Why needed here: IPD provides the evaluation framework with quantifiable cooperation/defection metrics. Understanding payoff matrices and strategy dynamics (tit-for-tat, win-stay-lose-shift) contextualizes why defection probability is the target metric.
  - Quick check question: Why might an LLM agent's strategy bifurcate under small temperature increases even with identical prompts and histories?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Base LLM (Gemma-2B, Gemma2-2B, LLaMA3-8B) -> Pre-trained SAE (16K features) -> Steering Module (Decoder + Feature + ω) -> Game Environment (IPD prompt + 64 histories) -> Evaluation (Defection probability)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Load pre-trained SAE weights from HuggingFace or custom training
  2. Identify candidate features via activation on prompt tokens
  3. Validate game-coherence: ensure P('green') + P('blue') ≈ 1 after steering
  4. Sweep steering strength ω to find feasible range before coherence breakdown
  5. Compute δ across all histories to quantify steering effect size

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Model size vs interpretability: Smaller models (Gemma-2B) have narrower context windows but enable exhaustive feature sweeps; larger models (Mixtral 8x7B) show richer strategy variation but are computationally expensive to steer systematically
  - Monosemanticity vs effect size: Some polysemantic features produced larger δ (47 pp) than monosematic 'trust' (3 pp); reliability vs magnitude tradeoff
  - Steering strength vs coherence: Higher |ω| increases effect but risks context collapse (P(game tokens) → 0)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Context collapse: Steering produces tokens unrelated to game instead of 'green'/'blue'
  - Non-monotonic response: Some features show irregular δ(ω) curves; not all concepts scale linearly
  - Feature mismatch: Semantically-relevant features may not activate on specific prompt tokens
  - Model-specific baseline aggression: LLaMA3 has higher default defection (70%) than Gemma (55%); steering ranges don't transfer directly

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity check with token features:** Steer with 'green' (feature 1041) and 'blue' (feature 6556) features; verify P('blue') scales as expected with ω. This confirms hook integrity.
  2. **Monosemanticity proxy validation:** Plot activation density histograms for known monosematic vs polysemantic features; confirm bimodal vs flat-tail distinction.
  3. **Feasible range sweep:** For a target abstract feature, sweep ω ∈ [-10, 8] and plot P('green') + P('blue') to identify coherence boundaries; report δ at feasible ω values.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does SAE-based representation steering successfully transfer from game-theoretic toy environments to complex, real-world tasks on embodied or end-user platforms?
- Basis in paper: The abstract and Section 6.2 explicitly hypothesize that this method "can generalise to real-world applications on end-user devices and embodied platforms," but the experiments are restricted to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.
- Why unresolved: The paper only validates the method in a constrained "toy" environment (IPD) with low context windows, whereas real-world deployment involves higher complexity and sensory input.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of steering efficacy in a physical robotics task or a complex software navigation task outside of a game-theoretic simulation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can steering be effectively performed with multiple features or across multiple layers without causing interference or semantic confusion?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.2 states that "Further research is necessary to better understand how steering with multiple features at once can be performed," noting that simple vector addition may fail due to the overcomplete nature of the feature space.
- Why unresolved: The current study modifies the residual stream using single features (univariate), but real-world alignment likely requires satisfying multiple constraints (e.g., safety and helpfulness) simultaneously.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework for "multilayer steering" or "multivariate steering" that demonstrates reliable control over multiple distinct behaviors concurrently without degrading model performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does steering an agent with a specific feature (e.g., "good faith") introduce unintended side effects or degrade performance on unrelated tasks?
- Basis in paper: Section 2.1 notes that similar methods like Inference Time Intervention (ITI) can affect performance on unrelated QA benchmarks, and Section 6.1 warns that polysemantic features risk steering toward "unexpected concepts."
- Why unresolved: The paper measures the probability of defection within the game context but does not benchmark whether the "good faith" steering inadvertently makes the model hallucinate, refuse valid requests, or alter its personality in non-game contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of steered agents on standard capability benchmarks to confirm that alignment steering does not induce "collateral damage" to general model intelligence.

## Limitations
- Generalization gap: Results from IPD environment may not transfer to complex real-world tasks
- Monosemanticity assessment: Activation histogram heuristics lack rigorous validation
- Feature stability: Steering effectiveness may be sensitive to prompt variations

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- SAE-based steering can modify LLM agent behavior in game-theoretic settings
- Steering breaks down when P('green') + P('blue') ≈ 0, indicating context collapse
- Larger models show richer strategy variation but require more computational resources
- Steering strength must be tuned experimentally for each feature-model combination

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Monosemantic features provide more predictable steering than polysemantic ones
- The 28 percentage point reduction represents a meaningful alignment improvement
- Game-theoretic environments provide valid testbeds for alignment research

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Results generalize to real-world applications on end-user devices
- SAE-based steering will scale to embodied platforms and complex multi-agent systems
- Monosemanticity histograms reliably predict steering effectiveness

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Environment Generalization Test**: Apply the same steering features to a different game-theoretic environment (e.g., Trust Game or Chicken Game) and measure whether the observed effects transfer.

2. **Prompt Robustness Evaluation**: Systematically vary the prompt phrasing, context window, and instruction style while maintaining the same SAE features and steering parameters. Measure how sensitive the steering effects are to prompt engineering.

3. **Real-World Task Pilot**: Implement a simple but realistic multi-turn task (e.g., collaborative text editing or resource allocation simulation) where the agent must make sequential decisions affecting multiple stakeholders. Apply steering features and measure behavioral changes beyond binary cooperation/defection metrics.
