# Fair and Explainable Credit-Scoring under Concept Drift: Adaptive Explanation Frameworks for Evolving Populations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.03807
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03807
- Authors: Shivogo John
- Reference count: 25
- Three adaptive SHAP variants improve explanation stability (cosine similarity ≈ 0.995) and reduce demographic disparity by approximately 0.026

## Executive Summary
This study addresses concept drift in credit-scoring systems where evolving borrower behaviors and economic conditions cause traditional explainability methods to produce unstable and potentially unfair explanations. The research introduces three adaptive SHAP variants—per-slice reweighting, drift-aware rebaselining with sliding windows, and online surrogate calibration using Ridge regression—to maintain transparency, fairness, and accountability in dynamic environments. Using a multi-year credit dataset, the adaptive methods demonstrate improved explanation stability and reduced demographic disparity without degrading predictive performance.

## Method Summary
The research develops three adaptive explanation frameworks to address concept drift in credit-scoring: (1) per-slice reweighting adjusts sample weights based on current data distribution, (2) drift-aware rebaselining uses sliding windows to recalibrate explanations, and (3) online surrogate calibration employs Ridge regression to continuously update explanation models. These methods are evaluated on a multi-year credit dataset using metrics including cosine similarity, Kendall τ correlation, demographic disparity, and AUC performance.

## Key Results
- Explanation stability improved to cosine similarity ≈ 0.995 and Kendall τ ≈ 0.89
- Demographic disparity reduced by approximately 0.026 (p < 0.05)
- Predictive performance maintained with AUC range of 0.63–0.66
- Adaptive methods outperformed static SHAP explanations under concept drift conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The adaptive frameworks work by continuously recalibrating explanation methods to match the current data distribution. Per-slice reweighting assigns appropriate weights to samples based on their relevance to current conditions. Drift-aware rebaselining maintains a sliding window of recent data to ensure explanations reflect current patterns. Online surrogate calibration uses Ridge regression to create a continuously updated model that approximates the black-box credit scorer while providing stable explanations.

## Foundational Learning
- Concept drift: Gradual or sudden changes in data distribution over time that invalidate static models
  * Why needed: Credit markets and borrower behaviors evolve, making static explanations inaccurate
  * Quick check: Monitor prediction accuracy and feature importance stability over time
- SHAP values: Game-theoretic approach to feature attribution that explains individual predictions
  * Why needed: Provides interpretable feature contributions for credit decisions
  * Quick check: Verify Shapley values sum to prediction difference from baseline
- Sliding window techniques: Method for maintaining relevance by focusing on recent data
  * Why needed: Balances recency with stability in drifting environments
  * Quick check: Adjust window size based on drift detection frequency

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data stream -> Drift detector -> Adaptive SHAP variant -> Explanation output

**Critical path**: Real-time data ingestion → Concept drift detection → Adaptive explanation recalculation → Model update

**Design tradeoffs**: The study balances explanation stability with computational overhead, choosing Ridge regression for online calibration despite potential accuracy trade-offs compared to more complex models.

**Failure signatures**: Explanation instability when drift rates exceed adaptive response capabilities; fairness degradation when minority group variance assumptions are violated.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test adaptive methods on synthetic concept drift datasets with controlled drift patterns
2. Compare explanation stability across different sliding window sizes
3. Evaluate computational latency of online calibration under varying data volumes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The study identifies several open questions: the long-term applicability of adaptive explanation frameworks beyond the 2017-2020 timeframe studied, the practical impact on individual borrowers beyond proxy fairness metrics, the validity of assumptions about minority group variance in different credit markets, and the computational overhead in production environments.

## Limitations
- Credit dataset limited to 2017-2020 timeframe, potentially missing long-term drift patterns
- Fairness improvements measured only through demographic disparity proxy metrics
- Assumes minority group has smaller variance in model scores, which may not hold universally
- Does not address potential downstream effects on loan approval rates or financial inclusion

## Confidence
- Explanation stability improvements: High (supported by concrete metrics like cosine similarity ≈ 0.995 and Kendall τ ≈ 0.89)
- Fairness improvements: Medium (statistically significant but limited to proxy metric of demographic disparity)
- Predictive performance maintenance: High (AUC range of 0.63-0.66 is consistent across methods)

## Next Checks
1. Deploy the adaptive framework on a longer time-series credit dataset (minimum 10 years) to validate performance under various drift patterns
2. Conduct A/B testing in a live credit-scoring environment to measure actual impact on loan approval rates across demographic groups
3. Benchmark computational overhead and latency of adaptive methods compared to static SHAP explanations in production-grade infrastructure
