  training scenario generation by introducing a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning
  framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework decomposes
  scenario generation into subproblems and employs specialized LLM agents to address

# Towards AI-Assisted Generation of Military Training Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07690
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07690
- Authors: Soham Hans; Volkan Ustun; Benjamin Nye; James Sterrett; Matthew Green

- Key outcome: Multi-agent framework with specialized LLM agents successfully generates coherent military training scenarios and predicts unit positions with improved feasibility over prior AI approaches.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that addresses the challenge of automating complex military training scenario generation. The approach decomposes scenario generation into subproblems, with a central Orchestrator Agent delegating tasks to specialized Helper Agents equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over narrow scenario slices. The framework enables both human-in-the-loop and fully automated generation of training artifacts like Operations Orders (OPORDs), demonstrating improved coherence and accuracy compared to single-agent approaches.

## Method Summary
The framework employs GPT-4o as an Orchestrator Agent using the ReAct paradigm (Reasoning + Action), which iteratively produces thoughts, actions, and observations while delegating subtasks to RAG-equipped Helper Agents. Each Helper Agent specializes in a specific information block (e.g., High-Level Unit Purpose, Decision Support Matrix, Unit Positions Time Based, Map and MCOO). The Map and MCOO Helper Agent programmatically extracts and renders simplified visual overlays focusing on relevant terrain features and obstacles rather than passing full-resolution military maps to multimodal LLMs. The approach is designed to be model-agnostic and follows a dependency graph defining construction order and automation levels for different information blocks.

## Key Results
- Framework produces coherent doctrinal documents like OPORDs with accurate Scheme of Movement and Maneuver sections
- Time-based unit position predictions demonstrate improved spatial reasoning accuracy using simplified visual map representations
- Multi-agent decomposition strategy overcomes limitations of basic prompting and single-agent approaches for highly complex military scenario generation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems with specialized agents improves coherence over single-agent prompting.
- Mechanism: A central Orchestrator Agent delegates subtasks to domain-specific Helper Agents, each equipped with RAG over narrow scenario slices. The orchestrator integrates responses sequentially to maintain consistency.
- Core assumption: Information blocks have stable dependencies that can be formalized as a directed graph guiding construction order.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks."
  - [Multi-Agent Framework section] "The orchestrator executes tasks through a step-by-step reasoning process, delegating subtasks to the relevant helper agents as needed and integrating their responses to generate coherent, context-aware outputs."
  - [corpus] Related work (Kaleidoscopic Teaming, MARL explainability) suggests multi-agent decomposition improves coordination in complex simulations, but direct evidence for LLM-based scenario generation remains limited.
- Break condition: If information block dependencies are circular or ambiguous, sequential delegation fails and the orchestrator cannot resolve conflicts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Simplified visual map representations enable more accurate spatial reasoning than passing full-resolution maps to multimodal LLMs.
- Mechanism: The Map and MCOO Helper Agent programmatically extracts and renders only relevant elements based on query context, producing focused overlays for the orchestrator. This reduces noise and supports waypoint-based path abstraction.
- Core assumption: Multimodal LLMs perform better on task-relevant, reduced-complexity images than on high-fidelity military maps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Map and MCOO Helper Agent section] "Earlier attempts to describe this information purely in text led to poor results—LLMs often misinterpreted spatial layouts... Instead, the helper extracts and renders only the relevant elements... This filtered, focused rendering improves the orchestrator's ability to reason accurately about space and movement."
  - [Proof of Concept section] Figure 2 contrasts full MCOO with simplified representation; no quantitative accuracy comparison is provided.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on simplified vs. full map inputs for LLM spatial reasoning.
- Break condition: If extracted visual elements are incomplete or misaligned with query context, spatial inferences degrade; programmatic extraction logic must be maintained.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Structured reasoning with backtracking enables self-correction during multi-step generation.
- Mechanism: The Orchestrator uses the ReAct paradigm (Reasoning + Action), iteratively producing thoughts, actions, and observations. If an action yields unsatisfactory results, the orchestrator can backtrack and reissue corrected queries.
- Core assumption: The orchestrator can reliably detect unsatisfactory outputs without external validation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [The Orchestrator Agent section] "This iterative strategy leads to greater robustness, enabling the orchestrator to revise its own intermediate conclusions if errors or inconsistencies arise."
  - [Proof of Concept section] Figure 4 illustrates a reasoning trace with thoughts, actions, and observations but does not quantify backtracking frequency or success rate.
  - [corpus] ReAct (Yao, 2023) is cited; corpus neighbors do not provide additional empirical support for backtracking in this domain.
- Break condition: If the orchestrator's self-evaluation is miscalibrated, it may not recognize errors or may backtrack excessively without convergence.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: Each Helper Agent uses RAG to ground responses in scenario-specific documents rather than relying solely on parametric knowledge.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a helper agent's response would differ with vs. without access to the scenario JSON files?

- Concept: ReAct prompting paradigm
  - Why needed here: The Orchestrator's reasoning loop depends on alternating thought and action steps with observation feedback.
  - Quick check question: Given a sample reasoning trace, can you identify where the orchestrator should backtrack based on an observation?

- Concept: Military Operations Orders (OPORDs) and MCOO
  - Why needed here: The framework generates doctrinal documents; understanding their structure (e.g., Scheme of Movement and Maneuver) is required to validate outputs.
  - Quick check question: What information blocks must be available before generating the Scheme of Movement and Maneuver section?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Orchestrator Agent -> Helper Agents (High-Level Unit Purpose, Decision Support Matrix, Unit Positions Time Based, Map and MCOO, others per dependency graph)

- Critical path:
  1. Define learning objectives and backstory (purple/orange blocks).
  2. Generate force groupings, objectives, and MCOO data.
  3. Compute time-based unit positions (orange, requires human verification).
  4. Synthesize Scheme of Movement and Maneuver (green, automatable).

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Full map vs. simplified visual: Reduced noise improves reasoning but requires accurate extraction logic.
  - Full automation vs. human-in-the-loop: Green blocks can be automated; orange require expert validation; purple remain human-driven.
  - Single model vs. model-agnostic: Framework is model-agnostic but experiments used GPT-4o; performance may vary across models.

- Failure signatures:
  - Orchestrator loops without convergence (backtracking fails to resolve).
  - Spatial inferences contradict terrain constraints (visual extraction incomplete).
  - OPORD sections lack coherence with upstream blocks (dependency graph violated).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the time-based unit position prediction on a simplified scenario; compare predicted coordinates to ground truth with and without simplified map inputs.
  2. Ablate one helper agent (e.g., Decision Support Matrix) and measure degradation in OPORD coherence.
  3. Test orchestrator backtracking: inject a deliberately inconsistent observation and verify whether the orchestrator detects and corrects the error.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What quantitative metrics can reliably evaluate the quality and doctrinal accuracy of LLM-generated military content?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Figure 6 presents only a side-by-side qualitative comparison of LLM-generated versus human expert text. The paper claims "improved feasibility and accuracy compared to prior AI approaches" without providing numerical benchmarks or standardized evaluation criteria.
- Why unresolved: The proof-of-concept relies on demonstration rather than systematic measurement, leaving unclear how success should be measured at scale.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of automated or expert-based scoring rubrics covering doctrinal compliance, factual consistency, and operational plausibility, applied across multiple generated outputs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How well does the multi-agent framework generalize across different operational contexts, terrain types, and DATE regions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] All experiments used exclusively the PACIFIC AEGIS scenario in the Indo-Pacific environment. The dependency hierarchy and framework were not tested on other operation types mentioned (e.g., river crossing, deliberate defense) or other DATE regions like Eurasia.
- Why unresolved: Single-scenario validation cannot establish whether the approach transfers to diverse geospatial and tactical contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-validation experiments across multiple DATE regions and operation types, measuring performance consistency and identifying context-specific failure modes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the framework maintain performance when using alternative LLM architectures beyond GPT-4o?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "our approach is model-agnostic and not dependent on any specific architecture" but report results only using GPT-4o.
- Why unresolved: No experiments substantiate the model-agnosticism claim; spatial reasoning and multi-step orchestration capabilities may vary significantly across model families.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation across multiple LLM architectures measuring output quality, spatial reasoning accuracy, and orchestrator reliability.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the framework generate complete, internally consistent OPORDs across all sections rather than isolated components?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper validates generation of only one OPORD section (Scheme of Movement and Maneuver) and Time-Based Unit Positions. The dependency graph shows many untested blocks, and full document coherence remains unaddressed.
- Why unresolved: Generating individual blocks differs from producing a complete document where all sections must be mutually consistent.
- What evidence would resolve it: End-to-end generation of full OPORDs with evaluation of cross-section consistency, factual coherence, and expert assessment of document-level quality.

## Limitations

- Framework performance depends heavily on Orchestrator's self-evaluation during backtracking, which lacks empirical quantification
- Simplified map extraction process has not been validated against ground truth accuracy
- Model-agnostic design claim remains untested as only GPT-4o was evaluated in experiments

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The multi-agent decomposition approach is technically sound and addresses a recognized limitation in single-agent prompting for complex tasks.
- **Medium confidence**: The simplified visual representation improves spatial reasoning in principle, but lacks quantitative validation against full map inputs.
- **Low confidence**: The backtracking mechanism's effectiveness and the framework's performance across different LLM models remain unproven.

## Next Checks

1. Measure backtracking frequency and success rate in the Orchestrator when handling inconsistent observations, and determine the conditions under which backtracking fails to converge.
2. Conduct a controlled comparison of unit position prediction accuracy using simplified visual overlays versus full-resolution military maps as inputs to the Map and MCOO Helper Agent.
3. Test framework performance across multiple LLM models (e.g., Claude, Llama) to assess model-agnostic claims and identify any architecture-specific dependencies.
