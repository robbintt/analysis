# Comparing EPGP Surrogates and Finite Elements Under Degree-of-Freedom Parity

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.04518
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04518
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: B-EPGP achieves ~100x lower error than CN-FEM under matched DoF for 2D wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet BCs

## Executive Summary
This study benchmarks a boundary-constrained Ehrenpreis–Palamodov Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate against classical finite element method with Crank–Nicolson time stepping (CN-FEM) for solving the two-dimensional wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The B-EPGP approach uses exact analytical basis functions derived from the PDE's characteristic variety to enforce both the differential equation and boundary conditions exactly, with coefficients determined via penalized least squares. To ensure fairness, a degrees-of-freedom (DoF) matching protocol was introduced, comparing B-EPGP's effective DoF—computed as the trace of the influence matrix—with CN-FEM's DoF based on spatial nodes and time steps.

Under matched DoF, B-EPGP consistently achieved significantly lower space-time L²-error and maximum-in-time L²-error than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of magnitude. For the smooth polynomial initial condition, B-EPGP reduced the space-time relative L²-error from 31.79% to 0.10%, and for the mollifier case, from 75.31% to 0.96%. The method also demonstrated rapid evaluation times after training and provided built-in uncertainty quantification. These results confirm that B-EPGP delivers superior accuracy, efficiency, and stability for linear wave problems while embedding operator structure directly into the surrogate representation.

## Method Summary
The study solves the 2D wave equation on unit square Ω = (0,1)² with homogeneous Dirichlet BCs, wave speed c = 1.0, terminal time T = 1.0, and zero initial velocity. Two initial conditions are tested: a polynomial u₀(x,y) = x(1-x)y(1-y) and a mollifier centered at (0.3, 0.7) with R = 0.24. B-EPGP uses basis functions φ_{j,k}(x,y,t) = sin(jπx/L₁)sin(kπy/L₂)cos(ω_{j,k}t) with N=40 modes/direction and m=5000 Latin Hypercube Design sample points, solved via ridge regression with GCV-selected λ. CN-FEM uses P1 triangular elements with Crank-Nicolson time stepping, with DoF = (n-1)²(n+1) matched to B-EPGP's effective DoF = tr(H_λ). A 400×400 reference solution is used for error computation via Gaussian quadrature (spatial) and Simpson's rule (temporal).

## Key Results
- B-EPGP reduced space-time relative L²-error from 31.79% to 0.10% for polynomial initial condition
- B-EPGP reduced space-time relative L²-error from 75.31% to 0.96% for mollifier initial condition
- Accuracy improvement of roughly two orders of magnitude under matched DoF conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The B-EPGP method embeds the differential operator structure directly into the surrogate representation through analytical basis functions derived from the characteristic variety. By enforcing both the PDE and boundary conditions exactly through the basis construction, B-EPGP eliminates approximation errors that arise in mesh-based methods. The ridge regression with GCV-selected regularization balances fitting accuracy against numerical stability, while the effective DoF computation ensures fair comparison with traditional finite element methods by accounting for the rank deficiency in the design matrix.

## Foundational Learning
- **Characteristic variety analysis**: Understanding the geometric structure of linear PDEs to construct exact basis functions; needed to derive analytical solutions that satisfy the PDE exactly
- **Ridge regression with GCV**: Regularized least squares with automatic hyperparameter selection; needed to prevent overfitting while maintaining accuracy
- **Effective degrees of freedom**: Trace of influence matrix in regularized regression; needed for fair comparison between different numerical methods
- **Latin Hypercube Design sampling**: Stratified sampling method for experimental design; needed to ensure representative training data across domain
- **Singular value decomposition**: Matrix factorization for solving ill-conditioned systems; needed for stable computation of regression coefficients

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: B-EPGP -> Design matrix construction -> Ridge regression with GCV -> Coefficient computation via SVD -> Surrogate evaluation
**Critical path**: Sample generation → Basis evaluation → Matrix assembly → Regularization parameter selection → Coefficient computation → Error evaluation
**Design tradeoffs**: Exact operator embedding vs. computational cost of analytical basis functions; sparse sampling vs. reconstruction accuracy
**Failure signatures**: Ill-conditioned design matrices without proper regularization; DoF mismatch between methods preventing fair comparison
**First experiments**: 1) Verify basis functions satisfy PDE and BCs analytically, 2) Test GCV convergence for λ selection, 3) Confirm DoF matching protocol accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results limited to linear PDEs with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions
- DoF matching protocol couples spatial and temporal resolution in CN-FEM, not reflecting typical engineering practice
- Computational efficiency claims not fully validated for training costs and scalability with problem dimension

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in relative accuracy comparison under matched DoF for studied problem class
- **Medium confidence** in computational efficiency claims due to limited scalability analysis
- **Low confidence** in generalization to nonlinear PDEs or different boundary condition types

## Next Checks
1. Test B-EPGP with nonlinear wave equations or varying wave speeds to assess robustness beyond linear case
2. Implement fixed time-stepping in CN-FEM to evaluate B-EPGP under more realistic computational constraints
3. Extend DoF matching framework to 3D problems and problems with Neumann/Robin boundary conditions to verify scalability
