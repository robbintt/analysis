# Stochastic Optimization with Random Search

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15610
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15610
- Reference count: 40
- Key result: Random search achieves O(d/ε⁴) complexity in stochastic optimization, matching gradient-based methods without discretization bias

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes convergence rates for random search methods in stochastic optimization, extending analysis to settings with only noisy function evaluations. The authors show that random search can achieve comparable complexity to gradient-based methods while avoiding discretization bias inherent in finite-difference approximations. The framework is particularly effective for non-smooth or black-box functions where gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. The analysis leverages translation invariance to control difference errors rather than individual errors, providing a novel approach to analyzing stochastic search methods.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes random search algorithms for stochastic optimization, where only noisy function evaluations are available. Under (L₀,L₁)-smoothness assumptions, the method perturbs current iterate in random directions and uses function differences to estimate descent directions. The analysis shows O(d/ε⁴) complexity for general stochastic settings and O(min(d⁴/³n²/³/ε⁸/³, dn/ε²)) for finite-sum problems with variance reduction. The approach handles both gradient-based and gradient-free settings, including scenarios with inexact human/helper feedback where convergence is achieved up to an accuracy floor of O(√dδ).

## Key Results
- Random search achieves O(d/ε⁴) complexity in stochastic optimization, matching gradient-based methods
- Variance-reduced variant attains O(min(d⁴/³n²/³/ε⁸/³, dn/ε²)) complexity in finite-sum case, improving upon deterministic rates when n ≫ d/ε²
- Method converges up to accuracy floor O(√dδ) in settings with inexact human/helper feedback
- Direct adaptations of momentum techniques fail due to step-size-dependent structure of both signal and noise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging translation invariance to control difference errors rather than individual errors. This allows the algorithm to make progress using only function evaluations, avoiding the need for explicit gradient computations. The random perturbations in multiple directions provide sufficient information to estimate descent directions even in non-smooth settings. The variance reduction technique in the finite-sum case effectively reduces the impact of individual data point noise while maintaining the benefits of random search.

## Foundational Learning

1. (L₀,L₁)-smoothness: A generalization of smoothness conditions that bounds both function values and gradient differences
   - Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for analyzing convergence rates in non-smooth settings
   - Quick check: Verify that the function satisfies both L₀ and L₁ bounds on differences

2. Translation invariance: Property where differences of function values at translated points remain unchanged
   - Why needed: Enables control of difference errors rather than individual errors
   - Quick check: Confirm that f(x) - f(y) = f(x+z) - f(y+z) for relevant function classes

3. Variance reduction in stochastic optimization: Techniques to reduce noise in gradient estimates
   - Why needed: Critical for improving convergence rates in finite-sum settings
   - Quick check: Monitor variance of gradient estimates across iterations

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Random Perturbation -> Function Evaluation -> Difference Calculation -> Direction Estimation -> Update Step

Critical path: The algorithm iteratively samples random directions, evaluates function at perturbed points, computes differences, estimates descent direction, and updates the iterate. The key insight is that translation invariance allows focusing on difference errors rather than individual function value errors.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades computational efficiency (no gradient computation) for potentially higher sample complexity compared to first-order methods. The random search approach is more robust to non-smoothness but may require more function evaluations.

Failure signatures: Convergence issues may arise when (L₀,L₁)-smoothness assumptions are violated, particularly when L₀ and L₁ differ significantly. Poor performance can also occur in highly anisotropic landscapes where random directions don't align well with descent directions.

First experiments:
1. Compare random search convergence on a simple quadratic function vs gradient descent
2. Test the method on a non-smooth piecewise linear function where gradients are undefined
3. Evaluate performance on a high-dimensional synthetic optimization problem with varying condition numbers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- O(d/ε⁴) complexity exhibits suboptimal ε-dependence compared to first-order methods with better problem structure
- Variance-reduced variant's theoretical bound may be pessimistic in practice due to conservative analysis
- Extension to human-in-the-loop settings relies on specific problem structures that may not generalize

## Confidence
High: Main convergence rate results under stated assumptions
Medium: Practical performance estimates in non-ideal conditions
Low: Extension to general human-in-the-loop optimization scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation of the random search method against state-of-the-art first-order stochastic optimization algorithms on benchmark non-convex problems
2. Investigation of the practical performance gap between the theoretical variance-reduced variant and simpler implementations without careful tuning of the inner loop size
3. Testing the robustness of the method when the (L₀,L₁)-smoothness assumptions are violated, particularly when L₀ and L₁ differ significantly or when the function exhibits non-smooth regions
