# COOPERA: Continual Open-Ended Human-Robot Assistance

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.23495
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23495
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** Introduces COOPERA framework for continual human-robot collaboration using LLM-simulated humans with traits, intentions, and tasks in Habitat 3.0.

## Executive Summary
COOPERA addresses the challenge of enabling robots to assist humans over long-term interactions by learning individual traits, habits, and activities. The framework centers on a human model with preferences supporting continuous interactions, feedback mechanisms, and benchmarks to evaluate robots' ability to reason about human preferences effectively. Experiments validate that simulated humans driven by traits reflect realistic behaviors and demonstrate the value of inferring and personalizing to human intents for open-ended collaboration.

## Method Summary
The COOPERA framework uses a hierarchical pipeline where Llama-3.1-8B generates intentions and tasks from human profiles using retrieval and reflexion, while a robot agent with Llama-3.2-11B and Mistral-7B classifier learns to predict intentions from partial observations. Human simulation combines SPC persona data extended with Big-5 traits, 3D motion from Motion-X and AMASS datasets, and LLM-driven generation of personality, intentions, and tasks. The system is evaluated in Habitat 3.0 with dynamic objects across four settings: same/diff human and same/diff scene scenarios.

## Key Results
- COOPERA enables robots to learn and personalize to individual human traits and preferences over long-term interactions.
- LLM-simulated humans exhibit realistic behaviors that validate the framework's effectiveness in open-ended collaboration.
- The framework demonstrates improved task completion when robots infer and adapt to human intentions compared to baseline approaches.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
COOPERA works by combining hierarchical LLM prompting with retrieval and reflexion to generate realistic human simulations, then training robot agents to predict intentions from partial observations. The human model captures personality traits (Big-5), intentions, and tasks through iterative refinement, while the robot learns to map visual observations to these latent variables using fine-tuned classifiers. This creates a closed-loop system where the robot can reason about preferences and provide personalized assistance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Human Simulation Pipeline**: LLM-driven generation of personality, intentions, and tasks using hierarchical prompting and memory retrieval - needed to create diverse, realistic human behaviors for training and evaluation.
- **Big-5 Personality Traits**: Standardized psychological framework for characterizing human personality - needed to provide structured, quantifiable traits for personalization.
- **Reflexion Mechanism**: LLM-based self-correction through reflection on past generations - needed to improve the coherence and realism of generated human behaviors.
- **SMPL-X Retargeting**: Converting 3D human motion data to avatar skeletons - needed to animate simulated humans in the Habitat 3.0 environment.
- **Predicate-based Success Metrics**: Evaluating task completion using semantic predicates - needed to provide interpretable, human-understandable success criteria.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Human Profile (SPC + Big-5) -> Intention Generation (Llama-3.1-8B + Retrieval + Reflexion) -> Task Generation -> Motion Retargeting (Motion-X/AMASS) -> Human Simulation -> Robot Observation (Video) -> Intention/Task Prediction (Llama-3.2-11B + Mistral-7B) -> Action Selection

### Critical Path
Observation -> Prediction -> Action -> Feedback -> Update Model

### Design Tradeoffs
- **LLM Size vs. Speed**: Larger models (Llama-3.1-8B) generate more realistic behaviors but increase computation time.
- **Fine-tuning vs. Zero-shot**: Fine-tuning Mistral-7B classifiers improves performance but requires training data and adaptation time.
- **Scene Complexity vs. Generalization**: More complex scenes improve realism but may reduce generalization to new environments.

### Failure Signatures
- **Hallucinated Interactions**: LLM proposes tasks involving objects not present in the room - check "Reflect 3D Info" logs.
- **Semantic Drift**: Simulated humans deviate from their Big-5 profile over time - monitor cosine similarity between generated intentions and profile embedding.
- **Motion Artifacts**: Retargeted motion doesn't match intended actions - validate motion retargeting pipeline.

### Exactly 3 First Experiments
1. **Single Human, Single Scene**: Run Human Simulation to generate training data for one profile in one scene, then train and evaluate robot agent.
2. **Same Human, Diff Scene**: Evaluate robot's ability to generalize across different scenes with the same human profile.
3. **Diff Human, Same Scene**: Evaluate robot's ability to adapt to different human profiles in the same scene.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can assistive agents be developed to perform proactive assistance, such as arranging the environment before the day starts based on inferred long-term preferences?
- How does the presence of multiple humans with conflicting traits and intentions impact the robot's ability to personalize assistance?
- How can the performance gap in generalizing to new humans be closed without relying solely on extensive re-training?

## Limitations
- Framework currently focuses on single-human settings, leaving multi-human collaboration for future work.
- Performance gap in generalizing to new humans (34.3% success) compared to scene generalization (46.5%).
- Realism of simulated humans validated against LLM-based metrics rather than real human data.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Overall framework design and technical implementation details are well-specified and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence**: Simulation pipeline's ability to generate realistic human behaviors is plausible but needs empirical validation.
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability of simulated humans to real-world behaviors is uncertain without validation on real human-robot interaction datasets.

## Next Checks
1. Verify exact positive/negative sample ratios used to train Mistral-7B binary classifiers.
2. Implement and test motion retargeting from Motion-X (SMPL-X) to Habitat 3.0 avatars.
3. Conduct small-scale pilot study with real human participants to compare behaviors with simulated humans.
