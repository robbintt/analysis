# MemoryBench: A Benchmark for Memory and Continual Learning in LLM Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17281
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17281
- Reference count: 40
- Evaluates LLM continual learning from user feedback across 11 datasets spanning 3 domains, 4 task formats, and 2 languages

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MemoryBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the continual learning capabilities of large language models through accumulated user feedback during service time. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on static tasks with long context, MemoryBench tests whether LLMs can effectively learn from diverse feedback signals including verbose explanations, action-based revisions, and implicit behavioral cues. The benchmark reveals significant gaps in current memory systems' ability to distinguish and utilize procedural knowledge from feedback, with naive retrieval-augmented generation baselines often matching or exceeding specialized memory architectures like A-Mem, Mem0, and MemoryOS.

## Method Summary
MemoryBench evaluates continual learning through two experimental settings: off-policy (pre-generated dialogues loaded into memory, then tested) and on-policy (real-time interaction with simulated user feedback). The benchmark uses Qwen3-8B as the default backbone and Qwen3-32B as the user simulator, with feedback collected over three dialogue turns. Eleven datasets spanning open, academic, and legal domains are tested with four task formats (LiSo, SiLo, LiLo, SiSo) in English and Chinese. Evaluation uses dataset-specific metrics combined with LLM-as-judge scoring, with final aggregation via min-max normalization or Z-score. The benchmark specifically tests explicit feedback (verbose/action-based) and implicit signals through text revision scenarios.

## Key Results
- Naive RAG baselines often match or exceed specialized memory systems (A-Mem, Mem0, MemoryOS) across diverse task formats
- Memory systems struggle to effectively utilize procedural knowledge from feedback, treating it instead as declarative context
- Mem0 exhibits pathological slowdown during scaling, with time per memory entry exceeding 20 minutes in later stages
- Performance gaps are consistent across LiSo, SiLo, LiLo, and SiSo task formats, indicating limited generalizability of current approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MemoryBench works by creating a controlled environment where LLMs must learn from simulated user feedback rather than static training data. The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its realistic feedback simulation across multiple domains and formats, combined with clear metrics that differentiate procedural from declarative knowledge utilization. By testing both explicit feedback types (verbose explanations, action-based revisions) and implicit signals (text revisions), the benchmark captures the full spectrum of user interaction patterns that would occur in real deployment scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Continual Learning**: The ability to incrementally acquire new knowledge from ongoing interactions without catastrophic forgetting - needed because static benchmarks cannot capture real-world LLM deployment where user feedback drives improvement.
- **Procedural vs Declarative Memory**: Procedural memory represents learned procedures and skills, while declarative memory stores facts and events - critical distinction since feedback typically contains procedural knowledge about task execution.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: RAG systems retrieve relevant context from memory to augment generation, serving as a baseline for comparing specialized memory architectures.
- **User Feedback Simulation**: LLM-as-user paradigm generates realistic interaction patterns, necessary for benchmarking without expensive human-in-the-loop collection.
- **Task Format Heterogeneity**: Different input/output length combinations (LiSo, SiLo, LiLo, SiSo) test whether memory systems generalize across diverse problem structures.
- **Cross-Domain Evaluation**: Testing across open, academic, and legal domains ensures that memory systems can handle domain-specific procedural knowledge.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Qwen3-8B backbone -> Memory Systems (Vanilla, RAG variants, A-Mem, Mem0, MemoryOS) -> Feedback Simulation (Qwen3-32B user simulator) -> Evaluation Pipeline
- **Critical Path**: Feedback generation -> Memory consolidation -> Retrieval and context augmentation -> Task-specific evaluation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Specialized memory systems vs. simple RAG baselines; computational efficiency vs. learning effectiveness; real vs. simulated user feedback
- **Failure Signatures**: Pathological latency increases in Mem0; inability to distinguish procedural from declarative knowledge; poor cross-format generalization
- **First Experiments**: 1) Run RAG baseline on Locomo dataset to establish performance floor, 2) Test Mem0 on small corpus to verify pathological slowdown pattern, 3) Compare explicit vs implicit feedback effectiveness on DialSim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How can LLM system architectures be modified to effectively distinguish and utilize procedural memory (user feedback) rather than treating it solely as declarative context?
2. How can memory construction and retrieval algorithms be optimized to avoid pathological latency increases during scaling?
3. Can a unified memory architecture generalize effectively across heterogeneous task formats without manual tailoring?

## Limitations
- Reliance on LLM-as-user simulation may not capture full complexity of human interaction patterns
- Simulated feedback collection is computationally expensive and may not reflect real-world conditions
- Benchmark aggregation methodology may mask dataset-specific variations in difficulty
- Fixed three-turn dialogue limit may not capture full spectrum of learning signals

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Naive RAG baselines matching or exceeding specialized memory systems
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim of "significant gaps" in continual learning capabilities
- **Low Confidence**: Meaningful testing of cross-domain generalization across heterogeneous datasets

## Next Checks
1. Replace LLM-as-user simulation with real human feedback collection on a subset of datasets to validate simulation accuracy
2. Systematically evaluate impact of different backbone models and user simulators on benchmark performance
3. Extend benchmark to include multi-session evaluation over extended periods to assess true continual learning capabilities
