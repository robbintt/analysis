# A Matter of Time: Revealing the Structure of Time in Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.19559
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19559
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Temporal information in VLMs is encoded in a low-dimensional, non-linear manifold; timeline approaches achieve 0.77-0.84 TAI scores with >100x speedup over baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) encode temporal information by introducing TIME10k, a benchmark dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth spanning 1700-2024. The authors evaluate 37 state-of-the-art VLMs and discover that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear manifold in the embedding space, contrasting with the linear subspaces found in language models. Based on this insight, they propose timeline extraction methods using Bézier curves and dimensionality reduction (KPCA) to create efficient temporal representations. Their approach achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to prompt-based baselines while being computationally efficient, reducing inference time from over 5000ms to 11ms.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce TIME10k, a dataset of 10,091 images across six categories (Aircraft, Cars, Instruments, Mobile phones, Ships, Weapons) with temporal ground truth spanning 1700-2024. They evaluate VLMs using a time probing baseline that compares image embeddings to text embeddings of years via dot-product similarity. To capture the non-linear manifold structure, they apply KPCA dimensionality reduction (optimal at S=13 dimensions) and fit Bézier curves through projected text embeddings to create a continuous timeline. Image embeddings are then projected onto this curve to predict temporal placement. The methodology includes TPE-optimized UMAP as an alternative dimensionality reduction approach.

## Key Results
- Temporal information in VLMs forms a low-dimensional, non-linear manifold in the embedding space
- Bézier curve timeline approaches achieve TAI scores of 0.77 (CLIP) and 0.84 (EVA-CLIP)
- Timeline methods reduce inference time from over 5000ms to 11ms while maintaining competitive accuracy
- KPCA dimensionality reduction consistently improves temporal prediction accuracy across all tested VLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Temporal information in VLMs is encoded in a low-dimensional, non-linear manifold
- **Mechanism**: During pre-training, VLMs align image-text pairs where text implicitly contains temporal metadata. This alignment maps chronological progression onto a curved geometry in the high-dimensional embedding space, which KPCA preserves.
- **Core assumption**: Training data contains sufficient implicit temporal signals to form a coherent structure rather than random noise.
- **Evidence anchors**: [Abstract] Temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear manifold; [Section 6.2] contrasts with linear subspaces in language models.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: A continuous "timeline" can be synthesized by fitting a Bézier curve to text-prompt embeddings
- **Mechanism**: By prompting the text encoder with years, anchor points are generated in the embedding space. Fitting a Bézier curve through these points creates a continuous geometric representation of time, allowing efficient projection of images.
- **Core assumption**: The semantic progression of "time" in the embedding space is smooth enough to be approximated by a parametric curve.
- **Evidence anchors**: [Section 3.3.2] Bézier curve approach provides structured representation; [Section 6.3] shows MAE stabilizes around 13 dimensions.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Dimensionality reduction (KPCA) removes noise and enforces global structure
- **Mechanism**: Raw embeddings contain irrelevant features. KPCA projects embeddings into a subspace where primary variance corresponds to the temporal manifold, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for temporal attributes.
- **Core assumption**: "Noise" dimensions are separable from "temporal" dimensions in the high-dimensional space.
- **Evidence anchors**: [Section 5.3] KPCA preserves global structure; [Section 6.3] dimensionality reduction consistently improves Bézier approach.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning & Shared Embedding Spaces**
  - **Why needed here**: The methodology relies on aligned image-text spaces where dot products represent similarity.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain why a dot-product similarity is used to compare an image embedding $I$ and a text embedding $T_y$ in Equation 1?

- **Concept: Manifold Hypothesis & Non-linear Dimensionality Reduction**
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding why linear projections would fail to capture the curved "timeline" structure.
  - **Quick check question**: Why might a linear projection (like standard PCA) fail to separate chronological order if the "timeline" is curved in the original high-dimensional space?

- **Concept: Bézier Curves & Control Points**
  - **Why needed here**: The solution models time as a continuous curve with control points influencing its shape.
  - **Quick check question**: In the context of the "Timeline" model, what happens to the predicted year of an image if its projection falls between two control points on the curve?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Query Image + Pre-defined Year Range → VLM Encoders → KPCA Projection → Timeline Model (Bézier Curve) → Year Prediction

- **Critical path**: Offline: Generate text embeddings for all years → Fit KPCA → Fit Bézier Curve. Online: Encode single image → Apply pre-computed KPCA transform → Calculate distance to curve.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Accuracy vs. Granularity: K=200 control points balance smoothing vs. fitting rapid temporal shifts
  - Efficiency vs. Linearity: Time Probing is O(N) in years; Bézier is O(1) relative to year range
  - KPCA vs. UMAP: KPCA preserves global structure; UMAP preserves local topology

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Inverted Timeline: Spearman correlation $\rho \approx -1$ (reverse ordering)
  - High MAE on older classes: Instruments/Weapons have high error (data coverage limits)
  - Prompt Sensitivity: Minimalist prompts fail (need descriptive templates)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Sanity Check**: Run Time Probing on small TIME10k subset using CLIP; verify top-ranked year within ±10 years.
  2. **Structure Visualization**: Generate text embeddings for 1700-2024, apply KPCA(3), plot in 3D to confirm curve structure.
  3. **Efficiency Validation**: Implement Bézier Timeline on Cars class; compare MAE and inference time against Time Probing baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can the approach of modeling temporal information as a non-linear manifold generalize effectively to other ordinal problems within vision-language models?
  - **Basis**: Authors conclude by asking about generalization to other ordinal problems.
  - **Unresolved**: Study focused exclusively on temporal data; other ordered concepts were not investigated.
  - **Resolution evidence**: Replicating methodology on datasets with non-temporal ordinal attributes.

- **Open Question 2**: Do generative VLMs encode temporal information in the same non-linear, low-dimensional manifold structure as contrastive models?
  - **Basis**: Authors state evaluation should extend to generative VLMs.
  - **Unresolved**: Experiments restricted to discriminative models; generative architectures not analyzed.
  - **Resolution evidence**: Applying timeline extraction to latent spaces of generative models.

- **Open Question 3**: How does the temporal awareness of VLMs shift when evaluating "soft" human-centric categories compared to the "hard" artifacts in TIME10k?
  - **Basis**: Authors note TIME10k should be extended with human-centric aspects like clothing.
  - **Unresolved**: Current dataset focuses on manufactured objects with precise dates; unclear if models can handle continuous evolution of human-centric artifacts.
  - **Resolution evidence**: Curating dataset extensions for categories like clothing and comparing performance against rigid object classes.

## Limitations

- Dataset construction methodology for TIME10k lacks detailed documentation on class balance and temporal distribution, which could bias observed manifold structure.
- Paper doesn't extensively explore alternative dimensionality reduction techniques beyond KPCA and UMAP, leaving open questions about whether non-linearity is specific to temporal features.
- Temporal manifold assumption may not generalize to VLMs trained on fundamentally different data distributions; study focuses on CLIP and EVA-CLIP variants.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Bézier timeline approaches achieve competitive accuracy (TAI scores around 0.77-0.84) while reducing inference time from 5000ms to 11ms. This result is directly measurable and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: Temporal information is encoded in a low-dimensional, non-linear manifold distinct from language models. While supported by dimensionality reduction experiments, the paper doesn't provide definitive proof that this structure is unique to temporal features.
- **Low confidence**: This non-linear manifold structure is universal across all VLMs. The paper only validates this on two model variants without exploring the full landscape of VLM architectures.

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture Generalization Test**: Apply the timeline methodology to additional VLM architectures (e.g., BLIP, Flamingo, or open-source alternatives) to verify whether the non-linear manifold structure consistently emerges across different training regimes and data distributions.

2. **Ablation on Dimensionality Reduction**: Systematically compare KPCA with alternative techniques (t-SNE, Isomap, autoencoders) on the same temporal prediction task to determine whether the non-linearity is specific to temporal features or a general property of VLM embeddings that any non-linear reduction would capture.

3. **Temporal Robustness Analysis**: Evaluate the timeline model's performance on synthetic data where temporal metadata is deliberately corrupted or scrambled to determine whether the observed manifold structure is genuinely capturing chronological progression or other correlated features (e.g., technological sophistication, visual complexity).
