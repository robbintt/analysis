# Nested Operator Inference for Adaptive Data-Driven Learning of Reduced-order Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11542
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11542
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Nested OpInf achieves four times smaller error than standard OpInf at comparable offline time, learning stable ROMs for large reduced dimensions through hierarchical operator entry construction.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces nested Operator Inference (OpInf), a method for learning physics-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) that exploits the hierarchical structure within reduced spaces. The approach iteratively constructs initial guesses prioritizing dominant POD modes, leading to provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error compared to standard OpInf. By learning operator entries in a stable, hierarchical order with tailored regularization, nested OpInf addresses the instability issues of standard OpInf for large reduced dimensions. The method can warm-start from previously learned models, enabling dynamic basis and model form updates for adaptive learning scenarios.

## Method Summary
Nested OpInf learns non-intrusive ROMs for quadratic dynamical systems from snapshot data by iteratively expanding the reduced dimension from s=1 to r. At each iteration, it builds a data matrix D_s and time-derivative matrix R_s, then solves a regularized least squares problem to identify operator entries. The key innovation is using previously learned operators as initial guesses (via Equation 9) and optimizing regularization weights for each iteration. The method employs a condensed Kronecker product representation to reduce computational complexity and enables warm-starting from existing models for dynamic updates. Regularization weights are strengthened for less important modes while maintaining accuracy, and the algorithm selects optimal weights via a candidate search over n_ω possibilities.

## Key Results
- Achieved four times smaller error than standard OpInf on a cubic heat conduction problem at comparable offline time
- Learned a ROM for the Greenland ice sheet model with 3% average error and computational speedup factor above 19,000 despite model form approximation errors
- Demonstrated stability advantages for large reduced dimensions through hierarchical operator entry learning
- Proved that nested OpInf achieves smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error compared to standard OpInf at each iteration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Nested OpInf works by exploiting the natural hierarchy in POD modes, where early modes capture the most energetic components of the solution manifold. By learning operator entries in this hierarchical order, the method prioritizes accurate representation of dominant dynamics first, then progressively adds refinement for higher modes. The initial guesses from previous iterations provide excellent starting points for subsequent optimization, reducing the search space and improving convergence. The regularization strategy becomes increasingly strict for less important modes, preventing overfitting while maintaining accuracy in the most critical components. This hierarchical approach stabilizes the learning process compared to standard OpInf, which attempts to learn all operator entries simultaneously without leveraging the intrinsic structure of the reduced space.

## Foundational Learning

POD and Reduced-order Modeling: Dimensionality reduction technique that projects high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace spanned by dominant modes. Why needed: Provides the hierarchical structure that nested OpInf exploits. Quick check: Verify residual energy drops below 0.01% for chosen r.

Operator Inference: Data-driven method for learning ROM operators from snapshot data without requiring full FOM operators. Why needed: Enables non-intrusive ROM learning when FOM operators are unavailable or expensive. Quick check: Confirm least squares problem is well-posed (rank(D_s) = s_tot).

Regularization in Least Squares: Technique to stabilize ill-posed problems by adding penalty terms to the objective function. Why needed: Prevents overfitting and numerical instability in operator identification. Quick check: Monitor condition number of D_s^T D_s + regularization matrix.

Condensed Kronecker Product: Efficient representation of quadratic terms that reduces computational complexity. Why needed: Avoids full Kronecker product explosion for large s. Quick check: Verify C_s correctly maps to condensed representation.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: POD basis V_r -> Snapshot projection P_s -> Data matrix D_s -> Regularized least squares -> Operator identification ĉ_s, Â_s, Ĥ_s -> ROM evaluation

Critical Path: The bottleneck is the regularized least squares solve at each iteration, particularly for large s where D_s becomes rank-deficient. The condensed Kronecker representation and warm-starting from previous iterations help mitigate this.

Design Tradeoffs: Larger r provides better accuracy but increases offline computational cost and risk of ill-conditioning. The choice of regularization weights balances stability against accuracy, with stricter regularization improving stability but potentially degrading ROM performance.

Failure Signatures: Rank-deficient D_s (σ_min(D_s) ≈ 0), divergent ROM trajectories early in the time window, and large residual in least squares indicating poor initial guesses. These manifest as NaNs or exploding trajectories in ROM simulations.

First Experiments:
1. Verify POD reconstruction error vs. reduced dimension r on training snapshots
2. Test nested OpInf on a simple linear system where exact solution is known
3. Compare snapshot reconstruction error δ_s between nested and standard OpInf for increasing s

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

Open Question 1: Can integrating nested OpInf into a greedy snapshot selection algorithm significantly reduce offline computational costs compared to standard training approaches? The paper suggests this as future work but doesn't implement or test the algorithm within an adaptive sampling framework.

Open Question 2: What systematic strategies can be developed for selecting individualized regularization weights for operator entries learned in different iterations? While the paper demonstrates the concept with simple factors, it lacks a theoretical or automated heuristic for determining optimal, entry-specific weights.

Open Question 3: Does the hierarchical benefit of nested OpInf persist when applied to nonlinear solution manifolds? The current theoretical guarantees rely on linear POD mode hierarchies, and it's unclear if this translates to latent spaces of autoencoders or other nonlinear structures.

## Limitations
- Results rely on regularization tuning without comprehensive sensitivity analysis across different problem types
- Method's performance on non-polynomial or highly nonlinear systems remains untested
- Computational scaling with increasing reduced dimension r and number of snapshots K needs further characterization

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Theoretical error reduction properties and iterative learning framework | High |
| Numerical results on cubic heat conduction problem | Medium |
| Greenland ice sheet application results | Medium-Low |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct sensitivity analysis of Greenland ice sheet results to regularization weight choices across a wider grid of values
2. Test performance on a non-polynomial test case (e.g., Burgers' equation with quadratic nonlinearity) to assess model form approximation limits
3. Characterize computational scaling with increasing r and K to confirm claimed stability advantages over standard OpInf for large reduced dimensions
