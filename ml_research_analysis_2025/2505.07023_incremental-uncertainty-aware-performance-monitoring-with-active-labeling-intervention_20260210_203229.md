# Incremental Uncertainty-aware Performance Monitoring with Active Labeling Intervention

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.07023
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07023
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Primary result**: Introduces IUPM, a label-free method for estimating ML model performance under gradual distribution shifts using incremental optimal transport and active labeling interventions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Incremental Uncertainty-aware Performance Monitoring (IUPM), a novel approach for estimating machine learning model performance under gradual distribution shifts without requiring labeled data. IUPM models gradual shifts using incremental optimal transport couplings, propagating labels from the initial distribution to the current timestep to estimate performance metrics. The method introduces an active labeling intervention strategy that queries labels for samples contributing highest uncertainty when a predefined threshold is exceeded. IUPM demonstrates superior performance estimation accuracy compared to existing baselines across synthetic datasets, MNIST with affine transformations, ImageNet-C, and real-world yearbook portrait data.

## Method Summary
IUPM estimates performance changes under gradual shifts by composing incremental optimal transport couplings that link consecutive time steps. At each time step, it computes optimal transport maps between consecutive domains using feature representations (penultimate layer activations for deep models). These maps are composed to propagate labels from the initial distribution, creating an estimated label distribution at the current timestep. The method quantifies uncertainty in performance predictions through the variance in the transported label distribution and uses this uncertainty to guide active labeling interventions when a predefined threshold is exceeded.

## Key Results
- IUPM outperforms existing baselines (ATC, AC, DOC) on gradual shift scenarios with lower mean absolute error in performance estimation
- Uncertainty Intervention (UI) strategy requires 50-60% fewer label queries than random or cross-entropy baselines while maintaining or improving accuracy
- IUPM shows particularly strong results on incremental rotational shifts where non-incremental approaches fail
- The method validates theoretical Lipschitz smoothness assumptions empirically on real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Incremental Optimal Transport for Label Propagation
IUPM estimates performance under gradual shifts by composing incremental optimal transport couplings to propagate labels from the initial distribution to the current timestep. At each time step t, compute γ_t(X_{t-1}|X_t) linking samples from consecutive domains via cost-minimizing couplings. Compose these into an accumulated transition map Ψ_t(X_0|X_t). The estimated label distribution ̂P(Y_t|X_t) is the expectation over Ψ_t of the initial label distribution P(Y_0|X_0). This leverages the gradual nature of shifts—small consecutive changes accumulate into tractable large shifts.

### Mechanism 2: Intrinsic Uncertainty Quantification via Mixture Entanglement
IUPM provides inherent uncertainty estimates because the label propagation produces actual predictive distributions that internalize conflicts from the transport process. The estimate ̂P(Y_t|X_t) is a mixture distribution. When linked source samples have contradicting labels, the resulting mixture exhibits variance. The uncertainty U(L̂_t) is computed as the expected standard deviation of sample-wise loss estimates under this predictive distribution. High uncertainty indicates the transport map links current samples to contradictory source labels.

### Mechanism 3: Uncertainty-Guided Active Labeling Intervention
Targeted labeling of high-uncertainty samples reduces overall estimation error more efficiently than random or loss-based sampling. When uncertainty exceeds threshold (U(L_t) > 0.1), select top-m samples maximizing per-sample uncertainty contribution: arg top-m U[L(f(x_t), Y_t)]. Query labels for these samples and fix their labels in the transition map, eliminating accumulated uncertainty along those transport paths.

## Foundational Learning

- **Optimal Transport / Wasserstein Distance**: Core mathematical machinery for computing couplings between distributions and bounding shift magnitude. *Quick check*: Given two sets of samples, can you explain why the Wasserstein distance captures "how much work" it takes to transform one distribution into another, and why this is better than KL divergence for gradual shifts?

- **Lipschitz Continuity**: Theoretical guarantee relies on Lipschitz smoothness of conditional label distributions—small input changes yield bounded label distribution changes. *Quick check*: If W(P(Y|X=x), P(Y|X=x')) ≤ L·c(x,x'), what does the constant L represent and what happens if L is very large?

- **Active Learning / Importance Sampling for Estimation**: Provides context for understanding why targeted sampling outperforms random sampling and how to evaluate intervention efficiency. *Quick check*: Why might selecting samples based on model uncertainty (entropy) differ from selecting based on estimation uncertainty (variance contribution to a metric)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: OT Coupling Module -> Transition Accumulator -> Performance Estimator -> Uncertainty Quantifier -> Intervention Controller
- **Critical path**: (1) Receive unlabeled batch X_t → (2) Compute γ_t(X_{t-1}|X_t) using feature representations → (3) Update Ψ_t → (4) Estimate performance and uncertainty → (5) If U > 0.1, query labels for top-m uncertain samples and update
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Incremental vs. Direct (NIPM): Incremental handles large cumulative shifts better but requires storing all intermediate couplings; direct matching is simpler but fails when conditional distributions diverge significantly
  - Threshold selection: Lower threshold = more interventions, higher accuracy but more labeling cost. Paper uses 0.1 based on ablation showing diminishing returns below this
  - Feature space for OT: Raw pixels vs. network activations. Paper uses penultimate layer activations—more semantically meaningful but architecture-dependent
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Error accumulation: Linear growth in estimation error per Theorem 1; manifests as systematic bias increasing over time
  - Calibration drift: Uncertainty estimates no longer correlate with actual error; intervention becomes inefficient
  - Coupling degeneracy: OT matches become meaningless (e.g., all mass concentrated on few source points); indicates shift outside assumed gradual regime
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Synthetic validation on 2D toy datasets: Implement IUPM on Moons dataset with rotational shift. Compare against ATC, AC, DOC baselines. Verify that incremental coupling outperforms NIPM as rotation accumulates. Target: MAE < 0.1 at t=100 with 200° rotation.
  2. Ablation on intervention threshold: Test thresholds {0.02, 0.06, 0.10, 0.14, 0.20} on synthetic data. Plot interventions vs. MAE. Confirm 0.1 lies at the knee of the tradeoff curve.
  3. Feature space sensitivity: Compare OT on raw MNIST pixels vs. LeNet layer-2 activations vs. penultimate layer. Measure impact on estimation accuracy under rotation shift. Expect penultimate layer to be most robust.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does IUPM perform relative to baselines when the gradual Lipschitz smoothness assumption is violated, specifically in cases of abrupt or non-sequential distribution shifts? The authors state in the conclusion that IUPM "may not be optimal for other types of distribution shifts" as it is tailored for gradual changes. Behavior under sudden domain jumps is untested.

### Open Question 2
How can the active labeling strategy be adapted to prevent budget exhaustion in scenarios where sample-wise uncertainty remains consistently high over time? The authors note that the Uncertainty Intervention (UI) approach "may require frequent interventions" when uncertainty is high. The current method uses a fixed uncertainty threshold to trigger labeling, which could lead to impractical labeling costs in highly volatile environments.

### Open Question 3
Can the "Gradual Lipschitz Smoothness" assumption be reliably monitored in production using only unlabeled data to detect when IUPM's theoretical guarantees might break? While Theorem 1 relies on this assumption, the empirical validation utilizes ground truth labels to estimate the Lipschitz constants, which are unavailable in a truly label-free deployment.

## Limitations
- Performance degradation when gradual Lipschitz smoothness assumption is violated by abrupt shifts
- Computational overhead from storing incremental optimal transport couplings for long sequences
- Uncertainty quantification may not fully capture epistemic uncertainty in cases of severe label distribution changes

## Confidence
- **High** for incremental optimal transport mechanism (Theorem 1 provides theoretical grounding, synthetic experiments demonstrate superiority over NIPM)
- **Medium** for intrinsic uncertainty quantification (empirical results show better intervention efficiency but limited ablation studies)
- **Medium** for active labeling intervention strategy (clear improvements over baselines but sensitivity to threshold selection not fully explored)

## Next Checks
1. **Extreme Shift Robustness**: Test IUPM on datasets with abrupt shifts (e.g., sudden appearance of new classes) to quantify performance degradation when gradual Lipschitz smoothness is violated.
2. **Computational Scalability Analysis**: Measure runtime and memory requirements as sequence length and feature dimension increase. Compare against linear vs. quadratic scaling expectations for coupling storage.
3. **Uncertainty Calibration Validation**: Conduct systematic experiments to verify that mixture variance in transported distributions correlates with actual estimation error across different shift magnitudes and types.
