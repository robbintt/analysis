# System-Aware Unlearning Algorithms: Use Lesser, Forget Faster

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.06073
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06073
- Authors: Linda Lu; Ayush Sekhari; Karthik Sridharan
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces system-aware unlearning with sublinear memory requirements for linear classification

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a new definition of machine unlearning called system-aware unlearning that provides privacy guarantees against attackers who can only observe the final state of the system after unlearning. This definition is less stringent than traditional unlearning definitions, allowing for more efficient unlearning algorithms with sublinear memory requirements. The authors present an exact system-aware unlearning algorithm for linear classification using selective sampling and generalize this approach to classification with general function classes. The algorithm's memory requirements and deletion capacity are analyzed, with experimental results demonstrating its efficiency compared to other unlearning methods.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces system-aware unlearning as a relaxation of traditional unlearning definitions, where the privacy guarantee is only against an attacker who can observe the system's state after unlearning. For linear classification, the authors propose a selective sampling algorithm that maintains a small subset of training samples (w-representative set) to efficiently perform unlearning. The algorithm computes a weight vector estimate and selectively samples training data based on this estimate, ensuring that the deleted samples can be reconstructed from the remaining data and the weight vector. This approach generalizes to general function classes using concepts from statistical learning theory, specifically the notion of a proper cover that approximates the hypothesis space.

## Key Results
- Proposes system-aware unlearning definition that provides weaker but more practical privacy guarantees than traditional unlearning
- Presents exact unlearning algorithm for linear classification with sublinear memory complexity O(1/ε) in the number of samples
- Demonstrates improved deletion capacity compared to ERM-based unlearning methods, with linear scaling in the size of the w-representative set
- Experimental results show superior performance on small-scale datasets compared to incremental and approximate unlearning methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system-aware unlearning approach works by relaxing the privacy requirement from preventing all information leakage about deleted samples to only preventing an attacker who observes the final system state from inferring information about deleted samples. This relaxation allows the algorithm to maintain only a small subset of representative samples (the w-representative set) that capture the essential information needed for the classifier. By computing a weight vector estimate and selectively sampling based on this estimate, the algorithm ensures that deleted samples can be reconstructed from the remaining data and the weight vector, enabling exact unlearning with sublinear memory.

## Foundational Learning

**System-Aware Privacy Definition**: Why needed - Provides a more practical privacy guarantee that only protects against attackers observing the final system state; Quick check - Compare privacy guarantees against different attacker models

**Proper Cover in Statistical Learning**: Why needed - Enables generalization from linear classification to arbitrary function classes; Quick check - Verify that the cover size is polynomial in relevant parameters

**Selective Sampling for Unlearning**: Why needed - Allows maintaining only a subset of samples while preserving deletion capability; Quick check - Ensure weight vector estimate accuracy for sample selection

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input data -> Weight vector estimation -> Selective sampling -> w-representative set -> Unlearning

Critical path: Sample deletion request → Identify samples in w-representative set → Reconstruct deleted samples using weight vector → Update classifier

Design tradeoffs: Privacy strength vs. memory efficiency (weaker privacy guarantees enable sublinear memory); Deletion speed vs. deletion capacity (larger w-representative sets increase capacity but require more memory)

Failure signatures: High reconstruction error when weight vector estimate is inaccurate; Insufficient deletion capacity when w-representative set is too small

First experiments:
1. Verify sublinear memory scaling with sample size on synthetic linear data
2. Test deletion accuracy as a function of w-representative set size
3. Compare deletion capacity against ERM-based baseline methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Relies on the assumption that an attacker can only observe the final state of the system, which may not hold in all real-world scenarios
- Effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of weight vector estimation and the assumption that the true weight vector is a linear combination of samples
- Experimental validation is limited to a small number of datasets and unlearning methods

## Confidence
High: Theoretical framework and memory complexity analysis
Medium: Practical effectiveness and experimental results
Low: Real-world applicability under different attack models

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithm on larger, more diverse datasets to verify scalability and robustness across different data distributions
2. Implement and test alternative weight vector estimation methods to assess their impact on deletion capacity
3. Conduct experiments under different attack models that relax the system state observability assumption to evaluate practical security guarantees
