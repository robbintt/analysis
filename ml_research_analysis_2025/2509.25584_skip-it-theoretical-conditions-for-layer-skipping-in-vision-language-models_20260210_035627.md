# Skip-It? Theoretical Conditions for Layer Skipping in Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25584
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25584
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Layer skipping is effective when both high redundancy and low cross-attention coincide

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding when layer skipping is beneficial in vision-language models (VLMs). The authors define and analyze four types of redundancy - geometric, proximal, functional, and informational - and prove relationships between them. They show that experimentally-verifiable geometric and proximal redundancy imply the more informative functional and informational redundancy under certain conditions. The key contribution is connecting these theoretical results to practical layer skipping decisions by analyzing hidden representations and cross-attention patterns. Experiments on multiple VLM architectures across diverse datasets show that layers with high redundancy and low cross-attention coincide with those successfully skipped in practice.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a theoretical framework connecting geometric/proximal redundancy to functional/informational redundancy in VLMs. They extract hidden states for vision and text tokens across all layers, compute cosine distances between adjacent layers (geometric redundancy), and calculate the probability that these distances fall below a threshold (proximal redundancy). Cross-attention is measured via the Visual Attention Ratio (VAR). Skip candidates are identified where both redundancy metrics are high AND cross-attention is low. Skipping is implemented via late entry (vision tokens inserted at layer ℓ) or early exit (tokens removed after layer ℓ).

## Key Results
- Layers with high redundancy and low cross-attention coincide with those skipped by popular methods
- Skipping based on these conditions achieves faster inference while preserving performance
- Skipping non-redundant layers leads to performance degradation
- Early vision layers and late text/vision layers consistently show high redundancy across architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Geometric and proximal redundancy are experimentally-verifiable proxies for deeper functional/informational redundancy
- Mechanism: When adjacent hidden states have low cosine distance and high probability of being close, this implies the conditional entropy H(Xℓ|Xℓ-1) is low, meaning one layer can predict the next with minimal information loss
- Core assumption: The conditional expectation function h(x,y) = E[Z|Xℓ=x, Xℓ-1=y] is Lipschitz continuous, and Markov chain structure Xℓ-1 → Xℓ → Z holds
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "layers with large redundancy as predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular layer-skipping methods"
  - [section 3.2]: Theorem 1 establishes E[∥E[Z|Xℓ] − E[Z|Xℓ-1]∥²₂] < 2(α² + β²)ε under Lipschitz assumptions
  - [corpus]: Weak direct validation; related work (AdaSkip, FlexiDepth) uses empirical skipping heuristics but lacks this theoretical grounding
- Break condition: Lipschitz constant becomes large, or hidden state norms vary significantly (unit-norm assumption violated)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Safe layer skipping requires both high redundancy AND low cross-attention
- Mechanism: High redundancy ensures within-modality representations are stable, but if cross-attention is high, vision and text tokens still communicate—removing one modality disrupts this exchange
- Core assumption: Cross-modal interaction is primarily captured by attention weights (specifically VAR metric)
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3]: "for general skipping of layers, both high levels of redundancy and small cross-attention are necessary conditions"
  - [section 4.4, Figure 3]: VAR analysis shows cross-attention concentrates in middle layers (layers 5-25), with early/late layers showing minimal cross-modal interaction
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus validation of the dual-condition requirement
- Break condition: Cross-attention measure fails to capture indirect multi-hop information flow, or redundancy metric misses representational drift in attention pattern space

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Early vision layers and late text/vision layers exhibit consistent redundancy patterns across model architectures and tasks
- Mechanism: Early vision tokens project from pretrained encoders into LLM embedding space with minimal transformation—representations stabilize quickly. Late layers refine outputs already converged toward task predictions
- Core assumption: This pattern generalizes across VLM architectures
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3, Figure 4]: Early layer vision tokens show P[D_V < 0.05] > 0.97 across LLaVA 7B/13B/NeXT; late layers show similar convergence
  - [section 5.1, Table 1]: Skipping layers 0-4 (late entry) maintains accuracy when redundancy is high; skipping layer 4 onwards causes sharp degradation
  - [corpus]: Void in Language Models detects unactivated layers in LLMs, suggesting architectural redundancy extends beyond VLMs
- Break condition: Model architectures with dense early cross-modal fusion (e.g., Flamingo-style interleaved processing) may not exhibit early-layer redundancy

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Conditional entropy H(X|Y) and mutual information I(X;Y)
  - Why needed here: Informational redundancy is defined as H(Xℓ|Xℓ-1) < ε; understanding how entropy quantifies uncertainty reduction between layers is essential for interpreting the theoretical bounds
  - Quick check question: If H(Xℓ|Xℓ-1) = 0.1 and H(Xℓ) = 5.0, what fraction of information in Xℓ is predictable from Xℓ-1?

- Concept: Lipschitz continuity
  - Why needed here: Theorems 1 and 2 require h(x,y) = E[Z|Xℓ=x, Xℓ-1=y] to be α-Lipschitz in one argument—this bounds how much predictions can change given representational drift
  - Quick check question: If h is 2-Lipschitz and ∥x₁ - x₂∥ = 0.05, what's the maximum change in h?

- Concept: Markov chain and data processing inequality
  - Why needed here: Theorem 5 relies on Xℓ-1 → Xℓ → Z forming a Markov chain to connect conditional entropy to functional redundancy via Pinsker's inequality
  - Quick check question: If Y → X → Z is Markov, does I(Y;Z|X) = 0? What does this imply about information flow?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Vision encoder (CLIP/SigLIP) → Projector → LLM backbone with interleaved vision/text tokens → Output head
  - Hidden states H_T (text) and H_V (vision) tracked per layer
  - Cross-attention via VAR metric: ratio of text-to-vision attention weights

- Critical path:
  1. Extract hidden states for all tokens across all layers (requires model hooks)
  2. Compute D_ℓ^(T) and D_ℓ^(V) via Eq. 1 (average cosine distance)
  3. Compute p_ℓ(t; H_T) and p_ℓ(t; H_V) via Eq. 2 (proximal redundancy probability)
  4. Compute VAR per layer (Eq. 3) for cross-attention
  5. Identify skip candidates: layers with both redundancy metrics < threshold AND VAR < threshold

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Threshold selection (t=0.05 in paper): Lower t = stricter redundancy requirement = fewer skip candidates = more conservative
  - Late entry vs. early exit: Late entry requires BOTH conditions; early exit requires only low cross-attention
  - Token-level vs. layer-level: Paper analyzes layer-level; token-level skipping (FastV) is complementary

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy drop > 5%: Skipped layers with high VAR (cross-modal disruption)
  - Accumulated drift across layers: Skipped layers with moderate but not-high redundancy
  - Task-specific degradation: Redundancy patterns vary by task type (Text/Doc VQA more sensitive than General VQA per Table 2)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Figure 4 on your target VLM: Plot D_ℓ^(V) and p_ℓ(0.05; H_V) across layers for a sample dataset. Identify early-layer vision redundancy plateau.
  2. Late entry probe: Insert vision tokens at layer k for k ∈ {0, 4, 8, 12} and measure accuracy on GQA. Confirm k=4 maintains performance when redundancy is high.
  3. Cross-attention correlation: For each layer, compute both redundancy metrics AND VAR. Verify that high-redundancy/low-VAR layers exist and form natural skip candidates.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: Do the observed redundancies arise as artifacts of current vision-language pretraining strategies, or do they serve as an intentional mechanism for multimodal processing?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "A longer term pursuit would perhaps be understanding why these redundancies exist and whether they arise as a drawback of vision-language pretraining strategies, or as an intentional mechanism for multimodal processing."
  - Why unresolved: The framework characterizes when redundancy exists but does not investigate the underlying cause of these patterns across layers.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of VLMs trained with different pretraining objectives; analysis of whether redundancy patterns emerge consistently across training runs or vary with architecture.

- Question: Can the redundancy framework predict or explain instances of VLM hallucination?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "Additionally, it would be interesting to study the factors underlying dramatic instances of VLM hallucination, based on recent observations and datasets in literature (Vo et al., 2025), through the lens of our framework."
  - Why unresolved: Hallucination was mentioned as a future direction but not empirically investigated.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments correlating redundancy/cross-attention patterns with hallucination rates on existing hallucination benchmarks; analysis of whether violated redundancy conditions coincide with hallucinated outputs.

- Question: Can redundancy metrics be computed dynamically per input rather than statically per layer to enable adaptive, input-dependent layer skipping?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The current approach identifies skip-able layers statically based on average redundancy across datasets. The paper notes "the model itself is more important in determining which layers can be dropped relative to the dataset itself," but individual inputs may vary.
  - Why unresolved: The methodology uses averaged metrics (E[ρ(X_ℓ, X_{ℓ-1})], P[ρ < t]) computed over datasets, not per-sample.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of variance in redundancy metrics across individual samples; implementation of dynamic skipping based on per-input redundancy with comparison to static approaches.

## Limitations

- Theoretical Generalization Limits: The framework assumes i.i.d. samples and unit-norm hidden states, which may not hold in practical VLMs with varying token distributions and hidden state magnitudes
- Metric Implementation Ambiguity: The Visual Attention Ratio (VAR) metric lacks complete specification, particularly regarding "head-wise sum" aggregation details
- Task and Architecture Specificity: Results primarily demonstrate on transformer-based autoregressive VLMs; applicability to architectures with different cross-modal fusion strategies remains untested

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The empirical observation that high-redundancy, low-cross-attention layers coincide with practical layer-skipping candidates across multiple VLM architectures
- Medium Confidence: The claim that early vision and late text/vision layers consistently exhibit high redundancy across tasks and architectures
- Low Confidence: The theoretical implication that experimental geometric and proximal redundancy metrics reliably predict deeper functional and informational redundancy in all practical scenarios

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Architecture Pattern Verification**: Apply the redundancy analysis framework to architectures with fundamentally different cross-modal fusion strategies (e.g., Flamingo, Mini-Gemini) and compare whether early/late layer redundancy patterns persist or transform

2. **Metric Robustness Testing**: Systematically vary the cosine distance threshold t in proximal redundancy computation (t=0.05 in paper) and measure how skip-candidate identification changes. Determine sensitivity of the framework to this hyperparameter across different VLM families

3. **Conditional Entropy Validation**: Directly estimate H(Xℓ|Xℓ-1) for early vision layers where high proximal redundancy is claimed, using entropy estimation techniques on actual hidden state distributions. Compare against the theoretical bounds to verify the gap between geometric/proximal metrics and true informational redundancy
