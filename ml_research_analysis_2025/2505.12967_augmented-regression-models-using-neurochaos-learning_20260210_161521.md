# Augmented Regression Models using Neurochaos Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.12967
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12967
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Primary result**: Chaotic feature augmentation (Tracemean) improves regression performance, especially with Lasso and SVR

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel regression augmentation approach that integrates chaotic neural features—specifically the Tracemean (mean of neural traces from the Neurochaos Learning framework)—with traditional regression models including Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and SVR. The method enhances predictive performance by augmenting the original feature set with Tracemean values. Evaluated on ten real-life datasets and synthetic data, the approach demonstrates significant improvements, with the highest average gain (11.35%) achieved by Augmented Chaotic Ridge Regression. The study reveals that chaotic-inspired features can substantially improve regression accuracy and computational efficiency, though it acknowledges the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning as a limitation.

## Method Summary
The approach begins by normalizing features via Min-Max scaling to the [0,1] range. For each normalized feature, a Skew Tent Map neuron (skew=0.499) is iterated starting from initial neural activity q, continuing until the trajectory enters an ε-neighborhood of the target value. The Tracemean (arithmetic mean of the chaotic neural trace) is computed for each feature. These Tracemean features are then concatenated with the original features, creating a 2n-dimensional feature space. Traditional regression algorithms (LR, Ridge, Lasso, SVR) are trained on this augmented feature set with hyperparameters (q: 0.01-0.99, ε: 0.01-0.45, plus model-specific parameters) tuned using 5-fold cross-validation.

## Key Results
- Augmented Lasso Regression and Augmented SVR showed improved predictive accuracy on 6 out of 10 real-life datasets
- Augmented Chaotic Ridge Regression achieved the highest average performance gain of 11.35%
- Mean Squared Error of augmented models consistently decreased and converged toward Minimum Mean Squared Error as sample size increased in synthetic experiments
- Six datasets demonstrated significant improvements while four showed no benefit, indicating augmentation effectiveness is dataset-dependent

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Chaotic transformation via skew tent maps generates Tracemean features that encode non-linear representations complementary to original features
- Mechanism: Each normalized input feature drives a skew tent map neuron that produces a chaotic trajectory terminating when entering an ε-neighborhood of the target value. The Tracemean captures dynamics dependent on both target proximity and initial neural activity
- Core assumption: Chaotic dynamics create meaningful non-linear embeddings preserving task-relevant information not captured by linear transformations
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states Tracemean "significantly enhances regression performance"; Section 3 details skew tent map iteration; limited corpus evidence on chaos-based feature engineering

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Feature augmentation preserves interpretable linear relationships while adding non-linear modeling capacity
- Mechanism: Original n features are retained while n Tracemean features are appended, creating 2n features. Regression coefficients can independently weight original vs. chaotic features
- Core assumption: Original and Tracemean features contain complementary information; multicollinearity is manageable via regularization
- Evidence anchors: Abstract notes Tracemean features "are integrated with traditional regression algorithms"; Section 3 states both original and transformed features are used; corpus evidence shows feature scaling interacts with regularization

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Regularized models selectively suppress unhelpful augmented features while preserving beneficial ones
- Mechanism: Lasso's L1 penalty can zero out noisy Tracemean features; Ridge's L2 penalty shrinks all coefficients; SVR's ε-insensitive loss controls sensitivity to augmented feature contributions
- Core assumption: Hyperparameter search includes configurations where useful chaotic features are retained and noisy ones are suppressed
- Evidence anchors: Abstract highlights improvements in Augmented Lasso Regression and Augmented SVR; Section 4.1 shows ACLS and ACSVR improve 6/10 datasets; corpus evidence discusses automatic relevance determination for Lasso

## Foundational Learning

- **Skew Tent Map Dynamics**
  - Why needed here: Core transformation relies on iterating this chaotic map; understanding bifurcation behavior and sensitivity to initial conditions is essential
  - Quick check question: Given input z ∈ [0,1] and skew s=0.499, what happens to the trajectory when q is near 0.01 vs. near 0.99?

- **Regularization Paths in Linear Models**
  - Why needed here: Paper relies on Ridge/Lasso to manage doubled feature space; understanding how α controls coefficient shrinkage helps interpret augmentation effectiveness
  - Quick check question: As α increases in Lasso, what happens to coefficients of features with low correlation to the target?

- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff with Feature Augmentation**
  - Why needed here: Adding 2× features reduces bias but increases variance; regularization mitigates variance; MSE→MMSE convergence reflects this tradeoff
  - Quick check question: In synthetic experiments, why does MSE converge to MMSE only at n=1000 and not at n=10 or n=50?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Raw Data → Min-Max Normalization → [z_1,...,z_n] → Neurochaos Layer (n skew tent neurons) → Tracemean Extraction → [t_1,...,t_n] → Augmentation → [z_1,...,z_n, t_1,...,t_n] (2n features) → Regression Layer → Prediction ŷ

- **Critical path**:
  1. Normalization MUST map to [0,1]—skew tent map domain is bounded
  2. q and ε are tuned jointly via 5-fold CV before model training
  3. Tracemean computation requires storing full trajectory; trace length varies with (q, ε, z_i)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Fixed skew=0.499: Near-maximum chaos but numerically sensitive; alternative skews not explored
  - Tracemean only: Paper mentions other NL features (firing time, energy, entropy) but uses only Tracemean to reduce computation
  - Grid search granularity: q steps of 0.01, ε steps of 0.01—coarse grids may miss optima

- **Failure signatures**:
  - ACLR improves only 4/10 datasets (lowest) → linear regression lacks mechanism to suppress noisy augmented features
  - Wine Quality required α=0.0001 (vs. 0.1 default) → standard hyperparameter ranges fail on some datasets
  - Bodyfat: Training R²=0.969, Testing R²=0.749 (ACRR) → potential overfitting on augmented features despite regularization
  - 4/10 datasets show no improvement across all augmented models → augmentation is not universally applicable

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline establishment**: Run standard LR, Ridge, Lasso, SVR on target dataset; record R², MSE, MAE using 80/20 train-test split with 5-fold CV for hyperparameters
  2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: For one dataset (e.g., Fish), visualize Tracemean values across q ∈ {0.01, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.99} and ε ∈ {0.01, 0.15, 0.30, 0.45} to understand parameter effects
  3. **Ablation study**: Compare (a) original features only, (b) Tracemean only, (c) augmented (original + Tracemean) using the same regression algorithm to isolate augmentation contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Would incorporating additional chaotic features (firing time, firing rate, energy, entropy) alongside Tracemean further improve regression performance?
- Can parameter-free Neurochaos Learning or automated hyperparameter optimization reduce tuning burden while maintaining performance?
- What dataset characteristics predict whether Tracemean augmentation will improve versus degrade regression accuracy?
- How does Tracemean augmentation perform on complex non-linear synthetic data beyond simple linear relationships?

## Limitations
- Performance improvements are inconsistent across datasets (4-6/10 show gains), suggesting augmentation is not universally beneficial
- The paper does not specify iteration limits for the chaotic map, raising concerns about computational stability and reproducibility
- Chaotic feature generation mechanism lacks established theoretical grounding in the regression literature

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Implementation methodology (min-max normalization, 5-fold CV, standard regression algorithms) is clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical results showing performance gains on specific datasets are verifiable, but generalizability across domains remains uncertain
- **Low confidence**: Theoretical justification for why chaotic augmentation improves regression performance lacks rigorous statistical or information-theoretic support

## Next Checks
1. **Convergence diagnostics**: Implement max iteration limits (e.g., 10,000) for the Skew Tent Map and analyze whether non-convergence affects performance on datasets showing poor results
2. **Feature correlation analysis**: Measure correlation between original features and their Tracemean counterparts across datasets to quantify redundancy and assess multicollinearity risks
3. **Ablation on synthetic data**: Systematically vary the underlying data-generating process (pure linear, linear + noise, non-linear) to determine which data characteristics make augmentation most effective
