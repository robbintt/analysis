# ArtNet: Hierarchical Clustering-Based Artificial Netlist Generator for ML and DTCO Application

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.13582
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13582
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** ArtNet improves CNN-based DRV prediction F1 score by 0.16 through data augmentation and achieves up to 97.94% PPA match with 95.53% runtime reduction for DTCO mini-brains.

## Executive Summary
ArtNet addresses the shortage of diverse training data for ML and Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) by generating realistic artificial netlists that accurately replicate topological characteristics and logical hierarchies. Unlike prior random generators, ArtNet uses hierarchical clustering guided by Rent's Rule to produce netlists with realistic wireload distributions and timing characteristics. The generator supports both user-specified parameters and extraction from real designs, producing "mini-brains" that match full-scale PPA metrics while enabling rapid design space exploration.

## Method Summary
ArtNet employs a hierarchical bottom-up clustering approach where instances are merged based on Rent's Rule constraints to ensure realistic terminal counts scale with block size. The method includes flip-flop insertion during net generation to enforce logic depth constraints and maintain sequential ratios. For DTCO applications, ArtNet generates scaled-down "mini-brains" that preserve relative structural parameters, enabling rapid BEOL parameter exploration with minimal runtime overhead. The system outputs Verilog netlists that can be validated through physical design tools.

## Key Results
- ML data augmentation with ArtNet improves CNN-based DRV prediction F1 score by 0.16 over real data alone
- Mini-brain approach achieves up to 97.94% PPA match to full-scale designs with 95.53% runtime reduction
- ArtNet outperforms prior methods in parameter space coverage, convergence, and runtime efficiency
- Generated netlists demonstrate realistic timing behavior with controlled Worst Negative Slack and Total Negative Slack distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Rent's Rule-Guided Hierarchical Clustering
ArtNet uses bottom-up agglomerative clustering where instances/clusters merge based on combining constraints derived from Rent's rule (T = kB^p). This ensures terminal counts scale statistically similar to real designs, preventing artifacts of prior random generators. The approach replicates realistic wireload distributions that are critical for PPA metrics.

### Mechanism 2: Logic Depth Preservation via Flip-Flop Insertion
During net generation, ArtNet sorts nets by logic depth and inserts flip-flops when connecting outputs to inputs would violate max depth constraints. This breaks long combinational paths and aligns sequential ratio with target parameters, ensuring feasible timing closure during generation rather than post-hoc.

### Mechanism 3: Statistical Proxying (Mini-Brains)
ArtNet generates scaled-down netlists that preserve relative structural parameters at 10% of design size. By maintaining Rent's exponent and sequential ratio, mini-brains achieve high rank correlation for PPA outcomes across BEOL configurations, enabling rapid exploration without full P&R runtime.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Rent's Rule (T = kB^p)**
  - Why needed here: This is the mathematical objective function for the clustering algorithm that ensures realistic terminal-to-block size relationships
  - Quick check question: Does a higher Rent's exponent (p) imply more or less interconnect complexity? (Answer: More)

- **Concept: Sequential Ratio (S_ratio) vs. Logic Depth**
  - Why needed here: These are the two conflicting constraints ArtNet must balance - S_ratio dictates design skeleton while logic depth dictates path stretch
  - Quick check question: If ArtNet inserts a flip-flop to fix a logic depth violation, does the S_ratio increase or decrease? (Answer: It increases)

- **Concept: Timing Closure (WNS/TNS)**
  - Why needed here: To evaluate quality of generated netlists through Worst Negative Slack and Total Negative Slack measurements
  - Quick check question: Why is a negative WNS problematic for a design? (Answer: It means the signal arrives later than required time, causing setup violation)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** SpecFile Generator -> Q_size (Priority Queue) -> Hierarchical Clustering -> Net Generator -> Q_seq (Sequential Queue) -> Flip-Flop Insertion -> PI/PO Matching
- **Critical path:** The Hierarchical Clustering (Algorithm 2) step. If merging logic is flawed here, resulting tree will have poor locality and subsequent net generation will create disorganized "sea of gates"
- **Design tradeoffs:** Prioritizes logic depth over sequential ratio when conflicting; trades absolute accuracy for speed in mini-brain approach (95% runtime reduction); flattened netlists generate faster but lose timing/locality benefits
- **Failure signatures:** Floating pins (if PI/PO matching skipped), combinational loops (if logic depth constraints disabled), high MAPE in Rent's analysis (if clustering constraints too loose)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Convergence Loop: Generate netlist from params → extract params → feed back in, check parameter stabilization; 2) PPA Proxy Validation: Run P&R on mini-brain and full-scale counterpart, plot Power/Effective Clock Period; 3) ML Data Augmentation: Train CNN on real vs. Real+ArtNet data, measure F1 score delta

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What are the theoretical limits on realizable combinations of input parameters for hierarchical clustering-based netlist generators?
- **Basis in paper:** Section IV-B explicitly states authors "do not provide any theoretical analysis" to answer "fundamental question" of which parameter combinations should be realizable
- **Why unresolved:** Paper relies on empirical assessment rather than deriving theoretical model predicting feasibility of parameter sets
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Formal analysis or mathematical constraints model defining feasible region of parameter space, mapping dependencies between connectivity, logic depth, and sequential ratios

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can ArtNet be extended to generate functionally valid netlists rather than topologically realistic ones?
- **Basis in paper:** Paper validates based on PPA metrics, Rent's rule, and cell distribution without verifying logical equivalence or functional correctness
- **Why unresolved:** Current methodology relies on statistical matching of topological features without semantic analysis of logic being constructed
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstration of generated netlists passing logical equivalence checks or functional simulation testbenches against target design specification

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does strict prioritization of logic depth constraints over sequential ratio matching limit accuracy for designs with specific pipeline structures?
- **Basis in paper:** Section III-B states "in case of conflict... ArtNet gives higher priority to logic depth range," potentially skewing S_ratio
- **Why unresolved:** Unclear if heuristic causes significant drift in sequential ratio for high-performance designs with strict pipeline stages
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation study comparing S_ratio matching accuracy when logic depth constraints are relaxed versus enforced for highly pipelined designs

## Limitations

- Theoretical analysis of feasible parameter space combinations is lacking, relying instead on empirical convergence testing
- Cell type distribution optimization method and exact hyperparameter values (G_avg, σ_G, σ_T, σ_p, α) remain underspecified
- Strict prioritization of logic depth over sequential ratio may limit accuracy for highly pipelined designs with strict pipeline stages

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** ML data augmentation results (+0.16 F1 improvement) and DTCO mini-brain PPA matching (≤2.06% MAPE) are well-supported with experimental validation
- **Medium confidence:** Hierarchical clustering effectiveness relies on Rent's rule assumptions that may not hold for highly irregular designs
- **Low confidence:** Runtime efficiency claims versus prior methods lack detailed comparison methodology

## Next Checks

1. **Parameter convergence validation:** Generate netlist from extracted parameters, re-extract and compare. Verify convergence within 50 iterations to 1% tolerance.

2. **Timing feasibility stress test:** Generate netlists with extreme S_ratio and D_max combinations. Measure WNS/TNS distributions to confirm timing closure without post-hoc fixes.

3. **Rent's rule sensitivity analysis:** Vary σ_T and σ_p values systematically. Plot resulting p and S_ratio distributions to identify robustness boundaries of clustering constraints.
