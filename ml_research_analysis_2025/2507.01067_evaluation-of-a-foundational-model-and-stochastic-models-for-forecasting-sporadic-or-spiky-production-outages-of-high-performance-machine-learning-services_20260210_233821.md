# Evaluation of a Foundational Model and Stochastic Models for Forecasting Sporadic or Spiky Production Outages of High-Performance Machine Learning Services

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.01067
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01067
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Foundational model (TimesFM) outperforms classical stochastic models on average for forecasting sporadic ML service outages, with accuracy varying by root cause type.

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates the performance of a foundational time series forecasting model (TimesFM) against classical stochastic models for predicting sporadic or spiky production outages in large-scale machine learning services. Using seven years of historical outage data broken down by eight root cause types, the study compares model accuracy using normalized MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics. The results show that while TimesFM performs best overall, model effectiveness varies significantly by root cause type, with neither model type nor lookback parameter consistently optimal. Fine-tuning TimesFM provides marginal gains. The study demonstrates that foundational models can accurately estimate year-end outage statistics with less than 6% error, highlighting their potential for software reliability modeling in agile environments.

## Method Summary
The study compares a foundational model (TimesFM) against classical stochastic baselines (PV, MA, AR) for univariate time series forecasting of monthly production outages. The evaluation uses 7 years of proprietary incident data, aggregated monthly and split into 1 year for training/validation and 6 years for testing. The analysis covers 8 root cause types plus total outages. Models are evaluated using normalized MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics, with lookback windows ranging from 1 to 12 months. Input data undergoes log1p transformation, and outputs are inverse transformed with 0-floor clamping to handle negative predictions.

## Key Results
- TimesFM achieves the lowest average normalized error across all root cause types
- Model effectiveness varies significantly by root cause type, with neither model type nor lookback parameter consistently optimal
- Fine-tuning TimesFM provides only marginal improvements in accuracy
- Foundational models can estimate year-end outage statistics with less than 6% error

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that foundational models like TimesFM can capture complex patterns in sporadic outage data that traditional statistical models miss, particularly for smooth decline patterns. However, the effectiveness depends heavily on the specific characteristics of each root cause type, suggesting that different outage patterns may require different modeling approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time Series Normalization:** Why needed - to handle varying scales across different root cause types; Quick check - verify all series are divided by their sum before modeling
- **Log1p Transformation:** Why needed - to stabilize variance in sporadic data with many zeros; Quick check - ensure transformation is applied to inputs and inverse transformation with 0-floor to outputs
- **Lookback Window Optimization:** Why needed - different outage patterns require different historical context; Quick check - sweep lookback values from 1-12 months for each model type

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Data -> Preprocessing (log1p) -> TimesFM/StatModels -> Postprocessing (expm1 + 0-floor) -> Evaluation

**Critical Path:** Data aggregation → Normalization → Model prediction → Inverse transformation → Error calculation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Foundational models offer better overall accuracy but require more computational resources; traditional models are simpler but may miss complex patterns

**Failure Signatures:** Negative predictions indicate missing 0-floor clamping; over-smoothing suggests lookback window too long; poor spike detection indicates need for different model type

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement baseline PV, MA, and AR models with rolling window prediction
2. Load TimesFM and verify input/output transformations work correctly
3. Compare normalized errors across different lookback windows for a single root cause type

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1:** How can the optimal forecasting model type be automatically selected for a specific production outage dataset?
- Basis: Conclusion states results "suggest future research directions: auto-selecting an optimal model type given a target dataset"
- Why unresolved: No single model consistently outperformed others across all eight root cause types
- Resolution: A meta-learning framework that predicts best-performing model based on preliminary statistical analysis

**Open Question 2:** How can lookback parameter and associated settings be dynamically tuned to maximize accuracy for sporadic outage data?
- Basis: Conclusion explicitly calls for research into "auto-tuning the lag and other associated parameter values"
- Why unresolved: Optimal lookback window varied significantly depending on root cause type and time period
- Resolution: Algorithm that adjusts lag parameters in real-time based on evolving variance and spikiness

**Open Question 3:** Can specific time-series patterns be mapped to optimal forecasting approaches a priori?
- Basis: Paper identifies which patterns are well-tracked by which models but doesn't establish predictive rules
- Why unresolved: Knowledge of model suitability is applied post-hoc rather than predicted beforehand
- Resolution: Quantifiable heuristics derived from data shape that reliably trigger model class selection

## Limitations
- Proprietary dataset limits reproducibility and generalizability to other domains
- Study focuses on a single large-scale ML service, which may not represent smaller services
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters are not fully specified, making precise reproduction difficult

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Comparative methodology between TimesFM and classical models is sound; normalized error metrics provide robust comparison basis
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim about <6% year-end estimation error is specific to the normalization approach and aggregate metrics used
- **Low Confidence:** Assertion that neither model type nor lookback is consistently optimal requires external validation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate study using public incident datasets (power outages or IT service management data) to test generalizability
2. Document and test exact fine-tuning hyperparameters used for TimesFM to assess marginal gains
3. Conduct deeper error distribution analysis (quantile regression, prediction intervals) for high-spike vs low-spike months
