# RED-DiffEq: Regularization by denoising diffusion models for solving inverse PDE problems with application to full waveform inversion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21659
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21659
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Diffusion models integrated as regularization for PDE inverse problems show superior accuracy and robustness in full waveform inversion

## Executive Summary
This work introduces RED-DiffEq, a framework that integrates diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for PDE-governed inverse problems. By leveraging pretrained diffusion models, RED-DiffEq effectively addresses the challenges of nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to noise in such problems. The method was applied to full waveform inversion (FWI) in geophysics, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional regularization techniques (Tikhonov and total variation) and existing diffusion-based approaches. RED-DiffEq achieved enhanced accuracy, robustness to noise and missing data, and strong generalization to complex velocity models not seen during training. The framework is general and can be adapted to diverse PDE-governed inverse problems, offering a promising direction for combining data-driven deep learning with physics-based inversion.

## Method Summary
RED-DiffEq integrates pretrained diffusion models as a regularization term within the iterative optimization process for solving PDE-governed inverse problems. The framework combines the physics-based objective (e.g., data misfit) with a diffusion model-based prior that guides the solution toward geologically plausible and data-consistent results. During each iteration, the diffusion model samples from the learned distribution of realistic velocity models, effectively regularizing the inversion process. The method leverages the denoising capabilities of diffusion models to handle noise and missing data, while the iterative nature ensures consistency with observed data. The approach is demonstrated on full waveform inversion, where it outperforms traditional regularization techniques and existing diffusion-based methods in accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

## Key Results
- RED-DiffEq achieves superior accuracy in full waveform inversion compared to Tikhonov and total variation regularization
- The method demonstrates robustness to noise and missing data, maintaining performance under adverse conditions
- RED-DiffEq generalizes effectively to complex velocity models not seen during training, outperforming existing diffusion-based approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RED-DiffEq leverages the generative capabilities of pretrained diffusion models to regularize the solution space of inverse PDE problems. By incorporating the diffusion model as a prior, the framework guides the inversion toward solutions that are both data-consistent and geologically realistic. The iterative sampling from the diffusion model ensures that the solution evolves toward the true model while maintaining stability in the presence of noise and missing data. This approach effectively addresses the ill-posedness and nonlinearity inherent in PDE-governed inverse problems, leading to improved accuracy and robustness.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion models**: Generative models that learn to denoise data iteratively; needed for creating realistic priors in inverse problems; quick check: verify model can generate plausible velocity models
- **Full waveform inversion (FWI)**: Geophysical technique for estimating subsurface properties from seismic data; needed as the primary application domain; quick check: confirm FWI objective function is correctly formulated
- **PDE-governed inverse problems**: Problems where the forward model is governed by partial differential equations; needed to understand the mathematical framework; quick check: validate PDE solver accuracy
- **Regularization techniques**: Methods to stabilize ill-posed inverse problems; needed to compare RED-DiffEq against traditional approaches; quick check: ensure Tikhonov and TV regularization are implemented correctly
- **Iterative optimization**: Process of refining solutions through repeated updates; needed to understand the inversion loop; quick check: verify convergence criteria and stability
- **Data consistency**: Ensuring solutions match observed data; needed to validate the physics-based component; quick check: confirm data misfit is minimized appropriately

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Diffusion Model -> Regularization Term -> Iterative Optimization -> FWI Solver

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves sampling from the pretrained diffusion model, computing the regularization term, and updating the velocity model within the iterative optimization loop. The FWI solver ensures data consistency at each step.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice of pretrained diffusion model impacts generalization and computational cost. A larger model may improve accuracy but increase runtime. The balance between regularization strength and data fidelity is crucial for stability.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may arise from mismatched training data in the diffusion model, leading to unrealistic priors. Over-regularization can cause solutions to deviate from observed data, while under-regularization may fail to address ill-posedness.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test RED-DiffEq on a simple synthetic velocity model with known ground truth to validate basic functionality.
2. Compare performance with Tikhonov and total variation regularization on noisy data to assess robustness.
3. Evaluate generalization by applying the method to a complex velocity model not seen during diffusion model training.

## Next Checks
1. **Field data validation**: Apply RED-DiffEq to real seismic field datasets with known ground truth to assess performance under realistic noise, bandwidth, and geological complexity.
2. **Scalability assessment**: Evaluate the computational efficiency and memory requirements of RED-DiffEq for large-scale 3D seismic inversion problems, including runtime comparisons with traditional methods.
3. **Cross-domain generalization**: Test the framework on other PDE-governed inverse problems (e.g., electromagnetic or medical imaging) to confirm its adaptability and robustness outside the FWI domain.
