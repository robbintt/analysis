# Emergency Communication: OTFS-Based Semantic Transmission with Diffusion Noise Suppression

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.07420
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07420
- **Reference count**: 15
- **Primary result**: System achieves 3dB SNR gain over existing methods with PSNR above acceptable thresholds at 650 km/h and 6 dB SNR

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of reliable emergency communication in high-mobility disaster scenarios where traditional systems fail due to complex channel conditions. The proposed solution integrates OTFS modulation, semantic communication, and a diffusion-based denoising module. OTFS modulation effectively handles Doppler shifts and multipath fading by transforming the channel into a sparse delay-Doppler domain, while semantic communication reduces data redundancy by focusing on key information. The diffusion-based denoising module further improves signal recovery by iteratively removing channel noise. Experimental results show that the system achieves at least a 3dB SNR gain over existing methods, with PSNR values above acceptable thresholds even at high speeds (650 km/h) and low SNRs (6 dB), demonstrating robust performance in challenging environments.

## Method Summary
The proposed system combines OTFS modulation with semantic communication and diffusion denoising to enable reliable emergency communication in high-mobility disaster scenarios. OTFS modulation transforms the doubly-dispersive channel into a sparse delay-Doppler domain, effectively handling Doppler shifts and multipath fading. Semantic communication reduces data redundancy by focusing on key information rather than raw data transmission. The diffusion-based denoising module iteratively removes channel noise from received signals, improving signal recovery. This integrated approach addresses the limitations of traditional systems that struggle with high-mobility environments and complex channel conditions.

## Key Results
- System achieves at least 3dB SNR gain over existing methods
- Maintains PSNR values above acceptable thresholds at 650 km/h vehicle speed
- Performs robustly at low SNRs (6 dB) in high-mobility environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from the synergistic integration of three complementary techniques. OTFS modulation converts the time-varying wireless channel into a quasi-static delay-Doppler domain, eliminating the need for complex time-domain equalization and effectively managing Doppler shifts and multipath fading. Semantic communication reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted by extracting and transmitting only the most relevant information, significantly decreasing bandwidth requirements. The diffusion denoising module iteratively refines the received signal by modeling and removing channel noise, improving the quality of the recovered information. This combination addresses both the physical layer challenges (channel conditions) and the application layer requirements (information relevance) simultaneously.

## Foundational Learning
- **OTFS Modulation**: Needed to handle high-mobility environments with severe Doppler shifts; quick check: transforms time-varying channels into sparse delay-Doppler domain
- **Semantic Communication**: Required to reduce data redundancy and improve transmission efficiency; quick check: focuses on key information rather than raw data
- **Diffusion Denoising**: Essential for improving signal recovery in noisy channels; quick check: iteratively removes channel noise through progressive refinement
- **Delay-Doppler Domain**: Critical for representing high-mobility channel characteristics; quick check: sparse representation simplifies signal processing
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Important metric for evaluating image/signal quality; quick check: higher values indicate better reconstruction quality

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: OTFS Modulation -> Semantic Encoder -> Channel -> Diffusion Denoiser -> Semantic Decoder
- **Critical Path**: Signal generation → OTFS modulation → transmission → diffusion denoising → semantic decoding → information extraction
- **Design Tradeoffs**: OTFS provides better mobility handling but increases computational complexity; semantic communication reduces bandwidth but requires sophisticated encoding/decoding; diffusion denoising improves quality but adds latency
- **Failure Signatures**: High error rates indicate OTFS demodulation issues; poor semantic reconstruction suggests encoding/decoding problems; persistent noise indicates diffusion module inefficiency
- **First 3 Experiments**: 1) Baseline performance comparison without diffusion module, 2) OTFS-only performance at varying speeds, 3) Semantic communication efficiency analysis with different information importance weights

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Practical feasibility of implementing the system in real-world emergency scenarios remains unverified
- Performance relies on specific channel conditions (high mobility, multipath fading) limiting generalizability
- Computational complexity of diffusion denoising module may impact latency in time-critical communications

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: OTFS modulation for handling Doppler shifts and multipath fading is well-established in literature
- **Medium Confidence**: Semantic communication framework's ability to reduce data redundancy and improve efficiency is plausible but requires further validation
- **Low Confidence**: Claimed 3dB SNR gain and robustness at 650 km/h and 6 dB SNR are simulation-based and need empirical verification

## Next Checks
1. **Field Testing**: Conduct real-world experiments in high-mobility disaster scenarios to validate system performance under actual channel conditions and assess robustness
2. **Scalability Analysis**: Evaluate computational complexity of diffusion denoising module and its impact on latency, particularly in resource-constrained emergency communication systems
3. **Generalizability Assessment**: Test system performance across diverse disaster environments (urban, rural, underwater) to ensure adaptability to varying conditions
