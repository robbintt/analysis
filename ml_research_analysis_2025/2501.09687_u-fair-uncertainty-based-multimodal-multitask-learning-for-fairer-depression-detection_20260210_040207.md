# U-Fair: Uncertainty-based Multimodal Multitask Learning for Fairer Depression Detection

## Quick Facts

- Key outcome: U-Fair improves fairness-accuracy Pareto frontier in multimodal depression detection by gender-specific uncertainty reweighting across PHQ-8 subitem tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness in depression detection using multitask learning (MTL). The authors propose U-Fair, a gender-based task-reweighting method that uses uncertainty to improve fairness. The method treats each PHQ-8 subitem as a separate task and reweights losses based on gender-specific uncertainty. Results show that while standard MTL improves performance over unitask approaches, it can also introduce negative transfer and reduce the fairness-accuracy Pareto frontier. U-Fair mitigates these issues by incorporating gender-based uncertainty reweighting, improving both fairness and performance. The approach aligns with empirical findings on PHQ-8 subitem discrimination capacity, providing the first evidence linking ML results with large-scale population studies.

## Method Summary
U-Fair treats depression detection as an 8-task MTL problem where each PHQ-8 subitem is predicted separately (scores 0-3), then summed and thresholded at ≥10 for binary classification. The multimodal architecture uses audio, visual, and text features processed through modality-specific CONV-BiLSTM-FC streams, fused via attention. Task losses are weighted by gender-specific uncertainty parameters σs_t, where loss for gender s and task t is (1/σs_t)²·Ls_t + log σs_t. This reweighting implicitly balances learning across genders while aligning with clinical findings on subitem discrimination capacity.

## Key Results
- U-Fair achieves superior fairness-accuracy Pareto frontiers compared to vanilla MTL and baseline uncertainty weighting (UW)
- Gender-specific uncertainty reweighting reduces statistical parity and equalized odds gaps to near 1.0 (0.80-1.20 bounds)
- Learned uncertainty weights (1/σ²) correlate with PHQ-8 subitem discrimination capacity from large-scale clinical studies
- Negative transfer occurs in vanilla MTL on harder datasets, where adding tasks degrades performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Gender-Specific Uncertainty Reweighting
Conditioning task loss weights on demographic group-specific uncertainty may improve fairness-accuracy tradeoffs compared to global uncertainty weighting. Each gender group s ∈ {male, female} learns separate uncertainty parameters σs_t per task. The loss L_U-Fair = (1/|S|) Σ_s Σ_t [1/(σs_t)² · Ls_t + log σs_t] upweights harder tasks per gender while the log term prevents collapse. This implicitly balances learning across groups without explicit fairness constraints. Core assumption: Aleatoric uncertainty differs by gender across PHQ-8 subitems, reflecting differential symptom manifestation. Break condition: If uncertainty distributions do not differ by gender, or if one gender's tasks dominate learning despite reweighting, fairness gains may not materialize.

### Mechanism 2: PHQ-8 Subitem Decomposition as Multitask Signal
Treating PHQ-8 subitems as separate tasks provides richer supervision than predicting only the binary depression outcome. Rather than directly predicting depressed/non-depressed, the model predicts each of 8 subitem scores (0–3), summed post-hoc and thresholded at ≥10. This aligns with clinical protocol and enables task-specific uncertainty estimation. Core assumption: Subitem tasks share representations useful for the final classification while exhibiting heterogeneous difficulty. Break condition: If subitem tasks are insufficiently correlated with the latent depression construct, or if noise dominates signal in specific subitems, negative transfer may occur.

### Mechanism 3: Task Difficulty Corresponds to Discrimination Capacity
Learned uncertainty weights (1/σ²) correlate with item-level discrimination capacity identified in large-scale psychiatric studies. The inverse uncertainty 1/σ²_t serves as a proxy for task difficulty. The authors observe that PHQ-1, 2, 6 (high discrimination in de la Torre et al., 2023) have higher 1/σ², while PHQ-3, 5 (low discrimination) have lower 1/σ², suggesting the model discovers clinically meaningful difficulty structure. Core assumption: Aleatoric uncertainty captures the same construct as item discrimination capacity measured in population studies. Break condition: If dataset-specific label noise or annotation artifacts drive uncertainty rather than intrinsic item properties, the correspondence may not generalize.

## Foundational Learning

### Aleatoric vs. Epistemic Uncertainty
Why needed here: U-Fair relies on aleatoric uncertainty (inherent data noise) as task-difficulty signals. Epistemic uncertainty (model ignorance) is not addressed but is relevant for understanding method limits. Quick check question: If you doubled the dataset size, which uncertainty type should decrease? (Answer: epistemic; aleatoric is data-inherent.)

### Negative Transfer in Multitask Learning
Why needed here: The paper documents negative transfer (MTL underperforming unitask) on E-DAIC. Understanding when shared representations harm rather than help is critical for diagnosis. Quick check question: If adding a new task degrades performance on an existing task, what is this phenomenon called? (Answer: negative transfer.)

### Group Fairness Metrics (Statistical Parity, Equal Opportunity, Equalized Odds)
Why needed here: Evaluation uses these metrics; understanding their differences (what they condition on) is essential for interpreting results and tradeoffs. Quick check question: Which metric requires equal TPR across groups but ignores FPR? (Answer: Equal Opportunity.)

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Input modalities (audio, text, visual) → CONV-1D/2D → BiLSTM → FC → Attentional fusion → 8 parallel task heads (4-class softmax each) → Per-gender uncertainty-weighted loss → Sum predictions → Threshold at 10 for binary outcome.

### Critical path
Feature extraction → attentional fusion → 8 task heads → per-gender uncertainty-weighted loss → sum predictions → threshold at 10 for binary outcome.

### Design tradeoffs
Late fusion preserves modality-specific representations but may miss cross-modal interactions earlier. Soft labels (Gaussian-based) provide richer supervision than hard labels but introduce hyperparameter choices. Gender-specific reweighting improves fairness but requires gender labels at train time and assumes binary gender categories.

### Failure signatures
Negative transfer: On harder datasets (e.g., E-DAIC), vanilla MTL underperforms unitask—look for accuracy drops when adding tasks. Fairness-accuracy collapse: If baseline UW improves accuracy but fairness metrics exceed 1.20/under 0.80, the tradeoff has not been addressed. Uncertainty collapse: If σs_t converges to similar values across genders, the reweighting provides no differentiation.

### First 3 experiments
1. Replicate unitask vs. vanilla MTL vs. baseline UW vs. U-Fair on DAIC-WOZ with provided splits; verify accuracy and MSP/MEOpp/MEOdd trends match Table 2.
2. Ablate gender conditioning: compare U-Fair (gender-specific σs_t) against global σ_t (baseline UW) to isolate fairness contribution.
3. Analyze learned σs_t per gender and task; compare ordering of 1/σ² with Table 5 discrimination capacity to confirm mechanism alignment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the U-Fair method effectively mitigate bias when applied to other sensitive attributes (e.g., race, age) or their intersectionality?
- Does framing the PHQ-8 subitem prediction as an ordinal regression problem improve the fairness-accuracy Pareto frontier compared to the current multi-class classification approach?
- Do the gender-based uncertainty weights derived by U-Fair remain consistent or require recalibration when applied to datasets collected from different cultural backgrounds?

## Limitations
- Method assumes binary gender categories, limiting generalizability to non-binary populations
- Correlation between learned uncertainty weights and clinical discrimination capacity demonstrated only on single dataset
- Exact feature extraction methods and dimensions for multimodal inputs are unspecified

## Confidence

### High confidence
That standard MTL can induce negative transfer on harder depression detection datasets, and that uncertainty-based weighting can improve performance over unitask.

### Medium confidence
That gender-specific uncertainty reweighting improves fairness-accuracy tradeoffs, given the observed MSP/MEOpp/MEOdd improvements, though the effect size and generalizability are uncertain.

### Low confidence
That the correspondence between learned uncertainty weights (1/σ²) and PHQ-8 subitem discrimination capacity provides "tangible evidence linking ML findings with large-scale empirical population studies," as this is demonstrated on a single dataset with a specific clinical measure.

## Next Checks
1. **Mechanism ablation**: Replicate U-Fair on DAIC-WOZ, then ablate gender conditioning by replacing gender-specific σs_t with global σ_t. Measure change in fairness metrics (MSP, MEOpp, MEOdd) to isolate the contribution of gender-specific reweighting.
2. **Cross-dataset uncertainty consistency**: Train U-Fair on DAIC-WOZ, extract 1/σ² values per task, and compare the ordering to de la Torre et al. (2023) discrimination scores. Repeat on E-DAIC to test if the correlation holds across datasets.
3. **Alternative fairness constraints**: Replace uncertainty-based reweighting with explicit fairness regularization (e.g., adversarial debiasing or fairness constraints on logits) to test if similar fairness gains can be achieved without gender-specific uncertainty modeling.
