- Students valued reduced cognitive load from debugging, enabling deeper focus on NLP concepts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces "Vibe Coding," a pedagogical framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as coding assistants while maintaining focus on conceptual understanding in NLP education. Implemented in a senior-level undergraduate course with 19 students, the approach used LLMs for code generation alongside mandatory prompt logging and reflection-based assessment. Results showed high student satisfaction (mean scores 4.4-4.6/5.0) across engagement, conceptual learning, and assessment fairness. Students valued reduced cognitive load from debugging, enabling deeper focus on NLP concepts. Challenges included time constraints, LLM output verification difficulties, and need for clearer task specifications. The framework successfully shifted assessment focus from code quality to conceptual mastery, preparing students for AI-augmented professional practice while teaching critical evaluation of AI-generated solutions.

## Method Summary
The study implemented Vibe Coding in a 12-week NLP course with 19 senior undergraduate students. The framework used three components: sanctioned LLM use for code generation, mandatory prompt logging in lab notebooks, and reflection-based assessment via Google Forms. Labs covered tokenization, POS/NER, text classification, n-grams, word embeddings, transformer fine-tuning, and in-context learning. Grading allocated 20% to code functionality, 30% to prompt log quality, and 50% to critical reflection. Student satisfaction was measured through end-of-course questionnaires covering course experience, Vibe Coding process, assessment structure, and open-ended feedback.

## Key Results
- High student satisfaction: mean scores 4.4-4.6/5.0 across engagement, conceptual learning, and assessment fairness
- 100% response rate on end-of-course questionnaire
- Students valued reduced cognitive load from debugging, enabling deeper focus on NLP concepts
- Framework successfully shifted assessment focus from code quality to conceptual mastery
- Students recognized prompt engineering as a transferable skill for professional contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cognitive Load Redistribution
Offloading syntax/implementation to LLMs may free cognitive capacity for conceptual processing, based on student self-reports. LLMs handle low-level implementation details (syntax, debugging), potentially enabling students to direct attention toward high-level NLP concept understanding rather than debugging loops. Core assumption: Reduced syntax-related load genuinely transfers to conceptual processing rather than reduced overall engagement; students possess sufficient foundational knowledge to interpret LLM outputs meaningfully.

### Mechanism 2: Assessment-Driven Attention Reallocation
Shifting grading weights from code artifacts to conceptual reflection redirects student effort toward understanding. Grading allocation (50% reflection, 30% prompt logs, 20% code functionality) creates explicit incentives for deep conceptual engagement over syntactic correctness. Core assumption: Assessment structure effectively drives student behavior; reflection questions are well-designed to probe genuine understanding.

### Mechanism 3: Metacognitive Scaffolding Through Documentation
Mandatory prompt logging may make AI interaction visible and reflectable, encouraging strategic use. Requiring documentation of prompts, responses, and modifications creates accountability and forces metacognitive engagement with the prompting process. Core assumption: Documentation prompts genuine reflection rather than mechanical compliance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Critical evaluation of AI-generated outputs**: Why needed? Students need foundational knowledge to evaluate LLM outputs, yet that knowledge traditionally comes through implementation practice. Quick check: Given an LLM-generated NLP pipeline, can you identify potential errors or suboptimal choices before running it?
- **Prompt engineering fundamentals**: Why needed? Effective LLM communication directly affects output quality and learning value; students recognized this as a transferable skill. Quick check: Can you write a constrained prompt that specifies task, constraints, expected output format, and verification criteria?
- **NLP conceptual foundations independent of implementation**: Why needed? Students must understand underlying principles (tokenization, embeddings, transformer architectures) to verify outputs and engage with reflection questions meaningfully. Quick check: Can you explain why a transformer-based approach is appropriate for a specific NLP task without referencing code?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Lecture (2h) -> Lab practice (2h) -> Prompt log documentation -> Critical reflection -> Code output verification
- **Critical path**: Lecture establishes conceptual foundation → Lab provides structured implementation tasks with LLM assistance → Students document all AI interactions in prompt logs → Students complete reflection questions requiring conceptual explanation → Assessment evaluates depth of understanding, not code elegance
- **Design tradeoffs**: Time pressure (mean time-sufficiency rating was 3.53/5.0); verification vs. scaffolding (bootstrapping problem); programming skill transfer (de-emphasizing code style may reduce traditional programming skill development)
- **Failure signatures**: Labs feel rushed despite LLM assistance (verification/documentation overhead); students struggle with domain-specific LLM limitations; LLM outputs require significant correction time; reflection responses may themselves be LLM-assisted
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Pilot single lab topic with verification checkpoints; measure time allocation and student confidence at each stage. 2) Test staged approach: traditional implementation for fundamentals (Labs 1-2), then transition to LLM-assisted work (Labs 3-7). 3) Implement peer review protocol where students compare multiple LLM-generated solutions to identical problems and critique differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does Vibe Coding result in comparable or superior conceptual retention compared to traditional coding instruction? Basis: Section 6.2 calls for "rigorous comparative studies between Vibe Coding and traditional approaches" to establish causal evidence. Why unresolved: This study lacked a control group and relied on student self-reports rather than comparative performance data. Evidence needed: Randomized controlled trial using validated concept inventories to measure transfer learning on novel problems for both groups.

### Open Question 2
Does offloading implementation to LLMs objectively reduce cognitive load, or does it simply shift the burden to output verification? Basis: Section 6.2 questions whether "reduced syntax-related load genuinely frees cognitive capacity for conceptual processing." Why unresolved: The study relied on qualitative student feedback rather than employing validated cognitive load measurement instruments. Evidence needed: Eye-tracking data or standardized cognitive load questionnaires (e.g., Paas scale) administered during lab sessions.

### Open Question 3
What pedagogical scaffolds best resolve the "bootstrapping problem" where students must verify LLM outputs without prior foundational knowledge? Basis: Section 5.2 identifies the "central tension" and Section 6.2 requests "verification pedagogy." Why unresolved: The paper identifies verification as the "most significant remaining challenge" but only suggests potential solutions without testing their efficacy. Evidence needed: Comparative study of specific interventions (e.g., graduated scaffolding vs. peer review) measuring student error-detection rates on buggy LLM code.

## Limitations
- Single-course, single-institution context with 19 students limits generalizability
- Absence of validated cognitive load measurements relies on self-reports rather than objective data
- Potential for students to use LLMs to generate reflection responses threatens assessment validity

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Student satisfaction metrics (M=4.4-4.6/5.0), framework implementation details, and practical challenges identification.

**Medium confidence**: Claims about cognitive load redistribution and metacognitive scaffolding through prompt logging based on self-reports.

**Low confidence**: Assertion that framework "successfully shifted assessment focus" requires more direct evidence of conceptual understanding gains beyond satisfaction scores.

## Next Checks

1. **Validate cognitive load mechanisms**: Implement validated cognitive load measurement instruments (e.g., Paas and van Merriënboer's scale) across multiple courses to test whether LLM assistance genuinely redistributes rather than reduces cognitive engagement.

2. **Test bootstrapping problem resolution**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing LLM-assisted learning outcomes for students with varying levels of prerequisite knowledge, measuring both immediate performance and retention of conceptual understanding.

3. **Establish assessment integrity**: Develop and validate methods to detect AI-generated reflection responses, such as requiring specific references to prompt logs or implementing oral defense components for key assignments.
