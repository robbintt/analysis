# SciArena: An Open Evaluation Platform for Foundation Models in Scientific Literature Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.01001
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01001
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Open platform using expert voting to rank foundation models on scientific literature tasks, with top models achieving 65.1% accuracy on automated evaluation

## Executive Summary
SciArena introduces an open evaluation platform for foundation models on scientific literature tasks, leveraging community voting to rank model performance on open-ended, citation-attributed responses. The platform collects over 20,000 votes from domain experts, enabling a leaderboard ranking based on Elo scores. Key models such as o3, Claude-4.1-Opus, and GPT-5 lead in performance, with variations across scientific disciplines. To assess model-based evaluators, SciArena-Eval—a benchmark using preference data—is introduced. Experiments show even top models like o3 achieve only 65.1% accuracy, underscoring the difficulty of automated evaluation in scientific literature tasks. The findings highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods and the value of expert-driven, real-time assessment in advancing AI for scientific literature synthesis.

## Method Summary
SciArena implements a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline where user queries are decomposed, scientific literature is retrieved via Semantic Scholar API, and two models generate citation-attributed responses. Expert users vote on pairwise comparisons (A/B/Tie), with Bradley-Terry modeling converting these into Elo ratings. A postprocessing step normalizes citation formats to reduce stylistic bias. The platform also introduces SciArena-Eval, a benchmark using 2,000 human preference pairs to evaluate how well model-based judges align with expert judgments.

## Key Results
- Expert voting yields high inter-annotator agreement (weighted Cohen's κ=0.76) compared to general tasks
- Top models (o3, Claude-4.1-Opus, GPT-5) achieve highest Elo scores, with domain-specific variations
- Model-based evaluators (LLM-as-Judge) achieve only 65.1% accuracy on SciArena-Eval, significantly below human expert performance
- Citation attribution accuracy is higher when responses support cited claims versus introducing unsupported citations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bradley-Terry model estimation produces more stable Elo rankings than online Elo for pairwise model comparisons
- Mechanism: Fits logistic regression to all pairwise comparison outcomes simultaneously (rather than sequential updates), estimating strength vector β that minimizes cross-entropy loss; bootstrapping with 100 resamples yields confidence intervals
- Core assumption: Comparison outcomes follow a consistent probabilistic relationship with latent model strength; ties can be handled by splitting evenly between outcomes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section 3.3 details the BT formulation: "ˆβ= arg min_{β∈R^M} (1/n) Σ CE(σ(X_i^T β), Y_i)"
  - [section] Table 2 shows confidence intervals and rankings across 37+ models
  - [corpus] Chatbot Arena paper (cited [14]) validates this approach for general-purpose tasks; SciArena adapts it for scientific domain
- Break condition: If user preferences become highly inconsistent over time or if a small subset of models dominates comparisons, variance estimates may become unreliable

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-stage retrieval + postprocessing reduces stylistic bias in preference data
- Mechanism: (1) Query decomposition via LLM, (2) abstract + snippet search over 100M+ papers via Semantic Scholar, (3) cross-encoder reranking to top-30 passages, (4) response postprocessing to remove markdown/unify citation style
- Core assumption: Users evaluate content quality rather than formatting; expert annotators can identify substantive differences in scientific accuracy
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section 3.1: "retrieves up to 40 paper snippets from full-text and 20 abstracts... reranked using a state-of-the-art re-ranker"
  - [section] Section 5.2: Response length coefficient (γ=0.141) is lower than Chatbot Arena (γ=0.25), suggesting reduced length bias
  - [corpus] Related work (ScholarQA [69]) validates similar retrieval pipelines for scientific synthesis
- Break condition: If postprocessing fails to normalize formats (e.g., models introduce novel formatting), residual stylistic bias may persist

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Model-based evaluators (LLM-as-Judge) struggle to replicate human expert preferences on scientific literature tasks
- Mechanism: SciArena-Eval benchmark tests pairwise evaluators by comparing their judgments against 2,000 human preference pairs; accuracy measured against ground truth
- Core assumption: Human expert preferences represent ground truth for response quality; evaluator models can access same context as humans
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Table 3: "Even the best-performing model, o3, achieves only 65.1% accuracy"
  - [section] Section 6.2: Reasoning-augmented models (o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1) outperform non-reasoning counterparts by 0.7-2.9%
  - [corpus] AlpacaEval [38], WildChat [86] show >70% correlation on general tasks—gap highlights domain-specific difficulty
- Break condition: If evaluator models are trained on SciArena data or similar scientific preference data, benchmark validity degrades

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Bradley-Terry paired comparison model**
  - Why needed here: Core statistical framework for converting pairwise votes into ordinal rankings with confidence intervals
  - Quick check question: Given 3 models (A, B, C) where A beats B 60%, B beats C 70%, what win probability does BT predict for A vs C?

- Concept: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for scientific literature**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how retrieved context feeds into response generation and citation attribution
  - Quick check question: Why might snippet-level search outperform abstract-only search for methodology questions?

- Concept: **Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) metrics**
  - Why needed here: Validating that expert preferences are consistent enough to serve as ground truth
  - Quick check question: If weighted Cohen's κ = 0.76 across annotators, what does this imply about subjectivity in scientific evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input Layer: User query → moderation → query decomposition
  Retrieval Layer: Semantic Scholar API → abstract search (100M papers) + snippet search (11.7M papers) → cross-encoder reranker → top-30 passages
  Generation Layer: Two randomly sampled models → citation-attributed responses → postprocessing (format normalization)
  Evaluation Layer: User vote (A/B/Tie/Both Bad) → Bradley-Terry fitting → Elo leaderboard
  Meta-evaluation: SciArena-Eval benchmark (2,000 preference pairs) → evaluator model accuracy

- Critical path:
  1. Query validation (content moderation via omni-moderation-latest)
  2. Retrieval quality (top-30 passages must be relevant; otherwise responses degrade)
  3. Response generation (citation format consistency)
  4. Vote collection (anomaly detection filters low-quality users)
  5. Elo estimation (BT model fitting + bootstrap CI)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Open vs. proprietary models**: Including 47 models increases diversity but raises API cost/latency
  - **Expert vs. crowd annotators**: Experts (102 researchers with ≥2 publications) yield higher IAA (κ=0.76) but limit scale
  - **Tie handling**: Duplicating ties and splitting (50% A wins, 50% B wins) enables BT model use but may introduce noise

- Failure signatures:
  - Low self-consistency (>10% flip rate on re-evaluation) → annotator confusion or ambiguous prompts
  - High citation count correlation with wins (γ>0.15) → users biasing toward citation-rich responses regardless of quality
  - Evaluator accuracy near 50% → evaluator model failing to discriminate; may need reasoning-augmented approach

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Citation attribution analysis**: Sample 100 responses, manually verify whether inline citations support claims; compare with automated o4-mini classification
  2. **Domain-specific Elo breakdown**: For a target model, compute Elo separately across 4 disciplines (Natural Science, Healthcare, Humanities, Engineering) to identify strength/weakness patterns
  3. **Evaluator ablation**: Test whether removing retrieved context from evaluator input degrades SciArena-Eval accuracy, isolating whether evaluators rely on context vs. response text alone

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can model-based evaluators be improved to surpass the 65.1% accuracy ceiling observed in frontier models on the SciArena-Eval benchmark?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6.2 reports that even top models like o3 struggle to align with human preferences, which the authors state "emphasize the need for more reliable automated evaluation methods."
- Why unresolved: Current LLM-as-a-judge methods fail to capture the nuance required for scientific reasoning and citation verification.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new evaluation protocol demonstrating statistically significant improvement over the 65.1% baseline on the released SciArena-Eval dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models be optimized to prioritize citation attribution correctness over mere citation volume?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.2 notes that while general search users prefer more citations regardless of quality, SciArena experts prefer citations that are relevant and correctly attributed.
- Why unresolved: Models may be incentivized to maximize citation count as a proxy for thoroughness, leading to the inclusion of irrelevant or contradicting references.
- What evidence would resolve it: A model fine-tuned to penalize "irrelevant or contradicting" citations achieving a higher Bradley-Terry coefficient for attribution quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific training interventions are required to mitigate the "conflict with cited papers" failure mode identified in scientific synthesis tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5.3 categorizes failure modes, including models generating claims that are unsupported by or conflict with the provided literature.
- Why unresolved: Models often rely on parametric knowledge rather than grounding their responses strictly in the retrieved context provided by the pipeline.
- What evidence would resolve it: A reduction in the frequency of "conflict with cited papers" errors in the failure case analysis of a newly trained model.

## Limitations
- Expert-only voting pool (102 researchers) ensures high-quality judgments but limits scale and diversity compared to crowd-based platforms
- 2,000-example SciArena-Eval benchmark may not capture full complexity across all scientific subfields
- Cross-encoder reranker and Semantic Scholar API configurations are not fully specified, affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Bradley-Terry Elo rankings with bootstrap confidence intervals (validated by Chatbot Arena and consistent across 37+ models)
- **Medium Confidence:** Citation attribution accuracy (reliant on automated classification with o4-mini, not human-verified across all responses)
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization of SciArena-Eval to other scientific domains beyond the 2,000 collected examples

## Next Checks

1. **IAA Stability Test:** Collect 200 additional expert votes on a fixed set of 50 model pairs after 6 months to measure temporal consistency of preferences
2. **Evaluator Robustness Test:** Train evaluator models on SciArena-Eval and test on held-out domains (e.g., humanities vs. natural sciences) to assess domain transfer
3. **Retrieval Dependency Test:** Compare Elo rankings with and without retrieved contexts to quantify how much performance depends on retrieval quality vs. model capability
