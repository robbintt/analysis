# Information Seeking for Robust Decision Making under Partial Observability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01531
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01531
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 74% absolute performance gain over prior methods on novel benchmark

## Executive Summary
InfoSeeker introduces a novel approach for decision-making under partial observability by explicitly integrating information seeking to align internal dynamics with environmental dynamics before task planning. The method achieves a 74% absolute performance gain on a new benchmark, demonstrating robust adaptation under uncertainty in both observations and environmental dynamics. It generalizes across different LLMs and established benchmarks, addressing a critical gap in handling uncertain dynamics during decision-making processes.

## Method Summary
InfoSeeker operates by first performing information seeking to understand and align the agent's internal dynamics model with the actual environment dynamics, then proceeding to task planning based on this aligned understanding. This two-phase approach allows the system to handle partial observability and uncertain dynamics more effectively than traditional methods that attempt direct task planning without explicit dynamics alignment. The framework is designed to be LLM-agnostic, enabling application across various language models while maintaining robust performance under uncertainty.

## Key Results
- Achieves 74% absolute performance gain over prior methods
- Demonstrates robust adaptation under uncertainty in observations and environmental dynamics
- Generalizes across different LLMs and established benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
InfoSeeker's success stems from explicitly separating dynamics alignment from task planning, allowing the system to first resolve uncertainty about the environment before making decisions. By treating information seeking as a prerequisite rather than an afterthought, the method creates a more accurate internal model of environmental dynamics, which directly improves downstream planning performance. This approach addresses the fundamental challenge of partial observability by ensuring that decision-making is based on well-aligned internal and external dynamics models.

## Foundational Learning
- **Partial observability**: Decision-making when not all relevant information is available; critical because real-world environments rarely provide complete information
- **Dynamics alignment**: Matching internal models to actual environmental behavior; needed to prevent planning based on incorrect assumptions about how the world works
- **Information seeking**: Active acquisition of missing information; quick check: Can the system identify what information is missing and how to obtain it?
- **Task planning**: Determining sequences of actions to achieve goals; quick check: Does the plan account for identified environmental constraints?
- **LLM generalization**: Applying methods across different language models; quick check: Does performance remain consistent across model variations?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Information Seeking Module -> Dynamics Alignment Module -> Task Planning Module

**Critical Path**
1. Observe environment state
2. Information seeking to identify gaps in dynamics understanding
3. Align internal dynamics model with observed environment
4. Plan tasks based on aligned dynamics
5. Execute planned actions

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Explicit vs. implicit dynamics alignment: Choosing explicit alignment provides better uncertainty handling but increases computational overhead
- Information gathering cost vs. planning accuracy: More information seeking improves plans but may slow response time
- Model complexity vs. generalization: Simpler models generalize better but may miss important dynamics

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance when dynamics change rapidly
- Overfitting to specific environmental patterns
- Excessive computation time during information seeking phase

**First Experiments**
1. Compare performance with and without information seeking phase
2. Test robustness across different levels of partial observability
3. Measure computational overhead versus baseline methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lacks detailed comparison with specific baseline methods
- No real-world deployment validation beyond synthetic benchmarks
- Implementation details and computational overhead not fully specified
- Claims of LLM generalization lack comprehensive empirical evidence

## Confidence

**Major Uncertainties and Limitations**
The reported 74% absolute performance gain, while impressive, lacks critical details about the baseline methods used for comparison and the statistical significance of the results. The paper mentions generalization across LLMs but does not specify which models were tested or how performance varied between them. The claim of "robust adaptation under uncertainty" is supported only by synthetic benchmarks without validation on real-world deployment scenarios. Additionally, the integration mechanism between information seeking and task planning is described conceptually but lacks technical depth regarding implementation details and computational overhead.

**Confidence Labels**
- High confidence: The core contribution of introducing explicit information seeking for dynamics alignment is technically sound and addresses a recognized gap in decision-making under partial observability
- Medium confidence: The benchmark design and evaluation methodology appear reasonable, but insufficient details prevent full verification of the 74% performance claim
- Medium confidence: The generalization claim across LLMs is plausible given the modular design, but empirical evidence is limited

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the information seeking component from the task planning module to quantify its specific contribution to performance gains

2. Test InfoSeeker on real-world robotic or physical systems to validate claims of robust adaptation beyond synthetic benchmarks

3. Compare computational efficiency and inference time against baseline methods to assess practical deployment viability
