# How Well Does Your Tabular Generator Learn the Structure of Tabular Data?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.09453
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09453
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Existing tabular generators struggle to capture causal structures, with significant gaps in structural fidelity across datasets.

## Executive Summary
TabStruct introduces a new evaluation framework for tabular data generators that focuses on structural fidelity—how well synthetic data matches the causal relationships in real data. The framework introduces a fine-grained metric based on conditional independence testing, distinguishing between global and local structure fidelity. It also incorporates conventional metrics like density estimation, downstream utility, and privacy preservation, evaluating eight generator categories across seven datasets with expert-validated causal structures.

## Method Summary
TabStruct evaluates tabular data generators through a comprehensive framework that combines structural fidelity metrics with conventional measures. The core innovation is a conditional independence testing approach that assesses how well synthetic data preserves the causal relationships present in real data. The framework distinguishes between global structure fidelity (overall structural preservation) and local structure fidelity (fine-grained conditional independence relationships). Eight categories of generators are evaluated across seven datasets, with ground truth causal structures validated by domain experts.

## Key Results
- Existing generators show significant gaps in structural fidelity: 74.02% local, 35.39% global independence on classification tasks
- Downstream utility shows weak correlation with global structure fidelity, questioning its sufficiency as a standalone measure
- Simple models like SMOTE and TVAE perform competitively in structural fidelity compared to advanced neural models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TabStruct works by introducing a structured evaluation approach that directly measures structural preservation through conditional independence testing. By distinguishing between global and local structure fidelity, it provides a more nuanced assessment than traditional metrics. The framework's strength lies in its ability to quantify how well generators capture the underlying causal relationships in tabular data, rather than just matching statistical properties.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal structure learning**: Why needed - To establish ground truth for evaluation; Quick check - Verify expert-validated causal graphs against domain knowledge
- **Conditional independence testing**: Why needed - Core mechanism for measuring structural fidelity; Quick check - Test power analysis for different sample sizes
- **Tabular data generation**: Why needed - Context for generator categories being evaluated; Quick check - Review generator architectures and training procedures
- **Downstream task evaluation**: Why needed - To connect structural fidelity with practical utility; Quick check - Validate task performance consistency
- **Privacy preservation metrics**: Why needed - To ensure comprehensive evaluation beyond structure; Quick check - Confirm privacy leakage detection accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Causal structure → Conditional independence tests → Structure fidelity scores → Combined with density/utility/privacy metrics → Generator evaluation
**Critical path**: Expert-validated causal structure → Independence testing → Fidelity calculation → Performance comparison across generators
**Design tradeoffs**: Granular structural assessment vs. computational complexity of independence testing; Expert validation vs. automated causal discovery
**Failure signatures**: Poor performance in conditional independence tests indicates structural mismatch; Weak correlation with downstream utility suggests limited practical value
**First experiments**: 1) Baseline independence testing on synthetic vs real data; 2) Structure fidelity comparison across generator types; 3) Downstream task performance correlation analysis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How to obtain expert-validated causal structures for diverse domains
- Whether improved structure fidelity directly translates to better downstream performance
- Generalizability of findings across different data types and domains

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on expert-validated causal structures which may be subjective or incomplete
- Conditional independence testing accuracy may be affected by high-dimensional data or limited samples
- Evaluation based on seven datasets may not represent all tabular data domains

## Confidence
High confidence: Generators struggle with causal structure preservation, well-supported by empirical results
Medium confidence: Simple models perform competitively in structural fidelity, requires careful interpretation across data types
Medium confidence: Weak correlation between downstream utility and global structure fidelity, broader implications need validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct sensitivity analysis on structural fidelity metrics with variations in expert-validated causal structures
2. Perform ablation study on sample size impact for conditional independence testing accuracy
3. Extend evaluation to more diverse tabular datasets with known structural properties
