# Vision-Based Localization and LLM-based Navigation for Indoor Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08120
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08120
- Authors: Keyan Rahimi; Md. Wasiul Haque; Sagar Dasgupta; Mizanur Rahman
- Reference count: 28
- One-line primary result: Vision-based localization achieves 96% accuracy on indoor waypoints; LLM navigation generates instructions with 75% accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses indoor navigation challenges where GPS is unavailable by combining vision-based localization with LLM-generated instructions. The authors develop a two-stage fine-tuned ResNet-50 for waypoint classification, achieving 96% accuracy even with short video queries and varying viewpoints. For navigation, they preprocess floor maps and use a refined system prompt with ChatGPT to generate step-by-step directions, yielding 75% instruction accuracy. The approach demonstrates potential for infrastructure-free indoor navigation using smartphone cameras and publicly available floor plans, particularly useful in hospitals, airports, and educational institutions.

## Method Summary
The system uses a two-stage ResNet-50 CNN for vision-based localization, first trained with self-supervised temporal pre-training on video frame pairs, then fine-tuned for supervised waypoint classification with label smoothing. Features are extracted and indexed using FAISS for real-time nearest neighbor search with temporal smoothing. For navigation, preprocessed floor maps are combined with a refined system prompt to generate step-by-step instructions using ChatGPT model o3. The pipeline aggregates per-frame localization predictions using exponential decay confidence scoring and sliding window majority voting.

## Key Results
- Vision-based localization achieves 96% accuracy across nine test waypoints with short-duration queries and varying viewpoints
- LLM-generated navigation instructions achieve 75% accuracy on preprocessed 2D floor maps
- System successfully combines vision-based localization with LLM navigation for infrastructure-free indoor wayfinding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Two-Stage Vision-Based Localization with Temporal Pre-Training
Self-supervised temporal pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning enables robust waypoint classification even with limited training data. Stage 1 trains ResNet-50 on temporal ordering tasks, forcing learning of motion-relevant features without manual labels. Stage 2 replaces the temporal head with waypoint classification and fine-tunes deeper layers while freezing early residual blocks. Core assumption: Temporal coherence transfers to static waypoint recognition. Evidence: 96% accuracy across nine waypoints, even with short queries and varying viewpoints. Break condition: Post-training visual changes or waypoints lacking distinctive features.

### Mechanism 2: LLM Navigation via Iteratively Refined System Prompts
Structured three-component system prompts with map preprocessing can guide ChatGPT to generate navigation instructions with ~75% accuracy. Map preprocessing removes extraneous elements that may trigger hallucinations. The system prompt contains: Initial Context defining the assistant role, Core Rules constraining behaviors, and Walkable Path Context explaining visual representations. Core assumption: LLMs possess sufficient spatial reasoning capability when provided adequate context. Evidence: 75% instruction accuracy, though processing time limitations noted. Break condition: Complex layouts, unconventional map visualizations, or ambiguous pathway representations.

### Mechanism 3: Confidence-Weighted Temporal Aggregation Pipeline
Exponential decay confidence scoring combined with sliding window majority voting produces stable, accurate localization from short video queries. Each frame's feature vector is queried against FAISS index using L2 distance, converted to confidence via exponential decay. Only predictions exceeding threshold enter a 10-frame sliding window. Final prediction is majority vote over all confident predictions. Core assumption: Correct predictions are temporally consistent while errors are random noise. Evidence: Average final prediction accuracy of 0.96 across all waypoints; only 4 incorrect predictions out of 270 tests after three seconds. Break condition: Rapid camera movement or occlusion preventing sufficient confident predictions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Residual Networks and Skip Connections**
  - Why needed here: ResNet-50 backbone enables training deep networks for fine-grained feature extraction; residual connections mitigate vanishing gradients critical for learning subtle indoor visual distinctions.
  - Quick check question: Why do skip connections help with gradient flow in deep networks during backpropagation?

- **Concept: Self-Supervised Learning from Temporal Sequences**
  - Why needed here: Stage 1 pre-training uses unlabeled video frames to learn motion patterns without requiring manual waypoint annotations, reducing labeling burden.
  - Quick check question: How does the temporal ordering task differ from contrastive learning objectives used in other self-supervised methods?

- **Concept: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search with FAISS**
  - Why needed here: Enables real-time comparison of query features against pre-computed waypoint database; L2 distance on normalized vectors approximates cosine similarity for ranking.
  - Quick check question: Why does L2 normalization make Euclidean distance equivalent to cosine distance for similarity ranking purposes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Collection (9 waypoints × 7 videos) → Feature Extraction (ResNet-50 → 2048-dim vectors) → Indexing (FAISS IndexFlatL2) → Query Pipeline (frame extraction → feature extraction → TopKUnique filtering → exponential decay confidence → sliding window) → Navigation Module (preprocessed floor map + refined system prompt + ChatGPT o3)

- **Critical path**: Offline training (Stage 1 temporal pre-training → Stage 2 supervised classification) → FAISS index serialization → Real-time localization query → LLM instruction generation. Localization output serves as origin point for navigation.

- **Design tradeoffs**: σ = 2.5 (confidence decay) balances strict matching vs. frame acceptance; τ = 0.7 (confidence threshold) balances prediction certainty vs. inclusion; frozen early ResNet layers preserve ImageNet features but limit domain adaptation; window size M = 10 balances stability vs. latency.

- **Failure signatures**: Localization failures show high per-frame confidence variance or repeated incorrect predictions; navigation failures include hallucinated paths or misaligned instructions; system failures show empty smoothing window after query completion.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate Experiment 2: Test localization accuracy across all 9 waypoints with 45°, 90°, and 180° camera pans using 3-second query videos to validate temporal smoothing effectiveness
  2. Duration sensitivity test: Compare accuracy between 1-second and 3-second query videos to measure minimum viable input length for reliable prediction
  3. System prompt ablation: Test navigation accuracy with individual prompt components removed to quantify each section's contribution to the 75% baseline accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can multi-shot prompting or fine-tuning on navigation-centric datasets significantly increase LLM instruction accuracy above the observed 75% baseline? The authors state future research will explore "enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities... through task-specific prompt engineering, multi-shot prompting, or fine-tuning." This remains unresolved due to current reliance on "almost zero-shot prompting" causing hallucinations. Comparative experiments showing instruction accuracy exceeding 75% would resolve this.

- **Open Question 2**: Can the LLM navigation pipeline be optimized to reduce the 3-4 minute processing time to a latency suitable for real-time interaction? Each query takes more than 3-4 minutes, preventing the system from functioning as a responsive assistant. Implementation of a faster model or pipeline optimization generating instructions in under a few seconds without sacrificing accuracy would resolve this.

- **Open Question 3**: Does the vision-based localization model maintain 96% accuracy when deployed in environments with significantly different architectural styles or lighting conditions? While authors call for "broader testing across diverse architectural layouts," the 96% accuracy is derived from a single office corridor. Cross-dataset validation showing high localization accuracy in structurally distinct environments without retraining would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Data Scope and Generalization: 96% localization accuracy demonstrated on single corridor environment with 9 waypoints may not generalize to complex multi-floor buildings or visually similar waypoints.
- Processing Time Constraints: Navigation instruction generation takes 3-4 minutes per query, making system unsuitable for real-time navigation assistance.
- Environmental Sensitivity: System performance degrades with post-training environmental changes requiring periodic retraining for long-term deployment.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Two-stage vision-based localization methodology is technically sound with 96% accuracy results across multiple camera angles and query durations.
- **Medium Confidence**: 75% navigation accuracy figure presented without detailed breakdown of error types or conditions; specific prompt content remains unspecified.
- **Low Confidence**: Scalability claims to "smartphone cameras and publicly available floor plans" lack validation across diverse building types, camera qualities, and map formats.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Environment Generalization Test**: Evaluate localization accuracy in at least three distinct indoor environments (office, hospital, retail) with varying lighting conditions and architectural complexity to validate scalability claims.

2. **Real-Time Performance Benchmark**: Measure end-to-end system latency from query initiation to navigation instruction delivery across different smartphone hardware specifications to establish practical deployment constraints.

3. **Failure Mode Analysis**: Systematically test system's behavior under controlled failure conditions including post-training environmental changes, rapid camera movement, and map representation variations to quantify robustness limits.
