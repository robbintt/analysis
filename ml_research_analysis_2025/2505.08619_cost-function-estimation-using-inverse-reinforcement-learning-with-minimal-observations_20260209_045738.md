# Cost Function Estimation Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Minimal Observations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.08619
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08619
- Reference count: 23
- Authors learn cost functions from single expert demonstrations using iterative trajectory sampling and optimal control

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MO-IRL, an iterative inverse reinforcement learning algorithm that significantly improves computational efficiency and convergence speed compared to existing methods. The key innovation is reformulating trajectory sampling by assigning individual weights to each observation in the partition function, enabling more efficient representation of the trajectory space. The algorithm generates informative trajectories using an optimal control solver at each iteration, producing both optimal and non-optimal demonstrations. By incorporating a step acceptance strategy based on Wolfe conditions and merit functions, the method ensures generated trajectories remain close to optimal demonstrations while requiring far fewer samples and iterations to converge.

## Method Summary
MO-IRL uses maximum entropy principles to estimate cost function weights from a single expert demonstration in continuous state spaces. The algorithm iteratively generates trajectories using an optimal control solver and updates weights by solving a convex optimization problem with elastic net regularization. A key contribution is the step acceptance strategy that uses Wolfe conditions on merit functions to validate weight updates, ensuring generated trajectories stay close to the expert demonstration. The method employs a moving window buffer to store generated trajectories and uses sub-sampling to improve robustness in low-dimensional feature spaces. The cost function is assumed to be a linear combination of explicit features, making it interpretable and suitable for model-predictive control integration.

## Key Results
- MO-IRL converges in 6, 2, and 2 iterations versus 55+ iterations for competing methods
- Uses only 14 samples versus 20-55 samples required by baselines
- Achieves trajectories closer to optimal cost values while maintaining computational efficiency
- Demonstrates superior obstacle avoidance through smaller, well-balanced weights

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm's efficiency stems from two key innovations: reformulating trajectory sampling to weight individual observations rather than entire trajectories, and using an optimal control solver to generate informative samples at each iteration instead of requiring extensive initial sampling. The Wolfe condition-based step acceptance ensures that weight updates produce trajectories close to the expert demonstration, preventing divergence. The convex optimization with elastic net regularization provides stable weight updates while maintaining sparsity. By generating both optimal and non-optimal trajectories through the OC solver, the method builds a more representative partition function without requiring large initial sample sets.

## Foundational Learning
- **Concept: Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt IRL)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's probabilistic framework assumes the expert's trajectory follows a distribution where higher-cost trajectories are exponentially less likely
  - Quick check question: What principle states that, given constraints, the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy?

- **Concept: Optimal Control & Cost Functions**
  - Why needed here: The algorithm interleaves with an optimal control solver to generate trajectories that minimize the current cost estimate
  - Quick check question: In an optimal control problem, are we given the cost function and asked to find the trajectory, or given the trajectory and asked to find the cost function?

- **Concept: Wolfe Conditions**
  - Why needed here: The core contribution uses Wolfe conditions for step acceptance to ensure meaningful progress in weight updates
  - Quick check question: In a line search, what are the two primary conditions used to ensure a chosen step length is neither too short nor too long to guarantee convergence?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Initialization -> Optimal Control Solver -> Trajectory Buffer -> Weight Optimizer -> Step Acceptance Module -> Update Weights
- **Critical path:** Initial trajectory generation → Step calculation → Validation loop (OC solve, merit evaluation, Wolfe check) → Accept step or backtrack
- **Design tradeoffs:** Small trajectory buffer size (L=1) for speed vs. larger buffer for diversity; linear cost assumption for interpretability vs. expressiveness; sub-sampling for robustness vs. computational overhead
- **Failure signatures:** No acceptable step found (algorithm terminates after 10 failed trials); collision with obstacles (weights overemphasize goal reaching); oscillation without regularization
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Point mass baseline task with 1-2 obstacles testing convergence speed and trajectory quality; 2) Ablation study disabling step acceptance to confirm its necessity; 3) Kuka robot reaching task with 37 features testing high-dimensional performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can MO-IRL be extended to online cost learning with model-predictive control for real-time human-in-the-loop teaching scenarios?
- Does MO-IRL's tendency toward smaller, well-balanced weights consistently lead to better generalization across environments compared to methods that may overweight certain features?
- How does MO-IRL perform when the dynamics model used by the optimal control solver is inaccurate or when transferred to physical robot hardware?
- Can MO-IRL effectively leverage multiple expert demonstrations to improve robustness, or does the single-demonstration assumption limit the quality of learned cost functions?

## Limitations
- Assumes linear cost functions as weighted combinations of explicit features, limiting expressiveness for complex behaviors
- Performance heavily depends on the quality and consistency of the optimal control solver
- Evaluated only on relatively simple point mass and robot manipulation tasks in simulation
- Does not address handling of non-optimal expert demonstrations or real-world noise

## Confidence
- Theoretical foundation using maximum entropy principles and Wolfe conditions: High confidence
- Empirical results showing significant improvements in sample efficiency: High confidence
- Claims about computational efficiency relative to sample complexity: Medium confidence
- Generalization to complex, high-dimensional continuous control problems: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test algorithm robustness to OC solver noise by introducing controlled perturbations and measuring impact on convergence and cost recovery accuracy
2. Evaluate performance when expert demonstrations contain non-optimal trajectories rather than a single optimal trajectory
3. Compare computational overhead of iterative trajectory generation versus one-shot sampling methods when scaling to 50+ dimensional feature spaces
