# DeepVIVONet: Using deep neural operators to optimize sensor locations with application to vortex-induced vibrations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.04105
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04105
- Reference count: 38
- Introduces DeepVIVONet for predicting vortex-induced vibrations using sparse sensor data with DeepONet

## Executive Summary
This paper presents DeepVIVONet, a deep neural operator framework for predicting vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of marine risers using sparse sensor data. The method employs DeepONet to reconstruct continuous dynamics from discrete measurements and forecast future states. Key results show accurate reconstruction and forecasting across varying flow conditions, with mean squared error as low as 1.29e-06. The framework also enables transfer learning for extrapolation to different flow velocities and optimizes sensor placement, outperforming traditional POD-based methods.

## Method Summary
DeepVIVONet uses DeepONet architecture to learn the mapping between sparse sensor measurements and the full VIV dynamics of marine risers. The model is trained on simulation data of riser responses to vortex-induced vibrations under various flow conditions. It incorporates both reconstruction of the current state from limited sensors and forecasting of future states. The framework leverages transfer learning capabilities to adapt to different flow velocities and includes an optimization component for sensor placement that outperforms traditional POD-based approaches.

## Key Results
- Mean squared error as low as 1.29e-06 for VIV prediction across varying flow conditions
- Successful transfer learning enabling extrapolation to different flow velocities
- Sensor placement optimization outperforming traditional POD-based methods
- DeepVIVONet serves as a fast surrogate model for sensor placement optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DeepVIVONet leverages the universal approximation capabilities of DeepONets to learn the nonlinear mapping between sparse sensor measurements and the full spatiotemporal dynamics of vortex-induced vibrations. The branch network encodes the sensor inputs while the trunk network represents the spatiotemporal coordinates. By training on high-fidelity simulation data, the network learns to reconstruct the complete VIV field from limited measurements and forecast future states. The transfer learning capability emerges from the operator learning framework, which captures the underlying physics rather than learning flow-condition-specific patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- DeepONet architecture: Why needed - learns continuous operators mapping between function spaces; Quick check - branch and trunk networks properly trained with sufficient data
- Vortex-induced vibrations physics: Why needed - understanding the underlying fluid-structure interaction; Quick check - model captures key VIV characteristics like lock-in and frequency response
- Sensor placement optimization: Why needed - minimizes sensor count while maintaining reconstruction accuracy; Quick check - optimized placement outperforms random or uniform configurations
- Transfer learning in operator networks: Why needed - enables application to different flow conditions without retraining; Quick check - performance on extrapolated flow velocities
- POD-based methods: Why needed - provides baseline comparison for sensor placement; Quick check - DeepVIVONet outperforms POD in accuracy and computational efficiency

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input sensors -> Branch network -> Trunk network (spatiotemporal coordinates) -> Output reconstruction/forecast

**Critical Path:** Sensor measurements → Branch network encoding → Operator learning → Full field reconstruction → Sensor placement optimization

**Design Tradeoffs:** Accuracy vs. computational cost in network architecture; Number of sensors vs. reconstruction fidelity; Training data diversity vs. generalization capability

**Failure Signatures:** Poor reconstruction in regions far from sensors; Degradation in forecasting beyond trained temporal horizons; Reduced accuracy for flow conditions outside training distribution

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test reconstruction accuracy with varying numbers of sensors to determine minimum required for acceptable performance
2. Validate forecasting capability at different temporal horizons to establish operational limits
3. Compare sensor placement optimization results against multiple baseline methods (random, uniform, POD)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance under highly turbulent flow conditions remains untested
- Extrapolation capability for flow velocities beyond training range is unverified
- Real-world validation of sensor placement optimization on physical marine risers is not provided
- Computational efficiency for very large-scale problems may still be substantial

## Confidence
- High confidence in reconstruction and forecasting accuracy for tested flow conditions
- Medium confidence in extrapolation capabilities to different flow velocities
- Medium confidence in sensor placement optimization without real-world validation
- Low confidence in performance under extreme turbulence or structural changes

## Next Checks
1. Test extrapolation capability for flow velocities significantly outside the training range to assess robustness
2. Validate sensor placement optimization on a physical marine riser in realistic offshore conditions
3. Evaluate performance under highly turbulent flow conditions and with varying structural properties of the riser
