# GutenOCR: A Grounded Vision-Language Front-End for Documents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.14490
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14490
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GutenOCR fine-tunes Qwen2.5-VL on business and scientific documents to deliver a unified prompt-driven OCR front-end that more than doubles grounded OCR composite score (0.40→0.82) and improves localization and transfer to region-level tasks.

## Executive Summary
GutenOCR introduces a grounded OCR front-end that turns general-purpose VLMs into a unified, prompt-driven interface for reading, detection, and localization on document pages. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B on a curriculum of business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the resulting checkpoints deliver both full-page reading in multiple output formats (text, layout-sensitive text2d, and structured lines/paragraphs with bounding boxes) and localized/conditional detection with explicit pixel-level grounding. On 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages, GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its backbone (0.40→0.82), substantially improves localized reading CER and line-detection F1, and shows strong transfer to region- and line-level OCR on Fox, while revealing trade-offs in page linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts on OmniDocBench v1.5. The work establishes an open baseline for VLM-based OCR that combines the strengths of classical OCR pipelines with the flexibility and scalability of modern vision-language models.

## Method Summary
GutenOCR fine-tunes Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct on a mixture of real and synthetic grounded OCR data using a 4-stage curriculum that progressively increases sequence length and shifts the data mixture. Stage 1 (<2k tokens) establishes grounding on short synthetic and real documents; Stage 2 (2k-8k) specializes to structured JSON outputs on real data; Stage 3a adds PubMed-OCR for scientific layouts; Stage 3b (8k-16k) extends to multi-column articles. All tasks share the same backbone and prompting interface, with training objectives for text, detection boxes, and structured JSON outputs. The model is trained with full fine-tuning using AdamW and DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 on 8x H100 GPUs.

## Key Results
- GutenOCR-7B achieves composite grounded OCR score of 0.82 on held-out business and scientific pages, more than doubling the backbone score of 0.40
- Full detection F1@0.5 rises from 0.111 to 0.787; localized reading CER drops from 0.530 to 0.129
- Region-level OCR CER improves from 0.163 to 0.067 on Fox; line-level detection F1@0.5 rises from 0.429 to 0.850
- Text detection recall on OmniDocBench increases from ~0.02 to 0.55-0.62, demonstrating transfer to diverse layouts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Curriculum-Guided Length and Domain Specialization
Progressive sequence-length curriculum with shifting data mixtures stabilizes grounded OCR learning and prevents optimization collapse on long documents. Stage 1 (<2k tokens, synthetic+real) establishes core grounding on short sequences; Stage 2 (2k-8k, real-only) specializes to structured JSON outputs; Stage 3a adds PubMed-OCR for scientific layouts; Stage 3b (8k-16k) extends to multi-column articles. Each stage restricts sequence length to match current capacity, preventing gradient instability from long-context outputs before the model has learned reliable localization. Evidence shows Stage 1 captures most gains, Stage 3a sharpens localized reading and conditional detection, while Stage 3b slightly degrades composite due to over-specialization on PubMed-OCR contexts.

### Mechanism 2: Unified Prompt-to-Task Interface with Schema-Driven Outputs
Training a single VLM checkpoint on multiple OCR task families with shared prompt conventions creates a composable API-like interface that generalizes across task variants. The model learns to map (prompt, image) → structured output via four task families: reading (text/text2d/lines/paragraphs), detection (BOX only), localized reading (image+box→text), and conditional detection (image+query→BOX). Prompt templates are randomized during training to improve robustness to phrasing variations while preserving task semantics. Evidence shows all tasks share the same backbone, tokenizer, and prompting interface, with more robust behavior under minor phrasing changes at inference time.

### Mechanism 3: Dense Spatial Supervision with Line-Level Grounding
Explicit line- and paragraph-level bounding-box supervision during fine-tuning creates precise localization that transfers to region-level reading and conditional detection. Real corpora (OCR-IDL, TabMe++, PubMed-OCR) provide line/word annotations; synthetic corpora (SynthDoG Grounding, Grounded LaTeX) add dense grounding for math and dense layouts. The model is trained to emit {"text": string, "bbox": [x1,y1,x2,y2]} pairs, forcing alignment between transcription and spatial prediction. Evidence shows full detection F1 rises from 0.111 to 0.787; localized reading CER drops from 0.530 to 0.129; and text detection recall on OmniDocBench increases from ~0.02 to 0.55-0.62.

## Foundational Learning

- **Character Error Rate (CER) vs. Word Error Rate (WER):** CER measures per-character transcription accuracy; WER is stricter, counting word-level errors. GutenOCR reports both to separate minor typos from structural reading failures. The composite score maps errors to 1 - CER for aggregation. *Quick check:* If a model transcribes "hello world" as "helo world," what is the CER and WER? (CER = 1/11 ≈ 0.09; WER = 0/2 = 0 if words are matched via edit distance with one deletion.)

- **IoU-Based Detection Matching (F1@0.5, Recall@0.5):** Detection metrics require matching predicted boxes to ground truth via Intersection-over-Union. F1@0.5 uses IoU ≥ 0.5 for matching; unmatched predictions are false positives, unmatched ground truth are false negatives. This separates localization quality from transcription. *Quick check:* If a predicted box [0,0,100,100] and ground truth [10,10,110,110] have overlap area 90×90 and union area 10000+10000-8100=11900, what is the IoU? (IoU = 8100/11900 ≈ 0.68 → matched at 0.5 threshold.)

- **End-to-End Structured Reading Metrics (mCER@0.5, CERe2e):** mCER@0.5 isolates recognition quality given correct localization by averaging CER over matched box pairs. CERe2e concatenates all matched boxes in reading order and measures page-level fidelity. These detect "good reader, bad paginator" pathologies where transcription is accurate but reading order or coverage is wrong. *Quick check:* If a model matches all ground-truth boxes but reads them in reverse order, which metric penalizes this? (CERe2e penalizes reading order; mCER@0.5 only measures per-box recognition.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct -> NaViT-style vision encoder -> transformer decoder -> structured OCR outputs (text, text2d, lines, paragraphs, BOX)

- **Critical path:** Load Qwen2.5-VL backbone and configure for long-context (up to 16k tokens) -> prepare data mixtures per stage (GL, SDG, IDL, TabMe++, PubMed-OCR) with line/paragraph annotations -> train Stage 1 (2k max, 20K steps) -> validate -> early stop -> progress through Stages 2, 3a, 3b with increasing length and shifting mixtures -> evaluate on held-out pages using CER, WER, F1@0.5, mCER@0.5, CERe2e

- **Design tradeoffs:** 3B vs. 7B: 3B achieves slightly better localized reading and detection; 7B better at global reading and conditional detection. Choose based on task priorities. Stage 3a vs. 3b: Stage 3a gives best composite on in-domain; Stage 3b specializes to long scientific articles at cost of business-document performance. text2d vs. text: text2d preserves layout but increases CER due to whitespace sensitivity; text is simpler but loses spatial structure.

- **Failure signatures:** Color-guided OCR failure (CER 0.94-0.96): Model misinterprets color prompts as text queries ("read 'red box'") → catastrophic forgetting from lack of color supervision. Formula recognition degradation: CDM drops from 0.936 to 0.866 (3B) after fine-tuning → negative transfer from math-agnostic training mixture. Page CER vs. Page F1 gap: High Page F1 (>0.97) but poor Page CER (>0.16) on Fox → model follows layout-driven reading order instead of benchmark's canonical linearization.

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Reproduce in-domain composite score: Run GutenOCR-7B Stage 3a on 1K held-out pages from OCR-IDL/TabMe++/PubMed-OCR; verify composite ≈0.82 and detection F1 >0.78. 2) Ablate training stages: Compare Stage 1, 2, 3a, 3b on Fox region/line tasks to confirm Stage 3a optimizes grounding while Stage 3b over-specializes. 3) Test out-of-domain transfer: Evaluate on OmniDocBench text detection (recall-only protocol) to measure grounding transfer to diverse page types; expect recall 0.55-0.62 vs. ~0.02 for backbone.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the training recipe be adapted to mitigate negative transfer in formula recognition while maintaining text grounding improvements? The current mixture is math-agnostic and erodes base capabilities for equations to prioritize business document grounding. Evidence would be a training ablation incorporating Grounded LaTeX data sustained into later stages, demonstrating recovered CDM scores on formula subsets.

### Open Question 2
Can the "catastrophic forgetting" of color-guided pointers be remedied through targeted data augmentation? The OCR-centric curriculum overwrites the base VLM's heuristic ability to interpret color cues, which is not explicitly retrained. Evidence would be a model variant fine-tuned with synthetic color-box prompts achieving competitive CER on the Fox Color subtask.

### Open Question 3
What evaluation protocols effectively measure "evidential QA" and fine-grained provenance for "document holograms"? Existing benchmarks focus on transcription fidelity or markup correctness rather than the verifiability of extracted answers. Evidence would be a benchmark suite that scores models on the pixel-level accuracy of citations used to support generated answers.

## Limitations
- The exact composition of the PubMed-OCR dataset is unspecified, making it difficult to assess alignment with evaluation layouts
- Observed trade-offs include color-guided OCR failure (CER 0.94-0.96) and formula recognition degradation (CDM 0.936→0.866) due to training mixture limitations
- Fox evaluation reveals systematic linearization mismatches where high Page F1 (>0.97) but poor Page CER (>0.16) indicates layout-driven reading order vs. benchmark's canonical linearization

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Core claim that GutenOCR substantially improves in-domain grounded OCR performance (composite 0.40→0.82) and localized reading (CER 0.530→0.129) on business and scientific documents, as these are measured on held-out data with standard metrics
- **Medium confidence:** Assertion that Stage 3a is optimal for in-domain tasks while Stage 3b over-specializes, based on relative composite scores but without isolating specific factors driving degradation
- **Low confidence:** Transfer claims to region/line-level OCR on Fox and OmniDocBench, since Fox reveals systematic linearization mismatches and OmniDocBench uses recall-only protocol that doesn't penalize spatial inaccuracies

## Next Checks
1. **Replicate in-domain composite score:** Run GutenOCR-7B Stage 3a on 1K held-out pages from OCR-IDL/TabMe++/PubMed-OCR; verify composite ≈0.82 and detection F1 >0.78
2. **Ablate training stages:** Compare Stage 1, 2, 3a, 3b on Fox region/line tasks to confirm Stage 3a optimizes grounding while Stage 3b over-specializes
3. **Test out-of-domain transfer:** Evaluate on OmniDocBench text detection (recall-only protocol) to measure grounding transfer to diverse page types; expect recall 0.55-0.62 vs. ~0.02 for backbone
