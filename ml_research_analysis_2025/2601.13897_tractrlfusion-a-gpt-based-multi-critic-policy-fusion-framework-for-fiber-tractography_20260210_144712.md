# TractRLFusion: A GPT-Based Multi-Critic Policy Fusion Framework for Fiber Tractography

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.13897
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13897
- **Reference count:** 31
- **Primary result:** GPT-based fusion of multiple RL policies achieves superior tractography Dice scores compared to individual policies and ensembles

## Executive Summary
TractRLFusion addresses the challenge of accurately reconstructing white matter fiber pathways in tractography while minimizing spurious connections. The proposed solution employs a GPT-based policy fusion framework that integrates multiple reinforcement learning (RL) policies through a data-driven fusion strategy. By combining Episodic Data Selection, FusionNet for learning fusion policies, and Multi-Critic Policy Fine-Tuning, the framework demonstrates superior performance on standard datasets including HCP, ISMRM, and TractoInferno, achieving notable Dice scores of 74.1 for Arcuate Fasciculus and 77.0 for Cingulum.

## Method Summary
TractRLFusion is a GPT-based multi-critic policy fusion framework designed to enhance white matter tractography accuracy by integrating multiple reinforcement learning policies. The framework consists of three key components: Episodic Data Selection (EDS) for selecting anatomically precise trajectories, FusionNet for learning the fusion policy, and Multi-Critic Policy Fine-Tuning (MCPFT) for enhancing robustness and generalization. The approach systematically fuses individual RL policies (SAC, TD3, DDPG) to outperform both individual policies and traditional ensemble methods, achieving superior Dice scores and anatomical reliability on standard benchmarks.

## Key Results
- FusionNet achieved Dice scores of 74.1 for Arcuate Fasciculus and 77.0 for Cingulum on HCP data
- Outperformed individual RL policies (SAC, TD3, DDPG) and their ensemble methods
- Demonstrated superior anatomical reliability across HCP, ISMRM, and TractoInferno datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the complementary strengths of multiple RL policies through intelligent fusion, where each policy may excel in different anatomical regions or trajectory characteristics. The GPT-based fusion approach learns to optimally combine these diverse policies based on contextual features, resulting in trajectories that benefit from the strengths of each individual policy while mitigating their individual weaknesses.

## Foundational Learning

**Reinforcement Learning for Tractography**: RL agents learn to navigate fiber pathways through reward-based optimization. Needed because tractography requires sequential decision-making along complex anatomical structures. Quick check: Verify each base RL policy achieves reasonable Dice scores individually before fusion.

**Policy Fusion Strategies**: Combining multiple decision-making policies to leverage complementary strengths. Needed because no single policy performs optimally across all tract types. Quick check: Confirm that fusion improves upon weighted averaging baselines.

**Anatomical Trajectory Selection**: Filtering and selecting high-quality fiber pathways based on anatomical plausibility. Needed to reduce spurious connections and improve reconstruction accuracy. Quick check: Validate EDS filtering criteria against anatomical ground truth.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Data -> EDS -> Multiple RL Policies -> FusionNet -> MCPFT -> Output Tracts

**Critical Path**: The core execution path follows: Raw Diffusion Data → EDS Filtering → Parallel RL Policy Execution → FusionNet Integration → MCPFT Refinement → Final Tract Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances computational complexity against performance gains. While fusion improves accuracy, it requires maintaining multiple RL policies and a fusion model, increasing memory and processing requirements compared to single-policy approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may manifest as (1) EDS filtering too aggressively, eliminating valid pathways; (2) FusionNet failing to learn meaningful policy combinations; (3) MCPFT overfitting to training data, reducing generalization.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate individual RL policies achieve baseline performance on Arcuate Fasciculus before fusion
2. Test EDS filtering with varying thresholds to optimize the precision-recall tradeoff
3. Evaluate FusionNet with different fusion strategies (weighted averaging, gating, attention) to identify optimal approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on Dice scores for specific tracts rather than comprehensive anatomical validation
- Generalizability claims would benefit from testing on a broader range of tract types and pathological cases
- Computational efficiency and scalability with increasing numbers of base policies remains untested for clinical deployment

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Comparative performance metrics against individual RL policies (SAC, TD3, DDPG) and ensemble methods appear well-supported by reported quantitative results, including specific Dice scores for Arcuate Fasciculus and Cingulum on HCP data.

**Medium confidence**: The claim of superiority over traditional methods is supported but would be strengthened by additional head-to-head comparisons. Generalizability across three datasets is reasonable but limited by the relatively small number of tract types evaluated.

## Next Checks
1. Test TractRLFusion on additional tract types beyond Arcuate Fasciculus and Cingulum, particularly those with complex geometries or crossing fibers, to verify robustness claims
2. Evaluate computational runtime and memory requirements when scaling to 10+ base policies to assess practical clinical deployment feasibility
3. Conduct anatomical validation using expert neuroanatomist review of generated tracts to confirm that high Dice scores translate to anatomically plausible reconstructions, particularly for challenging regions like the cerebellar peduncles or optic radiation
