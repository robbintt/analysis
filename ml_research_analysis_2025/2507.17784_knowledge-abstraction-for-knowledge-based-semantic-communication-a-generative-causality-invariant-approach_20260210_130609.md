# Knowledge Abstraction for Knowledge-based Semantic Communication: A Generative Causality Invariant Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.17784
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17784
- Reference count: 40
- Over 10% improvement in PSNR for data reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art semantic compression approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces UKIE, a generative causality-invariant learning approach for knowledge-based semantic communication. The method addresses the challenge of data reconstruction in semantic communication systems by extracting invariant (semantic knowledge) and variant (physical data) representations from data. UKIE employs a GAN-based architecture that uses causality-invariant learning to separate semantic knowledge from physical data, with sparse update protocols to maintain invariant knowledge consistency across distributed devices while minimizing communication overhead. The proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art semantic compression approaches, achieving over 10% improvement in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSRN) for data reconstruction.

## Method Summary
UKIE uses a two-stage meta-learning approach (via Reptile) to train a GAN-based architecture that separates data into invariant representations ($z_K$) capturing semantic knowledge and variant representations ($z_V$) capturing physical details. The encoder extracts both representations, with invariant representations stored in a semantic memory and variant representations transmitted over the physical channel. The decoder reconstructs data by combining received variant representations with retrieved invariant knowledge. The system includes adversarial training to ensure invariant representations capture only causality-invariant features, preventing memorization of spurious correlations. Sparse update protocols synchronize semantic knowledge across devices with minimal communication overhead.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 10% improvement in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSRN) for data reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art semantic compression approaches
- Demonstrates robust classification performance across domain shifts, maintaining consistent accuracy crucial for goal-oriented semantic communications
- Successfully validates across multiple datasets including MNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR-10, CINIC-10, and CELEB-A

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Causal Representation Disentanglement
Separating data into causally-invariant representations ($z_K$) and variant representations ($z_V$) enables robust cross-domain data reconstruction. The encoder-decoder architecture partitions information through a structured causal model (SCM), where invariant representations capture label-predictive features that remain stable across domains, while variant representations encode sample-specific details. The decoder reconstructs data by combining: $\hat{x} = g_{\theta_2}(\hat{z}_V, z_K)$.

### Mechanism 2: Adversarial Invariant Learning
Adversarial training prevents the invariant encoder from memorizing spurious correlations in classifier parameters. A min-max game between the invariant encoder ($f_{\theta_K}$) and an adversarial discriminator ($\Psi$) ensures that invariant representations capture only causality-invariant features. The encoder minimizes classification loss while maximizing the discriminator's uncertainty; the discriminator learns to detect anomalies in invariant representations.

### Mechanism 3: Two-Stage Meta-Learning via Reptile
Decomposing joint optimization into alternating UKIE Generator and Meaningful Invariant Discriminator (MID) phases enables stable convergence. Reptile meta-learning coordinates two interleaved processes: (1) UKIE Generator optimizes reconstruction + invariance losses; (2) MID distills semantic knowledge into $z_K$ via classification and adversarial losses. Parameter updates alternate with separate learning rates.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Structured Causal Models (SCM)**
  - Why needed here: UKIE's core premise is that causal mechanisms are domain-invariant. Understanding interventions, confounders, and the independence assumption $I(z_K; z_V) \approx 0$ is essential to interpret why this architecture should generalize.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a representation that predicts labels might still contain spurious (non-causal) correlations, and how SCM formalizes the difference?

- Concept: **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
  - Why needed here: UKIE uses adversarial training to enforce invariance. Understanding generator-discriminator dynamics, mode collapse, and Nash equilibria is critical for debugging training instabilities.
  - Quick check question: What happens to a GAN if the discriminator becomes too strong relative to the generator, and how might this manifest in UKIE's adversarial loss?

- Concept: **Prototypical Networks and Metric Learning**
  - Why needed here: The invariant loss $L_{iv}$ uses prototype-based clustering to enforce intra-class compactness. Understanding embedding spaces, distance metrics, and few-shot learning helps diagnose why invariant representations converge.
  - Quick check question: How does the prototype computation encourage representations from the same class to cluster, and what failure mode might occur if class distributions overlap significantly?

  ```

- Critical path:
  1. Data preparation: Ensure labels are available (supervised setting required for invariant learning)
  2. Encoder initialization: Initialize θ_E, θ_K, θ_V with ResNet-9 backbone
  3. Two-stage training loop: Alternate UKIE Generator (reconstruction + invariance) and MID (classification + adversarial) phases
  4. Semantic memory synchronization: Implement sparse update protocol with threshold κ to broadcast $z_K$ changes across devices
  5. Inference: Transmit $z_V$ over physical channel; receiver retrieves $z_K$ from semantic memory using label index

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Invariant vs. variant channel allocation**: Increasing $d_{z_K}$ improves classification but requires more semantic memory; increasing $d_{z_V}$ improves reconstruction fidelity but increases physical channel load
  - **Sparse update threshold κ**: Lower κ ensures faster knowledge synchronization but increases semantic channel overhead; higher κ reduces communication but risks knowledge divergence
  - **Adversarial strength**: Strong adversarial loss enforces purer invariance but risks training instability; weak adversarial loss is stable but may leak spurious correlations

- Failure signatures:
  - High invariant loss ($L_{iv} > 0.1$): Invariant representations are not clustering by class; check prototype initialization and learning rate
  - Low variant loss ($L_v < 0.5$): Variant representations are insufficiently diverse; variant loss coefficient may be too low
  - Reconstruction collapse (PSNR < baseline): Decoder may be ignoring $z_K$; verify label index is correctly passed to semantic memory during inference
  - Semantic memory divergence: Devices report inconsistent reconstructions; decrease sparse update threshold κ or increase synchronization frequency

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Sanity check on single-domain data**: Train UKIE on MNIST without domain shifts. Verify $L_{iv} \approx 0$ and $L_v \approx 1$. Confirm reconstruction PSNR > baseline VAE.
  2. **Domain shift robustness test**: Train on CIFAR-10, test on CINIC-10. Measure accuracy drop using only $z_K$ for classification. Compare against Colored-MNIST benchmarks to validate domain generalization.
  3. **Sparse update protocol validation**: Simulate multi-device setting with evolving data distributions. Vary κ ∈ {0.001, 0.01, 0.1} and measure: (a) semantic channel overhead, (b) reconstruction PSNR divergence across devices. Identify the knee point balancing communication cost and consistency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the UKIE framework be adapted for unsupervised semantic communication where explicit class labels are unavailable or the invariant factors are not strictly aligned with class categories? The method relies on supervised label indices to retrieve invariant knowledge ($z_K$) via Prototypical Networks and requires the label index $c$ to be transmitted for data reconstruction.

### Open Question 2
How does the proposed GAN-based architecture scale to high-resolution or multimodal data (e.g., video, HD images) compared to the low-resolution benchmarks used? Empirical evaluations are restricted to small datasets, and the computational efficiency analysis highlights parameter counts and training times that may explode with larger input dimensions.

### Open Question 3
How robust is the sparse update protocol and data reconstruction to channel estimation errors or imperfect Channel State Information (CSI)? The semantic decoder relies on accurate phase and amplitude recovery to reconstruct data from the received signal; estimation errors could distort the disentanglement of invariant and variant representations.

## Limitations
- Limited scalability to high-resolution datasets due to fixed dimensionality of semantic memory and shallow encoder architecture
- Reliance on perfect channel state information assumptions without modeling estimation errors or channel noise effects
- Supervised learning requirement with explicit class labels, limiting application to unlabeled or continuous data domains

## Confidence
- GAN-based causality-invariant learning framework: High
- Two-stage Reptile meta-learning for stable optimization: Medium
- Sparse update protocol for semantic memory synchronization: Medium
- Domain generalization performance claims: High (supported by multiple benchmark datasets)

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the sanity check on single-domain data (MNIST) to verify basic reconstruction capability and loss values ($L_{iv} \approx 0$, $L_v \approx 1$)
2. Implement domain shift experiment (CIFAR-10 → CINIC-10) to validate the invariant representation's generalization capability and compare classification accuracy drop
3. Test sparse update protocol with varying thresholds κ to identify the optimal balance between semantic channel overhead and reconstruction consistency across devices
