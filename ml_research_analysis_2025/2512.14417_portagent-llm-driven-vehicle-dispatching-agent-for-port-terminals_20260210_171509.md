# PortAgent: LLM-driven Vehicle Dispatching Agent for Port Terminals

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.14417
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14417
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that eliminates specialist dependency and reduces deployment time to 83.23 seconds

## Executive Summary
PortAgent introduces an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent designed to automate transfer of Vehicle Dispatch Systems (VDS) across Automated Container Terminals (ACTs). The system addresses three key transferability bottlenecks in port automation: specialist dependency, high data requirements, and time-consuming deployment. Through a Virtual Expert Team (VET) framework and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, PortAgent enables efficient cross-terminal deployment without requiring domain experts. The system demonstrates high success rates (86.67% to 100%) across different terminal scenarios while maintaining effectiveness independent of user expertise levels.

## Method Summary
The PortAgent system employs a Virtual Expert Team (VET) architecture that decomposes complex vehicle dispatching tasks into specialized sub-tasks. The system utilizes few-shot learning with RAG to minimize data requirements, enabling effective performance with minimal examples. An automatic self-correction workflow, inspired by the LLM Reflexion framework, allows for fast deployment without human intervention. The agent processes MAPP scenarios through iterative refinement cycles, leveraging domain-specific knowledge bases to generate optimized vehicle dispatching solutions. This approach transforms traditional specialist-dependent VDS deployment into an automated, transferable process.

## Key Results
- Achieved 86.67% to 100% success rates across three typical MAPP scenarios
- Demonstrated high data efficiency, requiring only one example to achieve 93.33% success rate
- Reduced deployment time to an average of 83.23 seconds
- Effectiveness proven independent of user expertise level (p > 0.05)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PortAgent works by leveraging LLM capabilities to automate complex reasoning tasks that traditionally required human specialists. The Virtual Expert Team framework breaks down the VDS deployment process into manageable sub-tasks, each handled by specialized components. The RAG mechanism enables the system to access relevant domain knowledge efficiently, while the self-correction workflow allows for continuous refinement without expert intervention. This combination addresses the fundamental bottlenecks of data scarcity and specialist dependency that have historically limited cross-terminal transferability of vehicle dispatching systems.

- LLM Reflexion Framework: Why needed - to enable automatic self-correction without human intervention; Quick check - test correction loop efficiency
- MAPP Scenario Processing: Why needed - to standardize evaluation across different terminal configurations; Quick check - ensure scenario coverage completeness
- Cross-Terminal Transferability: Why needed - to address the core challenge of deploying VDS across different ACTs; Quick check - validate performance consistency

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
PortAgent -> VET Framework -> RAG Mechanism -> Self-Correction Workflow

**Critical Path:**
User Request → VET Task Decomposition → RAG Knowledge Retrieval → Solution Generation → Self-Correction Iteration → Final Output

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The system prioritizes transferability over absolute optimization, accepting potentially sub-optimal solutions that work across terminals rather than terminal-specific optimal solutions. This tradeoff enables broader applicability but may sacrifice some performance in specialized scenarios.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Knowledge gaps in RAG mechanism leading to incomplete solutions
- VET decomposition errors causing task misalignment
- Self-correction loops failing to converge
- Scenario complexity exceeding LLM reasoning capabilities

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Baseline performance test with single terminal scenario
2. Cross-terminal transferability validation with varied configurations
3. Data efficiency evaluation using minimal training examples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to MAPP scenarios, potentially missing real-world complexity
- No assessment of long-term performance degradation or adaptation requirements
- Underlying VET framework effectiveness still depends on initial expert knowledge quality

## Confidence
**High confidence** for core operational claims:
- Success rates across scenarios (86.67%-100%)
- Data efficiency (93.33% success with one example)
- Deployment time (83.23 seconds average)
- Independence from user expertise (p > 0.05)

**Medium confidence** for generalizability claims beyond tested scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Conduct field trials across diverse port environments with varying sizes, vehicle fleet compositions, and operational constraints to assess real-world transferability beyond controlled MAPP scenarios.

2. Perform longitudinal studies tracking PortAgent performance over extended operational periods to evaluate adaptation requirements and potential degradation in dynamic port environments.

3. Implement controlled experiments comparing PortAgent against human expert performance across a broader range of operational scenarios, including edge cases and emergency situations not covered in the initial evaluation.
