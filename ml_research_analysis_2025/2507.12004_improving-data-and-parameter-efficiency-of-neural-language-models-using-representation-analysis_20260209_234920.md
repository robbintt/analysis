## Quick Facts

- Key outcome: Novel methods to improve data and parameter efficiency of neural language models through representation analysis

## Executive Summary
This thesis presents three novel methods to enhance the data and parameter efficiency of neural language models (NLMs) through representation analysis. The contributions include JACHESS, a smoothness-informed regularization framework that improves robustness by enforcing smooth representations via Jacobian and Hessian norms; BEAST, an early stopping method for fine-tuning PLMs that eliminates the need for labeled validation data by monitoring representation smoothness; and WILDA, a weak supervision framework that disentangles latent shifts in in-context learning by encoding demonstration knowledge into adapter modules. Empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in generalization, stability, and efficiency across diverse NLP tasks, particularly in low-resource settings.

## Method Summary
The thesis introduces three complementary approaches: JACHESS applies regularization to minimize the Frobenius norms of Jacobian and Hessian matrices during training, using Hutchinson's estimator for computational efficiency. BEAST monitors the skewness of layer-wise Besov smoothness distributions to predict overfitting onset without requiring labeled validation data. WILDA implements a teacher-student framework where a frozen LLM generates pseudo-labels through in-context learning, and a student model with adapter modules learns to disentangle the latent shift from demonstrations. These methods are evaluated on GLUE benchmark tasks with models ranging from BERT to 6.7B parameter OPT and Llama variants.

## Key Results
- JACHESS improves model calibration and robustness to perturbations through smoothness-enforced regularization
- BEAST eliminates the need for labeled validation sets in active learning through smoothness-based early stopping
- WILDA achieves stable few-shot learning performance by encoding in-context learning knowledge into adapter modules

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Smoothness-Enforced Regularization (JACHESS)
- **Claim:** Minimizing Jacobian and Hessian norms stabilizes representations, improving calibration and robustness
- **Mechanism:** JACHESS uses Hutchinson's estimator to approximate Frobenius norms of input-output Jacobians and Hessians, adding these as regularization terms to penalize large sensitivity changes
- **Core assumption:** High Frobenius norms correlate with brittleness and overfitting; reducing them forces smoother, more generalizable features
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions "regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices"; section 4.1 describes minimizing $||J||_F$ and $||H||_F$; corpus supports link between spectral bias and parameter efficiency
- **Break condition:** Too high regularization factors cause underfitting and flattened loss landscapes

### Mechanism 2: Smoothness-Based Early Stopping (BEAST)
- **Claim:** Skewness of layer-wise Besov smoothness distributions predicts overfitting onset without labeled validation data
- **Mechanism:** BEAST monitors Fisher-Pearson coefficient of smoothness distribution across transformer layers, stopping when skewness stops increasing
- **Core assumption:** Geometrical smoothness of internal representations correlates more reliably with generalization than validation loss in low-resource regimes
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states method eliminates "need for labeled validation sets"; section 6.2 details stopping when skewness stops increasing
- **Break condition:** In shallow networks or noisy data, skewness signal may be unstable, causing premature stopping

### Mechanism 3: Weak Supervision for Disentanglement (WILDA)
- **Claim:** Distilling in-context knowledge from teacher to parameter-efficient student adapter stabilizes few-shot learning
- **Mechanism:** WILDA uses frozen LLM teacher to generate pseudo-labels from demonstrations, student (LLM + adapter) fine-tunes on pseudo-labels using only query text
- **Core assumption:** Latent shift from demonstrations is independent of query and capturable by low-rank adapter update
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract describes using "in-context learning as mechanism for weak supervision"; section 10.2 explains encoding ICL-induced knowledge into adapters
- **Break condition:** If teacher hallucinates or domain shift is too large, pseudo-labels degrade student performance

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Lipschitz Continuity & Smoothness**
- **Why needed here:** Mathematical foundation for JACHESS and BEAST; understanding why penalizing Jacobian norms improves robustness
- **Quick check question:** If I double the input perturbation, does the output change by less than a factor of $L$? (If yes, you have bounded sensitivity)

**Concept: Besov Spaces**
- **Why needed here:** Required to interpret BEAST stopping criterion; generalizes smoothness to allow spatially inhomogeneous signals
- **Quick check question:** Why would standard Euclidean smoothness fail to capture the "jaggedness" of deep learning representations compared to Besov smoothness index?

**Concept: Teacher-Student Distillation**
- **Why needed here:** Essential for implementing WILDA; understanding transfer of teacher behavior to student
- **Quick check question:** What is the difference between hard-label distillation and soft-logit matching, and which does WILDA rely on?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Input: Tokenized Text -> Core: Transformer-based PLM -> Regulator: JACHESS -> Stopper: BEAST -> Adaptor: LoRA/Adapter -> Teacher: Frozen LLM

**Critical path:**
1. Fine-tune Core on small labeled set
2. Wrap Core with JACHESS to regularize representations
3. Monitor layer smoothness with BEAST to determine epoch cutoff
4. (Optional/Advanced) Apply WILDA: Freeze Core, use Teacher to generate pseudo-labels, train Adaptor only

**Design tradeoffs:**
- JACHESS: Compute cost (Hessian/Jacobian estimation) vs. robustness and calibration
- WILDA: Upfront training time (pseudo-label generation) vs. inference speed (no context window for demos)
- AL + PEFT: Annotation cost vs. more complex training loops (iterative sampling)

**Failure signatures:**
- Loss plateau: JACHESS regularization factors too high, model stops learning
- Premature Stop: BEAST triggers too early with noisy warm-start data
- Hallucination propagation: WILDA Student overfits to noisy Teacher pseudo-labels

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Sanity Check: Fine-tune BERT on GLUE with and without JACHESS, compare standard accuracy vs. accuracy under token corruption
2. Efficiency Baseline: Implement Active Learning with random vs. Entropy sampling, using BEAST for early stopping, measure Label Complexity Reduction
3. Weak Supervision Test: Implement WILDA using Llama 3 as Teacher and Llama 3 + LoRA as Student, compare 16-shot ICL vs. 0-shot WILDA performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: Does JACHESS regularization yield similar improvements for structured prediction and generative NLP tasks?
- Basis in paper: Explicit statement that "broader applicability of JACHESS to more complex NLP tasks... remains an open question" (Section 11.1)
- Why unresolved: Empirical evaluation focused exclusively on GLUE benchmark tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying JACHESS to named entity recognition, dependency parsing, or machine translation tasks

**Open Question 2**
- Question: Is there a formal theoretical link between representation smoothness, model uncertainty, and active learning efficiency?
- Basis in paper: Explicit statement that "further theoretical work is needed to establish a formal link between smoothness, model uncertainty, and AL efficiency" (Section 11.2)
- Why unresolved: While empirical results suggest correlation, mathematical characterization is absent
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical derivation proving smoothness minimization directly minimizes label complexity bounds

**Open Question 3**
- Question: To what extent does TAPT remain effective in low-resource settings when in-domain unlabeled data is scarce?
- Basis in paper: Explicit identification that "extent to which TAPT remains effective when in-domain data is scarce is an open question" (Section 11.3)
- Why unresolved: TAPT benefits were not tested in scenarios where domain-relevant text is the primary constraint
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring AL performance with TAPT using varying amounts of out-of-domain or synthetic unlabeled data

## Limitations
- JACHESS requires careful hyperparameter tuning of regularization factors, with sensitivity to dataset characteristics untested
- BEAST relies on Besov smoothness approximation through random forests, but specific implementation details are not provided
- WILDA's effectiveness depends heavily on teacher model quality, with no discussion of hallucination detection or correction mechanisms

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core mathematical framework for JACHESS is well-established and implementation details are sufficiently specified for reproduction

**Medium Confidence**: BEAST early stopping mechanism shows promise but requires additional Besov smoothness approximation details; generalization beyond GLUE unclear

**Medium Confidence**: WILDA's teacher-student framework is conceptually sound but lacks detailed prompt templates and hallucination handling procedures

## Next Checks

1. **Smoothness Generalization Test**: Evaluate JACHESS and BEAST on out-of-distribution datasets (e.g., applying GLUE models to BioBERT tasks) to verify generalization beyond training distribution

2. **Computational Overhead Benchmark**: Measure wall-clock time and memory overhead of JACHESS compared to standard fine-tuning across different model sizes (125M to 6.7B parameters)

3. **Teacher Quality Ablation**: Implement WILDA with multiple teacher models of varying quality (including deliberately corrupted teacher) to measure impact of teacher hallucination on student performance and identify failure thresholds
