# MoXGATE: Modality-aware cross-attention for multi-omic gastrointestinal cancer sub-type classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.06980
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06980
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Achieves 95% classification accuracy and 0.94 F1-score on multi-omic GI cancer subtype classification

## Executive Summary
MoXGATE introduces a modality-aware cross-attention framework for multi-omic cancer subtype classification that addresses the challenge of integrating heterogeneous genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data. The method employs modality-specific self-attention encoders followed by a modality-weighted cross-attention mechanism that captures inter-modality dependencies. Learnable modality weights adaptively balance the contribution of each omic source, while focal loss mitigates class imbalance in cancer subtyping datasets. Evaluated on GIAC and breast cancer datasets from TCGA, MoXGATE achieves 95% classification accuracy and 0.94 F1-score, outperforming existing baselines and demonstrating strong generalization to unseen cancer types.

## Method Summary
MoXGATE processes three omic modalities (gene expression, methylation, miRNA) through separate self-attention encoders, then fuses them using cross-attention with learnable modality weights. The architecture includes modality-specific linear projections followed by self-attention (8 heads, 0.1 dropout), cross-attention fusion (32 heads, 256 embedding dim), and a classifier with ReLU and dropout (0.3). Training uses focal loss (γ=2) with modality weight regularization and AdamW optimizer (lr=1e-4, weight_decay=1e-2). The model is evaluated on TCGA GIAC cohorts (COAD, READ, STAD for training; ESCA for testing) and breast cancer subtypes.

## Key Results
- Achieves 95% classification accuracy and 0.94 F1-score on GIAC molecular subtype classification
- Outperforms AE+Cross Attn (72% accuracy) and moBRCANet (93% accuracy) baselines
- Methylation and gene expression identified as dominant modalities for subtype discrimination
- Demonstrates strong generalization to breast cancer subtypes with 89% accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Cross-attention fusion captures inter-modality dependencies more effectively than simple concatenation
- **Mechanism:** Cross-attention computes query-key-value projections across stacked modality representations, allowing the model to learn which features from one omic type inform features in another
- **Core assumption:** Inter-modality dependencies exist and are learnable through attention weights
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "modality-weighted cross-attention mechanism that captures inter-modality dependencies"; [Page 5, Table 1] AE + Cross Attn achieves 72% accuracy vs. proposed approach at 95%

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Learnable modality weights adaptively prioritize discriminative omic sources during fusion
- **Mechanism:** Weights $w = [w_1, w_2, w_3]$ with $\sum w_i = 1$ are initialized uniformly and updated via gradient descent with regularization
- **Core assumption:** Modality importance is consistent across samples (global weights)
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 4, Eq. 10-11] Explicit formulation of learnable weights; [Page 5, Table 2] Methylation alone achieves 95% accuracy

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Focal loss mitigates class imbalance by down-weighting well-classified majority classes
- **Mechanism:** $L_{focal} = -\sum \alpha_i (1-p_i)^\gamma y_i \log p_i$ with $\gamma=2$ reduces loss contribution from easy examples
- **Core assumption:** Class imbalance exists and standard cross-entropy loss is dominated by majority classes
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 4, Eq. 13] Focal loss formulation; [Page 4] "Given the high class imbalance in cancer subtyping datasets, we utilize focal loss"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Multi-head self-attention
  - **Why needed here:** Self-attention encodes modality-specific features by computing attention weights across all feature pairs within each omic type
  - **Quick check question:** Given input $H_m \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$, what is the shape of the attention matrix $A_m$ and what does each entry represent?

- **Concept:** Cross-attention for multimodal fusion
  - **Why needed here:** The core innovation stacks modality embeddings and applies cross-attention to learn inter-modality relationships
  - **Quick check question:** In cross-attention, if $C \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times N \times d}$ represents three stacked modalities, what dimension does the attention matrix operate over?

- **Concept:** Focal loss and class imbalance
  - **Why needed here:** Cancer subtype datasets are often imbalanced; understanding how $\gamma$ controls the focusing effect helps tune the loss
  - **Quick check question:** If $\gamma=0$, what does focal loss reduce to? What happens to the loss for a sample with $p_i=0.9$ when $\gamma=2$ vs. $\gamma=0$?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input → modality-specific linear projection → self-attention → stack modalities → cross-attention → weighted fusion → classifier → focal loss
- **Critical path:** Input → modality-specific linear projection → self-attention → stack modalities → cross-attention → weighted fusion → classifier → focal loss
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - 32 attention heads vs. 8/16: +1% accuracy at higher computational cost
  - Feedforward attention improves performance (+2% over skip connections); BatchNorm degrades it (89% vs. 94%)
  - Global modality weights vs. patient-specific: simpler but less interpretable per-patient
  - Focal loss vs. cross-entropy: essential for imbalanced datasets; may be unnecessary for balanced data

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Accuracy drops to ~72%: Check if cross-attention is replaced with concatenation
  - Accuracy drops to ~89%: Check if BatchNorm is inadvertently added
  - Modality weights collapse to single modality: Check $\lambda_1$ regularization strength
  - Poor minority class performance: Verify focal loss is applied and $\gamma \geq 2$

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce baseline comparison:** Run MoXGATE vs. AE+Cross Attn vs. moBRCAnet on GIAC dataset; verify 95% accuracy is achievable with reported hyperparameters
  2. **Modality ablation:** Train on each modality alone and all pairs; confirm methylation is most discriminative
  3. **Architecture component ablation:** Test with/without BatchNorm, skip connections, and feedforward attention; verify feedforward attention helps and BatchNorm hurts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can patient-specific attention weighting mechanisms improve individualized cancer profiling while maintaining classification accuracy?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "although modality weights provide insight into the relative importance of omics data, they do not explicitly model dynamic feature importance at the patient level"
  - **Why unresolved:** Current learnable modality weights are global across all patients, treating each omic source's importance as fixed rather than adapting to individual tumor biology
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Modified MoXGATE architecture with per-patient attention weights, evaluated on whether it provides clinically actionable insights without degrading 95% accuracy

- **Open Question 2:** How does MoXGATE's computational complexity scale with increasing dataset sizes and feature dimensions compared to simpler fusion methods?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "while cross-attention improves modality fusion, it inherently increases computational complexity, making it less scalable for ultra-large datasets"
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper uses 256-dimensional embeddings with 32 attention heads but does not report training time, memory usage, or scaling behavior
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking MoXGATE against concatenation-based baselines across varying dataset sizes, reporting FLOPs, GPU memory, and wall-clock training time

- **Open Question 3:** Does MoXGATE maintain its performance advantage when applied to cancer types with fundamentally different molecular characteristics beyond GIAC and breast cancer?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Generalization claim relies on testing only on BRCA (89% accuracy) after training on COAD/READ/STAD
  - **Why unresolved:** BRCA and GIAC cancers may share similar modality importance patterns, leaving uncertain whether architecture transfers to cancers where miRNA or other modalities play larger roles
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation on additional TCGA cancer types with reporting of per-modality learned weights and performance comparisons

## Limitations

- **Dimensionality Assumptions:** Paper specifies cross-attention embedding dimension as 256 but does not explicitly state input projection dimension for self-attention encoders
- **Global vs. Patient-Specific Modality Weights:** Method uses fixed global weights rather than patient-adaptive weights, potentially limiting performance when modality importance varies across individuals
- **Class Imbalance Handling Validation:** While focal loss is employed, paper lacks ablation studies comparing focal loss vs. cross-entropy under different imbalance levels

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Cross-attention fusion superiority over concatenation (Table 1 shows 95% vs 72% accuracy)
- **Medium Confidence:** Learnable modality weights effectiveness (supported by Table 2 showing methylation dominance, but lacks patient-specific weight analysis)
- **Medium Confidence:** Focal loss necessity for imbalanced datasets (mentioned as motivation but not empirically validated through ablation)

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce Architecture with Dimensionality Clarification:** Implement MoXGATE with explicit specification of input projection dimensions for self-attention encoders, then validate against reported baseline comparisons

2. **Modality Weight Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary $\lambda_1$ regularization strength and analyze resulting modality weight distributions across different cancer subtypes to assess global weight limitations

3. **Focal Loss Ablation Study:** Compare MoXGATE performance with focal loss ($\gamma=2$) versus standard cross-entropy on datasets with varying class imbalance ratios to quantify focal loss contribution
