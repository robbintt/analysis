# A Multi-Modal Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Spatial Reasoning-Based Visual Grounding in Robotics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.27033
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27033
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves 96.7% mAP improvement on complex spatial reasoning tasks with a lightweight 1.3B parameter model

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of spatial reasoning in robotics where vision-language models struggle with fine-grained spatial understanding due to their implicit, correlation-driven reasoning and reliance solely on images. The proposed solution is a lightweight, multimodal neuro-symbolic framework that integrates panoramic images and 3D point clouds with neural perception and symbolic reasoning. The method constructs a structured scene graph encoding spatial and logical relationships, enabling precise, interpretable queries. Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, the framework demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art VLMs.

## Method Summary
The framework processes stitched panoramic images and 3D point clouds through a two-stage pipeline. First, it extracts bounding boxes using Florence-2 and attributes (age, gender, action) using InternVL3.5. Second, it projects 3D point clouds to 2D image coordinates using camera calibration, computes 3D entity centers, and constructs a scene graph with spatial relation edges. For querying, it employs a hybrid attribute-relational filtering approach: Phase 1 applies majority attribute matching (>50% match threshold) to reduce candidates, while Phase 2 validates spatial relations by traversing graph edges to identify the target entity.

## Key Results
- Achieves 96.7% improvement in mAP for complex spatial reasoning tasks compared to state-of-the-art VLMs
- Maintains compact model size of only 1.3B parameters, suitable for robotics applications
- Demonstrates strong performance in both attribute detection and spatial reasoning tasks on JRDB-Reasoning dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Explicit scene graph construction reduces spatial reasoning errors compared to implicit VLM correlation-based inference. The framework constructs a structured graph G = (V, E) where nodes encode entity attributes and edges encode spatial relations derived from 3D point clouds. This makes reasoning traceable and verifiable. Core assumption: Spatial relationships can be adequately captured through pairwise geometric functions without requiring learned relational priors. Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions structured scene graph encoding spatial and logical relationships; Section III.B provides unified scene graph construction formula.

### Mechanism 2
Two-phase hybrid filtering balances noise tolerance with relational precision. Phase 1 uses "Majority Match" requiring >50% attribute match to retain candidates, providing resilience to individual classification errors. Phase 2 enforces strict relational validation by traversing graph edges, ensuring contextual consistency. Core assumption: Attribute errors are independent and partial; relational constraints are sufficient to disambiguate remaining candidates. Evidence anchors: Section III.C describes majority match strategy providing resilience against minor perception errors.

### Mechanism 3
Fusing 2D semantic features with 3D geometric structure enables metric spatial reasoning unavailable to image-only VLMs. Point cloud P is projected onto 2D image using camera intrinsics K and extrinsics [R|t]. 3D entity centers c_i are computed as means of projected points within each bounding box, enabling explicit distance and orientation calculations. Core assumption: Camera calibration is accurate and point cloud coverage is sufficient within each bounding box. Evidence anchors: Section III.B provides projection equations u_j = K[R|t]p_j and entity center computation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Scene Graph Representation**
  - Why needed here: Core data structure encoding entities as attributed nodes and relationships as typed edges; all reasoning operates over this graph.
  - Quick check question: Can you sketch a scene graph for "a young male standing behind an elderly female"?

- **Concept: Camera Projection Geometry**
  - Why needed here: Required to understand how 3D point clouds map to 2D detections and how spatial relations are derived from fused coordinates.
  - Quick check question: Given intrinsics K and extrinsics [R|t], what happens to projected points if the robot moves forward 1 meter?

- **Concept: Hybrid Filtering with Threshold Tuning**
  - Why needed here: The majority-match threshold (>50%) is a tunable hyperparameter affecting precision-recall tradeoffs in noisy perception settings.
  - Quick check question: If attribute classification accuracy drops to 60%, what adjustment might be needed to the filtering threshold?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (panoramic image I, point cloud P, query Q) -> Feature Extraction (Florence for boxes, InternVL3.5 for attributes) -> Projection (3D-2D mapping, 3D center computation) -> Scene Graph (nodes with attributes, edges with spatial relations) -> Graph Search (sentence parsing, two-phase filtering, output)

- **Critical path:** Query parsing correctness → Phase 1 attribute matching → Phase 2 relational traversal. Errors in parsing or attribute extraction cascade through both phases.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Explicit vs. implicit reasoning: Gains interpretability and 96.7% mAP improvement on spatial tasks, but requires calibrated sensors and reliable detection. Lightweight (1.3B params) vs. larger VLMs: Lower compute but depends on modular component quality; Florence and InternVL3.5 are frozen backbones.

- **Failure signatures:** Attribute extraction errors from InternVL3.5 (acknowledged limitation), sparse point clouds producing empty π(b_i) sets, ambiguous queries where multiple subgraphs satisfy parsed constraints, incorrect camera calibration causing misaligned projections.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Unit test the projection module: Synthesize known 3D positions, project through calibrated camera, verify 2D-3D correspondence and spatial relation accuracy.
  2. Ablate the two-phase filtering: Run queries with only Phase 1 and only Phase 2 on JRDB-Reasoning validation set to quantify each phase's contribution to mAP.
  3. Stress test with noisy attributes: Artificially corrupt InternVL3.5 attribute outputs at varying noise levels to identify the break-even point where Phase 1 filtering degrades final accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the framework's attribute extraction robustness be significantly improved to overcome the current constraints imposed by the underlying LLM backbone capabilities? Basis: The Conclusion explicitly states the attribute extraction is constrained by current LLM capabilities. Why unresolved: The paper identifies this bottleneck but doesn't propose methods to decouple system performance from perception model error rates. What evidence would resolve it: A study showing enhanced end-to-end accuracy by integrating fine-tuned or specialized perception models.

### Open Question 2
Is the "Majority Match" strategy (>50% attributes) optimal for all query complexities, or does it introduce high false-positive rates in scenes with ambiguous attributes? Basis: Section III.C describes the "Majority Match" heuristic as a design choice without ablation study on threshold sensitivity. Why unresolved: Fixed >50% threshold assumes baseline perception accuracy that may not hold in diverse conditions. What evidence would resolve it: Ablation experiments showing precision-recall curves across varying threshold values (30% to 80%) on JRDB-Reasoning.

### Open Question 3
How does the static scene graph representation perform in dynamic environments where temporal consistency of spatial relations is required? Basis: The paper evaluates on JRDB-Reasoning and claims suitability for "embodied AI" but doesn't address maintaining graph consistency during robot movement. Why unresolved: Real-world robotics requires updating spatial relations in real-time as the agent moves. What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the framework's latency and consistency in a video-based simulation with continuous viewpoint changes.

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on accurate camera calibration and dense point clouds; sparse or occluded point clouds break 3D center computation
- Critical spatial relation thresholds (for "close," "front," "left/right") are underspecified, making exact reproduction difficult
- Sentence parser that converts natural language queries into structured graph constraints is completely unspecified
- Attribute extraction errors from InternVL3.5 cascade through the two-phase filtering even with correct graph structure

## Confidence

**Major Uncertainties and Limitations:**
The framework's reliance on accurate camera calibration and dense point clouds presents significant practical constraints. Sparse or occluded point clouds directly break the 3D center computation, propagating errors to all spatial relations. The spatial relation function f_geo is underspecified - critical thresholds for "close," "front," "left/right" are not provided, making exact reproduction difficult. The sentence parser that converts natural language queries into structured graph constraints is completely unspecified, representing a potentially major implementation gap. Additionally, the method explicitly acknowledges InternVL3.5 attribute extraction errors as a limitation, which could cascade through the two-phase filtering even with correct graph structure.

**Confidence Assessment:**
- **High Confidence:** The neuro-symbolic scene graph approach with explicit spatial encoding is well-supported and demonstrated effective (96.7% mAP improvement on complex spatial reasoning tasks).
- **Medium Confidence:** The two-phase hybrid filtering mechanism is theoretically sound but depends heavily on the unspecified f_geo thresholds and sentence parser implementation details.
- **Low Confidence:** Exact reproduction feasibility due to missing specifications for spatial relation thresholds, sentence parsing methodology, and handling of edge cases like sparse point clouds or occluded detections.

## Next Checks

1. **Test spatial relation threshold sensitivity:** Systematically vary f_geo thresholds for "close," "front," and "left/right" on JRDB-Reasoning validation data to identify which thresholds most impact mAP performance.

2. **Benchmark attribute extraction robustness:** Measure how attribute classification noise from InternVL3.5 affects final grounding accuracy across varying noise levels to quantify the impact of this acknowledged limitation.

3. **Evaluate failure modes under sensor degradation:** Create controlled experiments with artificially sparse point clouds and perturbed camera calibrations to map the framework's performance boundaries and identify failure signatures.
