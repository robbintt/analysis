# AutoSCORE: Enhancing Automated Scoring with Multi-Agent Large Language Models via Structured Component Recognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.21910
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21910
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Primary result:** Multi-agent LLM framework improves automated scoring accuracy and human-machine agreement compared to single-agent baselines.

## Executive Summary
AutoSCORE introduces a novel multi-agent framework for automated scoring that addresses the limitations of single LLM scoring by decomposing the task into structured component recognition followed by scoring. The framework employs two specialized agents: one that extracts rubric-relevant components from student responses into structured JSON format, and another that assigns final scores using these extracted components. Tested across four ASAP benchmark datasets using multiple LLM sizes (GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.1-70B), AutoSCORE demonstrates consistent improvements in scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement metrics (QWK, correlations), and error reduction (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent baselines. The approach is particularly effective for complex, multi-dimensional rubrics and shows substantial relative gains for smaller LLMs, offering a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated educational assessment.

## Method Summary
AutoSCORE implements a two-agent pipeline where the first agent (Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent) takes the student response and rubric to output a structured JSON representation of identified rubric components. The second agent (Scoring Agent) then uses this JSON, along with the original response and rubric, to predict the final score. The framework was evaluated on four ASAP benchmark datasets (ASAP-SAS Science, Biology, English subsets, and ASAP-AES Essay Set #1) using GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B models. The method employs carefully engineered prompts to force JSON output from the extraction agent and to constrain the scoring agent's reasoning path through the structured intermediate representation.

## Key Results
- AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK, correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent baselines
- The framework demonstrates particularly strong benefits for complex, multi-dimensional rubrics
- AutoSCORE shows especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs, narrowing the performance gap with larger models
- Structured intermediate representations significantly improve scoring alignment and reduce rubric misalignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Intermediate Structured Representation
Converting unstructured student responses into JSON-formatted rubric components before scoring appears to improve scoring accuracy and alignment. The Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent forces the model to explicitly identify discrete evidence defined by the rubric, reducing the chance of overlooking specific criteria or relying on holistic "vibes." This structuring step effectively grounds the final score in extracted evidence. The core assumption is that the LLM can reliably parse text into the specified JSON schema while preserving necessary semantic information. Evidence anchors include the abstract's description of the extraction-to-encoding process and methodology's emphasis on transparent reasoning. Break condition: if the extraction agent frequently hallucinates components or produces invalid JSON for edge-case responses, the pipeline fails.

### Mechanism 2: Reasoning Path Constraint
Decomposing the task into two distinct agents constrains the reasoning trajectory to better resemble human grading logic. By splitting the process into "identify evidence" and "assign score," the framework forces the model through a specific intermediate state (the JSON representation) that acts as a checkpoint aligning the model's reasoning path with sequential human grading steps. This potentially reduces spurious correlations by aligning intermediate processing states with human logic. Core assumption: aligning the model's intermediate states with human logic directly translates to higher QWK and accuracy. Evidence anchors include the methodology's discussion of constrained reasoning paths and the introduction's comparison to trained human raters. Break condition: if the scoring agent ignores the provided JSON or prioritizes its own reasoning over structured input, the constraint mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 3: Task Decomposition for Smaller Models
The multi-agent architecture provides significant relative performance gains for smaller models (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B) compared to single-agent baselines. Complex grading tasks may exceed the single-shot reasoning capacity of smaller LLMs. Breaking the problem into simpler extraction and scoring tasks reduces complexity per inference step, allowing smaller models to perform closer to larger proprietary models. Core assumption: the performance bottleneck for smaller models in end-to-end scoring is task complexity/depth, which is alleviated by decomposition. Evidence anchors include the abstract's note on especially large relative gains and the model-level analysis section. Break condition: if latency costs of two inference steps outweigh performance benefits for latency-sensitive applications, though the paper argues accuracy trade-off is worth it.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Rubric-Component Mapping**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire framework depends on defining what "components" exist in a rubric. You must be able to break a rubric into extractable JSON keys before implementing the agents.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a rubric score of "3 points for 2 valid examples and an explanation," what keys would you define in your JSON schema?

- **Concept: LLM Structured Output (JSON Mode)**
  - **Why needed here:** The Extraction Agent must output valid JSON reliably. Understanding how to force LLMs to output strict syntax is critical for the Scoring Agent to read the input.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the prompt enforce that the output is a valid JSON object rather than a text description of one?

- **Concept: Error Propagation in Pipelines**
  - **Why needed here:** This is a sequential pipeline. If Agent 1 misses a component, Agent 2 cannot score it. Understanding this dependency is vital for debugging scoring issues.
  - **Quick check question:** If a student writes a correct answer but uses synonyms the Extraction Agent wasn't instructed to find, how would this affect the final score?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (Task Context + Student Response) -> Extraction Agent (outputs JSON) -> Scoring Agent (outputs final score)

- **Critical path:** The definition of the JSON schema in the Extraction Agent prompt. If the schema does not fully cover the rubric's criteria, the Scoring Agent will lack necessary evidence to assign the correct score.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Latency vs. Accuracy:** Inference time roughly doubles (two serial LLM calls). The paper shows improved QWK but significant time increases (e.g., from ~5s to ~15s on some models).
  - **Simplicity vs. Robustness:** The paper notes that on simple tasks (like the Biology subset), the overhead of extraction introduced noise or offered negligible benefit ("ceiling effect"). AutoSCORE is best suited for complex, multi-dimensional rubrics.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **JSON Syntax Errors:** Extraction Agent produces text instead of JSON, crashing the pipeline.
  - **Component Hallucination:** Extraction Agent identifies components not present in student text.
  - **Rubric Mismatch:** Extraction Agent identifies text correctly, but Scoring Agent fails to map component presence to correct score point.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Schema Validation:** Run Extraction Agent on 20 samples with human review. Do not proceed to Scoring Agent implementation until JSON extraction F1 score is acceptable (>0.8).
  2. **Single vs. Multi-Agent Baseline:** Compare AutoSCORE pipeline against single-prompt baseline on held-out test set. Measure ΔQWK and ΔLatency.
  3. **Ablation on Rubric Complexity:** Test system on simple rubric (1-2 criteria) vs. complex one (4+ criteria) to verify if complexity trade-off holds for your specific domain.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does the AutoSCORE framework yield similar performance gains when applied to reasoning-oriented LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-o1) compared to the standard models tested?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion notes experiments "primarily focus on non-reasoning LLMs" and states that "evaluating AutoSCORE on such models warrants further investigation."
- **Why unresolved:** The architectural differences in reasoning models may inherently align with rubric-guided paths, potentially reducing the relative benefit of the multi-agent decomposition.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking AutoSCORE against single-agent baselines using reasoning models on the ASAP datasets to compare the performance gap.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What is the impact of deploying AutoSCORE in authentic classroom settings on student learning outcomes, teacher workload, and assessment reliability?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that AutoSCORE "has not yet been deployed in a real classroom" and that "future validation in authentic classrooms will be crucial."
- **Why unresolved:** Current results are derived from static benchmark datasets and do not capture dynamic variables of live educational environments or longitudinal use.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Field studies or pilot programs in schools measuring grading time reduction and pedagogical impact of generated feedback.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the AutoSCORE framework be effectively extended to process and score multimodal student inputs, such as images and audio?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Discussion identifies the limitation that "our work is limited to text-based assessments" and calls extending to "multimodal inputs" an "important direction."
- **Why unresolved:** The current methodology relies on text-based Component Extraction Agent and JSON structuring, which lack defined mechanisms for non-textual data.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An adapted framework capable of extracting components from visual or audio data and performance metrics on multimodal assessment tasks.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** To what extent do optional Verification and Feedback Agents enhance the quality control and interpretability of the scoring process?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Methodology section mentions these optional agents but states, "We leave a detailed investigation of the optional modules for future work."
- **Why unresolved:** The reported experiments isolate the two core agents (Extraction and Scoring) to establish a baseline, leaving the utility of auxiliary agents unquantified.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study including these agents to measure improvements in scoring accuracy (QWK) and qualitative validity of feedback provided.

## Limitations
- Prompt templates for both agents are not provided, requiring significant manual engineering for reproduction
- Performance gains are most pronounced for complex, multi-dimensional rubrics; may offer negligible benefit for simple 1-2 criterion tasks
- Sequential pipeline architecture creates error propagation risk where extraction errors directly impact scoring accuracy

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of task decomposition improving smaller model performance; observation that structured intermediate representations improve scoring alignment
- **Medium Confidence:** General scalability claims across diverse rubric types; assertion that the framework is "scalable, reliable, and interpretable"
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability to non-ASAP datasets and rubrics with substantially different structures than those tested

## Next Checks
1. **Schema Coverage Validation:** Manually review 50 random JSON extractions from the Extraction Agent to verify that all rubric components are consistently captured without hallucination
2. **Latency-Cost Tradeoff Measurement:** Implement both single-agent and AutoSCORE pipelines on identical hardware, measuring QWK improvement versus doubling of inference time to quantify practical overhead
3. **Rubric Complexity Ablation:** Systematically test the framework on a simple rubric (1-2 criteria) versus the complex rubrics used in the paper to empirically verify the claimed ceiling effect and validate the framework's appropriate application domain
