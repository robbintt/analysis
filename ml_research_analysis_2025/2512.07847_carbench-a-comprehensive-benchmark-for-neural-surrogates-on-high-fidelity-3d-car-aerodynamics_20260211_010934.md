# CarBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Neural Surrogates on High-Fidelity 3D Car Aerodynamics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.07847
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07847
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Transformer-based architectures (AB-UPT, TransolverLarge) achieve highest predictive accuracy (Rel L2 ~13-15%) for 3D car aerodynamics while maintaining computational efficiency

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CarBench, the first standardized benchmark for learning-based automotive aerodynamics, evaluating eleven models on DrivAerNet++, the largest public 3D car aerodynamics dataset. The benchmark establishes a unified evaluation framework with standardized data splits, metrics, and training protocols. Results demonstrate that transformer-based architectures, particularly AB-UPT and TransolverLarge, achieve the highest predictive accuracy with relative L2 errors around 13-15%, while also offering strong computational efficiency. The work provides a rigorous, physics-grounded foundation for reproducible progress in data-driven aerodynamic design and surrogate modeling.

## Method Summary
The benchmark evaluates eleven neural architectures on predicting surface pressure fields from 3D car geometries using the DrivAerNet++ dataset (8,150 CFD simulations). Models operate on 10,000-point surface samples with coordinates and normals as input features. The evaluation uses standardized training/test splits (5,819/1,154 samples), unified training protocols with early stopping and mixed precision, and comprehensive metrics including Relative L2 Error, R², and computational efficiency measures. The benchmark covers both interpolation and cross-category generalization tasks across three vehicle archetypes (Fastback, Estateback, Notchback).

## Key Results
- Transformer-based architectures (AB-UPT, TransolverLarge) achieve highest predictive accuracy with Rel L2 errors around 13-15%
- Dataset size dominates geometric diversity for cross-category generalization—larger homogeneous training sets outperform smaller diverse ones
- All models degrade 15-30% when interpolating from 10K subsampled points to full 487K mesh resolution
- Slice-based attention mechanisms provide optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for 3D aerodynamic field prediction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Physics-aware slice-based attention reduces computational complexity while maintaining global receptive fields
Transformer architectures with slice-based attention achieve superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs by distributing points across learned slices and operating attention on slice tokens rather than all point pairs. This reduces complexity from O(N²d) to O(NG + G²d) while preserving global context for dense surface field regression. The mechanism assumes aerodynamic fields exhibit spatial coherence capturable through learned grouping.

### Mechanism 2: Dataset scale dominates diversity for cross-category generalization
Large training sets (4000+ samples) provide sufficient coverage of aerodynamic modes within single archetypes, enabling learned representations to transfer across vehicle categories. Small diverse sets lack statistical coverage of the joint geometry-flow distribution. The mechanism assumes aerodynamic phenomena share common physical patterns across categories when sufficient data enables learning transferable flow representations.

### Mechanism 3: Implicit triplane representations enable resolution-agnostic field reconstruction
Triplane-based implicit networks achieve competitive accuracy with explicit point-cloud methods by projecting 3D geometry onto three orthogonal feature planes, bilinearly sampling from these planes, and decoding via MLP. This decouples output resolution from input representation, assuming surface aerodynamic fields vary smoothly enough that triplane features provide sufficient basis for reconstruction.

## Foundational Learning

- **Point cloud representations for 3D geometric learning**
  - Why needed here: All models operate on 10,000-point surface samples requiring understanding of permutation invariance and local neighborhood construction
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why PointNet uses global max pooling and how this differs from k-NN graph construction in RegDGCNN?

- **Neural operators for physics surrogate modeling**
  - Why needed here: Fourier Neural Operator represents spectral convolution approach; understanding kernel learning in frequency domain explains high throughput but lower accuracy
  - Quick check question: Why does operating in Fourier space limit the ability to capture localized flow features?

- **Transformer attention mechanisms for irregular domains**
  - Why needed here: Slice-based (Transolver), anchor-based (AB-UPT), and local k-NN (PointTransformer) attention represent different trade-offs demonstrated by benchmark
  - Quick check question: How does soft assignment to slices differ from hard clustering, and what gradient flow benefits does it provide?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** 3D coordinates + surface normals → 6D features per point → Encoder (architecture-specific) → Processor (attention/convolution blocks) → Decoder (per-point regression head) → Scalar pressure field

- **Critical path:** 1) Sample 10,000 points from CFD surface mesh 2) Normalize pressure using training-set statistics 3) Forward pass through surrogate model 4) Denormalize predictions for metric computation 5) Interpolate to full mesh (487K points) for high-resolution evaluation

- **Design tradeoffs:** Accuracy vs. efficiency (AB-UPT: best accuracy, Rel L2 0.136, 31ms latency; Transolver++: best compactness, 1.81M params, Rel L2 0.157), Memory vs. expressiveness (RegDGCNN: 27GB memory vs PointNet: 0.29GB), Resolution fidelity (15-30% degradation from subsampled to full mesh)

- **Failure signatures:** High-curvature regions show localized artifacts in point-based models, stagnation zones and wake regions exhibit elevated P95-P99 errors, cross-category transfer can double Rel L2 error (0.25→0.50) when distributions misalign

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Train PointNet and Transolver on provided training split; verify Rel L2 within reported confidence intervals 2) Evaluate predictions at both 10K subsampled and full 487K mesh resolution; quantify interpolation error contribution 3) Train Transolver on Fastbacks only (4,224 samples); evaluate on Estatebacks+Notchbacks to test generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. Can neural surrogates accurately predict global aerodynamic coefficients (e.g., drag, lift) and flow topology descriptors without direct supervision on these integrals? The current benchmark focuses exclusively on surface-level kinematic pressure fields, leaving the relationship between pointwise error and accurate global force coefficients unquantified.

2. Can architectures be adapted to train and infer directly on full-resolution meshes (~500k points) to eliminate the performance degradation observed in subsampling-to-full-mesh interpolation? All models were trained on 10,000 subsampled points, creating a resolution gap where models fail to capture high-frequency geometric details.

3. How do current state-of-the-art architectures perform when extended to volumetric flow field estimation and unsteady flow regimes? The benchmark restricts evaluation to steady-state RANS surface pressure, leaving efficacy for transient phenomena or 3D volume predictions unknown.

## Limitations

- Benchmark's strongest claims about transformer superiority rely on comparisons with models not retrained under identical conditions—AB-UPT and TripNet use author-provided checkpoints
- Cross-category generalization results may overstate robustness since ablation studies show severe degradation when test archetypes are completely absent from training
- All models suffer substantial resolution-dependent degradation (15-30%) when interpolating from 10K subsampled points to full 487K mesh resolution

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Relative performance rankings among PointNet, RegDGCNN, NeuralOperator, Transolver family models (reproduced under unified protocol). Claims about computational efficiency trade-offs and memory requirements are well-supported.
- **Medium confidence:** Claims about transformer architectures achieving best accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. While Transolver and AB-UPT show superior metrics, AB-UPT results use external checkpoints.
- **Medium confidence:** Claims about dataset size dominating geometric diversity for generalization. Results show strong evidence but don't fully isolate whether learned representations capture transferable physical patterns versus memorization.
- **Low confidence:** Claims about cross-category generalization robustness. The benchmark shows generalization works when archetypes share common features, but provides limited evidence for truly unseen categories.

## Next Checks

1. **Full reproducibility test:** Retrain AB-UPT and TripNet using the unified pipeline to verify their reported metrics hold under identical conditions. Compare with checkpoint results to quantify any training protocol effects.

2. **Extreme generalization probe:** Create training/test splits where no Fastback samples exist in training (only Estateback + Notchback). Measure whether models can generalize to Fastbacks at all, testing the limits of learned transferability.

3. **Resolution-fidelity correlation:** Systematically evaluate each model's performance across multiple sampling densities (1K, 5K, 10K, 50K points) to quantify the relationship between input resolution and output accuracy. Identify the point of diminishing returns for each architecture.
