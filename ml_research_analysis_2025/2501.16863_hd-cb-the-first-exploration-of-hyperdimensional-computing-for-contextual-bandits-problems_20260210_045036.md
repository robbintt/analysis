# HD-CB: The First Exploration of Hyperdimensional Computing for Contextual Bandits Problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.16863
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16863
- Reference count: 40
- First exploration of Hyperdimensional Computing for Contextual Bandits, replacing matrix operations with parallel vector computations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Hyperdimensional Contextual Bandits (HD-CB), the first application of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) to sequential decision-making problems in Contextual Bandits. The approach maps environmental states to high-dimensional hypervectors and represents each action with dedicated hypervectors, enabling simple vector operations instead of computationally expensive ridge regression. Four HD-CB variants are presented, implementing different exploration strategies while reducing memory overhead and hyperparameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HD-CB consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to traditional linear CB algorithms, with particular effectiveness in recommendation systems and resource-constrained environments.

## Method Summary
HD-CB encodes context vectors into high-dimensional hypervectors using random base vectors for feature indices combined with discretized level vectors, then represents each action with dedicated hypervectors. At each iteration, the method estimates expected rewards through cosine similarity between action hypervectors and encoded context hypervectors. Updates are performed via simple bundling operations that accumulate reward-weighted context representations, eliminating the need for matrix inversion. Four variants are proposed: HD-CB_EPS (ε-greedy exploration), HD-CB_UNC1 (confidence-based exploration with smoothing), HD-CB_UNC2 (confidence-based with thinning updates), and HD-CB_UNC3 (memory-efficient permutation-based encoding).

## Key Results
- HD-CB variants consistently achieve competitive or superior performance compared to traditional linear CB algorithms
- HD-CB reduces computational complexity from O(d³) to O(D) for context size d and hypervector dimension D
- Memory-efficient variants (UNC3) reduce storage from 2N hypervectors to 2 hypervectors with minimal performance loss
- Recommendation system experiments show HD-CB achieves significantly higher average rewards as the number of actions increases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: High-dimensional projection enables linear separability of context-action relationships.
- Mechanism: Random base vectors for feature indices combined with discretized level vectors create quasi-orthogonal hypervectors. Similar context values map to similar HVs; dissimilar contexts map to nearly orthogonal HVs, enabling efficient similarity-based reward estimation via δ(Aa, Xt,a).
- Core assumption: Context-reward relationships can be approximated as linear combinations in the projected high-dimensional space.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "maps environmental states in a high-dimensional space and represents each action with dedicated hypervectors"; [section II.B] "fundamental concepts, symbols, or elements of a problem can be mapped to random HVs that result nearly orthogonal—i.e., linearly independent—thanks to the mathematical properties of high-dimensional spaces"; [corpus] Related HDC work (THDC, FactorHD) confirms separability benefits but does not provide independent validation for bandit-specific tasks.
- Break condition: When context dimensions exceed effective encoding capacity (small D) or when reward functions are highly non-linear in the original feature space.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bundling operations accumulate reward-weighted context representations without matrix inversion.
- Mechanism: The update rule Aat = Aat ⊕ (Xt,a ⊗ Rt,a t) binds context to reward magnitude via thermometer encoding, then superimposes onto the action's representative vector. This replaces ridge regression's O(d³) matrix operations with O(D) vector additions.
- Core assumption: Reward magnitude can be meaningfully encoded as hypervector similarity through thermometer encoding (more active elements = higher reward).
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "replacing computationally expensive ridge regression procedures required by traditional linear CB algorithms with simple, highly parallel vector operations"; [section III.A] "Rt,a t is generated using a thermometer encoding technique where the number of active elements increases with the magnitude of the scalar value"; [corpus] No direct corpus comparison of bundling vs. matrix inversion efficiency in bandit settings.
- Break condition: When reward distributions are multi-modal or when action-context interactions require higher-order representations beyond pairwise binding.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Permutation-based action encoding enables memory-efficient multi-action representation while preserving distinguishability.
- Mechanism: HD-CB UNC3 applies unique permutation ρa to context vectors, creating orthogonal action-context pairs St,a = ρa(Xt,a) that can be superimposed into global vectors MA and MB without interference, reducing storage from 2N HVs to 2 HVs.
- Core assumption: Permutation orthogonality is sufficient to prevent cross-action interference in the superimposed representation.
- Evidence anchors: [section III.E] "This property ensures that context-action pairs remain distinguishable even when multiple pairs are superimposed, eliminating the need for dedicated HVs for each action"; [section IV.F] "HD-CB UNC3 exhibits the highest sensitivity to reductions in HV size... quickly saturates the capacity of the high-dimensional space at lower dimensions"; [corpus] No corpus papers validate permutation-based memory compression for bandits.
- Break condition: When HV dimensionality is too low (<256 in experiments) or when action count exceeds the effective orthogonal capacity of the permutation space.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contextual Bandits (exploration-exploitation tradeoff)
  - Why needed here: The paper assumes familiarity with CB formulation—observing context, selecting actions, receiving rewards—and standard exploration strategies (ε-greedy, UCB) that the HD variants implement.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why LinUCB adds a confidence term to the estimated reward, and what happens if this term is removed?

- Concept: Hyperdimensional Computing primitives (bundling ⊕, binding ⊗, permutation ρ, similarity δ)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these four operations is essential to follow how context encoding, reward binding, and action updates work without matrix operations.
  - Quick check question: Given two random hypervectors A and B in a 10,000-dimensional space, what is the expected cosine similarity, and how does binding differ from bundling in preserving information?

- Concept: Thermometer encoding for scalar-to-vector mapping
  - Why needed here: The reward encoding mechanism converts scalar rewards to HVs where similarity correlates with magnitude—a non-obvious choice affecting learning dynamics.
  - Quick check question: If reward r=0.3 produces a thermometer-encoded HV with 3,000 active elements (out of D=10,000), how many active elements would r=0.8 produce, and what does this imply for the similarity between these encoded rewards?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Encoding Unit -> Action Store -> Similarity Estimator -> Action Selector -> Reward Encoder -> Update Engine

- Critical path: Context arrival → Encoding (dominant cost) → Similarity computation for all actions → Selection → Reward observation → Update. Encoding and similarity scale with O(D) and O(N·D) respectively.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **EPS vs UNC**: EPS has 1 hyperparameter, lowest compute; UNC variants add confidence tracking for better exploration but require 2 HVs per action or additional permutation operations.
  - **UNC1 vs UNC2**: UNC1 requires tuning α₂ smoothing factor; UNC2 eliminates it via thinning but adds random mask generation.
  - **UNC3 memory vs accuracy**: Reduces memory by ~2N× but requires larger D (≥1024) to maintain performance; most sensitive to dimensionality reduction.
  - **HV size D**: Paper shows D=256 retains ~98% of D=10,000 performance for UNC1/2; D<64 degrades all variants significantly.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Slow convergence with high ε/α**: Over-exploration prevents exploitation of learned preferences; tune exploration parameters down.
  - **Poor performance scaling with actions**: In UNC3, indicates D too small for action space; increase D or switch to UNC1/2 with per-action vectors.
  - **Reward estimates saturating near zero or one**: Thermometer encoding range mismatch; verify reward normalization matches encoding levels.
  - **Memory overflow in resource-constrained deployment**: Switch from UNC1/2 to UNC3; accept ~10% accuracy loss per paper's scalability analysis.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation on synthetic data**: Implement HD-CB EPS with D=1000, ε=0.05, N=20 actions, d=10 context features; reproduce paper's ~0.85 average reward over 500 iterations to verify encoding and update correctness.
  2. **Ablation on HV dimensionality**: Run UNC2 with D ∈ {64, 256, 1024, 4096} on same synthetic setup; confirm paper's finding that D=256 achieves <2% degradation vs D=10,000.
  3. **Real benchmark test**: Apply HD-CB UNC2 to MovieLens-100k (binarized ratings) with N=200 movies; compare average reward against LinUCB baseline to validate claimed 0.824 vs 0.821 advantage (paper Fig. 7).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a hybrid HD-CB approach, where shared hypervectors capture relationships across actions, improve efficiency and effectiveness compared to per-action hypervectors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "developing a hybrid HD-CB approach, where shared hypervectors capture shared relationships across actions, drawing inspiration from traditional Hybrid LinUCB models, could further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the framework."
- Why unresolved: All four proposed HD-CB variants use dedicated hypervectors per action; no shared structure across actions has been explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and benchmarking of a hybrid HD-CB variant against the proposed models on the same synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What performance gains can be achieved through dedicated hardware acceleration of HD-CB models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion identifies hardware acceleration as a promising direction: "exploring hardware acceleration for HD-CB models presents a promising direction, leveraging their inherent parallelism to reduce computational overhead drastically."
- Why unresolved: All experiments were conducted in software; no hardware implementation or FPGA/ASIC acceleration was tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Latency, throughput, and energy consumption measurements from FPGA or ASIC implementations compared to software baselines.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can hyperparameters (ε, α, α₂) be dynamically tuned during online learning rather than requiring pre-tuning via grid search?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future work mentions "dynamic tuning of hyperparameters." [inferred] Results show HD-CB EPS is highly sensitive to ε, and all models require grid search for optimal performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper relies on offline grid search for hyperparameter selection, which is impractical for truly online, adaptive deployment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of adaptive hyperparameter schemes with performance comparable to grid-search-tuned baselines.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do HD-CB models perform in non-stationary environments where reward distributions change over time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] All experiments assume stationary reward distributions; no evaluation addresses concept drift or dynamically changing environments.
- Why unresolved: Real-world applications (e.g., recommendation systems) often face non-stationary conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on datasets with controlled distribution shifts or synthetic non-stationary benchmarks.

## Limitations

- Limited theoretical analysis connecting HDC properties to contextual bandit regret bounds
- Core assumptions about linear separability and thermometer encoding effectiveness lack independent validation
- Comparative evaluation limited to specific synthetic and recommendation datasets, restricting generalizability claims

## Confidence

- High confidence in computational efficiency claims (O(D) vs O(d³) complexity verified through theoretical analysis and implementation)
- Medium confidence in convergence and scalability results (empirical results are compelling but limited to specific synthetic and recommendation datasets)
- Low confidence in generalization claims without additional validation on diverse domains beyond synthetic and recommendation tasks

## Next Checks

1. Derive and verify regret bounds for HD-CB variants, comparing theoretical guarantees against established linear CB algorithms like LinUCB
2. Implement ablation studies testing sensitivity to thermometer encoding resolution and non-linear reward distributions to validate robustness claims
3. Conduct cross-domain validation on non-recommendation datasets (e.g., clinical decision-making, autonomous control) to assess generalizability beyond the current experimental scope
