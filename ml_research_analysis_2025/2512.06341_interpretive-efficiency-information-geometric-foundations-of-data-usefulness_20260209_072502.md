# Interpretive Efficiency: Information-Geometric Foundations of Data Usefulness

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.06341
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06341
- **Reference count**: 25
- **Key outcome**: Interpretive Efficiency is a normalized, task-aware metric that quantifies how effectively an interpretive channel transmits task-relevant information, satisfying five axioms and relating to mutual information and Fisher information.

## Executive Summary
Interpretive Efficiency is a normalized, task-aware metric that quantifies how effectively an interpretive channel transmits task-relevant information. It is defined as a ratio or calibrated difference between a task-specific score and a reference value, satisfying five axioms: boundedness, monotonicity under sufficiency, data-processing stability, invariance to admissible reparameterizations, and asymptotic consistency. The measure relates to mutual information and Fisher information, admitting a geometric interpretation in local parametric models. Theoretical results establish consistency and finite-sample concentration bounds. Experiments on controlled image and signal tasks show that Interpretive Efficiency recovers theoretical orderings, exposes representational redundancy masked by accuracy, and correlates with robustness, making it a practical, theory-backed diagnostic for representation design.

## Method Summary
Interpretive Efficiency is quantified as $E(\phi;N) = \hat{I}(Z;Y) / \hat{I}(X;Y)$, where $\hat{I}$ is a mutual information lower bound estimated using a neural NWJ estimator. The method involves training a 2-layer MLP critic to maximize the NWJ bound over 5000 steps with Adam optimizer (lr=1e-3), batch size 256, and cross-fitting for critic training. Evaluation is performed on two datasets: sklearn 8x8 grayscale digits and synthetic sinusoids (5Hz vs 9Hz with random phase/amplitude, noise, and amplitude modulation). Channels tested include identity, PCA with varying components, random projection, FFT top-20, and downsampling. A Logistic Regression classifier trained on the transformed features provides auxiliary accuracy metrics to verify alignment with efficiency orderings.

## Key Results
- Interpretive Efficiency recovers theoretical orderings in controlled experiments (Digits and sinusoids).
- The metric exposes representational redundancy masked by accuracy scores.
- Efficiency correlates with model robustness to perturbations.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Interpretive Efficiency works by providing a task-specific, normalized measure of information transmission through a channel. It captures not just raw information content but the relevance of that information to the classification task, making it sensitive to representational redundancy and robustness properties that raw accuracy may miss.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mutual Information (MI)**: A measure of dependence between two random variables. Needed to quantify the amount of task-relevant information transmitted. Quick check: Verify that MI is symmetric and non-negative.
- **Sufficiency**: A statistic $T(X)$ is sufficient for $Y$ if $P(Y|T(X),X) = P(Y|T(X))$. Needed to ensure the efficiency measure respects information preservation under sufficient statistics. Quick check: Confirm that efficiency equals 1 for a sufficient statistic.
- **Fisher Information**: A measure of the amount of information that an observable random variable carries about an unknown parameter. Needed for the geometric interpretation of efficiency in local models. Quick check: Verify that Fisher information is the expected value of the squared score.
- **Data Processing Inequality**: A property stating that processing data cannot increase mutual information. Needed to ensure efficiency is stable under data processing. Quick check: Confirm that efficiency does not increase under deterministic transformations.
- **Cross-fitting**: A technique for training and evaluating a model on different data splits to reduce bias. Needed for stable estimation of the mutual information lower bound. Quick check: Ensure training and evaluation sets are disjoint for the critic network.
- **Asymptotic Normality**: A property where the distribution of an estimator converges to a normal distribution as sample size increases. Needed for the theoretical consistency of the efficiency measure. Quick check: Plot the distribution of the efficiency estimate for increasing sample sizes to observe convergence.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Data -> Channel $\phi$ -> Transformed Features $Z$ -> Critic $T(z,y)$ -> MI Lower Bound $\hat{I}(Z;Y)$ -> Efficiency $E(\phi;N)$ -> Evaluation (Accuracy, Robustness)
- **Critical Path**: The critical path for computing Interpretive Efficiency is the estimation of the mutual information lower bound $\hat{I}(Z;Y)$ using the neural NWJ estimator. This involves training the critic network $T(z,y)$ to distinguish samples from the joint distribution $P_{ZY}$ and the product of marginals $P_Z P_Y$.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff is between the bias and variance of the mutual information estimator. A more complex critic network can reduce bias but increase variance and computational cost. The choice of channel $\phi$ also involves a tradeoff between dimensionality reduction and information preservation.
- **Failure Signatures**: 
    - $E > 1$: Indicates estimator bias, likely due to underestimation of the reference mutual information $\hat{I}(X;Y)$.
    - High variance in $E$: Suggests instability in the variational MI estimation, possibly due to insufficient training of the critic network.
    - Efficiency ordering mismatch with accuracy: Indicates that the metric is capturing task-relevant information that accuracy misses, such as robustness to perturbations.
- **First Experiments**:
    1. Verify that the efficiency of the identity channel is 1 on a synthetic Gaussian dataset where analytical MI is known.
    2. Compare the efficiency of PCA with different numbers of components on the digits dataset to observe the tradeoff between dimensionality reduction and information preservation.
    3. Test the efficiency of channels on a corrupted version of the sinusoid dataset (e.g., with added noise or phase shifts) to assess robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Does Interpretive Efficiency maintain its theoretical guarantees and diagnostic utility when applied to modern, high-dimensional deep neural networks and large-scale datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that while the metric is designed for representation analysis, "scaling to large models is straightforward but beyond the scope of this foundational study" (Page 10).
- Why unresolved: The validation experiments are restricted to low-dimensional controlled tasks (sklearn Digits 8$\times$8 and synthetic sinusoids), leaving the metric's behavior in complex, hierarchical architectures unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results applying $E(\phi; N)$ to large-scale vision (e.g., ResNets on ImageNet) or language models, demonstrating that the metric remains computationally tractable and distinguishes representational quality effectively.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the estimation pipeline be stabilized to strictly enforce the boundedness axiom $E \in [0,1]$ in finite samples, preventing artefacts where $E > 1$?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that due to estimator bias, "it is possible to obtain $\hat{E}(\phi; N) > 1$," citing this as an "estimator-calibration artefact" rather than a theoretical violation (Page 11; Remark 2, Page 5).
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests remedies like calibrated-difference normalization or aggregating multiple estimators, it does not provide a proof or empirical protocol that guarantees empirical boundedness.
- What evidence would resolve it: A specific estimation protocol or bias-correction method proven to ensure $\hat{E}(\phi; N) \le 1$ holds almost surely or with high probability for finite $N$.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the Fisher-geometric interpretation of Interpretive Efficiency remain valid for models involving non-smooth transformations or discrete representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion section identifies the need to explore "deeper links... especially in models with long-range dependence, curvature effects, or non-smooth transformations" (Page 15).
- Why unresolved: The theoretical derivation of the Fisher-geometric expansion (Theorem 2) relies explicitly on Assumption 2 (R3), which requires local asymptotic normality and differentiability in quadratic mean—conditions that often fail in modern ReLU networks or discrete settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical extension of the geometric bounds to non-smooth function classes, or empirical validation showing the metric correlates with robustness in architectures where Fisher information is ill-defined.

## Limitations
- The experimental validation is limited to low-dimensional, controlled tasks (sklearn Digits and synthetic sinusoids), leaving the metric's behavior in complex, real-world scenarios unverified.
- The method relies on variational lower bounds for mutual information estimation, which can introduce bias and variance that affect the efficiency estimates, especially for high-dimensional data.
- The paper does not provide a protocol to strictly enforce the boundedness axiom $E \in [0,1]$ in finite samples, leading to potential artefacts where $E > 1$.

## Confidence
- **Theoretical consistency results**: High
- **Empirical ordering recovery on digits and sinusoids**: Medium
- **Relationship to robustness**: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Validate the efficiency ordering on a held-out dataset (e.g., Fashion-MNIST or CIFAR-10) using the same channel types to test generalizability beyond the two reported tasks.
2. Perform an ablation study on the critic network architecture (e.g., varying depth, width, activation functions) to assess the sensitivity of the efficiency estimate to this key component.
3. Quantify the bias of the NWJ estimator by computing the efficiency on a known distribution (e.g., Gaussian) where analytical values can be compared to the estimated values.
