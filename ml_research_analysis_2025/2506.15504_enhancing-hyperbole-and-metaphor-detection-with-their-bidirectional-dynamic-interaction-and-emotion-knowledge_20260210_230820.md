# Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.15504
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15504
- **Reference count:** 20
- **Primary result:** EmoBi achieves 28.1% improvement in F1 for hyperbole detection on TroFi dataset and 23.1% improvement in F1 for metaphor detection on HYPO-L dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting hyperbole and metaphor in text by proposing an emotion-guided framework (EmoBi) that leverages large language models. The method incorporates emotion analysis, emotion-based domain mapping, and a bidirectional dynamic interaction mechanism between the two rhetorical devices. By grounding detection in emotional context and forcing explicit reasoning about source and target domains, the framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across four benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
EmoBi is a multi-stage LLM pipeline that performs joint sentence-level binary classification for hyperbole and metaphor. The method first extracts emotional connotations using an LLM, then identifies source and target domains based on these emotions, and finally applies a bidirectional dynamic interaction where detection of one rhetorical device informs the other. The framework concludes with a verification mechanism to check prediction consistency. The approach uses sequential prompting with GPT-4o or Llama3 to enforce structured reasoning chains that break the task into emotion extraction, domain mapping, and mutual interaction steps.

## Key Results
- EmoBi achieves 28.1% improvement in F1 score for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- EmoBi achieves 23.1% improvement in F1 score for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset
- The framework outperforms encoder-only models like MTL-F-RoBERTa while providing explicit reasoning chains for detection decisions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Emotion as Semantic Anchor
The model first prompts an LLM to identify emotional connotations, which serves as a grounding signal to narrow the search space for subsequent semantic mapping. By establishing affective intent first, the model reduces the probability of literal misinterpretation. This assumes that rhetorical devices are consistently emotion-driven and that LLMs can accurately extract these latent emotions better than direct classification.

### Mechanism 2: Bidirectional Dependency Modeling
Instead of shared feature learning, the architecture uses sequential prompting where Metaphor detection informs Hyperbole detection and vice versa. This mutual reinforcement approach leverages the statistical correlation between rhetorical devices, where identifying one helps constrain and improve detection of the other. The method assumes strong overlap in semantic features between hyperbole and metaphor in the target datasets.

### Mechanism 3: Explicit Domain Mapping
The model forces an intermediate reasoning step: identifying target domain (abstract concept) and source domain (concrete concept) based on emotion. This breaks classification into an explanation task followed by label assignment, utilizing the LLM's strength in generation over discrimination. The approach assumes source and target domains are identifiable entities within the text and that this mapping is the primary mechanism for rhetorical understanding.

## Foundational Learning

- **Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT):** The model relies on identifying "Source Domain" (concrete concept) and "Target Domain" (abstract concept). Understanding this mapping is essential for debugging prompt logic. *Quick check:* In "Time is a butcher's knife," which is the source domain and which is the target?

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** EmoBi's architecture is essentially structured CoT (Emotion → Domain → Interaction). Understanding CoT principles explains why sequential dependency improves results over single-pass classification. *Quick check:* Why would asking an LLM to "identify emotions" before "detecting hyperbole" yield better results than asking it to do both at once?

- **Error Propagation in Pipelines:** The authors explicitly list "error propagation" as a limitation since modules are sequential and failures cascade. *Quick check:* If the Emotion Analysis module outputs "joy" for text conveying "bitter sarcasm," how will this affect the Domain Mapping step?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input text → Emotion Analysis → Domain Mapping → Interaction (Metaphor→Hyperbole + Hyperbole→Metaphor) → Verification

- **Critical path:** The Emotion Analysis → Domain Mapping interface is most fragile. If emotion prompts return generic or hallucinated emotions, the domain mapping will fail to identify correct source domains, rendering the interaction step useless.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Accuracy vs. Latency: Multiple sequential LLM calls boost F1 scores significantly but increase inference cost and latency compared to single-pass BERT classifiers
  - Explicitness vs. Robustness: Hard-coding reasoning steps (Emotion then Domain) loses flexibility and struggles with text not fitting the rigid "Source/Target" structure

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Hallucination Cascade: Domain Mapping module invents a source domain not present in text to satisfy prompt's demand for structure
  - False Positive Interaction: Model incorrectly identifies literal sentence as having "Metaphor" because "Hyperbole" module produced false positive, or vice versa

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Ablation):** Run dataset using only Emotion Analysis output (skipping domain mapping) to quantify emotion's contribution to F1 score
  2. **Error Analysis of Step 1:** Manually review 50 failure cases to check if failure originated in Emotion Analysis (wrong emotion) or Interaction (wrong logic)
  3. **Verifier Stress Test:** Test verification mechanism by injecting incorrect labels into pipeline to see if Verifier successfully corrects them

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the multi-step architecture be refined to mitigate error propagation where inaccuracies in early stages negatively impact subsequent detection steps? The current sequential pipeline lacks feedback loops or error correction mechanisms. Evidence would require comparing current pipeline performance against versions using gold-standard intermediate labels for emotion and domain mapping.

### Open Question 2
How can the emotion analysis module be enhanced to consistently capture subtle or implicit emotional nuances critical for detecting complex rhetorical devices? Current LLMs may struggle with highly context-dependent or weak emotional signals. Evidence would require an ablation study using human-annotated "gold-standard" emotion datasets as input.

### Open Question 3
Is the framework computationally efficient and scalable enough for real-time applications compared to encoder-only baselines? The paper doesn't discuss inference time, computational cost, or resource usage. Evidence would require comparative analysis of inference latency and FLOPS between EmoBi and MTL-F baselines on same hardware.

## Limitations
- Error propagation risk where early-stage mistakes cascade through sequential pipeline
- Heavy LLM dependency with significant reproducibility barriers due to underspecified parsing logic
- Domain mapping constraints that break down for highly abstract conceptual metaphors without explicit source domains

## Confidence

**Performance Improvements (High Confidence):** Quantitative claims of F1 improvements are well-supported by experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets with ablation studies and comparisons to state-of-the-art baselines.

**Bidirectional Interaction Mechanism (Medium Confidence):** Theoretical justification is sound but empirical evidence isolating this mechanism's specific contribution is less conclusive.

**Emotion as Semantic Anchor (Medium Confidence):** Conceptual framework is compelling but insufficient evidence that emotion analysis is primary driver rather than correlated factor.

## Next Checks
1. **Error Propagation Quantification:** Systematically perturb emotion analysis with incorrect emotions and measure downstream degradation to quantify impact of early-stage errors.

2. **Ablation Study on Interaction Mechanism:** Create variant removing bidirectional interaction while keeping other components intact to isolate specific contribution of mutual reinforcement.

3. **Parser Robustness Test:** Design test suite with varied LLM output formats to validate parsing logic reliably extracts binary predictions across diverse output formats.
