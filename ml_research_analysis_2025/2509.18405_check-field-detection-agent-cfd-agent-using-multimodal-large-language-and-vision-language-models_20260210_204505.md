## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a training-free agentic AI framework called CFD-Agent for zero-shot check field detection using a combination of a vision language model (VLM) and a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The method uses OWLv2 as the VLM to generate candidate bounding boxes for check fields and employs GPT-4 for reasoning and final localization through two specialized modules: one for signature detection and another for fields with optical character recognition. Evaluated on a curated dataset of 110 diverse check images, the framework achieves a mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) of 0.698 and accuracies of 89.0% and 79.6% at IOU thresholds of 0.25 and 0.5, respectively, significantly outperforming the baseline LLM-Optic method. The framework demonstrates robust performance across all nine target check fields, particularly excelling in precise localization, making it well-suited for real-world fraud detection and document processing applications without requiring labeled training data.

## Method Summary
The CFD-Agent framework uses a two-module agentic approach for zero-shot check field detection. Module 1 handles signature detection through iterative visual reasoning using OWLv2 for candidate generation and GPT-4 as both Actor (selecting candidates) and Evaluator (validating selections) in a feedback loop with memory. Module 2 processes text-based fields using vertical stacking of candidates, GPT-4 OCR on stacks, global NER extraction, and CER-based filtering with threshold 0.8. The system routes fields based on OCR feasibility, with text fields processed through Module 2's faster OCR pipeline and non-text fields through Module 1's visual loop. OWLv2 (ViT-B/16) generates candidates with confidence thresholds 0.001-0.03, followed by NMS (IoU=0.4) and size filtering.

## Key Results
- Achieved mIOU of 0.698 across nine check fields
- Accuracy@0.25 IOU: 89.0% and Accuracy@0.5 IOU: 79.6%
- Outperformed baseline LLM-Optic method significantly
- Demonstrated robust performance across all nine target check fields including signature, date, courtesy amount, legal amount, payer name, bank name, memo, MICR, and payee name

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Filtering via Character Error Rate (CER)
The system achieves high-precision localization by filtering visual candidates using textual similarity between candidate OCR content and global reference extraction, rather than relying solely on visual features. The framework first extracts a "reference" text for a specific field from the full image using an MLLM, then calculates CER between this reference and OCR output of every candidate bounding box proposed by the VLM. Candidates with CER exceeding threshold 0.8 are discarded before final visual evaluation, effectively isolating correct regions by text content. This works because the MLLM can extract reference text with sufficient accuracy to serve as ground truth for localized candidates.

### Mechanism 2: Iterative Agentic Refinement (Actor-Evaluator)
Visual grounding for ambiguous non-text fields like signatures improves through MLLM "Actor" selection critiqued by separate "Evaluator" instance in feedback loop. The Actor MLLM selects candidate label, Evaluator grades selection, and if grade is "Fail," candidate is added to "Memory" set and masked in next iteration, forcing Actor to choose different hypothesis. This verbal reinforcement learning strategy disambiguates overlapping labels by having the Evaluator distinguish signatures from nearby noise or other markings better than Actor's initial probability distribution.

### Mechanism 3: Modality-Specific Routing
Overall system accuracy maximizes by routing check fields to specialized sub-pipelines based on OCR feasibility. The framework bifurcates processing: Module 1 handles "Signature" (non-OCR-friendly, relies on visual labeling), Module 2 handles text-based fields using OCR stacking. Module 2 is faster and more accurate for text fields where OCR can be performed, while Module 1 is necessary only for non-text fields. This works because text-based fields are consistently machine-readable or handwritten with sufficient clarity for CER mechanism to function effectively.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (VLM)**
  - Why needed here: System relies on OWLv2 to propose bounding boxes for "signature" or "check fields" without training on checks. Understanding that VLMs map text prompts to image regions via Vision Transformers is crucial for debugging why it might confuse "Payee" with generic "text."
  - Quick check question: How does the VLM generate candidate boxes for a class it has never explicitly seen (e.g., specific check layouts)?

- **Concept: Visual Grounding**
  - Why needed here: Core task is locating specific entities (Payee, Date) within image based on text query. CFD-Agent is complex pipeline solving visual grounding problem where standard VLMs fail due to fine-grained similarity.
  - Quick check question: Why can't standard object detector (like YOLO trained on COCO) solve this task out of the box?

- **Concept: Agentic AI / Verbal Reinforcement Learning**
  - Why needed here: Module 1 functions not as static model but as agent with memory. Understanding system "learns" from own mistakes within single inference session (via Memory set) is key to understanding robustness.
  - Quick check question: What happens to "Memory" set if Evaluator incorrectly rejects valid signature?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Image (960×960) -> OWLv2 (VLM) with prompts -> Candidate Generator -> Post-Processor (NMS IoU=0.4, size filtering) -> Router (Field Type -> Module 1 or 2) -> Module 1: Label Overlay -> GPT-4 (Actor) -> GPT-4 (Evaluator) loop -> Module 2: Vertical Stack -> GPT-4 (OCR) + Global NER -> CER Filter (threshold 0.8) -> Agentic Evaluation -> Final Bounding Box

- **Critical path:** VLM candidate generation step is primary bottleneck. If OWLv2 model fails to produce bounding box with IoU > 0.5 for target field, no amount of MLLM reasoning can recover it (Recall ceiling).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Latency vs. Accuracy:** Module 2 uses "Vertical Stack" to avoid overlapping labels (faster inference) but loses spatial context, requiring secondary check. Module 1 uses iterative loops (slower) to handle visual ambiguity.
  - **Generalization vs. Specificity:** Using general-purpose GPT-4/OWLv2 avoids training data costs but requires complex engineering (CER thresholds, aspect ratio filters) to match domain-specific performance.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **MICR Line truncation:** VLMs often detect only segments of MICR line. Mitigation: Extend horizontal coordinates to image edges.
  - **Label Overlap:** In Module 1, visual labels overlap, confusing MLLM. Mitigation: Use Module 2 (stacking) wherever possible.
  - **Long Handwriting:** "Legal Amount" often has lowest IoU because VLM cannot capture full span of handwritten text in single box.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **VLM Threshold Sweep:** Vary OWLv2 confidence threshold (0.001 to 0.1) to plot curve of Candidate Count vs. Field Recall. Identify "sweet spot" where critical fields aren't missed but volume is manageable.
  2. **CER Sensitivity Analysis:** Test Module 2 performance by varying C_o (0.5 vs 0.8) to see how tolerant system is to MLLM OCR errors on blurry checks.
  3. **Module Ablation:** Run "Signature" field through both Module 1 (Visual Loop) and Module 2 (OCR-based) to empirically validate paper's claim that Module 1 is superior for non-text fields.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can advanced prompt engineering or alternative MLLM backends significantly reduce Character Error Rate (CER) for MICR line?
Basis: Authors note MICR NER performed poorly with GPT-4 and state "An extensive investigation into prompt engineering could potentially improve this performance" (Page 9). Unresolved because current experiments were limited and didn't correct degradation in long-field OCR capabilities. Evidence: Comparative study showing lower mean CER for MICR fields using varied prompting strategies or different MLLMs on same dataset.

### Open Question 2
Would substituting document-specialized VLM for OWLv2 improve detection of long or fragmented fields like legal amount?
Basis: Paper identifies VLM as performance "bottleneck" and suggests it "may benefit from improved object detection models specialized in document analysis" (Page 10). Unresolved because current VLM (OWLv2) is trained on general open-world objects, occasionally failing to encapsulate long handwritten text in single bounding box. Evidence: Benchmarking CFD-Agent with document-focused VLM (e.g., LayoutLM-based detectors) showing higher Acc@0.5 for legal amount field.

### Open Question 3
How effective is CFD-Agent as bootstrap mechanism for training specialized, real-time object detection models compared to human labeling?
Basis: Abstract and conclusion propose framework can serve as "bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality labeled datasets" for real-time models, but this specific application is not evaluated (Page 10). Unresolved because while zero-shot agent is accurate, utility of auto-generated labels for training smaller production-grade models remains theoretical. Evidence: Training lightweight model (e.g., YOLO) on CFD-Agent-generated labels and comparing mAP against model trained on human-annotated ground truth.

### Open Question 4
Does optimal configuration of component models (VLM + MLLM) vary significantly across different document types or check layouts?
Basis: Authors state "comprehensive investigation into optimal configuration of these component models is beyond scope of this work" (Page 10). Unresolved because study relies on specific combination (OWLv2 + GPT-4), leaving impact of model swapping on agentic reasoning loops unexplored. Evidence: Ablation studies across diverse check formats using various model pairs to identify if specific architectures offer superior reasoning or localization.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on OWLv2 and GPT-4 API calls without providing exact prompts or thresholds introduces significant reproducibility barriers
- Performance on handwritten text fields (particularly Legal Amount) shows notable degradation due to VLM's inability to capture full handwritten spans
- Lack of publicly available evaluation data (110 images from unspecified sources) makes independent verification impossible
- Modality-specific routing assumes text fields are consistently machine-readable, which may not hold for real-world check variations

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Zero-shot framework design and general methodology are well-described and reproducible in principle. Architectural components (VLM candidate generation, MLLM reasoning loops, CER-based filtering) are technically sound.
- **Medium confidence:** Reported performance metrics (mIOU 0.698, 89.0% @0.25 IOU) are specific but cannot be independently verified without access to evaluation dataset and exact implementation details.
- **Low confidence:** Claims about superior performance over "LLM-Optic" baseline lack methodological detail about baseline implementation, making comparative assessment difficult.

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset Availability Verification:** Request or recreate the 110-image evaluation dataset with ground truth bounding boxes to enable independent benchmarking of framework's reported performance metrics.
2. **Prompt Engineering Replication:** Implement exact GPT-4 Actor/Evaluator/OCR/NER prompts through systematic prompt variation testing to determine sensitivity of results to prompt formulation.
3. **Real-World Degradation Testing:** Evaluate framework on diverse set of low-quality checks (blurry, faded, cursive handwriting) to quantify performance degradation and identify failure modes beyond controlled evaluation set.
