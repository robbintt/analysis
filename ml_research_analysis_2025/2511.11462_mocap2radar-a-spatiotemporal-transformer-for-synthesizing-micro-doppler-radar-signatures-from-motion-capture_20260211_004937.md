# MoCap2Radar: A Spatiotemporal Transformer for Synthesizing Micro-Doppler Radar Signatures from Motion Capture

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11462
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11462
- Reference count: 3
- One-line primary result: Novel ML method synthesizes micro-Doppler radar spectrograms from MoCap data with good generalization.

## Executive Summary
MoCap2Radar introduces a pure machine learning approach for synthesizing micro-Doppler radar spectrograms from motion capture data. The core innovation is a spatiotemporal transformer architecture that jointly models spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames, formulated as a sequence-to-sequence regression problem. Real-world experiments using paired MoCap and radar data demonstrate that the model produces visually and quantitatively plausible radar spectrograms, achieving good generalization even when trained only on straight walks and tested on random walks. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both spatial and temporal components, with the full spatiotemporal model outperforming spatial-only and temporal-only variants.

## Method Summary
The model maps MoCap sequences (53 markers, 3D positions) to radar spectrograms using a stacked transformer architecture. A spatial encoder first applies self-attention across MoCap markers within each frame to capture joint-to-joint relationships. A temporal decoder then applies self-attention across timeframes for each marker to capture motion dynamics. The two streams are fused via cross-attention before an MLP head predicts the spectrogram magnitude. The model is trained with MSE loss on paired data, with MoCap upsampled to match radar sampling rate and spectrograms generated via STFT with magnitude compression.

## Key Results
- Spatiotemporal transformer outperforms spatial-only and temporal-only variants in ablation studies
- Model generalizes from straight walks (training) to random walks (testing)
- ML approach achieves >10x speed advantage over physics-based radar synthesis
- Model implicitly learns RCS dependencies without explicit electromagnetic simulation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Factorized Spatiotemporal Attention
The model effectively maps motion to radar signals by decoupling the learning of intra-frame body kinematics (spatial) from inter-frame motion dynamics (temporal). A stacked architecture first applies self-attention across MoCap markers within a single frame to model joint-to-joint relationships (e.g., limb orientation). It subsequently applies self-attention across timeframes for each marker to capture velocity and acceleration profiles. This factorization reduces the complexity of the joint spatiotemporal search space compared to monolithic attention.

### Mechanism 2: Implicit Radar Cross-Section (RCS) Approximation
The spatial transformer layers learn an implicit, differentiable function approximating the Radar Cross-Section (RCS) of human body parts based on relative marker positions, bypassing explicit electromagnetic simulation. Instead of simulating physics, the model learns that specific spatial configurations (e.g., the forearm orientation derived from wrist and elbow markers) correlate with specific energy returns in the spectrogram. The attention mechanism acts as a learned weighting scheme for different body parts' contributions to the signal.

### Mechanism 3: Phase-Invariant Regression Target
Formulating the problem as spectrogram regression (magnitude) rather than raw signal synthesis (I/Q) makes the learning problem tractable by eliminating ill-conditioned phase sensitivity. Raw radar phase is highly sensitive to distance (approx. 1.1 mm accuracy required at 5.8 GHz). Standard MoCap and body shape variations introduce errors exceeding this threshold. By targeting the STFT magnitude (specifically the square root of spectral density), the model ignores the precise phase while retaining the micro-Doppler structure needed for recognition tasks.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)**
- Why needed here: The entire output of the model is an STFT spectrogram. You must understand how the window length ($W$) and hop ($H$) trade off temporal resolution vs. frequency resolution to interpret the model's regression targets.
- Quick check question: If you double the window length $W$, what happens to the frequency resolution of the resulting spectrogram, and how would that affect the transformer's output shape?

**Concept: Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)**
- Why needed here: The core engine of both the Spatial and Temporal blocks. You need to grasp how Queries, Keys, and Values are used to weigh the importance of different joints (spatial) or frames (temporal).
- Quick check question: In the Spatial Block, what represents the "tokens" in the sequence—is it the time frames or the body markers?

**Concept: Micro-Doppler Signatures**
- Why needed here: To evaluate if the model is hallucinating or generating physically plausible radar data. You need to know that micro-Doppler refers to the small frequency shifts caused by limb movements (arms/legs) distinct from the main body velocity (torso).
- Quick check question: In a walking spectrogram, what causes the "sine-wave" like patterns around the main frequency peak?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Input MoCap Sequence -> Spatial Encoder (M markers, L_s=2, d_s=64) -> Temporal Encoder (W frames, L_t=4, d_t=128) -> Cross-Attention Fusion -> MLP Head -> Predicted Spectrum

**Critical path:**
Alignment is the most common point of failure—ensuring MoCap is strictly interpolated to the radar sampling rate (250Hz → 256Hz) and windowed with the exact same STFT parameters. The Cross-Attention block is where the distinct spatial and temporal streams must converge; incorrect dimension matching will block gradient flow.

**Design tradeoffs:**
Pre-norm vs Post-norm: Uses Pre-norm (Layer Norm before Attention) to improve gradient flow for deep temporal stacks. MSE loss naturally truncates high-frequency components (over-smoothing). Inference speed claims >10× faster than physics-based simulation.

**Failure signatures:**
Smooth Outputs indicate underfitting temporal dynamics (relying only on torso velocity). Generalization Collapse shows model has overfit to periodic straight walks rather than learning velocity-to-frequency mapping.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Sanity Check - Overfit One Sample: Train on single window pair; should reach near-zero MSE if architecture is implemented correctly.
2. Ablation (S vs T vs S+T): Reproduce ablation showing both spatial and temporal components are necessary.
3. Phase vs Magnitude: Attempt raw I/Q regression to observe phase ambiguity gradient break.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can alternative loss functions (spectral-correlation, perceptual) better preserve high-frequency Doppler components than MSE?
- Basis: Authors note MSE truncates high-frequency components and plan to explore alternatives.
- Resolution: Train with perceptual loss and demonstrate improved spectral detail preservation.

**Open Question 2:** Does generalization extend to structurally different motions like dancing or running with sufficient data?
- Basis: Authors speculate current small dataset limits generalization to complex motions.
- Resolution: Train on expanded dataset including diverse activities and evaluate on unseen motions.

**Open Question 3:** What specific physical relationships (like limb orientation affecting RCS) does spatial attention actually learn?
- Basis: Authors plan deeper interpretability results on whether model learns physical concepts or statistical correlations.
- Resolution: Attention visualization showing correlations with known physical RCS dependencies.

**Open Question 4:** Can synthetic radar data serve as transfer learning bridge to train applications using only MoCap data?
- Basis: Paper suggests method could extend applications from MoCap data without radar data.
- Resolution: Train classifier using only MoCap-generated synthetic radar data, then deploy on real radar inputs.

## Limitations

**Data Alignment Sensitivity:** Entire pipeline hinges on precise alignment between MoCap frames and radar STFT windows; exact interpolation method and STFT parameters not specified.

**Generalization Domain Gap:** Limited to one subject and body type; implicit RCS approximation may break for different subjects, clothing types, or objects being carried.

**Loss Function Constraints:** MSE loss with Softplus activation naturally produces smooth outputs that truncate high-frequency micro-Doppler components, suggesting model may be underfitting temporal complexity.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Core architecture works for specific experimental setup (single subject, controlled environment); ablation studies clearly demonstrate necessity of spatial and temporal components.

**Medium Confidence:** Claim that model learns "implicit RCS approximation" is plausible but relies on internal reasoning; generalization to random walks is promising but needs broader testing.

**Low Confidence:** Assertion of applicability to edge computing/IoT radars lacks quantitative validation (no latency, memory, or power measurements provided).

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Subject Validation:** Test trained model on MoCap-radar data from different subjects (different heights, weights, walking styles). Measure performance degradation and analyze whether spatial transformer blocks capture universal body kinematics or overfit to training subject's geometry.

2. **Alternative Loss Function Experiment:** Replace MSE loss with spectral loss (MSE in log-frequency domain) or perceptual loss using pre-trained activity classifier. Compare resulting spectrograms for high-frequency micro-Doppler preservation and downstream classification accuracy.

3. **Phase Reconstruction Ablation:** Train model to predict complex-valued STFT (magnitude and phase) rather than just magnitude. Measure performance degradation and analyze whether phase information contains discriminative features for activity recognition that are being discarded.
