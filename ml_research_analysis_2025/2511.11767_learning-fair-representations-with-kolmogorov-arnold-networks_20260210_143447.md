# Learning Fair Representations with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

## Quick Facts

- Addresses socioeconomic bias in college admissions using KAN-based adversarial debiasing

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a Kolmogorov-Arnathan Network (KAN)-based adversarial debiasing framework to address socioeconomic bias in college admissions. The authors integrate KANs with an adversarial learning setup, leveraging their spline-based architecture for interpretability and stability during optimization. An adaptive fairness penalty mechanism dynamically balances fairness and accuracy. Tested on two UCI freshman admissions datasets, the method achieves significant fairness improvements (up to 92.99% p%-Rule, DP gaps as low as 0.007) while maintaining competitive predictive performance (up to 82.51% accuracy, 86.68% AUROC), outperforming baseline models.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a KAN-based classifier and adversary trained in a min-max framework to learn fair representations. The classifier minimizes prediction loss while the adversary tries to predict sensitive attributes from the learned representations, with the goal of making them indistinguishable. A key innovation is the adaptive fairness penalty λ that updates based on the gap between current and target p%-Rule values. The framework employs B-splines of order k=3, with specific architectures for both classifier and adversary, and uses optimizers like Adam, OAdam, or ADOPT. Training involves alternating between freezing the classifier to train the adversary, then updating the classifier with the fairness penalty.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 92.99% p%-Rule and Demographic Parity gaps as low as 0.007
- Maintained competitive accuracy up to 82.51% and AUROC up to 86.68%
- Consistently outperformed baseline models in fairness metrics while preserving predictive performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging KANs' ability to learn interpretable, smooth representations through B-splines while simultaneously making these representations invariant to sensitive attributes through adversarial training. The adaptive fairness penalty mechanism ensures the model doesn't sacrifice too much accuracy for fairness or vice versa, dynamically adjusting the trade-off based on real-time fairness performance.

## Foundational Learning
- KAN architecture and B-splines: Understanding how Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks use piecewise polynomials to approximate functions
- Adversarial debiasing: The principle of using a minimax game to remove sensitive information from representations
- Demographic Parity: The fairness metric measuring independence between predictions and sensitive attributes
- Adaptive regularization: Dynamic adjustment of penalty terms during training based on performance metrics
- p%-Rule: The fairness metric measuring relative acceptance rates between protected and non-protected groups

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Data -> KAN Classifier -> Adversary (predicts sensitive attribute) -> Loss functions (Y, Z) -> λ update -> back to classifier
- Critical path: Feature extraction → KAN representation → adversary prediction → combined loss → gradient updates
- Design tradeoffs: Higher spline order k provides better expressiveness but causes training instability; adaptive λ balances fairness and accuracy
- Failure signatures: Oscillatory training loss (mitigate with ADOPT optimizer or lower k); fairness-accuracy collapse (diagnostic: monitor both metrics per epoch)
- First experiments: 1) Train with k=3 and observe loss stability; 2) Test adaptive λ behavior by tracking p%-Rule evolution; 3) Compare fairness metrics with and without adversary

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can explicit feature-level bias detection through reweighting mechanisms improve fairness while enhancing data privacy?
- Do the stability guarantees hold when optimizing for non-Demographic Parity fairness definitions like Equalized Odds?
- Can oscillatory training behavior in high-spline-complexity KANs be mitigated to leverage greater expressiveness?

## Limitations
- Cannot verify exact performance claims without access to institutional UCI freshman admissions datasets
- Several key hyperparameters (grid configuration G, fairness threshold τ, exact data splits) are unspecified
- The claim of "consistently outperforming" baselines cannot be assessed without reproducible experiments on standard benchmarks

## Confidence
- High: The KAN-based adversarial debiasing framework is technically sound and follows established fair ML methodology
- Medium: Performance claims relative to baselines are plausible but unverifiable without data access
- Low: Claims of consistent outperformance cannot be independently assessed

## Next Checks
1. Implement the method on public fairness datasets (Adult, COMPAS, German Credit) to verify effectiveness independently
2. Conduct ablation studies on the adaptive λ mechanism and spline order k to understand their impact
3. Test the framework's robustness to different sensitive attribute definitions and fairness metrics beyond demographic parity
