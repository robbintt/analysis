# A Surrogate-Augended Symbolic CFD-Driven Training Framework for Accelerating Multi-objective Physical Model Development

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19031
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19031
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Achieves up to 81.3% reduction in training cost while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy in multi-objective physical model development

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a surrogate-augmented symbolic CFD-driven training framework that significantly reduces the computational cost of developing physically consistent closure models for fluid dynamics. The approach integrates Gaussian Process-based surrogate modeling into the CFD-driven training process, using historical CFD evaluations to predict candidate model performance and reduce expensive CFD re-evaluations. Tested across one- and two-dimensional flows, including turbulence and heat-flux model optimization, the framework demonstrates substantial computational savings while maintaining model accuracy.

## Method Summary
The framework combines Gene Expression Programming (GEP) for generating symbolic expressions with a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model to accelerate physical model development. Discrete symbolic expressions are mapped to continuous feature vectors by evaluating them point-wise on baseline flow field invariants and aggregating results. The GP surrogate learns to predict model errors and uncertainties, allowing the system to filter candidates and only perform full CFD evaluations on high-potential models. This approach reduces the number of expensive CFD simulations while maintaining model quality, particularly effective for multi-objective optimization problems.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 81.3% reduction in training cost compared to standard CFD-driven training
- Successfully applied to both one-dimensional (square duct flow) and two-dimensional flows (natural convection, mixed convection, concentric annulus)
- Maintains comparable predictive accuracy to original CFD-driven approach while dramatically reducing computational expense
- Demonstrates effectiveness for both turbulence model optimization and heat-flux model development

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating a probabilistic surrogate model into CFD-driven training can substantially reduce computational cost by filtering candidate models.
- Mechanism: A Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate learns to approximate the error of ML-generated candidate models based on historical CFD evaluations. New candidates are first screened by the surrogate; only those predicted to have low error or high uncertainty are evaluated with full CFD.
- Core assumption: The mapping from discrete symbolic model expressions to their CFD-evaluated errors can be approximated by a continuous function that a GP can learn.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "achieves up to 81.3% reduction in training cost" and section 2.1 describes screening candidates before CFD evaluation.
- Break condition: The surrogate model fails to capture the relationship between model structure and error, leading to poor filtering and wasted CFD evaluations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A novel input mapping enables GP surrogates to work with discrete symbolic expressions.
- Mechanism: Discrete symbolic expressions are transformed into continuous feature vectors by evaluating each expression point-wise on a dataset and aggregating results (e.g., taking the mean output value).
- Core assumption: The aggregated point-wise evaluation of a model provides a sufficient signature of its behavior to predict its final CFD-computed error.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "mapping discrete symbolic expressions into continuous representations" and section 2.1.1 describes the aggregation function approach.
- Break condition: The aggregation function loses too much critical information about the model's behavior, causing the surrogate to conflate models with very different CFD performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Bayesian optimization-inspired selection metrics can effectively balance exploitation and exploration.
- Mechanism: Selection metrics like Expected Improvement (EI) use the surrogate's predicted mean and variance to estimate potential for a candidate to outperform the current best, guiding re-evaluation of promising or uncertain candidates.
- Core assumption: The uncertainty quantification from the GP is a reliable proxy for where predictions are untrustworthy and where new information is most valuable.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "leveraging uncertainty quantification" and section 2.1.3 discusses EI metrics for balancing exploitation and exploration.
- Break condition: Poor calibration of exploration-exploitation balance causes either redundant evaluations or random sampling without progress.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Gaussian Process (GP) Regression
- Why needed here: The core surrogate model is a GP. Understanding its non-parametric, Bayesian nature and how it provides both mean prediction and uncertainty is essential.
- Quick check question: What does the kernel function in a GP define, and what are its two main outputs for a given input point?

### Concept: Gene Expression Programming (GEP) / Symbolic Regression
- Why needed here: The framework uses GEP to generate candidate models. Understanding that this produces discrete, variable-length symbolic expressions is key to why input mapping is necessary.
- Quick check question: Why are the outputs of symbolic regression difficult to use directly as inputs for a standard Gaussian Process?

### Concept: Bayesian Optimization Principles
- Why needed here: The candidate selection strategy uses concepts from Bayesian optimization. Knowing the goal is to efficiently sample an expensive black-box function by balancing exploration and exploitation is critical.
- Quick check question: In Bayesian optimization, what two things does the "acquisition function" balance when deciding where to sample next?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
1. CFD-driven Training Loop (GEP): Generates candidate models and evaluates them with full CFD
2. Input Mapping: Transforms discrete symbolic expression into continuous feature vector via point-wise evaluation and aggregation
3. Surrogate Model (GP): Takes continuous feature vector as input and predicts model error (mean) and uncertainty (variance)
4. Selector: Uses acquisition function based on surrogate outputs to decide whether to send candidate for CFD evaluation
5. Surrogate Refinement: New CFD results are added to GP's training set, improving predictions over time

### Critical path
GEP generates candidate -> Input Mapping (creates continuous feature) -> Surrogate Prediction (predicts error & uncertainty) -> Selector (decides: CFD or skip?) -> (If yes) Full CFD Evaluation -> Update Surrogate Training Data

### Design tradeoffs
- Acquisition Function Choice: EI with specific hyperparameters vs. alternatives like LCB affects exploration/exploitation balance
- Aggregation Function for Input Mapping: Mean vs. higher moments captures more/less information
- GP Kernel Choice: Rational Quadratic vs. RBF/Matérn dictates assumed smoothness of function being modeled

### Failure signatures
- Converging to Local Optimum: Selector too exploitative, only re-evaluating variants of known good models
- Random Walk: Selector too exploratory, re-evaluating many poor or highly uncertain models without progress
- Surrogate Inaccuracy: Error predictions become unreliable, causing filtering of good candidates and wasting CFD on poor ones

### First 3 experiments
1. Baseline Cost Measurement: Run standard CFD-driven training without surrogate on simple 1D flow case to establish baseline error and CFD evaluation count
2. Surrogate Integration Test: Integrate surrogate model with recommended hyperparameters and compare final error achieved for fixed CFD evaluation budget
3. Input Mapping Ablation: Modify input mapping to use different aggregation (e.g., standard deviation instead of mean) and compare surrogate prediction error and training efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Question: Can the assumption of independence between training objectives in the multi-output Gaussian Process be relaxed to capture correlations without incurring prohibitive computational costs?
- Question: Does the aggregation of point-wise model evaluations into a single mean value for surrogate input mapping result in the loss of critical spatial gradient information?
- Question: How does the framework's efficiency and surrogate accuracy scale when applied to unsteady, three-dimensional, or multiphase flows?

## Limitations
- Performance is flow-case dependent and may degrade for more complex, three-dimensional flows where the relationship between model form and error is less smooth
- Input mapping strategy (mean aggregation) may not capture sufficient behavioral information for models with complex functional forms
- GEP hyperparameters, cost function formulations, and GP optimization details were not fully specified, creating potential reproducibility gaps

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core mechanism of using GP surrogates to filter CFD evaluations and general approach of mapping symbolic expressions to continuous features
- **Medium confidence**: Specific input mapping technique and effectiveness of EI selection metric with given hyperparameters
- **Low confidence**: Performance on highly turbulent, three-dimensional, or transient flows; impact of alternative aggregation functions; sensitivity to unspecified GEP and GP hyperparameters

## Next Checks
1. Input Mapping Sensitivity Test: Compare original mean-aggregation against alternative including higher-order statistics on square duct case
2. Flow Complexity Scaling Test: Apply framework to three-dimensional bluff body flow and compare cost reduction and accuracy to 1D/2D results
3. GP Hyperparameter Robustness Test: Systematically vary kernel type and number of restarts for marginal likelihood optimization to assess sensitivity
