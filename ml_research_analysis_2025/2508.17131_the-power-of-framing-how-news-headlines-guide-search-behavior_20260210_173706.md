# The Power of Framing: How News Headlines Guide Search Behavior

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.17131
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17131
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: News headline framing significantly influences user query reformulation behavior, with conflict and strategy frames disrupting alignment with selected content.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a controlled experiment demonstrating that the framing of news headlines in search results significantly influences user query behavior. The authors show that participants exposed to conflict and strategy-framed headlines produced follow-up queries less aligned with the content they selected, compared to a control group. Episodic framing led to more concrete queries than thematic framing. A difference-in-differences analysis revealed that conflict framing increased the retrieval of similarly framed headlines in subsequent searches, but this effect did not persist across multiple rounds. The study highlights that even brief exposure to specific narrative frames can subtly alter the trajectory of information-seeking behavior in search environments.

## Method Summary
The experiment recruited 600 participants via Prolific and assigned them randomly to six conditions (conflict, strategy, episodic, thematic, episodic vs. thematic, and control). In six search rounds, participants entered queries, viewed three filtered headlines matching their condition, selected one, and repeated. Headlines were classified into frames using ChatGPT-4o Mini, and results were retrieved via ScaleSERP API. The analysis measured semantic similarity between queries and headlines using Sentence Transformers, along with concreteness and emotional content metrics, using linear mixed-effects models and difference-in-differences estimation.

## Key Results
- Conflict and strategy frames disrupted alignment between follow-up queries and previously selected headlines
- Episodic framing produced more concrete queries than thematic framing
- Conflict framing increased retrieval of similarly framed headlines in subsequent searches (+8.9%, p = 0.015), but effects did not accumulate across rounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cognitive Priming Drives Query Reformulation
- **Claim:** Brief exposure to framed headlines activates interpretive schemas that shape the semantic direction of follow-up queries.
- **Mechanism:** Priming makes certain concepts more cognitively accessible. When users see conflict-framed headlines, adversarial schemas activate, shifting attention toward emotionally or ideologically salient aspects rather than the factual content of what they clicked.
- **Core assumption:** Users cannot fully suppress the influence of recently activated frames when reformulating queries, even when the frames are incidental to their original search goal.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Headline framing significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted alignment with prior selections"
  - [section 4.1] "approximately 65% of the semantic direction of the next query is attributable to the user's own previous query, while 35% reflects the influence of the selected headline"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; corpus focuses on headline generation/classification, not behavioral priming effects
- **Break condition:** Effects attenuate across query rounds; no accumulation observed, suggesting priming is short-lived without reinforcement.

### Mechanism 2: Frame-Consistent Retrieval Feedback Loop
- **Claim:** Exposure to a specific frame increases the probability that subsequent queries retrieve similarly framed content, creating a short-term feedback loop.
- **Mechanism:** Primed users unconsciously adopt frame-aligned vocabulary or focus areas in their queries, which search algorithms then match to similarly framed headlines.
- **Core assumption:** Search algorithms return frame-consistent results because frame-aligned queries share vocabulary patterns with frame-aligned headlines.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "A difference-in-differences analysis revealed that conflict framing increased the retrieval of similarly framed headlines in subsequent searches"
  - [section 5.2] "the only condition to show a notable increase relative to control is the conflict frame in the conflict condition (+8.9%, p = 0.015)"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support for retrieval feedback loops in framing contexts
- **Break condition:** Effect does not persist across multiple rounds; decay observed even within six-query sessions.

### Mechanism 3: Individual Differences Moderate Susceptibility
- **Claim:** Political orientation and news consumption frequency moderate framing effects through motivated reasoning and cognitive availability.
- **Mechanism:** Frequent news seekers have more practiced schemas that are more readily activated. Ideologically congruent frames resonate more strongly because they align with existing belief structures.
- **Core assumption:** Framing is not uniformly influential; prior exposure and motivational factors amplify or dampen effects.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 6] "liberal participants exposed to conflict-framed headlines exhibited significantly greater increases in conflict framing in their follow-up queries"
  - [section 6] "Participants who reported using search engines more frequently to find news exhibited modestly higher frame match rates"
  - [corpus] "Negative frames produced higher views and shares" (arxiv:2503.15493) offers indirect support for engagement-driven moderation
- **Break condition:** Exploratory findings did not survive multiple comparison correction; require replication.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Framing Theory (Entman 1993)**
  - **Why needed here:** Frames define problems, diagnose causes, make moral judgments, and suggest solutions. Understanding this is essential for interpreting why conflict frames behave differently from episodic frames.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why "conflict" and "episodic" frames would produce different effects on query concreteness?

- **Concept: Priming vs. Availability Heuristics**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper invokes both mechanisms; priming explains short-term persistence, while availability explains why certain frames feel representative.
  - **Quick check question:** If you wanted to test whether an effect was priming-driven vs. availability-driven, what experimental manipulation would distinguish them?

- **Concept: Difference-in-Differences (DiD) Estimation**
  - **Why needed here:** The causal claims about frame persistence rely on DiD analysis comparing treatment vs. control trajectories.
  - **Quick check question:** What does a positive DiD estimate tell you about frame exposure that a simple pre-post comparison would not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Query capture layer: Records user queries, timestamps, and round number
  2. Live search API (ScaleSERP): Retrieves top 50 Google News results per query
  3. Frame classifier (LLM-based): Classifies each headline into one of six frames using prompt in Appendix
  4. Treatment filter: Selects top 3 headlines matching assigned frame condition (with fallback random fill)
  5. Outcome measurement: Computes semantic similarity (Sentence-BERT), concreteness scores, and frame match rates
  6. Experimental assignment: Between-subjects randomization to one of six conditions

- **Critical path:**
  Query → API retrieval → Frame classification → Treatment filtering → User selection → Next query → Outcome computation

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - LLM-based frame classification enables scalability but introduces label noise; manual validation was not reported
  - Six-round sessions capture short-term effects but may miss longer-term accumulation
  - Controlled interface increases internal validity at cost of ecological validity

- **Failure signatures:**
  - If fewer than 3 frame-matching headlines exist, random fill dilutes treatment dose
  - Short/ambiguous queries may retrieve heterogeneous frames regardless of user intent
  - Classifier drift: if frame definitions diverge from user interpretation, causal inference weakens

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate classifier accuracy:** Manually label a sample of headlines and compute agreement with LLM classifications
  2. **Test dose-response:** Manipulate proportion of frame-matching headlines (e.g., 1/3, 2/3, 3/3) to test whether effects scale with exposure strength
  3. **Extend session length:** Run 12+ round sessions to test whether accumulation effects emerge with longer exposure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do framing effects accumulate or persist in naturalistic search settings over periods longer than a few minutes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note the total session length was only six queries and state that "framing effects, especially those related to accumulation (H3), may require longer exposure periods or more organic engagement to manifest more strongly."
- Why unresolved: The controlled experiment found only short-term persistence that decayed quickly, but the artificial brevity of the session may have prevented the observation of long-term cognitive carryover.
- Evidence: Longitudinal field studies tracking user query reformulation over days or weeks within a live search engine environment.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do algorithmic feedback loops interact with framing to stabilize or amplify specific narrative trajectories?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The limitations section states, "Additional attention should also be paid to how... algorithmic feedback loops interact with individual predispositions."
- Why unresolved: The study utilized static filtering of results via an API rather than a dynamic search engine that learns from user clicks and reinforces specific frames.
- Evidence: A simulation or experiment where the retrieval algorithm dynamically updates result rankings based on the user's previous interactions with framed content.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does political orientation specifically increase susceptibility to conflict frames, or is this effect dependent on the specific news topic?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors found that liberal participants showed increased conflict framing in follow-up queries, but caution that these "exploratory findings... should be interpreted cautiously given potential imbalances in ideological self-identification."
- Why unresolved: The observed interaction between political identity and framing may be a artifact of the sample demographics or the specific news topics retrieved during the experiment.
- Evidence: A pre-registered experiment with stratified sampling across political orientations and controlled news topics to isolate motivated reasoning effects.

## Limitations

- LLM-based frame classification introduces measurement noise that may dilute true effects; manual validation was not reported
- Six-round sessions may be insufficient to detect longer-term framing persistence or accumulation
- Ecological validity limited by controlled interface and search context (single topic area per session)
- Exploratory findings on individual differences did not survive multiple comparison correction

## Confidence

- **High:** Short-term framing effects on query alignment and concreteness (well-powered, consistent across analyses)
- **Medium:** Difference-in-differences findings for conflict framing persistence (statistically significant but no accumulation observed)
- **Low:** Individual difference moderators (exploratory, uncorrected for multiple comparisons)

## Next Checks

1. **Classifier validation:** Manually label 100 randomly selected headlines and compute Cohen's kappa with LLM classifications to establish reliability
2. **Dose-response test:** Manipulate treatment strength (1/3, 2/3, 3/3 frame-matching headlines) to determine whether effects scale with exposure intensity
3. **Extended session replication:** Run 12+ round sessions to test whether framing effects accumulate over longer exposure periods
