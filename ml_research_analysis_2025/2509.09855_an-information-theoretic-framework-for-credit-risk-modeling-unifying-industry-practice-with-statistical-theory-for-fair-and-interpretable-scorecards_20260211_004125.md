# An Information-Theoretic Framework for Credit Risk Modeling: Unifying Industry Practice with Statistical Theory for Fair and Interpretable Scorecards

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.09855
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09855
- **Reference count**: 18
- **Primary result**: IV and PSI are mathematically equivalent (Jeffreys divergence); enables formal statistical inference and fairness constraints for credit scorecards

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for widely-used credit risk modeling metrics by proving that Information Value (IV) is mathematically equivalent to Population Stability Index (PSI) when computed between good and bad credit outcomes. This unification allows practitioners to use the same information-theoretic framework for both variable selection and model monitoring. The authors introduce statistical uncertainty quantification via the delta method for WoE and IV, enabling formal hypothesis testing and probabilistic fairness constraints. The framework is empirically validated to achieve comparable predictive performance (AUC 0.82-0.84) across different encoding strategies while enabling explicit fairness-performance trade-offs through mixed-integer programming.

## Method Summary
The framework combines information theory with statistical inference to unify industry metrics under a common foundation. Optimal binning is performed using depth-1 XGBoost stumps maximizing information gain/KL divergence. Features are encoded via either one-hot transformation or WoE transformation (log-odds). Three model variants are trained: logistic regression with one-hot encoding, logistic regression with WoE transformation, and constrained XGBoost (depth=1). Mixed-integer programming solves a bi-objective optimization problem maximizing predictive IV while constraining demographic IV below a fairness budget ε. The delta method provides standard errors for WoE (SE(WoE_j) = 1/n_{j,g} + 1/n_{j,b}) and propagates to IV, enabling statistical hypothesis testing.

## Key Results
- Proves IV = PSI (Jeffreys divergence) when comparing good/bad credit distributions
- Introduces SE(IV) via delta method, replacing arbitrary thresholds with statistical significance tests
- Three encoding strategies achieve comparable AUC (0.82-0.84) when built on same information-theoretic foundation
- Traces Pareto frontier showing explicit fairness-performance trade-off with uncertainty quantification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: The IV-PSI Equivalence Identity
The Information Value formula $\sum (P_g - P_b) \ln(P_g/P_b)$ algebraically expands to $D_{KL}(P_g \| P_b) + D_{KL}(P_b \| P_g)$, which is the definition of Jeffreys divergence. This proves that the variable selection metric (IV) is identical to the drift monitoring metric (PSI) when applied to the same outcome distributions. The equivalence holds for discrete distributions over identical bins, enabling unified theoretical treatment of both processes.

### Mechanism 2: Statistical Inference via the Delta Method
The delta method derives variance of non-linear transformations. For WoE, $Var(WoE_j) \approx 1/n_{j,g} + 1/n_{j,b}$, where $n_{j,g}$ and $n_{j,b}$ are counts in bin j. Since IV is a weighted sum of WoE values, this propagates to $SE(IV)$, enabling confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. This replaces industry practice of using arbitrary thresholds (e.g., IV > 0.1) with statistically rigorous significance testing.

### Mechanism 3: Fairness-Performance Trade-off as Divergence Constraints
The framework separates IV into $IV_{perf}$ (separation between default/non-default) and $IV_{fair}$ (separation between protected/reference groups). It formalizes fairness as a bi-objective optimization: maximize $IV_{perf}$ while constraining $IV_{fair} \leq \epsilon$. This creates a Pareto frontier where predictive power is explicitly traded off against discriminatory leakage, implemented via mixed-integer programming.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Jeffreys Divergence (Symmetric KL Divergence)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the mathematical bridge connecting IV and PSI. Without understanding that $D_{KL}(P\|Q) + D_{KL}(Q\|P)$ forms a symmetric measure of divergence, the unification appears coincidental.
  - **Quick check question:** If P and Q are swapped in the PSI formula, does the value change? (Answer: No, because it is symmetric).

- **Concept: The Delta Method**
  - **Why needed here:** Essential for understanding how uncertainty bounds are derived. It explains how the variance of a function (log-odds) can be approximated using the variance of its inputs and the function's derivative.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is the delta method necessary to calculate the standard error of WoE, rather than just calculating the variance of raw counts? (Answer: Because WoE is a non-linear transformation of the counts).

- **Concept: Pareto Efficiency in Multi-Objective Optimization**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper traces a "performance-fairness frontier." Understanding Pareto efficiency is required to interpret why there is no single "best" model, but rather a set of optimal trade-off solutions.
  - **Quick check question:** On the Pareto frontier, if you force the model to be strictly fairer (lower $IV_{fair}$), what must happen to the predictive IV? (Answer: It must generally decrease).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Input -> Optimal Binning Engine -> Feature Encoder -> Model Core -> Optimization Layer
- **Critical path:** The Optimal Binning Engine is the highest leverage component. The paper shows binning strategy determines success more than classifier choice (Logistic vs. XGBoost).
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Sensitivity vs. Stability:** PSI (Jeffreys) is sensitive but unbounded; Jensen-Shannon is bounded/stable but less sensitive
  - **WoE vs. One-Hot:** WoE offers dimensionality reduction (1 feature per variable) and direct theoretical mapping; One-Hot preserves bin independence. Both yield comparable performance (AUC 0.82-0.84) if binning is correct
  - **Confidence Level (k) in Constraints:** Higher confidence (e.g., k=2.58 for 99%) tightens feasible solution space, potentially sacrificing more predictive power for safety
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Exploding SE(IV):** Occurs when bins are too granular (low counts), invalidating statistical tests
  - **Non-Monotonicity:** If business logic requires risk to increase with feature, but optimal binning creates up-down jumps, MIP constraints may force suboptimal solution or fail to converge
  - **Dominance of Proxy Leakage:** If feature has extremely high $IV_{perf}$ but also high $IV_{fair}$ (acts as proxy for protected class), MIP struggles to find solution satisfying both high accuracy and low bias
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Verify IV-PSI Identity:** Calculate IV and PSI on same dataset; confirm they yield identical values algebraically
  2. **Encoding Ablation:** Train LR on One-Hot vs. WoE encoded bins; verify Test AUCs are within 0.02 difference
  3. **Frontier Tracing:** Run MIP optimization with varying ε values (0.1 to 3.0); plot Predictive IV vs. Demographic IV to visualize Pareto frontier

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can information-theoretic measures be extended to operate directly on continuous distributions while preserving interpretability and regulatory compliance required in credit scoring?**
  - **Basis in paper:** "The framework's reliance on binned features, while consistent with industry practice, may sacrifice information contained in continuous distributions."
  - **Why unresolved:** Binning discretizes data, potentially losing granular predictive signal; no continuous formulation exists that maintains monotonicity and auditability
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A continuous IV analogue derived with closed-form or estimable uncertainty bounds, validated against binned baselines on benchmark credit datasets

- **How can the information-theoretic fairness framework address intersectional fairness across multiple protected attributes?**
  - **Basis in paper:** "The fairness formulation addresses only single protected attributes... This limitation suggests the need for extensions to multi-dimensional information divergence measures."
  - **Why unresolved:** Current IV_fair handles binary protected groups; combining multiple attributes without inflating uncertainty or violating independence assumptions is unsolved
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Multi-dimensional divergence formulations with valid standard errors, demonstrated via controlled experiments with intersecting demographic groups

- **Can information-theoretic measures be combined with causal inference to distinguish legitimate predictive relationships from dependencies arising from societal biases?**
  - **Basis in paper:** "Combining information-theoretic measures with causal inference frameworks could enable discrimination between legitimate predictive relationships and problematic dependencies."
  - **Why unresolved:** IV is purely associational and does not distinguish causal drivers from spurious correlations linked to protected attributes
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A causal-IV hybrid metric evaluated on synthetic data with known causal structures and real data with validated causal pathways

## Limitations
- The framework relies on binned features, potentially sacrificing information in continuous distributions
- Fairness formulation addresses only single protected attributes, not intersectional fairness
- Delta method uncertainty quantification may break down in sparse bins common in production credit data

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The IV-PSI mathematical equivalence proof - straightforward algebraic identity with clear conditions
- **Medium Confidence:** The delta method uncertainty quantification - valid asymptotically, but practical limitations in sparse settings are significant
- **Medium Confidence:** The bi-objective fairness-performance optimization - theoretically elegant, but empirical validation on real-world data would strengthen claims

## Next Checks
1. **Real-World Robustness Test:** Apply framework to publicly available credit dataset (Lending Club or Home Credit) with multiple protected attributes to verify IV-PSI identity and uncertainty quantification hold under real-world noise
2. **Non-Linear Fairness Leakage Test:** Design synthetic experiment where feature has low single-feature IV_fair but creates high unfairness through non-linear interactions; test whether current constraint framework catches this scenario
3. **Monotonicity Constraint Impact Analysis:** Systematically vary strictness of monotonicity constraints in MIP optimization; measure resulting degradation in AUC and change in fairness-performance frontier shape to quantify practical cost of business logic requirements
