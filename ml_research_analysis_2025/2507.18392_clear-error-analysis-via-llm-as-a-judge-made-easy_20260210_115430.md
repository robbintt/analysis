# CLEAR: Error Analysis via LLM-as-a-Judge Made Easy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.18392
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18392
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: Introduces CLEAR, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that automates error analysis by clustering instance-level feedback into structured, quantified summaries using Key Point Analysis.

## Executive Summary
CLEAR is a framework and interactive tool for automated error analysis of large language models using LLM-as-a-Judge paradigms. It generates structured, quantified summaries of recurring model issues by clustering instance-level feedback through Key Point Analysis, moving beyond single scalar scores to provide actionable insights. The system supports multiple judges, configurable evaluation modes, and two KPA implementations, producing both high-level overviews and drill-down capabilities to individual examples. Experiments across math and RAG benchmarks demonstrate CLEAR's ability to identify system-specific issues, with GPT-4o-based KPA yielding the most accurate results. A user study with 12 AI practitioners found the tool saves time and surfaces overlooked failure modes.

## Method Summary
CLEAR employs an LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm where a large language model evaluates model outputs and provides instance-level feedback. This feedback is then processed using Key Point Analysis (KPA) to cluster similar issues and generate a structured summary of recurring problems. The framework supports two KPA implementations: one based on GPT-4o and another using an open-source RAG model. CLEAR also includes an interactive visualization tool that allows users to explore high-level issue overviews and drill down to individual examples. The system is designed to be generalizable across different benchmarks and evaluation modes, offering both general and task-specific analysis options.

## Key Results
- CLEAR successfully identified system-specific issues such as calculation errors in GSM8K and hallucination in TechQA benchmarks.
- GPT-4o-based KPA implementation yielded the most accurate and synthesized issue types compared to other KPA methods.
- User study with 12 AI practitioners demonstrated time savings and the ability to surface overlooked failure modes, though users requested features like severity annotations.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CLEAR leverages the ability of LLMs to provide detailed, instance-level feedback on model outputs, which is then aggregated and synthesized using KPA. This approach moves beyond traditional scalar metrics by identifying and quantifying recurring error patterns, enabling more actionable insights for model improvement. The interactive visualization tool enhances usability by allowing users to explore issues at both macro and micro levels.

## Foundational Learning
- **LLM-as-a-Judge**: Why needed - to provide detailed, instance-level feedback on model outputs; Quick check - verify that the judge can accurately identify and articulate errors.
- **Key Point Analysis (KPA)**: Why needed - to cluster and synthesize similar issues from feedback; Quick check - ensure that KPA groups related issues and avoids redundancy.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Why needed - to enable users to explore issues at different granularities; Quick check - confirm that the tool allows seamless navigation between high-level summaries and individual examples.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: LLM Judge -> Instance-level Feedback -> Key Point Analysis (KPA) -> Structured Summary -> Interactive Visualization
- **Critical Path**: The core workflow involves the LLM judge evaluating outputs, KPA clustering feedback, and the visualization tool presenting results.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Using LLM-based KPA provides accuracy but increases computational cost (~2N LLM calls); open-source KPA reduces cost but may sacrifice quality.
- **Failure Signatures**: Biases in the judge or KPA can propagate to the final issue set; computational expense may limit scalability.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Test CLEAR on a small dataset to validate issue clustering accuracy. 2) Compare GPT-4o-based KPA with open-source KPA on the same dataset. 3) Conduct a pilot user study with 3-5 practitioners to assess usability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can severity scoring and prioritization mechanisms be integrated into CLEAR to help users distinguish critical errors from minor issues?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion: "Looking ahead, we plan to... incorporate severity scoring and prioritization mechanisms." User study participants also "requested features such as severity annotations."
- Why unresolved: The current system quantifies issue prevalence but treats all issues equally; users noted difficulty understanding which errors were most critical.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified CLEAR implementation with severity annotations, evaluated via user study showing improved prioritization accuracy and reduced decision latency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can CLEAR mitigate the propagation of biases from the LLM-as-a-Judge to the final aggregated issue set?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The limitations section states: "Biases in the judge (e.g., self-bias, length/style bias) or their failure to identify subtle errors directly compromise the quality and validity of the final, aggregated issues."
- Why unresolved: No debiasing mechanisms are proposed; the framework currently inherits all judge limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring bias propagation rates across different judge models, or demonstrations of debiasing techniques that improve issue validity without sacrificing coverage.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can CLEAR be extended to diagnose root causes of identified error patterns rather than only surfacing symptoms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The limitations section explicitly notes: "Our tool identifies and quantifies recurring error patterns but does not diagnose their root cause. For instance, it can highlight frequent factual inaccuracies but cannot distinguish if this stems from knowledge deficits, retrieval failures, or flawed reasoning."
- Why unresolved: The current pipeline maps symptoms to issues but lacks causal attribution mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integration of causal analysis modules that correctly classify root causes (validated against human expert diagnoses) for identified issues.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the trade-off between the cost of LLM-based KPA (~2N calls) and the quality of discovered issues across different dataset scales and model qualities?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes "LLM-based KPA... can be computationally expensive, requiring approximately ~2N LLM calls," but only evaluates on modest benchmark sizes. Scalability for large-scale analyses remains a "practical limitation."
- Why unresolved: No systematic analysis of cost-quality trade-offs at scale or across varying error rates.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks measuring issue quality versus computational cost across datasets of varying sizes (1K–100K instances) and model error rates.

## Limitations
- CLEAR's effectiveness in identifying nuanced or domain-specific issues remains unclear without broader testing beyond math and RAG tasks.
- The reliance on GPT-4o for KPA may introduce bias, as different judges or KPA implementations could yield varying results.
- The user study sample size of 12 practitioners is small, potentially limiting the robustness of usability claims.

## Confidence
- **High**: CLEAR's ability to generate structured, quantified summaries of model issues using KPA is well-supported by experimental results.
- **Medium**: The tool's time-saving benefits and ability to surface overlooked failure modes are supported by user feedback but require larger-scale validation.
- **Low**: Claims about CLEAR's generalizability across diverse domains and its effectiveness with non-GPT-4o judges lack sufficient empirical backing.

## Next Checks
1. Test CLEAR on a wider range of benchmarks and domains to assess its generalizability and robustness.
2. Compare CLEAR's performance using different LLM judges and KPA implementations to evaluate consistency and bias.
3. Conduct a larger-scale user study with diverse practitioner backgrounds to validate usability and effectiveness claims.
