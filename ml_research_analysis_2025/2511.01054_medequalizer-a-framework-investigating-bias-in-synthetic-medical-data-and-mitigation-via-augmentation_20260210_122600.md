# MedEqualizer: A Framework Investigating Bias in Synthetic Medical Data and Mitigation via Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01054
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01054
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Introduces MedEqualizer framework that reduces demographic bias in synthetic medical data by enriching underrepresented subgroups before GAN generation, achieving substantial fairness improvements across three GAN models while preserving distributional fidelity.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses demographic bias in synthetic medical data generated by GANs, where underrepresented patient subgroups often remain inadequately captured in synthetic outputs. The authors develop MedEqualizer, a model-agnostic augmentation framework that identifies underrepresented demographic combinations (by race, gender, and age) and generates additional synthetic samples to balance their representation before final GAN training. Using logarithmic disparity metrics and sunburst visualizations, they demonstrate that MedEqualizer substantially improves demographic balance across MedGAN, HealthGAN, and CTGAN models while maintaining data quality through rigorous two-stage filtering. The framework achieves these improvements by adding only a small number of synthetic records, preserving the overall data distribution while enhancing fairness and representativeness in synthetic healthcare data generation.

## Method Summary
MedEqualizer operates through a systematic pipeline that first identifies demographic subgroups below a frequency threshold (τ=150) in real data, then generates synthetic samples specifically for these underrepresented groups using model-appropriate strategies (conditional generation for CTGAN, separate models for MedGAN/HealthGAN). These candidate samples undergo rigorous two-stage filtering—first using One-Class SVM to ensure distributional plausibility, then using a classifier to confirm synthetic-real indistinguishability (accepting batches only if AUC ≤ α). Validated samples are then integrated into the real dataset to reach the threshold, and the augmented dataset is used to train the final GAN model. The framework is evaluated on MIMIC-III using logarithmic disparity metrics to quantify representation gaps between synthetic and real data across multiple protected attributes and their intersections.

## Key Results
- MedEqualizer significantly reduces demographic imbalance in synthetic medical data across all three GAN models tested
- The framework achieves equitable representation for underrepresented subgroups while adding only a small number of synthetic records
- Log disparity metrics show substantial improvements in demographic balance, particularly for HealthGAN and MedGAN
- Sunburst visualizations reveal improved intersectional representation across race, gender, and age combinations
- Two-stage filtering effectively maintains data quality while enabling targeted augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Pre-Generation Augmentation for Underrepresented Subgroups
- Claim: Enriching underrepresented demographic subgroups in real data before synthetic generation improves representational balance in outputs.
- Mechanism: MedEqualizer identifies subgroups below threshold τ (150) and generates synthetic samples to fill the gap (τ − |D_{g,r,a}|). These validated samples augment the real dataset before final GAN training, ensuring the generator sees balanced demographic patterns.
- Core assumption: Generative models learn proportional representations from training data; amplifying minority subgroup presence in training data propagates to more equitable synthetic outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MedEqualizer, a model-agnostic augmentation framework that enriches the underrepresented subgroups prior to synthetic data generation"
  - [section 4.3.4] "After generating synthetic records that pass both tests for all underrepresented subgroups, we integrate them into the real dataset... the augmented data improves demographic balance while preserving the essential characteristics"
  - [corpus] Related work on synthetic data trust (arXiv:2502.02076) emphasizes that bias mitigation in training data is foundational to clinical AI reliability.

### Mechanism 2: Two-Stage Filtering Ensures Distributional Fidelity
- Claim: Cascaded quality filtering retains synthetic samples that are both distributionally plausible and indistinguishable from real data.
- Mechanism: Stage 1 uses One-Class SVM trained on real data to reject samples outside the learned boundary. Stage 2 trains a classifier to distinguish real from synthetic; batches are accepted only if classifier AUC ≤ α (low discriminability = high realism).
- Core assumption: Low classifier AUC indicates synthetic samples have captured the joint distribution of features well enough to confuse a discriminator.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3.3] "We compute the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) for this classifier and only accept a batch if the AUC score falls below a predefined threshold α"
  - [section 4.3.3] "A low AUC indicates that the classifier struggles to distinguish between real and synthetic samples"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus comparison for two-stage filtering in tabular synthetic health data; this appears to be a novel adaptation from Chameleon's image-domain approach.

### Mechanism 3: Model-Specific Conditional vs. Subgroup-Specific Training
- Claim: Different GAN architectures require adapted augmentation strategies to achieve comparable fairness improvements.
- Mechanism: CTGAN supports conditional generation—train once on full data, conditionally sample for target subgroups. MedGAN and HealthGAN lack conditional sampling, so MedEqualizer trains separate models per underrepresented subgroup using only that subgroup's real samples.
- Core assumption: Conditional generators can generalize across subgroups from a shared latent space; non-conditional generators require isolated training to capture subgroup-specific patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3.2] "CTGAN: We trained a conditional generative model on the entire dataset and generated synthetic samples, conditioning the model on each underrepresented subgroup"
  - [section 4.3.2] "HealthGAN and MedGAN: Unlike CTGAN, these models do not support conditional generation. Hence, we trained a separate model for each underrepresented subgroup"
  - [corpus] Related work (arXiv:2508.08529, SynLLM) explores prompt-based synthetic generation but does not address conditional vs. non-conditional architectural constraints.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Logarithmic Disparity Metric**
  - Why needed here: This fairness metric quantifies representation gaps between synthetic and real data. Values near 0 indicate equitable representation; extreme values flag over/underrepresentation.
  - Quick check question: If a subgroup has log disparity = log(0.5), is it over- or underrepresented in synthetic data?

- **Concept: Mode Collapse in GANs**
  - Why needed here: GANs can over-generate common patterns and ignore rare subgroups. Understanding mode collapse explains why demographic imbalance persists without intervention.
  - Quick check question: How does minibatch averaging in MedGAN (Section 2.1) help mitigate mode collapse?

- **Concept: Intersectional Bias**
  - Why needed here: Fairness evaluation must consider combined protected attributes (e.g., Black women aged 65+), not just marginal groups. Sunburst visualizations reveal compounded disparities.
  - Quick check question: Why might a subgroup be adequately represented marginally (by race alone) but highly underrepresented intersectionally (by race + age + gender)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Subgroup Identifier -> Model-Adapted Generator -> Two-Stage Filter -> Augmenter -> Evaluator
- **Critical path:** Identify underrepresented subgroups → Generate synthetic samples (model-specific) → Apply two-stage filtering → Augment real data → Train final generator on augmented data → Evaluate with log disparity
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Threshold τ: Lower values = fewer subgroups augmented, less perturbation; higher values = more comprehensive fairness but risk distribution shift
  - Batch size N: Smaller batches = finer control but slower; larger batches = faster but may waste computation on rejected batches
  - Classifier threshold α: Stricter (lower) = higher quality but more rejections; looser = faster but lower fidelity
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Repeated batch rejections: Generated samples consistently fail OCSVM or classifier—indicates generator-destination mismatch
  - Post-augmentation log disparity still extreme: Augmentation insufficient or threshold τ too low
  - Equitable subgroups decrease: Over-augmentation distorting overall distribution
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline fairness audit:** Run MedGAN, HealthGAN, CTGAN on raw MIMIC-III; compute log disparity by race, gender, age, and intersections. Identify top 5 underrepresented subgroups.
  2. **Threshold sensitivity analysis:** Test τ ∈ {100, 150, 200} on a single model (e.g., HealthGAN). Measure tradeoff between subgroup balance improvement and distributional fidelity (use KS test on continuous features).
  3. **Ablation on filtering:** Disable Stage 1 (OCSVM) or Stage 2 (classifier) separately. Compare post-augmentation log disparity and classifier AUC to assess each filter's contribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does MedEqualizer augmentation affect the performance and fairness of downstream clinical predictive models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states the authors plan to "assess downstream impacts on model performance."
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on evaluating the fairness and representativeness of the synthetic data generation process itself, but does not validate the utility of this data for training predictive algorithms.
- Evidence: Benchmarking predictive model accuracy and fairness metrics (e.g., Equalized Odds) on classifiers trained using MedEqualizer-augmented data versus original data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can MedEqualizer be effectively generalized to other generative architectures and longitudinal healthcare datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion explicitly lists exploring "additional attributes, datasets, [and] generative architectures" as future work.
- Why unresolved: The current study is restricted to the MIMIC-III dataset and three specific GAN variants; generalization to time-series EHR data or diffusion models remains untested.
- Evidence: Successful application of the framework to diverse datasets (e.g., eICU) and architectures (e.g., TimeGAN) demonstrating similar disparity reductions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the synthetic generation of underrepresented subgroups introduce clinically invalid artifacts or spurious correlations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Ethical Considerations section highlights the risk of "overrepresentation of rare patient profiles" and the need for "clinical validation."
- Why unresolved: While statistical filters (OCSVM) were used, the semantic plausibility of synthetic records for extremely rare intersectional groups was not verified by clinical experts.
- Evidence: Clinical expert review or domain-specific consistency checks on the generated records for rare subgroups to ensure biological plausibility.

## Limitations
- Unspecified hyperparameters (threshold α, batch size N, model configurations) may affect reproducibility and optimal performance
- Evaluation limited to MIMIC-III dataset, restricting generalizability to other medical domains and real-world deployment scenarios
- Does not validate clinical validity of synthetic records for extremely rare intersectional groups, only statistical plausibility

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Pre-generation augmentation mechanism for underrepresented subgroups is well-supported by methodology and related work
- **Medium Confidence:** Two-stage filtering approach effectiveness is plausible but lacks direct comparative validation
- **Medium Confidence:** Model-specific adaptation strategy is logically sound but requires empirical validation for optimal implementation

## Next Checks
1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary threshold τ, classifier threshold α, and batch size N to identify optimal configurations that maximize demographic balance while preserving distributional fidelity
2. **Comparative Filtering Evaluation:** Compare two-stage filtering (OCSVM + classifier) against alternative methods (e.g., Wasserstein distance, MMD) on held-out validation set
3. **Generalizability Assessment:** Apply MedEqualizer to different medical dataset (e.g., eICU or different MIMIC-III subset) to evaluate robustness beyond original evaluation setting
