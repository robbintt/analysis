# SCOPE: Prompt Evolution for Enhancing Agent Effectiveness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.15374
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15374
- Authors: Zehua Pei; Hui-Ling Zhen; Shixiong Kai; Sinno Jialin Pan; Yunhe Wang; Mingxuan Yuan; Bei Yu
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SCOPE achieves 38.64% success rate on HLE (vs 14.23%) and 56.97% on GAIA (vs 32.73%) by evolving prompts through execution traces

## Executive Summary
SCOPE addresses a critical limitation in agentic systems where static prompts fail to adapt to dynamic contexts and complex tasks. The framework introduces online prompt evolution that synthesizes guidelines from both agent errors and successes, using a dual-stream (tactical/strategic) routing mechanism to explore diverse strategies through multiple perspectives. This approach enables agents to continuously improve their effectiveness rather than being constrained by initial prompt design.

The system demonstrates substantial performance gains across benchmark evaluations, showing that prompt evolution is not just beneficial but essential for modern agentic systems operating in complex, dynamic environments. By leveraging execution traces as learning signals, SCOPE bridges the gap between static prompt engineering and adaptive intelligence.

## Method Summary
SCOPE implements online prompt evolution through execution trace analysis, synthesizing actionable guidelines from both successful and failed agent interactions. The framework employs dual-stream routing to separate tactical (immediate task execution) and strategic (long-term planning) considerations, while multiple perspective exploration ensures diverse strategy generation. This architecture enables continuous adaptation without requiring complete prompt redesign, making it practical for real-world deployment scenarios.

## Key Results
- Improves HLE benchmark success rates from 14.23% to 38.64%
- Increases GAIA benchmark performance from 32.73% to 56.97%
- Demonstrates superior performance against static prompt baselines and existing methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The core innovation lies in treating execution traces as valuable learning signals rather than mere logs. By systematically analyzing both successes and failures, SCOPE extracts actionable insights that guide prompt refinement. The dual-stream architecture prevents tactical decisions from overwhelming strategic planning, while multiple perspective exploration avoids local optima that plague single-strategy approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- Execution trace analysis: Why needed - provides empirical evidence of agent behavior patterns; Quick check - verify trace quality and completeness
- Dual-stream routing: Why needed - separates immediate execution from long-term strategy; Quick check - validate stream independence
- Guideline synthesis: Why needed - converts raw trace data into actionable prompt modifications; Quick check - test synthesis accuracy on known cases
- Multiple perspective exploration: Why needed - prevents premature convergence to suboptimal strategies; Quick check - measure diversity of generated approaches
- Online adaptation: Why needed - enables continuous improvement without manual intervention; Quick check - monitor adaptation rate and stability
- Error/success classification: Why needed - distinguishes learning opportunities from noise; Quick check - validate classification accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Execution traces -> Error/Success Classifier -> Guideline Synthesizer -> Dual-Stream Router -> Multiple Perspective Explorer -> Prompt Evolver -> Agent

Critical path: Agent execution -> Trace collection -> Error/success classification -> Guideline synthesis -> Dual-stream routing -> Strategy exploration -> Prompt evolution

Design tradeoffs: Real-time evolution vs. computational overhead; Strategy diversity vs. decision consistency; Granular vs. holistic guideline synthesis

Failure signatures: Poor trace quality leading to incorrect guidelines; Imbalanced error/success classification; Strategy exploration getting stuck in local optima; Dual-stream routing creating conflicting directives

First experiments:
1. Baseline comparison: Run agent with static prompts vs. SCOPE-evolved prompts on identical tasks
2. Ablation study: Remove dual-stream routing and measure performance degradation
3. Trace quality test: Inject noise into execution traces and observe guideline synthesis accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to synthetic benchmarks (HLE, GAIA) without extensive real-world validation
- Dual-stream routing effectiveness depends on quality of error/success classification, which lacks thorough validation
- Computational overhead of online prompt evolution and impact on real-time responsiveness not quantified

## Confidence
High confidence: Core methodology of using execution traces for prompt evolution is technically sound and addresses genuine static prompt limitations. Benchmark improvements are well-documented and statistically significant.

Medium confidence: Dual-stream routing contribution could be influenced by benchmark-specific characteristics. Guideline synthesis assumes clean signal-to-noise ratios that may not hold in noisier environments.

Low confidence: Claims about prompt evolution being "essential" extrapolate beyond empirical evidence. Comparative advantages lack rigorous ablation studies isolating specific architectural contributions.

## Next Checks
1. Deploy SCOPE in a live customer service agent environment and measure end-to-end task completion rates across diverse query types over a minimum 30-day period, comparing against static prompt baselines.

2. Conduct systematic ablation studies removing dual-stream routing, multiple perspective exploration, and guideline synthesis components to quantify their individual contributions to performance improvements.

3. Measure and report computational overhead and latency introduced by SCOPE's online evolution mechanisms, including memory usage and processing time per agent interaction, to assess practical deployment feasibility.
