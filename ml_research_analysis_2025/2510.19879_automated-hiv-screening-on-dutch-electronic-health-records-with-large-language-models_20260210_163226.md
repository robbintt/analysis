# Automated HIV Screening on Dutch Electronic Health Records with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19879
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879
- Reference count: 40
- Novel pipeline using MedGemma-27B LLM for automated HIV screening on Dutch EHRs achieves 90.00% sensitivity

## Executive Summary
This study introduces an automated HIV screening pipeline using the MedGemma-27B large language model to analyze unstructured Dutch electronic health records for HIV testing eligibility. The system incorporates EuroTEST clinical guidelines and employs self-consistency aggregation to improve decision accuracy. Evaluated on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, the pipeline demonstrates high accuracy while maintaining a low false negative rate, significantly outperforming traditional baseline methods for HIV screening automation.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed a pipeline that processes unstructured Dutch EHR text using the MedGemma-27B large language model to determine HIV testing eligibility. The system incorporates EuroTEST clinical guidelines and employs self-consistency aggregation to improve decision accuracy. The model analyzes clinical notes and patient information to identify indicators for HIV testing, generating binary screening recommendations. The approach was evaluated on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, comparing performance against traditional baseline methods using established metrics including sensitivity and false negative rate.

## Key Results
- Achieves 90.00% sensitivity when using self-consistency aggregation
- Maintains low false negative rate for HIV screening
- Significantly outperforms traditional baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The high sensitivity is achieved through the combination of MedGemma-27B's strong language understanding capabilities for clinical Dutch text and the self-consistency aggregation method that reduces random errors in individual model predictions. The integration of EuroTEST clinical guidelines ensures that the model's screening recommendations align with established clinical standards for HIV testing eligibility.

## Foundational Learning
The pipeline leverages the MedGemma-27B model's pre-training on medical and scientific literature, which provides a strong foundation for understanding clinical terminology and context in Dutch EHRs. The self-consistency aggregation mechanism draws on ensemble learning principles to improve prediction reliability by considering multiple sampling paths through the same input data.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:**
MedGemma-27B -> Text Processing -> EuroTEST Guidelines Integration -> Self-Consistency Aggregation -> Binary Screening Output

**Critical Path:**
The pipeline processes unstructured EHR text through MedGemma-27B, applies EuroTEST guidelines, uses self-consistency aggregation for decision refinement, and produces binary screening recommendations.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The choice of MedGemma-27B provides strong language understanding for Dutch clinical text but requires significant computational resources. Self-consistency aggregation improves accuracy but increases processing time and complexity.

**Failure Signatures:**
Model may miss subtle clinical indicators in unstructured text, produce false positives due to ambiguous language, or fail to properly apply guideline criteria in complex cases.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test baseline performance without self-consistency aggregation
2. Evaluate performance on structured versus unstructured data subsets
3. Compare different prompt engineering approaches for guideline application

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How well does the system generalize across different Dutch healthcare institutions with varying EHR documentation practices?
- What are the specific failure modes when the model encounters ambiguous clinical language or incomplete documentation?
- How does the system perform on temporal data spanning different clinical settings and time periods?

## Limitations
- Evaluation conducted on single institutional dataset from Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, limiting generalizability to other Dutch healthcare settings
- No assessment of potential biases across different demographic groups or clinical presentations
- Long-term reliability and safety in real-world clinical workflows unproven, particularly regarding false negative rates in diverse patient populations
- The computational cost of self-consistency aggregation may limit scalability in resource-constrained healthcare environments

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical implementation and methodological approach are well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Clinical accuracy claims based on single-center experimental results require external validation across different Dutch healthcare institutions
- **Low confidence**: Real-world safety and clinical impact remain unproven without prospective validation in diverse clinical settings and patient populations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct multi-center validation across different Dutch hospitals with varying patient demographics, EHR systems, and documentation practices
2. Perform prospective clinical validation comparing model recommendations against actual HIV testing outcomes and subsequent diagnoses
3. Evaluate system performance on temporal data spanning multiple years to assess consistency over time and identify temporal dependencies or drift
4. Assess potential biases by analyzing performance across different demographic groups, risk factors, and clinical presentations
5. Measure computational efficiency and scalability for potential deployment in resource-constrained healthcare settings
