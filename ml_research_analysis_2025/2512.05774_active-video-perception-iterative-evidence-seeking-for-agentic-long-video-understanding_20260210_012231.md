core_contribution: The paper proposes Active Video Perception (AVP), an iterative
  evidence-seeking framework for long video understanding. Unlike passive caption-based
  approaches, AVP treats videos as interactive environments, actively deciding what,
  when, and where to observe through a plan-observe-reflect loop.

# Active Video Perception: Iterative Evidence Seeking for Agentic Long Video Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05774
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05774
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AVP achieves best performance across five benchmarks, improving over DVD by 5.7% average accuracy while using 18.4% of inference time and 12.4% of input tokens

## Executive Summary
Active Video Perception (AVP) introduces an iterative evidence-seeking framework for long video understanding that treats videos as interactive environments rather than passive media. Unlike traditional caption-based approaches, AVP employs a plan-observe-reflect loop where an agent actively decides what, when, and where to observe in a video to answer queries efficiently. The framework demonstrates significant improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency across five major long video understanding benchmarks.

The key innovation lies in treating video understanding as an active process where the agent can strategically gather evidence through targeted observations rather than processing entire videos passively. This approach enables more efficient reasoning by focusing computational resources on relevant portions of the video while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
AVP implements a three-stage iterative process: planning, observing, and reflecting. The planner generates targeted observation proposals based on the query and current context, the observer extracts time-stamped evidence directly from video pixels at specified locations, and the reflector evaluates whether sufficient evidence has been gathered to answer the query. This loop continues until the reflector determines the answer can be confidently provided.

The framework uses a unified multimodal model that operates in a "compression-then-plan" mode, allowing it to reason about the video efficiently without processing the entire content. By treating videos as environments that agents can interact with through observations, AVP enables more focused and efficient information gathering compared to traditional passive approaches that process entire videos upfront.

## Key Results
- AVP achieves best performance across five benchmarks (MINERVA, LVBench, MLVU, Video-MME, LongVideoBench)
- Improves over leading agentic method (DVD) by 5.7% average accuracy
- Uses only 18.4% of inference time and 12.4% of input tokens compared to DVD
- Demonstrates strong efficiency gains while maintaining or improving accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AVP works by treating video understanding as an active perception problem where the agent can strategically gather evidence rather than passively processing entire videos. The plan-observe-reflect loop allows the system to focus computational resources on the most relevant portions of the video, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency. By extracting time-stamped evidence directly from pixels rather than relying on pre-generated captions, AVP can capture visual details that might be lost in textual summaries.

The iterative nature allows the agent to refine its understanding progressively, gathering additional evidence only when needed. This selective observation strategy reduces computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, as the system can focus on gathering specific evidence required to answer the query rather than processing all available information.

## Foundational Learning

**Active Perception** - Why needed: Enables efficient information gathering by focusing on relevant video portions. Quick check: Can the agent identify and extract relevant evidence without processing entire video.

**Multimodal Integration** - Why needed: Combines visual and textual information for comprehensive understanding. Quick check: Does the model effectively integrate evidence from different modalities.

**Iterative Reasoning** - Why needed: Allows progressive refinement of understanding through multiple observation cycles. Quick check: Does each iteration improve the quality of evidence gathered.

**Evidence Sufficiency Evaluation** - Why needed: Determines when enough information has been gathered to answer queries. Quick check: Can the system accurately judge when sufficient evidence is available.

**Video as Environment** - Why needed: Treats videos as interactive spaces for evidence gathering rather than static content. Quick check: Does the agent effectively navigate and extract information from video content.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Query -> Planner -> Observer -> Reflector -> Answer (with feedback loop from Reflector to Planner)

**Critical Path**: The plan-observe-reflect loop represents the core processing pipeline, with each component building upon the previous one's output to progressively refine the understanding and gather necessary evidence.

**Design Tradeoffs**: AVP trades off between observation frequency and computational efficiency, balancing the need for sufficient evidence against the cost of additional processing. The framework must decide when to stop gathering evidence versus continuing to observe.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include over-reliance on early observations leading to premature conclusions, insufficient evidence gathering resulting in incorrect answers, and inefficient observation strategies that miss critical information.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test the planner's ability to generate relevant observation proposals for different query types
2. Evaluate the observer's accuracy in extracting time-stamped evidence from video pixels
3. Assess the reflector's effectiveness in determining when sufficient evidence has been gathered

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Generalizability to real-world videos with varying quality and complexity remains untested
- Performance on videos outside the evaluated benchmarks needs validation
- Trade-off between observation frequency and accuracy requires more extensive exploration
- Efficiency claims based on controlled conditions may differ in practical deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- Core methodology confidence: High - The plan-observe-reflect framework represents a sound conceptual approach to active perception
- Empirical results confidence: Medium-High - Comprehensive benchmark evaluation provides strong evidence, though real-world applicability needs validation
- Efficiency claims confidence: Medium - Claims are based on controlled conditions; practical deployment scenarios may yield different results

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate AVP on diverse real-world long videos with varying quality, length, and content complexity outside controlled benchmarks
2. Conduct ablation studies systematically varying observation frequency and plan complexity to establish optimal trade-offs
3. Test cross-dataset generalization by training on one benchmark and evaluating on others to assess robustness
