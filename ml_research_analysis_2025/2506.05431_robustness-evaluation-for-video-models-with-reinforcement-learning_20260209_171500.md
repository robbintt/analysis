# Robustness Evaluation for Video Models with Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.05431
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05431
- Reference count: 38
- The paper proposes a multi-agent RL approach for robust evaluation of video classification models, outperforming state-of-the-art on Lp metrics and average queries.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating robustness in video classification models, which is more complex than image-based models due to the increased temporal dimension. The authors propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach consisting of a spatial agent that identifies sensitive regions in video frames and a temporal agent that selects impactful frames. The agents work cooperatively to generate fine, visually imperceptible perturbations while maintaining low Lp norms. The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on Lp metrics and average queries, demonstrating its effectiveness in evaluating video model robustness.

## Method Summary
The method uses multi-agent reinforcement learning to evaluate video model robustness. A spatial agent performs hierarchical patch selection (L1 coarse, L2 fine) on selected frames, while a temporal agent uses an LSTM to select impactful frames. Both agents share a common misclassification reward but also receive domain-specific rewards (objectness for spatial, frame sparsity for temporal). PPO optimizes both policy networks. The system applies Gaussian Blur, Dead Pixels, or Gaussian Noise distortions to selected patches in selected frames, querying the victim model until misclassification or 10,000 queries. Post-misclassification, a reverse distortion removal phase iteratively removes perturbations from low-impact regions to minimize Lp norms.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Lp metrics and average queries
- Demonstrates effectiveness on two popular datasets: HMDB-51 and UCF-101
- Shows robustness across four video action recognition models: C3D, TSN, TSM, SlowFast

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Search Space Reduction
- Decomposing the high-dimensional video search space through hierarchical spatial patch selection and temporal frame filtering reduces query complexity while maintaining attack effectiveness
- The spatial agent operates in two stages—L1 localization divides frames into coarse non-overlapping grids, selecting one patch; L2 localization further subdivides the selected patch for finer targeting. The temporal agent uses an LSTM-based binary classifier to include/exclude each frame
- Core assumption: Adversarial vulnerability is concentrated in sparse spatial regions and a subset of semantically representative frames, rather than uniformly distributed

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Agent Coordination via Shared and Task-Specific Rewards
- Combining a shared attack-success reward with domain-specific rewards (objectness for spatial, frame sparsity for temporal) enables cooperative learning without explicit communication between agents
- Temporal rewards include (r1) frame count minimization via threshold L, (r2) semantic representativeness via feature embedding distance, (r3) shared confidence reduction. Spatial rewards include (r1) edgebox-based objectness score, (r2) optical-flow motion saliency, (r3) shared confidence reduction
- Core assumption: Task-specific heuristics (edgeboxes for objectness, optical flow for motion saliency) correlate with adversarial vulnerability; PPO can stabilize multi-agent credit assignment

### Mechanism 3: Post-Hoc Reverse Distortion Removal
- Iteratively removing distortions from low-impact regions after achieving misclassification minimizes Lp norm while preserving attack success
- Once misclassification is achieved, the system attempts to reverse distortions from the least sensitive regions, checking after each removal whether misclassification holds
- Core assumption: Not all applied perturbations contribute equally to misclassification; early-exploration distortions in insensitive regions are removable

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
  - Why needed here: Both spatial and temporal agents use PPO for stable policy gradient updates in the actor-critic framework
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how PPO's clipped surrogate objective prevents destabilizing large policy updates during training?

- Concept: **LSTM for Sequential Frame Decisions**
  - Why needed here: The temporal agent processes frames sequentially with LSTM hidden state carrying information across frames; spatial agent uses LSTM to maintain region consistency across consecutive frames
  - Quick check question: How does the LSTM hidden state help the temporal agent decide frame inclusion based on prior frame selections?

- Concept: **Black-Box Query-Based Attacks**
  - Why needed here: The method queries the victim model for prediction scores without gradient access; query efficiency is a core optimization target
  - Quick check question: Why do black-box attacks require more queries than white-box attacks, and what specifically does this paper do to reduce query count?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Feature Extractor -> Temporal Agent -> Spatial Agent -> Victim Models
  MobileNet-V2 -> LSTM + FC -> Hierarchical Patch Selection -> C3D, TSN, TSM, SlowFast

- Critical path:
  1. Extract CNN features from all M frames
  2. Temporal agent sequentially selects focus frames
  3. Spatial agent performs L1 localization on selected frames
  4. Spatial agent refines via L2 localization within L1 patches
  5. Apply distortion to selected patches in selected frames
  6. Query victim model, compute all reward components
  7. Update both policy networks via PPO
  8. Repeat until misclassification or max queries (10,000)
  9. Trigger reverse distortion removal post-misclassification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Patch size: 5×5 yields lower MAP but higher queries; 13×13 yields higher MAP but fewer queries
  - Hierarchical depth: >3 levels increases complexity without proportional gain
  - Distortion type: DP often achieves best success rate; GB achieves lowest MAP

- Failure signatures:
  - High queries (>10K) without success → check reward signal scaling, LSTM state propagation
  - High MAP after reverse removal → reverse step may not be triggering; verify misclassification check
  - Low success rate across all models → agents not learning spatial-temporal correlations; inspect attention/patch selection patterns

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce single-agent vs multi-agent ablation on UCF-101 with TSM to validate claimed 21% MAP improvement
  2. Ablate L2 localization (use only L1 patches) to isolate hierarchical contribution to query reduction
  3. Run reverse distortion removal as standalone post-processing on pre-computed successful attacks to measure MAP reduction independently

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the text provided.

## Limitations
- Critical hyperparameters (PPO settings, patch sizes, frame threshold L) are not specified, making exact reproduction difficult
- Multi-agent coordination mechanism lacks direct video-specific corpus validation
- Reverse distortion removal contribution has no established precedent in video attack literature

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Hierarchical spatial-temporal decomposition approach for reducing search complexity
- **Medium confidence**: Cooperative reward structure effectiveness for multi-agent coordination
- **Medium confidence**: Reverse distortion removal mechanism for minimizing Lp norms

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation study isolating each mechanism (single vs multi-agent, with/without reverse removal, hierarchical vs flat spatial search) to quantify individual contributions to query reduction
2. Test transferability of learned attack patterns across different victim models to validate spatial-temporal vulnerability discovery quality
3. Implement sensitivity analysis on critical hyperparameters (PPO settings, patch sizes, frame threshold L) to establish robustness bounds of the method's performance claims
