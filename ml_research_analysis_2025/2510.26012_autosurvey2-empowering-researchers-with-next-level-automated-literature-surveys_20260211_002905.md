## Executive Summary
AutoSurvey2 is an automated pipeline for generating comprehensive academic survey papers using large language models (LLMs). The system integrates retrieval-augmented generation, modular section planning, and multi-stage content synthesis to overcome context window limitations and ensure topical coverage. It employs semantic embedding search to retrieve relevant literature, uses LLMs to construct structured outlines, and generates sections grounded in retrieved evidence with IEEE citation formatting. A multi-LLM evaluation framework assesses coverage, structure, and relevance. Experiments show AutoSurvey2 outperforms existing baselines in generating coherent, well-structured, and factually grounded surveys.

## Method Summary
AutoSurvey2 uses a four-stage DAG pipeline: (1) Research Planning retrieves 1500 reference papers to generate an 8-section outline; (2) Research Phase retrieves 20 papers per section and analyzes top 5; (3) Generation Phase produces IEEE LaTeX with abstract, conclusion, and citations; (4) Post-processing extracts citations, generates BibTeX, and enhances with DBLP lookups. The system stores ArXiv metadata with 768-dim embeddings in PostgreSQL using pgvector, and uses GPT-4.1 for generation. A multi-LLM Judge Agent evaluates surveys on Coverage, Structure, and Relevance using 5-point Likert scales.

## Key Results
- AutoSurvey2 outperforms existing baselines in generating coherent, well-structured, and factually grounded surveys
- Ablation study shows removing the planner causes a 19% degradation in Structure score, the largest among ablated components
- The multi-LLM evaluation framework provides reproducible quality assessment aligned with expert review criteria

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation with semantic embeddings improves factual grounding and reduces citation hallucination
- Mechanism: The system encodes paper abstracts into 768-dimensional vectors using nomic-embed-text-v2-moe, stores them in PostgreSQL with pgvector, and retrieves top-k papers via cosine similarity before generation. Retrieved titles and abstracts are provided as context to the LLM, constraining output to grounded content
- Core assumption: Relevant papers' abstracts contain sufficient signal for the LLM to synthesize accurate survey content without reading full texts
- Evidence anchors: Related work consistently uses embedding-based retrieval, but no corpus papers directly validate the abstract-sufficiency assumption

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical planning with retrieval-guided outline generation improves structural coherence
- Mechanism: Before writing, the system retrieves 1500 reference papers related to the topic, then prompts an LLM to generate a structured 8-section outline based on themes, methods, and research directions identified in the retrieved corpus
- Core assumption: The LLM can identify coherent thematic structure from paper titles and abstracts alone, and this structure transfers to a well-organized survey
- Evidence anchors: Ablation study shows removing the planner drops Structure score from 4.68 to 3.78—a 19% degradation, the largest among ablated components

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-LLM evaluation framework provides scalable, reproducible quality assessment aligned with expert review criteria
- Mechanism: A Judge Agent (separate LLM) evaluates generated surveys on Coverage, Structure, and Relevance using 5-point Likert scales with detailed rubrics. Zero-temperature inference ensures reproducibility
- Core assumption: LLM evaluators can approximate expert judgment on academic writing quality when given explicit rubrics
- Evidence anchors: Evaluation framework is stated but not validated against human benchmarks

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vector embeddings and semantic similarity search
  - Why needed here: The entire retrieval system depends on understanding how text is converted to dense vectors and how cosine similarity ranks semantic relatedness
  - Quick check question: Given two abstracts, can you explain why their embedding similarity might be high even if they share no keywords?

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: AutoSurvey2's core innovation is grounding LLM generation in retrieved evidence rather than parametric knowledge
  - Quick check question: What specific failure modes does RAG address that pure LLM generation cannot?

- Concept: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for workflow orchestration
  - Why needed here: The system uses a graph-based state machine where nodes represent operations and edges encode dependencies
  - Quick check question: If node B depends on node A's output, how does the DAG ensure correct execution order?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Database Construction: PostgreSQL + pgvector stores ArXiv metadata + 768-dim embeddings (nomic-embed-text-v2-moe)
  - Stage 1 - Research Planning: PlanningPhase → OutlineGeneration → SectionPlanning (retrieves 1500 papers, generates 8-section outline)
  - Stage 2 - Research Phase: PaperSearch → ContentAnalysis → ContentSynthesis (per-section retrieval of 20 papers, analysis of top 5)
  - Stage 3 - Generation Phase: PaperGeneration (abstract, conclusion, IEEE LaTeX formatting)
  - Stage 4 - Post-processing: Citation extraction, BibTeX generation, DBLP enhancement, final compilation
  - State Management: Global state Σ (topic, outline, related_papers, generated_sections, section_papers)

- Critical path: Outline quality (Stage 1) → Section-level retrieval relevance (Stage 2) → Citation fidelity (Stage 4). Ablation shows planner removal causes the largest performance drop; prioritize outline generation logic

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Parallel section generation improves speed but risks stylistic inconsistencies (acknowledged in Limitations)
  - Abstract-only retrieval trades full-text depth for computational tractability
  - LLM-as-judge enables scalable evaluation but inherits model biases

- Failure signatures:
  - Low similarity scores (< 0.7 threshold) indicate sparse retrieval corpus for the topic
  - Missing ArXiv IDs in citations suggest regex extraction failures
  - DBLP lookup failures leave preprint citations unenhanced
  - Stylistic inconsistency across sections signals insufficient refactoring

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the pipeline on a topic with known ground-truth surveys (e.g., "Transformers in Vision") and compare Coverage/Structure/Relevance scores against human baselines to validate the evaluation framework
  2. Ablate the ContentAnalysis node (skip structured analysis, pass raw papers directly to synthesis) to quantify its contribution to Relevance scores
  3. Test retrieval quality by sampling 20 papers per section and manually assessing semantic similarity to the section query; if >30% are tangential, tune the embedding model or similarity threshold

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can tighter verification modules be integrated into the pipeline to detect and correct factual inaccuracies or citation errors inherited from LLM pretraining data?
- Basis in paper: Section 8 (Limitations) states the system inherits LLM limitations like factual inaccuracies and that "Addressing these issues will require tighter integration of verification modules"
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies on retrieval and LLM self-evaluation, but lacks a dedicated, fine-grained verification layer for the generated text beyond citation formatting
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing a reduction in hallucination rates when a specific verification module (e.g., fact-checking against retrieved evidence) is added to the generation phase

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the parallelized section generation architecture introduce stylistic inconsistencies, and can shared stylistic constraints or post-hoc style transfer models resolve them?
- Basis in paper: Section 8 notes that "parallelized section generation... can occasionally introduce stylistic inconsistencies that require additional refinement"
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the inconsistency as a constraint of the current parallel approach but does not quantify the divergence or propose a specific algorithmic solution beyond general refinement
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative metrics measuring stylistic variance across sections (e.g., perplexity, vocabulary richness) comparing standard parallel generation against a proposed consistency-aware generation method

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the system's performance degrade when the underlying literature database contains missing or misclassified entries, and can retrieval robustness be improved for incomplete corpora?
- Basis in paper: Section 8 highlights that "output quality is inherently dependent on the completeness and accuracy of the underlying literature database—missing or misclassified entries may cause important works to be overlooked"
- Why unresolved: The evaluation assumes a high-quality ArXiv snapshot; the system's robustness to sparse or noisy data repositories has not been tested
- What evidence would resolve it: A sensitivity analysis measuring "Coverage" scores (as defined in Section 5) when the reference database is progressively corrupted or thinned to simulate missing entries

## Limitations
- The system inherits LLM limitations like factual inaccuracies and requires tighter integration of verification modules
- Parallelized section generation can occasionally introduce stylistic inconsistencies that require additional refinement
- Output quality is inherently dependent on the completeness and accuracy of the underlying literature database

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Retrieval-augmented generation with semantic embeddings as a baseline approach (established in related work like AutoSurvey and SurveyForge)
- Medium Confidence: Hierarchical planning improves structural coherence (supported by ablation study showing 19% Structure score drop when planner removed)
- Low Confidence: Multi-LLM evaluation framework accurately approximates expert judgment (stated but not validated against human benchmarks)

## Next Checks
1. **Human Correlation Study**: Compare Judge Agent scores against three independent human experts rating the same AutoSurvey2-generated surveys on Coverage, Structure, and Relevance. Calculate inter-rater reliability (e.g., Krippendorff's alpha) to validate the evaluation framework
2. **Abstract vs. Full-Text Retrieval**: Generate two surveys on the same topic - one using abstract-only retrieval (current method) and one using full-text retrieval. Compare Coverage and Relevance scores to quantify the information loss tradeoff
3. **Generalizability Test**: Run AutoSurvey2 on three distinct domains (e.g., "Transformer architectures," "Federated learning," "Computer vision ethics") and evaluate whether the planner consistently identifies coherent thematic structures across domains with varying literature density and disciplinary norms
