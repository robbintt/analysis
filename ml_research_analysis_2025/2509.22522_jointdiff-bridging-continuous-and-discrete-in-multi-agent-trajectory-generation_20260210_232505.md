# JointDiff: Bridging Continuous and Discrete in Multi-Agent Trajectory Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.22522
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22522
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Unifies continuous trajectory generation and discrete event modeling in multi-agent systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance on sports datasets with semantic controllability

## Executive Summary
JointDiff introduces a novel diffusion framework that bridges the gap between continuous trajectory generation and discrete event modeling in multi-agent systems. By jointly modeling both modalities, the method achieves superior performance on scene-level metrics in sports datasets (NBA, NFL, Bundesliga) while enabling semantic controllability through weak-possessor-guidance and text-guidance. The approach introduces CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains, and provides a unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions.

## Method Summary
JointDiff employs a novel diffusion framework that jointly models continuous trajectories and discrete events in multi-agent systems. The method introduces CrossGuid, a conditioning operation specifically designed for multi-agent domains that enables effective semantic controllability. The framework integrates weak-possessor-guidance and text-guidance mechanisms to provide controllable generation of trajectories based on semantic information. A unified sports benchmark with textual descriptions is introduced to evaluate the model's performance across different sports datasets including NBA, NFL, and Bundesliga.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on scene-level metrics across NBA, NFL, and Bundesliga datasets
- Demonstrates the importance of joint modeling for realistic and controllable generative models in interactive systems
- Outperforms non-joint baselines across all tested datasets and metrics
- Provides effective semantic controllability through weak-possessor-guidance and text-guidance mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of JointDiff stems from its unified approach to modeling both continuous trajectories and discrete events simultaneously. By treating these traditionally separate aspects as a joint problem, the model captures the inherent dependencies between spatial movements and event occurrences. The CrossGuid conditioning operation allows for efficient integration of semantic information, while the diffusion framework provides stable training dynamics for the complex joint distribution.

## Foundational Learning
- Diffusion probabilistic models: Why needed - provide stable training for complex distributions; Quick check - verify denoising score matching objective
- Multi-agent trajectory generation: Why needed - captures interactions between multiple agents; Quick check - ensure proper modeling of relative positions and velocities
- Conditional generation: Why needed - enables semantic controllability; Quick check - verify conditioning information properly influences generation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input Trajectory/Events -> CrossGuid Conditioning -> Joint Diffusion Model -> Output Trajectory/Events

**Critical Path**
1. Trajectory and event data preprocessing
2. CrossGuid conditioning operation
3. Joint diffusion model processing
4. Semantic controllability integration

**Design Tradeoffs**
The joint modeling approach trades computational complexity for improved realism and controllability. The CrossGuid operation introduces additional parameters but enables more effective conditioning compared to traditional methods.

**Failure Signatures**
- Mode collapse in generated trajectories
- Inconsistent event modeling when conditioning on semantic information
- Degraded performance when scaling to larger agent counts

**First Experiments**
1. Compare joint vs. separate modeling approaches on trajectory reconstruction accuracy
2. Evaluate semantic controllability through ablation of weak-possessor-guidance and text-guidance
3. Test CrossGuid conditioning effectiveness against standard conditioning methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Performance generalization to non-sports multi-agent domains remains untested
- Absence of baselines from other multi-agent trajectory generation approaches limits comparative assessment
- Practical utility of semantic controllability features would benefit from more extensive user studies

## Confidence
- Performance claims on sports datasets: High
- CrossGuid conditioning effectiveness: Medium
- Semantic controllability claims: Medium
- Benchmark contribution: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test JointDiff on non-sports multi-agent datasets (e.g., pedestrian trajectory datasets, autonomous vehicle scenarios) to evaluate cross-domain generalization.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of joint modeling versus separate trajectory and event modeling to quantify the specific contribution of the joint approach.
3. Implement a user study evaluating the practical utility of semantic controllability features (weak-possessor-guidance and text-guidance) in real-world scenarios.
