# Who Moved My Distribution? Conformal Prediction for Interactive Multi-Agent Systems

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11567

- Primary result: Iterative conformal prediction framework adapts uncertainty-aware controllers to endogenous distribution shifts in multi-agent systems, achieving up to 9.6% higher success rates while maintaining safety guarantees

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of safe motion planning in multi-agent systems where uncertainty-aware agents interact with reactive non-ego agents, leading to endogenous distribution shifts. The authors introduce an iterative conformal prediction framework that adapts uncertainty-aware controllers to these shifts through trajectory data collected under the deployed controller. The core method integrates with model predictive control and includes theoretical analysis establishing convergence conditions. Experiments in 2- and 3-agent simulation scenarios demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, showing improved success rates while maintaining safety guarantees and preventing overly conservative behavior seen in non-iterative methods.

## Method Summary
The method introduces an iterative conformal prediction framework for multi-agent systems where agents must plan motions under uncertainty while interacting with reactive non-ego agents. The core innovation is an iterative recalibration process that adapts prediction regions using trajectory data collected under the deployed controller. The framework integrates with model predictive control, allowing agents to maintain safety guarantees while avoiding the overly conservative behavior typical of non-iterative approaches. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence conditions for the iterative process, providing guarantees that the method will eventually adapt to distribution shifts caused by agent interactions.

## Key Results
- Iterative conformal prediction achieves up to 9.6% higher success rates compared to baseline methods in 2- and 3-agent simulation scenarios
- The framework maintains safety guarantees while preventing the overly conservative behavior typical of non-iterative approaches
- In 3-agent cases, the method shows particularly notable improvements when all agents employ conformal prediction
- The iterative approach successfully adapts to endogenous distribution shifts caused by agent interactions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by recognizing that in multi-agent systems, the distribution of states and actions shifts endogenously as agents interact with each other. Traditional conformal prediction methods fail in these settings because they assume stationarity. The iterative approach collects trajectory data under the deployed controller and uses this to recalibrate prediction regions, effectively adapting to the shifting distributions. By integrating with model predictive control, the method maintains real-time feasibility while continuously updating its uncertainty estimates. The convergence analysis ensures that this iterative process will eventually stabilize, providing both adaptivity and theoretical guarantees.

## Foundational Learning

**Conformal Prediction**: A framework for uncertainty quantification that provides statistical guarantees on prediction sets. Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for uncertainty-aware control. Quick check: Verify that prediction regions satisfy coverage guarantees at desired confidence levels.

**Endogenous Distribution Shifts**: Changes in data distributions caused by the agent's own actions or interactions with other agents. Why needed: Multi-agent systems inherently create these shifts through mutual interactions. Quick check: Monitor prediction error statistics to detect when distributions have shifted.

**Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: A control strategy that solves optimization problems over receding horizons. Why needed: Provides the real-time control framework that the conformal prediction adapts to. Quick check: Ensure MPC optimization remains feasible under the uncertainty bounds provided by conformal prediction.

**Nonconformity Measures**: Functions that quantify how different a new data point is from existing data. Why needed: Core component for determining prediction regions in conformal prediction. Quick check: Verify that nonconformity scores remain bounded as assumed in theoretical analysis.

**Iterative Refinement**: The process of repeatedly updating estimates based on new data. Why needed: Enables adaptation to distribution shifts in dynamic environments. Quick check: Monitor convergence of prediction regions across iterations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: State Estimator -> Nonconformity Measure -> Prediction Region Calculator -> MPC Optimizer -> Controller -> Environment -> Trajectory Data Collector -> Update Mechanism -> (back to Nonconformity Measure)

**Critical Path**: The core execution path involves: (1) collecting trajectory data from environment, (2) computing nonconformity scores, (3) calculating updated prediction regions, (4) feeding these regions into MPC optimization, and (5) generating control actions. This cycle repeats iteratively.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances between adaptivity (frequent updates to handle distribution shifts) and computational overhead (each iteration requires recalculation of prediction regions). The choice of nonconformity measure affects both the quality of uncertainty quantification and computational efficiency. The integration with MPC requires careful consideration of how uncertainty bounds affect feasibility and optimality.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include: (1) nonconvergence of the iterative process due to unbounded nonconformity scores, (2) overly conservative prediction regions leading to poor performance, (3) computational bottlenecks preventing real-time operation, and (4) safety violations if the conformal guarantees don't hold in practice.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement a single-agent scenario with synthetic distribution shifts to verify the iterative update mechanism works as expected
2. Test the integration with MPC on a simple 2-agent collision avoidance problem to validate real-time feasibility
3. Evaluate the safety guarantees by deliberately introducing challenging scenarios where traditional methods fail

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper identifies several open questions regarding scalability to larger agent populations, performance under nonlinear system dynamics, computational overhead in real-time applications, and the extent to which theoretical assumptions hold in complex real-world scenarios. It also raises questions about how the method performs compared to the broader state of the art in multi-agent motion planning.

## Limitations

- Theoretical analysis assumes bounded nonconformity scores and Lipschitz continuity, which may not hold in complex real-world scenarios
- Experiments are limited to simple 2- and 3-agent settings with linear system dynamics, leaving scalability questions unanswered
- Safety guarantees depend on conformal prediction assumptions that may not fully capture multi-agent interaction complexity
- Computational overhead of repeated recalibrations and impact on real-time performance in safety-critical applications remains unclear
- Comparison with existing methods is limited to specific baselines and may not represent the full state of the art

## Confidence

**High**: The iterative conformal prediction framework effectively adapts to distribution shifts in controlled multi-agent scenarios, showing measurable improvements in success rates.
**Medium**: The theoretical convergence analysis provides a solid foundation, though practical applicability may be limited by the assumptions made.
**Low**: The scalability of the method to larger, more complex multi-agent systems with nonlinear dynamics is not fully established.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments with larger numbers of agents (5+) and nonlinear system dynamics to assess scalability and robustness
2. Implement the framework on a physical multi-robot testbed to evaluate real-world performance and safety guarantees under sensor noise and actuation uncertainties
3. Compare the computational overhead and real-time performance of the iterative approach against non-iterative methods in high-frequency control loops
