# Flow Matching Meets Biology and Life Science: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.17731
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17731
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First comprehensive review of flow matching (FM) applications in biology and life sciences, covering sequence modeling, molecule generation, protein design, bioimages, and spatial transcriptomics.

## Executive Summary
This survey presents the first comprehensive review of flow matching (FM) applications in biology and life sciences. FM offers a continuous probability flow framework for generative modeling, avoiding stochastic diffusion steps. The paper categorizes FM applications into biological sequence modeling, molecule generation and design, and protein generation. Key methods include conditional FM for guided generation, rectified FM for straighter probability paths, and non-Euclidean FM for curved manifolds. For biological sequences, FM methods like Fisher Flow and Dirichlet Flow enable efficient DNA and RNA generation. In 3D molecule generation, SE(3)-equivariant and optimal transport-based FM models improve efficiency and validity. Protein generation benefits from backbone generation, co-design, and docking prediction using FM. The survey also covers bio-image generation, spatial transcriptomics, and neural activity modeling. Datasets span DNA/RNA sequences, single-cell genomics, molecular structures, and protein structures. Future directions include discrete sequence generation, small molecule design with physical priors, and protein dynamics modeling. FM's continuous, geometry-aware, and conditioning capabilities make it a promising tool for diverse biological applications.

## Method Summary
This survey paper reviews flow matching methods applied to biology and life sciences. The authors synthesize findings from 40+ papers covering biological sequence modeling, 3D molecule generation, protein generation, bio-image generation, spatial transcriptomics, and neural activity modeling. The paper identifies key FM variants including Conditional FM, Rectified FM, Non-Euclidean FM, and Discrete FM (CTMC-based, Simplex-based). Reviewed methods use various biological datasets including QM9 (133K molecules), ZINC250K (249K), GEOM-Drugs (430K), PDB (200K+ proteins), and single-cell genomics data. The survey highlights FM's advantages over diffusion models including fewer inference steps and continuous probability flow, while identifying challenges in discrete sequence generation, physical prior integration, and scalability to large proteins.

## Key Results
- FM achieves efficient 3D molecule generation by enforcing SE(3)-equivariance in the vector field, ensuring physical constraints like rotation and translation invariance are preserved during generation
- Rectified FM accelerates inference by replacing stochastic, iterative denoising with deterministic, straight-line probability paths, significantly reducing sampling steps
- FM extends to discrete biological sequences (DNA, RNA) by interpreting the flow over probability simplices or via Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC), rather than continuous Euclidean space

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Flow Matching (FM) likely generates biologically valid 3D structures (proteins, molecules) by enforcing SE(3)-equivariance in the vector field, ensuring physical constraints like rotation and translation invariance are preserved during generation.
- Mechanism: The model learns a vector field $u_\theta(x, t)$ that transports noise to data. By constructing this field with SE(3)-equivariant layers, the generated trajectories respect the geometric symmetries inherent in atomic coordinates, preventing the creation of physically impossible or unaligned structures.
- Core assumption: Biological validity and energy stability in 3D space correlate strongly with the preservation of rotational and translational symmetries during the generative process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section V-B] "To ensure physically meaningful and symmetry-consistent outputs, recent advancements have incorporated SE(3)-equivariant neural architectures into flow matching models."
  - [Section VI-A] "...adhering to SE(3)-equivariance, local bond constraints, and global topological consistency."
  - [Corpus] "Generating Cyclic Conformers with Flow Matching..." validates FM application in complex conformational geometry.
- Break condition: If the target biological structure requires specific chiralities or non-geometric chemical constraints not captured by standard SE(3) layers, the generated output may be geometrically valid but chemically inert.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FM appears to accelerate inference in biological tasks by replacing the stochastic, iterative denoising of diffusion models with deterministic, straight-line probability paths (Rectified Flow).
- Mechanism: Instead of simulating a stochastic differential equation (SDE), FM learns an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). "Rectified" variants specifically align the coupling between source (noise) and target (data) to minimize path curvature, allowing ODE solvers to reach high-quality samples in significantly fewer steps.
- Core assumption: A deterministic path exists that connects the simple prior distribution to the complex biological data distribution without sacrificing sample fidelity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Abstract] "...offering a flexible and scalable framework... generating high-quality samples with fewer inference steps..."
  - [Section III-A] "Rectified FM... prefers the linear transport trajectory... It is shown that the optimal transport (OT) coupling provides a straight coupling... simplifying the flow."
  - [Corpus] "Three Forms of Stochastic Injection..." discusses enhancements to distribution-to-distribution modeling, implying active refinement of these trajectories.
- Break condition: If the biological data manifold is highly disjoint or multimodal, strictly straight paths may cross low-probability regions ("manifestation of the manifold hypothesis"), potentially requiring stochastic injections to maintain diversity.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FM extends to discrete biological sequences (DNA, RNA) by interpreting the flow over a probability simplex or via Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC), rather than continuous Euclidean space.
- Mechanism: For discrete data, the model learns the rate of transition between states (nucleotides/amino acids) rather than a velocity vector in continuous space. Techniques like Dirichlet Flow define paths on the probability simplex to handle categorical variables smoothly before "hardening" to discrete sequences.
- Core assumption: The evolution of discrete biological sequences can be modeled as a continuous probability flow or a Markov process that converges to the target empirical distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section III-B] "Discrete FM has emerged as a powerful paradigm... covering a wide range of biological objects."
  - [Section IV-A] "Fisher-Flow... treats discrete DNA sequences as points on a statistical manifold... allowing for continuous reparameterization."
  - [Corpus] Related papers like "Three Forms of Stochastic Injection" explore distribution-to-distribution generation, but specific discrete FM corpus evidence for sequences is less cited in the provided neighbors; rely primarily on Section IV.
- Break condition: Breaks if the "vocabulary" of biological tokens is vast or if long-range dependencies (common in proteins) cannot be captured by the local transition rates of standard CTMC formulations without Transformer-based conditioning.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNF) & ODEs**
  - Why needed here: FM is fundamentally a CNF method. Understanding how to integrate a vector field over time ($dx/dt = u(x,t)$) to transform distributions is the core mathematical engine of this survey.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why an ODE solver allows for fewer inference steps than the iterative denoising loop of a standard DDPM?

- Concept: **SE(3) Equivariance**
  - Why needed here: Critical for 3D molecular and protein generation. You must understand that rotating the input coordinates must result in a correspondingly rotated output structure for the model to be physically useful.
  - Quick check question: If I rotate a protein backbone input by 45 degrees, what must happen to the predicted vector field $u_\theta(x,t)$ for the model to be SE(3)-equivariant?

- Concept: **Optimal Transport (OT) & Couplings**
  - Why needed here: The survey highlights "Rectified Flow" as a key efficiency driver. This relies on OT concepts to find the "straightest" path between noise and data.
  - Quick check question: How does coupling a specific noise sample $x_0$ to a specific data sample $x_1$ (rather than just the distributions) help "straighten" the generative trajectory?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (Biological data) -> Interpolant (Path definition) -> Backbone (Neural network estimating vector field) -> Integration (ODE Solver)
- Critical path: Selecting the **Conditioning Mechanism**. The paper emphasizes *Conditional FM* for guided generation (e.g., protein pocket design). The model must accept conditional inputs (like a protein pocket) and modify the vector field $u_\theta(x, t, c)$ accordingly.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Straight vs. Curved Paths**: Straight paths (Rectified FM) allow 1-step generation but may fail to model complex multi-modal distributions as well as stochastic/curved flows.
  - **Continuous vs. Discrete**: Modeling DNA as continuous probabilities (Fisher Flow) is differentiable but requires a final discretization step that may introduce error.
- Failure signatures:
  - **Mode Collapse**: Generating valid but repetitive biological structures (common in small-molecule generation).
  - **Non-physicality**: Generated molecules with steric clashes or invalid bond angles (indicates missing or weak equivariance/physical priors).
  - **Instability**: ODE solver divergence if the vector field is not Lipschitz continuous or if step sizes are too large in high-curvature regions.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **2D Molecule Generation (QM9/ZINC)**: Validate the basic discrete/graph FM pipeline. Check validity and uniqueness metrics against diffusion baselines.
  2. **Protein Backbone Generation (PDB)**: Test the SE(3) implementation. Measure "designability" (can a sequence be predicted for the generated structure?).
  3. **Conditional Scaffolding**: Given a fixed motif, generate a surrounding scaffold. This tests the model's ability to handle rigid constraints.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can discrete Flow Matching (FM) yield more semantically coherent representations and facilitate better downstream performance compared to Masked Language Modeling (MLM) for biological sequences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly ask this question in Section IX.A while discussing the representational advantages of discrete FM over traditional paradigms like MLM.
- Why unresolved: Discrete FM is described as a "largely underexplored frontier," and its generation quality currently lags behind state-of-the-art autoregressive transformers in language generation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical benchmarks showing discrete FM models outperforming MLM baselines on biological sequence classification tasks and metrics of semantic coherence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can Flow Matching be integrated with physical simulations (e.g., molecular dynamics) to learn natural transition paths between protein states?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section IX.C identifies modeling protein dynamics, such as conformational changes, as a core challenge and proposes exploring the integration of FM with physical simulations as a solution.
- Why unresolved: Current models often struggle to capture the continuous, physics-driven evolution of protein structures without relying on computationally expensive, extensive simulation data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Hybrid models combining FM with molecular dynamics that successfully predict protein conformational transitions with higher fidelity and interpretability than simulation-free baselines.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the Flow Matching framework be adapted to effectively capture inter-molecular interactions and reaction dynamics for complex tasks like enzyme design?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section IX.B, the authors state that leveraging FM to capture inter-molecular interactions and reaction dynamics represents a "crucial and promising direction" for drug discovery.
- Why unresolved: Tasks like enzyme design involve modeling specific reaction mechanisms beyond simple molecular recognition, which standard generative models do not explicitly encode.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of FM architectures capable of generating molecules that correctly bind and catalyze specific reactions, validated by binding affinity assays and functional activity scores.

## Limitations

- Discrete Sequence Generation: The survey claims FM can handle DNA/RNA sequences via Dirichlet Flow and CTMC, but specific performance metrics and error rates for discretization are not provided.
- Physical Prior Integration: While SE(3)-equivariance is emphasized, the integration of more complex physical constraints (e.g., quantum chemical energies, protein dynamics) is only briefly mentioned.
- Scalability to Large Proteins: Most cited methods focus on small to medium proteins; scaling to large, multi-domain proteins remains untested in the survey.

## Confidence

- **High**: FM's continuous probability flow framework and its ability to replace diffusion's stochastic steps with deterministic ODEs (Mechanism 2) is well-established in the literature.
- **Medium**: FM's extension to discrete biological sequences (DNA, RNA) via CTMC or Dirichlet Flow is conceptually sound but lacks comprehensive empirical validation in the survey.
- **Low**: The survey's claims about FM's superior efficiency in 3D molecular generation are based on architectural innovations (SE(3)-equivariance) rather than direct, systematic comparisons with state-of-the-art diffusion models.

## Next Checks

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Run FM and diffusion models on the same 3D molecule generation task (QM9/ZINC) and compare sample quality, validity, and inference speed.
2. **Discrete Sequence Fidelity**: Evaluate the accuracy of DNA/RNA sequence generation using FM, focusing on discretization error and long-range dependency capture.
3. **Large-Scale Protein Test**: Apply FM to generate a large, multi-domain protein structure and assess geometric validity, designability, and computational scalability.
