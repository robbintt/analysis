# Evaluating Large Language Models on the Frame and Symbol Grounding Problems: A Zero-shot Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.07896
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07896
- Authors: Shoko Oka
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Closed LLMs (ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.0 Flash) scored 41-56 on zero-shot tasks; open models showed high variability, with medium-scale Instruct-tuned models scoring 19-50 and smaller models near zero.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates 13 large language models on two fundamental AI philosophical problems: the frame problem (dynamic information filtering) and symbol grounding (meaning construction for novel symbols). Using a zero-shot benchmark with 5 trials per model, outputs were scored by an LLM rater on 6 criteria. Closed models demonstrated consistent high performance (41-56 mean scores), while open-source models showed greater variability with medium-scale Instruct-tuned models performing moderately (19-50) and smaller models scoring near zero. Symbol grounding tasks yielded higher scores than frame tasks, suggesting LLMs may be better suited to creative/associative tasks than dynamic situational reasoning.

## Method Summary
The study employed a zero-shot evaluation design where 13 LLMs generated responses to two philosophical reasoning tasks. Each model completed 5 independent trials for both the Frame Problem (urban navigation with dynamic updates) and Symbol Grounding Problem (conceptualizing a novel object "kluben"). Outputs were scored by ChatGPT-4o using a 6-criterion rubric (0-10 points each). Open-source models ran on AWS EC2 with default sampling parameters and max_new_tokens=1000, while closed models used standard UI/API access. The evaluation script and exact prompts are provided in the paper.

## Key Results
- Closed models (ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.0 Flash) achieved consistently high scores (41-56 mean) across both tasks
- Open-source models showed high variability, with Llama 3B Instruct scoring 27.8 (frame) and 50.2 (symbol grounding) versus base 3B scoring 5.4 and 10.4
- Symbol grounding tasks generally yielded higher scores than frame tasks across all model types
- 8-bit quantization preserved response determinism but modestly reduced scores (Phi-3: 28→19 frame, 46→41 symbol grounding)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Larger parameter count combined with instruction tuning enables more stable zero-shot reasoning on abstract philosophical tasks.
- Mechanism: Scaling increases representational capacity for semantic associations and contextual reasoning, while instruction tuning aligns model behavior toward task completion patterns.
- Core assumption: Performance gains reflect genuine capability improvements rather than memorized patterns or evaluator bias.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Instruct tuning and model size improved performance"; [Section 4.3/5.2] Tables 6a/6b show Llama 3B Instruct dramatically outperforming base 3B; [corpus] The Vector Grounding Problem (arXiv:2304.01481) discusses how LLMs may achieve grounding without explicit sensorimotor experience.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Models exhibit stronger capability on creative/associative tasks (symbol grounding) versus dynamic situational reasoning (frame problem).
- Mechanism: LLM training on text corpora may favor semantic association and narrative generation patterns over causal reasoning about physical constraints and real-time information updating.
- Core assumption: Score differentials reflect genuine architectural tendencies rather than evaluation artifact.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Symbol grounding tasks generally yielded higher scores than frame tasks"; [Section 4.5] Comparative analysis shows consistent pattern across model types.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: 8-bit quantization preserves response determinism while modestly reducing evaluated quality.
- Mechanism: Quantization reduces precision of weight representations but maintains overall activation patterns.
- Core assumption: Quality reduction reflects genuine capability degradation rather than evaluator sensitivity to minor stylistic changes.
- Evidence anchors: [Section 4.4] Tables 7a/7b show identical trial-by-trial outputs with reduced scores; [Section 5.3] Discussion notes output content remained identical but scores decreased.

## Foundational Learning

- **Frame Problem**:
  - Why needed here: Central evaluation task testing information selection and situation model updating in dynamic environments. Originates from McCarthy & Hayes (1969) on relevance determination.
  - Quick check question: Given multiple simultaneous events, can you identify which information affects a specific goal and update your judgment when conditions change?

- **Symbol Grounding Problem**:
  - Why needed here: Tests whether models can construct internal meaning for novel symbols without real-world referents. Originates from Harnad (1990) on how arbitrary symbols acquire meaning.
  - Quick check question: If presented with a nonsense word "kluben" described only abstractly, can you construct coherent meaning, stories, and emotional interpretations?

- **Zero-shot Evaluation**:
  - Why needed here: Methodological choice ensuring models receive no examples or hints, testing pure comprehension rather than pattern matching to demonstrations.
  - Quick check question: Can the model complete a novel task type without any prior examples of correct outputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Subject LLMs (13 models) -> Task prompts (Frame/Symbol Grounding) -> 5 trial executions -> Evaluator LLM (ChatGPT-4o) -> 6-criterion scoring -> Mean/SD calculation

- **Critical path**:
  1. Design prompts capturing philosophical problem essence (Sections 3.2)
  2. Run 5 independent trials per model in zero-shot format (Section 3.3)
  3. Submit outputs to evaluator LLM with randomized ordering (Section 3.4)
  4. Calculate mean and standard deviation per model-task combination (Section 3.5)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Single rater LLM ensures reproducibility but introduces potential bias; paper acknowledges need for human expert evaluation
  - Zero-shot design tests "basic ability" but may underestimate few-shot or chain-of-thought capabilities
  - English-only prompts maximize training data overlap but limit cross-linguistic generalization claims

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Non-response or response loops (TinyLlama, Llama 1B base): indicates prompt comprehension failure
  - High standard deviation with intermittent high scores (Llama 1B Instruct: SD 19.37): suggests unstable capability expression
  - Identical responses across trials (Phi-3): indicates excessive determinism, potentially limiting creative tasks

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate with human expert raters to validate LLM scoring reliability (addresses Section 5.5 limitation)
  2. Add few-shot and chain-of-thought conditions to measure prompt engineering effects beyond zero-shot baseline
  3. Expand model selection to include additional parameter scales (7B, 13B, 70B) to characterize scaling curve more precisely

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Does the automated scoring by a "rater LLM" (ChatGPT-4o) correlate reliably with human expert evaluation for the Frame and Symbol Grounding benchmarks?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The author states that "validity and reproducibility require further verification" because the study relied entirely on automated scoring.
  - Why unresolved: All scores were generated by a single LLM without human baselines or inter-rater reliability checks, introducing potential evaluation bias.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study where human experts in psychology and cognitive science score the model outputs to establish a correlation coefficient.

- **Open Question 2**: How does the introduction of auxiliary prompting strategies (Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought) impact model performance on these specific philosophical tasks?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The author notes it is "necessary to verify separately how the models behave when auxiliary prompt designs... are used."
  - Why unresolved: The study was restricted to zero-shot conditions to test "basic ability," leaving the potential improvements from context or reasoning steps untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Re-evaluating the models using Few-shot and Chain-of-Thought prompts to measure changes in scores and stability.

- **Open Question 3**: Are the observed performance differences between Frame and Symbol Grounding tasks statistically significant across a larger sample size?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The author acknowledges that formal hypothesis tests were omitted due to small sample sizes (n=5) and normality violations.
  - Why unresolved: The current study relied solely on descriptive statistics, preventing robust conclusions about the statistical significance of the results.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A large-scale replication with sufficient trials (e.g., n > 30) to support non-parametric statistical testing.

## Limitations

- Reliance on single LLM scorer introduces potential evaluation bias; human expert validation needed
- Zero-shot design may underestimate model capabilities under alternative prompting strategies
- Small model failures may reflect prompt comprehension issues rather than fundamental capability limits
- English-only prompts limit cross-linguistic generalization claims

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The finding that closed models (ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.0 Flash) consistently outperform open-source models across both tasks. This is supported by clear score differentials (mean 41-56 vs 0-50) and the paper's direct observation that "Closed models demonstrated consistent performance across all tasks."

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that instruction tuning and model size improve performance. While the dramatic improvement from Llama 3B base to Instruct (scores 5.4→27.8 frame, 10.4→50.2 symbol grounding) supports this, the mechanism remains partially speculative without controlled ablation studies.

**Low Confidence**: The conclusion that 8-bit quantization preserves response determinism while modestly reducing quality. This finding is based on Phi-3's identical outputs across trials with reduced scores, but the mechanism (evaluator sensitivity to minor stylistic changes) is not conclusively established.

## Next Checks

1. **Human rater validation**: Replicate the evaluation with 3-5 human experts scoring the same outputs to establish inter-rater reliability and validate the LLM scorer's consistency. This directly addresses the paper's acknowledged limitation in Section 5.5.

2. **Prompt engineering exploration**: Test the same models with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting variations to determine if performance differences reflect genuine capability gaps versus prompting sensitivity. This would clarify whether zero-shot is the appropriate evaluation baseline.

3. **Cross-linguistic evaluation**: Translate the prompts into 2-3 additional languages and test a subset of models to assess whether the observed performance patterns generalize beyond English training data.
