# Evaluating the Sensitivity of BiLSTM Forecasting Models to Sequence Length and Input Noise

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.06926
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06926
- **Authors:** Salma Albelali; Moataz Ahmed
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Primary result:** Longer sequences increase overfitting risks, particularly in data-constrained environments, while noise consistently degrades accuracy in BiLSTM time-series forecasting models.

## Executive Summary
This study systematically investigates how sequence length and input noise affect BiLSTM model robustness in time-series forecasting. The research evaluates the trade-offs between model capacity and generalization across datasets with varying temporal resolutions. The authors demonstrate that extended sequences can lead to overfitting in data-limited scenarios, while noise consistently impairs predictive accuracy. The combined effect of both factors produces the most severe performance degradation. These findings highlight the importance of data-aware design strategies and systematic testing to ensure reliable deep learning forecasting models in critical applications.

## Method Summary
The study employs a stacked Bidirectional LSTM architecture with three layers (128, 64, 32 units) and 0.2 dropout between layers. Models are trained using AdamW optimizer (lr=0.001) with early stopping (patience=10 epochs). Three univariate temperature datasets are used: daily climate data, weather history, and air quality measurements. A sliding window approach generates input sequences with baseline length 10 and extended length 30 (or 40 per results text). Gaussian noise (std=0.05) is added to the target variable during training. Performance is evaluated using RMSE and R² scores with 70/15/15 train/validation/test splits.

## Key Results
- Longer sequences increase overfitting risks, particularly in data-constrained environments
- Noise consistently degrades accuracy across all tested conditions
- Higher observation frequencies demonstrate greater resilience, though still vulnerable under adverse conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- **Sliding window sequence generation**: Creates fixed-length input-output pairs from time-series data; needed for converting temporal data into supervised learning format
- **Bidirectional LSTM architecture**: Processes sequences in both forward and backward directions; provides richer temporal context for forecasting
- **Early stopping with patience**: Prevents overfitting by halting training when validation performance plateaus; needed to balance model capacity and generalization
- **Min-Max scaling**: Normalizes features to [0,1] range; essential for stable LSTM training and consistent performance across datasets
- **Ljung-Box test**: Checks for autocorrelation in residuals; validates model adequacy in capturing temporal dependencies
- **Augmented Dickey-Fuller test**: Tests stationarity of time-series; ensures data properties are appropriate for LSTM modeling

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Data Preprocessing -> Sliding Window Generation -> BiLSTM Model -> Training with Noise Injection -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**
Data preparation (scaling + windowing) → Model architecture (BiLSTM layers + dropout) → Training protocol (AdamW + early stopping) → Evaluation (RMSE + R²)

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Sequence length: Longer sequences capture more temporal context but increase overfitting risk in small datasets
- Noise injection: Adding noise to targets improves robustness but degrades baseline accuracy
- Model depth: Deeper networks provide better representation but require more data to avoid overfitting

**Failure Signatures**
- Training loss << validation loss indicates overfitting, especially with extended sequences
- Low R² scores across all conditions suggest fundamental model-data mismatch
- Inconsistent results between datasets reveal sensitivity to temporal resolution

**First Experiments**
1. Train baseline model (seq=10, clean) to establish performance reference
2. Add Gaussian noise (σ=0.05) to targets and retrain to measure noise sensitivity
3. Increase sequence length to 30 and retrain to assess overfitting risk

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can adaptive sequence configuration algorithms be developed to dynamically optimize forecasting accuracy across heterogeneous temporal resolutions?
- Do the observed sensitivities to sequence length and noise persist in multivariate or irregularly sampled time-series modalities?
- How do different preprocessing methods (e.g., detrending, normalization) interact with model behavior under conditions of noise and data imbalance?

## Limitations
- Discrepancy between sequence lengths (30 in methodology vs 40 in results) creates uncertainty about experimental conditions
- Absence of batch size specification and maximum epoch limits prevents accurate replication of training dynamics
- Focus on univariate temperature forecasting limits generalizability to multivariate or non-weather domains

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Longer sequences increase overfitting risk in data-constrained environments
- **Medium confidence:** Noise consistently degrades accuracy across all tested conditions
- **Low confidence:** Higher observation frequencies demonstrate greater resilience

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce experiments with both sequence lengths (30 and 40) to determine which configuration matches reported results
2. Test model with Gaussian noise applied to input features instead of target variable
3. Validate findings on additional time-series domains (e.g., financial or sensor data) to test generalizability beyond temperature forecasting
