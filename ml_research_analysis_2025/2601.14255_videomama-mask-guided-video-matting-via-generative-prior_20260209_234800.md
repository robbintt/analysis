# VideoMaMa: Mask-Guided Video Matting via Generative Prior

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14255
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14255
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces VideoMaMa, a diffusion-based model for video matting using segmentation masks as guidance, and creates MA-V, a large-scale pseudo video matting dataset

## Executive Summary
VideoMaMa addresses the challenge of video matting in real-world scenarios where high-quality training data is scarce. The approach leverages pretrained video diffusion models to generate continuous alpha mattes from binary segmentation masks, enabling scalable annotation of real-world videos. By creating the MA-V dataset through this generative prior method, the authors demonstrate how segmentation cues can drive progress in video matting research. The model shows strong zero-shot generalization to real-world footage and improves downstream segmentation models when fine-tuned on MA-V.

## Method Summary
VideoMaMa employs a diffusion-based architecture that converts binary segmentation masks into continuous alpha mattes by conditioning on pretrained video diffusion models. The key innovation lies in using generative priors to bridge the domain gap between synthetic and real-world videos. To overcome data scarcity, the authors generate the MA-V dataset by applying VideoMaMa to segmentation masks from the SA-V dataset, resulting in over 50K annotated real-world videos. The method is validated by fine-tuning SAM2 on MA-V, which outperforms SAM2 trained on existing matting datasets on in-the-wild videos.

## Key Results
- VideoMaMa demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to real-world footage
- MA-V dataset improves SAM2 performance on in-the-wild videos compared to existing matting datasets
- The generative prior approach enables scalable creation of high-quality matting annotations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging pretrained video diffusion models as generative priors to convert binary segmentation masks into continuous alpha mattes. This approach bridges the domain gap between synthetic and real-world videos by utilizing the rich visual understanding encoded in diffusion models. The segmentation masks provide structured guidance, allowing the model to focus on refining alpha values rather than learning from scratch. By creating MA-V through this process, the authors generate a large-scale dataset that captures real-world visual complexity while maintaining annotation quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Video Diffusion Models**: Pretrained models that generate video frames; needed to provide rich visual priors for matting; quick check: verify the model can generate plausible video sequences
- **Alpha Matting**: Process of extracting transparent foreground from background; needed as the target output for video segmentation; quick check: ensure alpha values are continuous and properly blend foreground with background
- **Segmentation Masks**: Binary representations of object boundaries; needed as structured guidance for the matting process; quick check: confirm masks accurately delineate objects of interest

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Segmentation Mask -> Video Diffusion Model -> Alpha Matte Generation -> MA-V Dataset

Critical Path: The critical path involves conditioning the video diffusion model on segmentation masks to generate alpha mattes, which are then used to create the MA-V dataset for downstream model training.

Design Tradeoffs: The approach trades computational complexity for annotation quality by leveraging powerful pretrained models. While this enables high-quality results, it may limit adaptability to videos with highly dynamic content or non-standard visual characteristics.

Failure Signatures: Potential failures include propagation of errors from initial segmentation masks into the matting process, and limitations in handling videos with extreme variability or non-standard visual characteristics due to reliance on pretrained diffusion models.
