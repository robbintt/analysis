core_contribution: ReTrack addresses the challenge of data unlearning in diffusion
  models, where the goal is to remove the influence of specific training data without

# ReTrack: Data Unlearning in Diffusion Models through Redirecting the Denoising Trajectory

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.13007
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13007
- **Reference count**: 11
- **Primary result**: Achieves 0% frequency of T-shirt images in generated samples on MNIST T-Shirt while maintaining high FID (2.09) and IS (9.48) scores

## Executive Summary
ReTrack introduces an efficient method for data unlearning in diffusion models by redirecting denoising trajectories. The approach uses an importance sampling-based fine-tuning loss that focuses on the data to be forgotten, approximated by retaining only k-nearest neighbor terms. This creates an interpretable objective that accelerates unlearning while preserving generative quality. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets including MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion.

## Method Summary
The core innovation of ReTrack lies in its unlearning loss formulation. Instead of computing expensive importance sampling over all data points, ReTrack approximates the loss by considering only the k-nearest neighbors in the remaining data distribution. This redirection of denoising trajectories effectively removes the influence of target data while maintaining the model's ability to generate high-quality samples. The method operates through fine-tuning rather than full retraining, making it computationally efficient. The k-NN approximation provides both computational advantages and interpretability in understanding how the unlearning process affects the model's behavior.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0% frequency of T-shirt images in generated samples on MNIST T-Shirt dataset
- Maintains high FID score of 2.09 and IS score of 9.48 on MNIST T-Shirt after unlearning
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets including CelebA-HQ and CIFAR-10
- Shows effective balance between unlearning strength and generation quality preservation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ReTrack works by fundamentally altering the denoising trajectory of the diffusion model during inference. By fine-tuning with a loss that emphasizes the importance of the data to be forgotten through a k-nearest neighbor approximation, the model's internal representations shift away from generating content similar to the target data. The k-NN approximation serves as a computationally efficient proxy for the full importance sampling distribution, focusing the model's attention on the most relevant competing patterns in the remaining data. This redirection effectively "erases" the influence of the forgotten data while preserving the model's overall generative capabilities through the retention of other learned patterns.

## Foundational Learning

**Diffusion Models**: Generative models that learn to denoise data through a Markov chain process. Understanding this is crucial because ReTrack operates by modifying the denoising trajectory.

**Importance Sampling**: A technique for estimating properties of a distribution by sampling from a different distribution. Needed to understand how ReTrack approximates the unlearning loss efficiently.

**k-Nearest Neighbors**: A non-parametric method for classification or regression that uses the k closest training examples. Critical for understanding the computational approximation used in ReTrack.

**Fine-tuning vs. Retraining**: Fine-tuning adjusts a pre-trained model on new data, while retraining starts from scratch. This distinction is key to understanding ReTrack's computational efficiency claims.

**Denoising Trajectory**: The path a diffusion model takes from noise to a generated sample. Understanding this concept is essential for grasping how ReTrack redirects generation to achieve unlearning.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data → k-NN Approximation Module → Unlearning Loss → Diffusion Model Fine-tuning → Redirected Denoising Trajectory

**Critical Path**: The key computational flow is: (1) Identify data to forget, (2) Compute k-NN approximation of remaining data distribution, (3) Calculate unlearning loss, (4) Fine-tune diffusion model, (5) Generate samples with redirected trajectories.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The primary tradeoff is between unlearning strength and generation quality. Using k-NN approximation reduces computational cost but may miss some long-range dependencies in the data distribution. The choice of k represents a balance between approximation accuracy and efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor unlearning performance when k is too small (insufficient coverage of data distribution) or too large (computational inefficiency and loss of focus). Generation quality degradation when the unlearning loss overly disrupts the model's learned representations.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Verify the k-NN approximation accuracy by comparing against full importance sampling on a small dataset
2. Test unlearning effectiveness with varying k values on MNIST T-Shirt to find optimal k
3. Measure computational speedup of ReTrack compared to exact importance sampling baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The k-NN approximation may not capture the full complexity of the data distribution, potentially limiting unlearning effectiveness
- Computational efficiency gains are not quantified in detail, making it difficult to assess practical advantages
- Performance claims are based on specific datasets and may not generalize across all types of data or diffusion model architectures

## Confidence

| Claim Cluster | Confidence Level |
|---------------|------------------|
| Redirecting denoising trajectories for unlearning | High |
| k-NN approximation effectiveness | Medium |
| Best trade-off between unlearning and quality | Low |

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Apply ReTrack to additional datasets beyond MNIST, CelebA-HQ, and CIFAR-10, including more complex and diverse data distributions, to assess the method's robustness and generalizability.

2. **Ablation study on k-nearest neighbors**: Conduct experiments varying the number of retained neighbors (k) to determine its impact on unlearning effectiveness and generation quality, establishing guidelines for optimal k selection.

3. **Comparative analysis with expanded baselines**: Compare ReTrack against a broader range of data unlearning methods in diffusion models, including both fine-tuning and more computationally intensive approaches, to fully characterize its position in the state-of-the-art landscape.
