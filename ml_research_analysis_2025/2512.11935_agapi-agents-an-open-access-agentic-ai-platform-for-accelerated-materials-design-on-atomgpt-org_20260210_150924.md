- Open-access agentic AI platform integrating LLMs with 20+ materials science APIs for autonomous design workflows

## Executive Summary
AGAPI-Agents is an open-access agentic AI platform that integrates open-source large language models with over 20 materials-science APIs to enable autonomous, reproducible materials design workflows. The system employs an Agent-Planner-Executor-Summarizer architecture to orchestrate multi-step tasks including database queries, property predictions, structure optimization, and characterization. Benchmarking demonstrates GPT-OSS-20B achieves 3.93× speedup in token generation compared to Llama-3.2-90B-Vision, while serving over 1,000 users. Comprehensive case studies showcase end-to-end workflows requiring up to 10 sequential operations, from semiconductor defect analysis to heterostructure interface design.

## Method Summary
The platform uses an Agent-Planner-Executor-Summarizer architecture where an LLM reasons about natural language queries, selects appropriate API tools, and orchestrates multi-step workflows. Models are served via Ollama/vLLM with tensor parallelism, using ReAct prompt patterns with constrained JSON generation for tool selection. The system includes JWT authentication, token-bucket rate limiting, and deterministic sampling (temperature=0). Version pinning ensures reproducibility. The platform integrates 20+ REST endpoints including JARVIS-DFT database queries, ALIGNN property predictions, structure manipulation tools, and characterization methods.

## Key Results
- GPT-OSS-20B achieves 3.93× speedup in token generation compared to Llama-3.2-90B-Vision
- Tool-augmented predictions improve bulk modulus accuracy by 27% (MAE reduction from 7.876 to 5.732 GPa)
- Platform serves over 1,000 users with demonstrated 10-step autonomous workflows for defect analysis and interface design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Tool-augmented retrieval reduces hallucination by grounding LLM outputs in verified database entries and physics-based models.
- **Mechanism:** The LLM acts as a reasoning engine that translates natural language queries into structured API calls. Results from databases (JARVIS-DFT, Materials Project) and computational tools (ALIGNN, SlaKoNet) replace parametric knowledge, constraining outputs to physically realizable values.
- **Core assumption:** API-accessible databases contain accurate, standardized property values; the LLM can reliably map queries to correct tool selections.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "unifying databases, simulation tools, and machine-learning models through a common orchestration framework"; [section 2.4] "the agent grounds responses in actual API calls rather than generating values from parametric knowledge"; [corpus] Related work "Towards Agentic Intelligence for Materials Science" (FMR=0.55) discusses similar orchestration principles but lacks the specific tool-augmentation evaluation AGAPI provides.
- **Break condition:** If database entries contain systematic errors (e.g., DFT-underestimated bandgaps), grounding propagates those errors rather than eliminating them.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The Agent-Planner-Executor-Summarizer architecture enables autonomous multi-step workflows by decomposing complex queries into sequential tool calls with dependency resolution.
- **Mechanism:** The Planner analyzes queries to identify required tools and execution order. The Executor dispatches API calls asynchronously, passing outputs from completed operations as inputs to dependent ones. The Summarizer aggregates results into human-readable outputs.
- **Core assumption:** LLMs can reliably decompose scientific tasks and maintain state across multi-step operations; error propagation remains manageable for workflows up to ~10 steps.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "autonomously constructs and executes multi-step workflows...requiring up to ten sequential operations"; [section 2.5] Case Study 1 demonstrates a 10-step defect analysis pipeline executed "without manual intervention"; [corpus] "Agentic Mixture-of-Workflows" paper addresses similar multi-modal orchestration but for chemical search; AGAPI's contribution is domain-specific tool integration.
- **Break condition:** Very long workflows (15+ operations) "sometimes fail due to error propagation or timeout issues" [Discussion].

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Tool augmentation effectiveness is property-dependent, improving predictions when high-quality standardized data exists but degrading performance for properties with sparse or inconsistent database coverage.
- **Mechanism:** For well-documented properties (bulk modulus), database retrieval complements LLM knowledge. For properties with heterogeneous computational protocols (band gap, Tc), retrieved values may conflict with trained knowledge or introduce noise.
- **Core assumption:** Adaptive tool-selection mechanisms could assess database reliability before retrieval.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "tool-augmented predictions improve bulk modulus accuracy by 27%...but degrade other properties including band gap (40% MAE increase)"; [section 2.6] Parity plots (Figure 9) show property-dependent R² values: bulk modulus 0.994 with tools vs. 0.984 without; Tc drops from 0.979 to 0.732; [corpus] No direct corpus evidence addresses this finding; this is a novel contribution requiring further validation.
- **Break condition:** For novel materials not in training corpora or databases (defects, disorder, superlattices), physics-based models become essential [section 2.6].

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Graph Neural Networks for Property Prediction (ALIGNN)**
  - **Why needed here:** ALIGNN predicts formation energy, bandgaps, elastic constants from crystal structures without DFT calculations. Understanding its input (POSCAR/crystal structure) and output format is essential for interpreting agent results.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a crystal structure with 8 atoms, can you explain why ALIGNN predictions complete in <1 second while DFT would take hours?

- **Concept: Machine Learning Force Fields (ALIGNN-FF)**
  - **Why needed here:** Structure optimization via ALIGNN-FF provides near-DFT accuracy at fraction of computational cost. The agent uses this for geometry relaxation before property prediction.
  - **Quick check question:** What physical quantities (energies, forces, stresses) does ALIGNN-FF compute, and how does convergence detection work?

- **Concept: REST API Authentication and Rate Limiting**
  - **Why needed here:** AGAPI uses JWT tokens for authentication and token-bucket rate limiting. Understanding these constraints prevents workflow failures during batch operations.
  - **Quick check question:** If you submit 100 sequential ALIGNN predictions, how would you structure requests to avoid rate-limit errors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User Query → LLM Reasoning Engine (GPT-OSS-20B default) → Tool Selection Layer (constrained JSON generation) → API Gateway (20+ REST endpoints) → Workflow Orchestrator (dependency resolution, async execution) → Response Synthesizer (formatting, validation)

- **Critical path:** Start with single-tool queries (database search, property lookup) before attempting multi-step workflows. The 10-step defect analysis example (ag32 in supplementary) represents advanced usage.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - GPT-OSS-20B offers 3.93× speedup over Llama-3.2-90B-Vision but may have lower reasoning capability for ambiguous queries
  - Open-source models ensure reproducibility via version pinning but require self-hosting infrastructure
  - Temperature=0 ensures determinism but reduces exploration of solution paths

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Tool calls returning "Invalid JSON" → LLM hallucinated non-existent tool; check tool registry
  - Timeout on 15+ step workflows → Error propagation; break into smaller sub-workflows
  - Contradictory property values → Different functionals (MBJ vs. OptB88vdW); MBJ preferred for bandgaps

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Single-tool validation:** Query "Find all Al₂O₃ materials" and verify tool-enabled vs. tool-disabled outputs differ (hallucination check)
  2. **Property prediction chain:** Retrieve JARVIS-ID → ALIGNN prediction → compare against database values
  3. **Simple multi-step workflow:** Database search → POSCAR retrieval → XRD generation (4 steps) before attempting 10-step workflows

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What adaptive mechanisms can dynamically determine whether tool augmentation will improve or degrade prediction accuracy for a specific property-query combination?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state "Future agentic AI systems should implement adaptive tool-selection mechanisms that dynamically assess database reliability and relevance before retrieval" after observing tool access improves bulk modulus predictions by 27% but degrades band gap by 40% and superconducting Tc by 5-fold.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates the problem empirically but proposes and evaluates no adaptive selection strategy.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A benchmark showing an adaptive mechanism predicts when tool augmentation helps vs. hurts with >80% accuracy across multiple property types, tested on held-out materials.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does error compound in multi-step agentic workflows exceeding 10 sequential operations?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state "Very long workflows (15+ operations) sometimes fail due to error propagation or timeout issues" without quantitative characterization.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper shows 10-step workflows succeed but provides no analysis of failure patterns or mitigation for longer pipelines.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Quantitative analysis of success rates vs. workflow length, error taxonomy, and recovery strategies achieving >90% success on 15+ step workflows.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What minimum database coverage and protocol standardization thresholds predict when tool-augmented predictions will outperform base LLM knowledge?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify that tool effectiveness depends on "database quality and coverage," "standardization of computational protocols," and whether materials are "well-documented in existing literature."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper shows bulk modulus benefits while other properties degrade but does not quantify thresholds that predict success.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Correlation analysis between database metrics (coverage, methodological consistency) and augmentation performance, yielding validated property-specific thresholds.

## Limitations
- Property-dependent tool augmentation effectiveness shows inconsistent improvements across different material properties
- Multi-step workflow reliability degrades significantly for workflows exceeding 10-15 sequential operations
- Current system lacks adaptive mechanisms to determine when tool augmentation will help versus hurt prediction accuracy

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** The Agent-Planner-Executor-Summarizer architecture successfully orchestrates 20+ API endpoints as demonstrated by the 1,000+ concurrent users and 3.93× token generation speedup with GPT-OSS-20B.

**Medium Confidence:** Property prediction improvements for bulk modulus (27% MAE reduction) are statistically significant and reproducible, but degradation in band gap and superconducting Tc predictions requires further investigation.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of multi-step workflows beyond the 10-operation case studies remains uncertain due to acknowledged failure modes for longer workflows.

## Next Checks
1. **Property-specific tool reliability assessment:** Systematically evaluate tool augmentation across 20+ properties to identify which benefit from database retrieval versus which require LLM-only predictions, establishing criteria for adaptive tool selection.

2. **Workflow decomposition testing:** Validate the 15+ operation failure threshold by designing progressively longer workflows and identifying specific error propagation points, then implement checkpoint/restart mechanisms.

3. **Database protocol standardization analysis:** Compare computational protocols (functionals, k-point densities, convergence criteria) across JARVIS-DFT, Materials Project, and OQMD to quantify systematic biases affecting property predictions.
