# Online Incident Response Planning under Model Misspecification through Bayesian Learning and Belief Quantization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.14385
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14385
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: MOBAL achieves costs of 35.91±9.01 compared to 92.71±27.67 for the best alternative when the model is misspecified.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses automated incident response in cybersecurity where the system model is uncertain. The proposed MOBAL method combines Bayesian learning to iteratively refine a conjecture about the system model with belief space quantization to enable tractable planning. The approach handles model misspecification by maintaining a distribution over possible models rather than assuming a single correct model, and provably bounds the resulting sub-optimality. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark show MOBAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods when the true system dynamics differ from the assumed model.

## Method Summary
MOBAL formulates incident response as a POMDP where the true system dynamics are unknown. It maintains a posterior distribution over a finite set of parameter vectors representing possible models, updates this distribution via Bayesian learning using observed alerts, and discretizes the continuous belief space into a finite grid. The quantized belief space enables efficient dynamic programming to compute response policies. The method iterates between belief estimation (particle filter), Bayesian conjecture refinement, belief space quantization, and planning (value iteration), producing actions that balance immediate response costs against long-term security objectives.

## Key Results
- MOBAL achieves costs of 35.91±9.01 under model misspecification versus 92.71±27.67 for the best alternative
- The method provides theoretical guarantees with sub-optimality bounded by approximation error (quantization) plus misspecification error
- Online planning time is approximately 8.5 minutes per step, with computation dominated by value iteration and quantization resolution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Bayesian Conjecture Refinement
- Claim: The system improves its response strategy by iteratively shifting probability mass toward the "least wrong" model within its hypothesis space, even if the true model is excluded.
- Mechanism: MOBAL maintains a posterior distribution $\rho_t$ over a set of parameter vectors $\Theta$. Upon receiving observation $o_t$, it applies Bayes' rule (Eq. 6) to update $\rho_t$. Proposition 1 guarantees that asymptotically, $\rho_t$ concentrates on the set $\Theta^*$ that minimizes the discrepancy $K(\theta, \nu_t)$ between the conjectured and true observation distributions.
- Core assumption: The hypothesis space $\Theta$ is compact and contains at least one model capable of approximating the system dynamics sufficiently (Assumption 1). The mapping from parameters to observations is Lipschitz continuous (Assumption 2).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture about the model through Bayesian learning... which facilitates model adaptation."
  - [section] Proposition 1 (Consistent conjectures) guarantees convergence to minima of the discrepancy function.
  - [corpus] Corpus signals are weak for this specific misspecification approach; "Robust Bayesian Inference..." addresses measurement error but differs in application.
- Break condition: If the set $\Theta$ contains no models that correlate with the true dynamics (discrepancy $K$ is flat or high for all $\theta$), the posterior will not converge to a useful policy.

### Mechanism 2: Belief Space Quantization
- Claim: Discretizing the continuous belief space into a finite grid allows for computationally tractable planning via dynamic programming while maintaining bounded approximation error.
- Mechanism: The continuous belief space $B$ is mapped to a finite set of representative beliefs $\tilde{B}$ using a resolution parameter $r$ (Eq. 12). This converts the intractable continuous POMDP into a finite MDP. Proposition 3 bounds the resulting cost error by $\frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma}$, where $\epsilon$ depends on the grid resolution.
- Core assumption: The optimal cost function $J^*$ is uniformly continuous (required for Prop 4 proof), meaning nearby beliefs have similar optimal costs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We quantize the conjectured model into a finite Markov model... enabling efficient response planning via dynamic programming."
  - [section] Section 4.3 defines the mapping $\Phi$ and derives the approximation error bound in Prop 3.
  - [corpus] "Lazy Heuristic Search for Solving POMDPs" similarly addresses tractability but uses heuristic search rather than fixed quantization.
- Break condition: If the quantization resolution $r$ is too low relative to the curvature of the value function, distinct critical states may be mapped to the same representative belief, causing inappropriate actions.

### Mechanism 3: Sub-optimality Decomposition
- Claim: The total performance loss is strictly bounded by the sum of the quantization error (approximation) and the model error (misspecification).
- Mechanism: Theorem 1 establishes the bound $\|\tilde{J} - J^*\|_\infty \leq \frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma} + \frac{\gamma \alpha c_{max}}{(1-\gamma)^2}$. This separates the error induced by the grid resolution ($\epsilon$) from the error induced by the model likelihood difference ($\alpha$).
- Core assumption: The transition probabilities of the true model $p_{\theta^*}$ and conjectured model $p_\theta$ differ by at most $\alpha$ in total variation distance (Prop 2 condition).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...sub-optimality bound that decomposes into approximation and misspecification components."
  - [section] Theorem 1 in Section 4.3 explicitly derives and proves this decomposition.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus matches for this specific theoretical decomposition.
- Break condition: If the model misspecification is severe (large $\alpha$) or the discount factor $\gamma$ approaches 1, the error bound grows quadratically, potentially rendering the theoretical guarantee vacuous.

## Foundational Learning
- **Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)**
  - Why needed here: The paper formulates incident response as a POMDP where the security state is hidden. You must understand the difference between the physical state $s_t$ and the belief state $b_t$ to follow the algorithm.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a probability distribution over states (belief) is necessary when the true state is unknown, versus just guessing the most likely state?

- **Bayesian Inference**
  - Why needed here: The core of MOBAL is the Bayesian update (Eq. 6). Understanding how prior beliefs shift to posteriors based on likelihoods is essential to grasp how the system adapts.
  - Quick check question: If an observation $o_t$ is very unlikely under the current model parameters $\theta$, how does Bayes' rule affect the posterior probability of that $\theta$?

- **Dynamic Programming (Value Iteration)**
  - Why needed here: Once the belief space is quantized, the system solves for the optimal policy using DP. Understanding the Bellman equation (Eq. 3) is required to understand how actions are selected.
  - Quick check question: How does the discount factor $\gamma$ influence the "far-sightedness" of the policy derived from the Bellman equation?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Particle Filter -> Bayesian Updater -> Model Sampler -> Quantizer -> Solver -> Action
- **Critical path:** The latency loop is $o_t \rightarrow$ Particle Filter $\rightarrow$ Bayesian Update $\rightarrow$ Quantization $\rightarrow$ Value Iteration $\rightarrow a_t$. The paper notes an online compute time of ~8.5 mins, heavily influenced by the solver and quantization resolution.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Resolution ($r$) vs. Speed:** Increasing $r$ reduces approximation error $\epsilon$ but exponentially increases the size of the state space $\tilde{B}$ (Fig. 9).
  - **Hypothesis Space ($\Theta$) vs. Convergence:** A diverse $\Theta$ increases robustness to misspecification but may slow down the convergence of $\rho_t$ to a consistent conjecture.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Stuck Prior:** If $\rho_t$ remains flat, the likelihood function may be uninformative (observations do not distinguish between models).
  - **Cost Divergence:** If the cost exceeds the theoretical bound, check if the $\alpha$ assumption (Prop 2) is violated (the model is drastically wrong).
  - **Particle Degeneracy:** In high-dimensional state spaces, the particle filter may collapse, necessitating an increase in particle count $M$.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Sanity Check:** Run MOBAL on the CAGE-2 benchmark with "no misspecification" ($\theta^* \in \Theta$) to ensure the approximation error (quantization) is tolerable compared to standard solvers.
  2. **Misspecification Stress Test:** Run MOBAL vs. baselines (PPO, CARDIFF) where the simulation parameters are fixed to 0.5 but the true environment varies (the "misspecification" scenario in Table 1).
  3. **Resolution Sweep:** Plot the computed cost and computation time against varying quantization resolution $r$ to find the "knee of the curve" where approximation error stabilizes but compute time is acceptable.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can offline computations be effectively integrated with MOBAL to reduce the online planning time (currently ~8.5 minutes per step) for time-critical incident response scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Conclusion: "Future research should therefore investigate ways to reduce the planning time. To this end, a promising approach is to combine mobal with offline computations."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation is computationally intensive, making it unsuitable for rapid response requirements, and the authors have not yet implemented or tested the suggested offline-online hybrid approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified version of MOBAL that pre-computes strategies or value functions offline, demonstrating significantly reduced online decision latency without violating the established error bounds.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does MOBAL generalize effectively to operational technology (OT) or cloud-based environments where observation spaces and state dynamics differ significantly from the CAGE-2 IT benchmark?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion notes that "testing it in additional environments is an important next step," and Section 8 mentions that the formulation applies to OT and cloud systems but has not been instantiated for them.
- Why unresolved: The experimental validation is restricted to the CAGE-2 benchmark; it remains unproven whether the belief quantization and particle filtering parameters transfer effectively to diverse infrastructures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful deployment of MOBAL in distinct environments (e.g., cloud simulations or OT testbeds) showing robust performance without requiring extensive manual re-tuning of the quantization resolution or particle count.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the cardinality and specification of the conjecture set $\Theta$ impact the convergence rate and the tightness of the misspecification error bound?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the authors prove consistency and derive bounds assuming a set $\Theta$, the experimental setup simplifies $\Theta$ to three discrete values. The trade-off between a dense conjecture set (high computational cost) and a sparse set (risk of high misspecification error $\alpha$) is not quantified.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis assumes general conditions, but practical implementation requires choosing a finite $\Theta$. The sensitivity of the method to this choice is not empirically analyzed.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study measuring the convergence speed and resulting cost as the size and distribution of the conjecture set $\Theta$ are systematically varied against the true model.

## Limitations
- The theoretical guarantees depend on strict assumptions about compactness and Lipschitz continuity that may not hold in practice
- The method requires significant computation time (8.5 minutes per planning step), limiting real-time applicability
- Results are validated only on the CAGE-2 benchmark with specific misspecification scenarios

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The mechanism of Bayesian conjecture refinement and the quantization approach for tractability are well-established techniques. The theoretical framework follows standard POMDP methodology.
- **Medium Confidence**: The decomposition of sub-optimality into approximation and misspecification components is novel, but its practical significance depends on the relative magnitudes of these terms in real-world scenarios.
- **Low Confidence**: The experimental comparison against PPO and CARDIFF is limited by the specific CAGE-2 setup. The claim of "outperforming state-of-the-art" needs validation across diverse benchmarks.

## Next Checks
1. **Stress Test with Severe Misspecification**: Evaluate MOBAL when the true model parameters are far outside the hypothesis space (e.g., attack probabilities of 0.2 or 0.8 when only 0, 0.5, and 1 are conjectured). Measure whether the cost bound still holds and identify the breaking point.
2. **Scalability Assessment**: Test MOBAL on larger network topologies (e.g., CAGE-3 or custom networks with 100+ nodes) to quantify the computational scaling with state space size and verify if the quantization resolution can be adjusted to maintain tractability.
3. **Alternative Prior Sensitivity**: Run experiments with different initial prior distributions $\rho_0$ (e.g., informative priors favoring certain attack strategies) to assess how the learning speed and final performance depend on the initial conjecture about the system model.
