# Safe and Compliant Cross-Market Trade Execution via Constrained RL and Zero-Knowledge Audits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04952
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04952
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Zero-violation, competitive execution via RL + compliance shield + zkCA audit

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of executing large trades across multiple markets while adhering to regulatory constraints and avoiding information leakage. It proposes a modular architecture combining constrained reinforcement learning with zero-knowledge compliance audits. The approach uses a PPO-based RL agent trained under a constrained MDP formulation, a runtime shield that projects unsafe actions to feasible sets, and a zero-knowledge compliance audit (zkCA) layer that generates cryptographic proofs of rule adherence without revealing proprietary strategies. Experiments in an ABIDES-based simulator demonstrate that the safe RL agent achieves lower implementation shortfall and variance than TWAP/VWAP baselines while maintaining zero constraint violations.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a modular architecture for cross-market trade execution that integrates constrained reinforcement learning with zero-knowledge compliance audits. At its core is a PPO-based RL agent trained under a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) formulation that explicitly handles hard constraints on volume participation, price bands, and self-trading avoidance. A runtime shield component monitors and projects unsafe actions to feasible sets before execution, while a zero-knowledge Compliance Audit (zkCA) layer generates cryptographic proofs of compliance without revealing proprietary information. The system is evaluated in a multi-venue simulator (ABIDES) with baseline comparisons to TWAP/VWAP strategies, demonstrating competitive execution quality with strict adherence to regulatory constraints.

## Key Results
- Safe RL agent achieves lower implementation shortfall and variance than TWAP/VWAP baselines
- Zero constraint violations achieved while matching unconstrained RL performance
- Stress tests confirm robustness under latency, partial fills, and varying constraints (95% confidence)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by enforcing constraints at multiple levels: during training (CMDP formulation), at execution time (runtime shield), and during post-trade audit (zkCA proofs). The shield prevents constraint violations in real-time by projecting actions to feasible sets, while zkCA provides cryptographic assurance of compliance without exposing proprietary strategies.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Constrained MDP (CMDP) formulation** - needed to handle hard constraints during training; quick check: verify constraint satisfaction in training data
2. **Runtime action shielding** - needed to prevent violations during execution; quick check: measure shield projection frequency and impact
3. **Zero-knowledge proofs for compliance** - needed to audit without information leakage; quick check: verify proof validity without strategy exposure
4. **Multi-venue simulation with ABIDES** - needed to test cross-market execution realistically; quick check: validate simulator against historical market data
5. **PPO algorithm with constraint handling** - needed for stable RL training under constraints; quick check: compare reward convergence with/without constraints

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Market Data -> RL Agent -> Shield -> Exchange -> zkCA -> Auditor

**Critical Path:** Market data feeds into RL agent, whose actions are screened by shield before exchange submission, with zkCA generating compliance proofs for audit trail

**Design Tradeoffs:** The shield adds latency but prevents violations; zkCA adds computational overhead but enables private compliance verification

**Failure Signatures:** Shield projection failures indicate overly restrictive constraints; high shield intervention rates suggest poor constraint formulation

**First Experiments:** 1) Run baseline TWAP/VWAP for comparison, 2) Test shield with synthetic constraint violations, 3) Validate zkCA proof generation and verification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- All experiments conducted in simulation using ABIDES, limiting real-world validity
- zkCA implementation details remain abstract with unquantified computational overhead
- Compliance constraints may not cover all regulatory requirements across jurisdictions

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Theoretical foundation of constrained MDP formulation, modular architecture design, and core algorithmic contributions (PPO-based RL with constraint handling, runtime shield implementation)

**Medium Confidence:** Experimental results showing competitive performance against TWAP/VWAP baselines and zero constraint violations are internally consistent within simulator environment

**Low Confidence:** Practical deployment aspects including zkCA performance overhead, real-world compliance audit effectiveness, and shield behavior under extreme market conditions

## Next Checks
1. Test trained RL agent on historical market data from multiple exchanges to assess real-world performance across different market regimes
2. Measure computational and latency overhead of zero-knowledge compliance proofs in realistic trading infrastructure
3. Design adversarial stress tests with market manipulation attempts and extreme volatility to evaluate shield robustness under worst-case conditions
