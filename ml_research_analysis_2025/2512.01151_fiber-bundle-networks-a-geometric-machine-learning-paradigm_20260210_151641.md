# Fiber Bundle Networks: A Geometric Machine Learning Paradigm

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.01151
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01151
- Authors: Dong Liu
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: 83.4% accuracy on UrbanSound8K with 0.4M parameters vs 84.7% with 11.2M ResNet18 parameters

## Executive Summary
FiberNet introduces a geometric machine learning paradigm that reformulates audio classification as optimization on fiber bundles, where categories form the base space and wavelet-transformed features lie in the fibers. The core innovation is a learnable Riemannian metric that automatically identifies important frequency components through diagonal weight learning, combined with variational prototype optimization via energy minimization. This approach achieves competitive accuracy while using far fewer parameters and offering clear interpretability—the learned metric weights directly reveal which frequency bands are most discriminative for each category.

## Method Summary
FiberNet extracts wavelet features from audio, then learns a diagonal Riemannian metric to weight frequency bands by discriminative importance through energy minimization. The energy functional balances three terms: attachment energy pulls prototypes toward training samples, tension energy encourages semantically similar categories to cluster together using word-embedding similarity, and repulsion energy maintains separation between different categories. Prototypes are optimized via alternating gradient descent, and classification is performed via Voronoi tessellation under the learned metric. The framework uses orthogonal wavelet subbands to justify the diagonal metric form and provides interpretable feature importance through the learned weights.

## Key Results
- Achieves 83.4% accuracy on UrbanSound8K (10-class audio classification)
- Uses only 0.4M parameters versus 11.2M for ResNet18 baseline
- Demonstrates clear interpretability: learned metric weights reveal which frequency bands drive classification decisions
- Monotonic energy decrease guaranteed by alternating optimization algorithm

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The diagonal Riemannian metric learns to weight frequency bands by discriminative importance, improving classification under noisy or high-dimensional features.
- Mechanism: The metric $G = \text{diag}(a_1, \dots, a_d)$ with $a_i = \exp(\theta_i)$ parameterizes feature importance. Energy minimization increases weights for dimensions with low intra-class variance (consistent within classes) and decreases weights for noisy or irrelevant dimensions. Orthogonal wavelet subbands justify diagonal form.
- Core assumption: Wavelet subbands are approximately decoupled so cross-band interactions are negligible.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "learnable Riemannian metrics identifying important frequency feature components"; [Section 3.3] "orthogonality between wavelet subbands ensures independence of feature dimensions, and the diagonal metric is sufficient to capture the main geometric structure"
- Break condition: Strong cross-band correlations violate diagonal assumption; a full metric tensor or coupled modeling is needed.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Energy minimization positions prototypes to balance within-class compactness, semantic smoothness, and inter-class separation.
- Mechanism: $E[s] = E_{\text{attachment}} + \lambda_1 E_{\text{tension}} + \lambda_2 E_{\text{repulsion}}$. Attachment pulls prototypes to same-class samples; tension uses word-embedding similarity to pull semantically related prototypes together; repulsion enforces a minimum margin between all prototypes. Alternating optimization on $s$ and $G$ monotonically reduces energy.
- Core assumption: Word-embedding similarity reflects perceptual/functional audio similarity.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "energy functional balances three terms: attachment energy pulls prototypes toward training samples, tension energy encourages semantically similar categories to cluster together, and repulsion energy maintains separation"; [Section 3.5] "neighbors of 'chair creaking' are 'door creak' (weight 0.5), 'wood creak' (weight 0.3), 'floor creak' (weight 0.2)"
- Break condition: Misaligned semantic adjacency (e.g., synonyms with different acoustic profiles) causes inappropriate prototype clustering.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Voronoi tessellation under the learned metric provides interpretable decision regions and direct feature-importance readout.
- Mechanism: Prototypes partition the feature space into Voronoi cells under $d_G$. Test samples are assigned to the nearest prototype's class. The learned weights $a_i$ explicitly reveal which frequency bands drive classification.
- Core assumption: Class boundaries are approximable by Voronoi cells under a diagonal Riemannian metric.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Classification is performed via Voronoi tessellation under the learned Riemannian metric"; [Section 4.3] "This corresponds to Voronoi partitioning of the feature space under Riemannian metric $G^*$"
- Break condition: Multimodal or highly non-convex class distributions require multiple prototypes per class or more complex partitioning.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Riemannian metric and Mahalanobis distance
  - Why needed here: FiberNet replaces Euclidean distance with $d_G(v_1, v_2) = \sqrt{\sum_i a_i (v_{1,i} - v_{2,i})^2}$.
  - Quick check question: Calculate distance between $[1, 2]$ and $[4, 6]$ under $G = \text{diag}(1, 0.25)$.

- Concept: Variational optimization and energy functionals
  - Why needed here: Learning proceeds by minimizing $E[s, G]$ rather than standard cross-entropy.
  - Quick check question: What smoothness property does minimizing Dirichlet energy encourage in a function?

- Concept: Fiber bundle structure (base space, fiber, projection, section)
  - Why needed here: Categories form the base; features live in fibers; sections select prototypes per category.
  - Quick check question: In $E = B \times F$ with $\pi(b, f) = b$, what is $\pi^{-1}(b)$?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Wavelet feature extractor (DWT) -> Learnable diagonal Riemannian metric $G(\theta)$ -> Section/prototypes $\{s(c)\}_{c \in C}$ -> Energy functional $E[s, G]$ -> Alternating optimizer -> Voronoi classifier

- Critical path:
  1. Extract wavelet features for all training samples
  2. Build semantic adjacency graph from category name embeddings
  3. Initialize $s^{(0)}(c)$ as class means; $\theta^{(0)} = 0$
  4. Iterate: update $s$ by gradient descent on $E$; update $\theta$ by gradient descent on $E$
  5. Converge when $|E^{(t+1)} - E^{(t)}| < \epsilon$
  6. Inference: assign test sample to nearest prototype under $G^*$

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Diagonal vs full metric: interpretability and $O(d)$ vs modeling cross-band correlations
  - Single vs multiple prototypes per class: simplicity vs handling multimodal distributions
  - Fixed word-embedding adjacency vs learned adjacency: external knowledge vs task-specific flexibility

- Failure signatures:
  - Energy plateaus or oscillates: check learning rate, energy scaling
  - Prototype collapse: increase $\lambda_2$ or margin
  - Class accuracy near chance: inspect wavelet features, consider multi-prototype extension
  - All weights near zero or extremely large: check gradient scale, $\theta$ initialization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce UrbanSound8K results: Daubechies-4 wavelet, 5-level DWT, validate ~83% accuracy and param count (~0.4M)
  2. Ablate energy terms: train with $\lambda_1=0$, $\lambda_2=0$, or both to quantify each term's contribution
  3. Visualize learned weights: plot $a_i$ per frequency band for contrasting classes (e.g., "ocean waves" vs "gun shot") to confirm interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the diagonal structure of the Riemannian metric limit performance on data modalities where features lack the orthogonality of wavelet coefficients?
- Basis: [inferred] Section 3.3 states the diagonal form is theoretically justified by wavelet subband orthogonality to reduce parameter count, implying potential limitations with correlated features.
- Why unresolved: The paper validates the method only on wavelet-transformed audio; performance on standard dense vector inputs (e.g., raw pixels or BERT embeddings) remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments on non-wavelet benchmarks (e.g., standard image or text classification) evaluating diagonal vs. full metric tensors.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the computational complexity of the repulsion energy scale with the number of categories in large-scale classification settings?
- Basis: [inferred] The repulsion energy (Eq. 18) is defined as a sum over all pairs $i \neq j$, suggesting quadratic computational scaling with class count $N$.
- Why unresolved: Empirical evaluation is restricted to UrbanSound8K (10 classes), leaving efficiency on datasets with thousands of classes unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Complexity analysis and runtime benchmarks on datasets with significantly larger category sets (e.g., ImageNet-1k).

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the optimization robust to semantic mismatches where word embedding similarity does not align with feature-space similarity?
- Basis: [inferred] The tension energy (Eq. 15) enforces prototype proximity based solely on pre-defined word embedding adjacency ($E_{sem}$).
- Why unresolved: The framework assumes semantic neighbors (e.g., "car" and "truck") are also acoustically similar, but provides no mechanism to handle cases where this assumption fails.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies analyzing convergence and accuracy when the semantic adjacency graph is corrupted or derived from mismatched domains.

## Limitations
- Wavelet feature extraction parameters (decomposition depth, retained coefficients) are not specified, creating significant ambiguity in reproducing the reported performance
- Semantic similarity computation details are missing—word embedding model, dimensionality, and neighbor selection criteria affect the tension energy term
- Energy functional hyperparameters (λ₁, λ₂, margin, K) are not provided, making it difficult to replicate the exact optimization dynamics
- Single-prototype-per-class assumption is unstated but appears critical; multimodal class distributions may require multi-prototype extensions

## Confidence

- High confidence: The geometric framework and alternating optimization algorithm's convergence guarantees
- Medium confidence: The interpretability claims—the diagonal metric provides clear frequency band weights, but the relationship to actual decision boundaries requires further validation
- Low confidence: The energy functional design—while the three-term structure is intuitive, the specific balance and semantic embedding approach lack comparative validation against alternatives

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary λ₁, λ₂, margin, and semantic neighbor count K to identify optimal configurations and quantify each term's contribution

2. **Multi-prototype extension**: Implement 2-3 prototypes per class and measure performance gains on known multimodal categories like "dog bark" vs "gun shot"

3. **Cross-domain generalization**: Apply FiberNet to other audio classification datasets (ESC-50, Speech Commands) to test whether learned frequency band weights transfer or require domain-specific tuning
