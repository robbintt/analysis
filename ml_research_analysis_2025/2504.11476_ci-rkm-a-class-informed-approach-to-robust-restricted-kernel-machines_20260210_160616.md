# CI-RKM: A Class-Informed Approach to Robust Restricted Kernel Machines

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.11476
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11476
- Authors: Ritik Mishra; Mushir Akhtar; M. Tanveer
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CI-RKM achieves 85.94% average classification accuracy on 26 benchmark datasets, outperforming standard RKM (84.87%) and other models

## Executive Summary
CI-RKM addresses the vulnerability of standard Restricted Kernel Machines to noisy and outlier-contaminated data by introducing a class-informed weighted function. This function dynamically adjusts the contribution of each training point based on its proximity to class centers and class-specific characteristics. The method leverages weighted conjugate feature duality and the Schur complement theorem to maintain optimization stability while improving robustness. Experimental evaluations on 26 UCI datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements, particularly under label noise conditions, with CI-RKM maintaining accuracy even at 20% noise levels while other models degrade substantially.

## Method Summary
CI-RKM extends the Restricted Kernel Machine framework by incorporating class-informed weights that down-weight samples far from their class centroids. The method computes class centroids and radii in kernel-induced feature space, then assigns weights to each sample using a distance-based function. These weights are integrated into the RKM optimization through weighted conjugate feature duality, resulting in a modified linear system that can be solved efficiently. The approach maintains the mathematical properties of standard RKM while providing enhanced robustness to outliers and noise through the dynamic weighting mechanism.

## Key Results
- Achieves 85.94% average classification accuracy across 26 benchmark datasets
- Outperforms RKM baseline (84.87%) and other models with statistical significance (Friedman test χ²_F and Nemenyi post-hoc test)
- Maintains robustness under high label noise conditions (5%, 10%, 20%) where baseline models degrade significantly
- Ablation studies confirm weight function effectiveness in mitigating outlier influence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Points closer to their class centroid receive higher weight, reducing outlier influence on the decision boundary.
- Mechanism: The class-informed weight function D computes for each sample x_k: D(x_k) = 1 - ||σ(x_k) - K±|| / (r± + ξ), where K± is the class centroid in kernel-induced feature space and r± is the class radius. Points near centroids approach weight ~1; distant outliers approach weight ~0, diminishing their contribution to the loss.
- Core assumption: Class structure in feature space is approximately spherical; centroid-based proximity correlates with sample reliability.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "integrates a class-informed weighted function that dynamically adjusts the contribution of each training point based on its proximity to class centers"; [section III.A, Eq. 5-8]: Full mathematical definition of D, centroids K±, and radii r±.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Weighted conjugate feature duality preserves the RKM optimization structure while incorporating per-sample weights.
- Mechanism: The Fenchel-Young inequality (Eq. 10) bounds e^T h ≤ (1/2λ)e^T D e + (λ/2)h^T D^{-1}h. Substituting LS-SVM constraints into the RKM objective yields a weighted formulation where the linear system (Eq. 16) includes λD^{-1}I_N, directly modulating hidden feature contributions per sample weight.
- Core assumption: The diagonal weight matrix D remains positive-definite throughout training (proven in Theorem III.2).
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "incorporating weighted conjugate feature duality"; [section III.B, Eq. 10-16]: Derivation from inequality through to final linear system.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Schur complement theorem guarantees the quadratic form in weighted duality remains positive semi-definite.
- Mechanism: The block matrix formulation Q = [[(1/λ)D, -I], [-I, λD^{-1}]] satisfies Q ≥ 0 via Schur complement condition (C - B^T A^{-1} B ≥ 0), ensuring the Fenchel-Young inequality holds and the optimization is well-posed.
- Core assumption: D must be positive-definite diagonal (established by construction).
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "leveraging the Schur complement theorem"; [section III.B, Eq. 11]: Explicit Schur complement formulation with positive-definiteness condition.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and the kernel trick
  - Why needed here: CI-RKM operates entirely in kernel-induced feature space; centroids, distances, and decision boundaries all depend on implicit mappings via K(x_i, x_j).
  - Quick check question: Given a kernel K, can you explain why ||σ(x) - σ(x')||² = K(x,x) + K(x',x') - 2K(x,x') without explicitly computing σ?

- Concept: Restricted Kernel Machines (RKM) and conjugate feature duality
  - Why needed here: CI-RKM inherits RKM's dual formulation with visible (primal) and hidden (dual) variables; understanding this is prerequisite to interpreting Eq. 15-17.
  - Quick check question: In standard RKM, what do the hidden features h_k represent, and how do they relate to the error terms e_k?

- Concept: Fenchel-Young inequality and convex conjugates
  - Why needed here: The weighted bound (Eq. 10) is a Fenchel-Young type inequality; the entire CI-RKM formulation hinges on this variational bound.
  - Quick check question: For a convex function f, what is the relationship between f(x) and its convex conjugate f*(y)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input layer -> Kernel module -> Class statistics module -> Weight module -> Linear solver -> Inference

- Critical path:
  1. Compute full kernel matrix M (O(N²) storage, O(N²d) compute)
  2. Compute class centroids and radii (requires all diagonal and off-diagonal kernel entries)
  3. Compute D vector (O(N) operations)
  4. Assemble and solve (N+1)×(N+1) linear system—dominant cost is O(N³) for direct solve
  5. For prediction, compute kernel evaluations against all training points

- Design tradeoffs:
  - RBF kernel bandwidth σ: Controls feature space geometry; too small → fragmented class structure, unreliable centroids; too large → all weights converge, diminishing CI-RKM advantage
  - Regularization η and λ: Balance model complexity vs. fitting; standard kernel machine tuning applies
  - Small constant ξ: Prevents numerical edge cases but introduces slight weight bias; paper does not specify selection method

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy drops below baseline RKM: Likely weight function misbehaving—check if any D(x_k) values are negative or extremely small; verify centroid/radius computations
  - Numerical instability in linear solve: D may have near-zero entries; increase ξ or clip minimum weight
  - No improvement over RKM on clean data: Expected—CI-RKM advantage emerges primarily under noise; verify noise conditions in training data
  - Poor performance on highly imbalanced classes: Class radii may differ substantially, causing asymmetric weighting; consider class-balanced radius normalization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate ablation study (Table IV): Train RKM and CI-RKM on the 6 listed datasets with 0%, 5%, 10%, 20% label noise; verify CI-RKM maintains higher average accuracy as noise increases.
  2. Weight distribution analysis: On a 2D synthetic dataset with known outliers, visualize D(x_k) values—confirm outliers receive low weights while inliers cluster near 1.
  3. Kernel bandwidth sensitivity: Fix a noisy dataset (e.g., connbenchsonarminesrocks), sweep RBF kernel parameter over {2^{-5}, ..., 2^{5}}, plot accuracy curves for CI-RKM vs. RKM to identify regimes where CI-RKM provides consistent advantage.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How can concepts from granular ball theory be integrated into the CI-RKM framework to enhance scalability for large-scale datasets?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that future work could incorporate granular ball theory to enhance the scalability of the RKM model.
  - Why unresolved: The current implementation likely faces standard kernel scalability bottlenecks ($O(N^3)$), and the suggested integration remains a theoretical proposal.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A modified CI-RKM implementation utilizing granular balls that demonstrates linear or sub-quadratic training times on large datasets.

- Question: Can the CI-RKM architecture be adapted to process matrix-structured data directly without vectorization?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion suggests developing the architecture by drawing inspiration from the support matrix machine to handle matrix inputs.
  - Why unresolved: The current formulation relies on vector inputs $x_k \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and standard kernel functions, which cannot inherently preserve the structural information of matrix data.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A derivation of the model using matrix-based regularization or kernels, validated on image or tensor classification benchmarks.

- Question: Does the definition of class radius using the maximum distance ($r_{\pm}$) inadvertently introduce sensitivity to outliers within the training set?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims robustness against outliers, but Eq. (8) defines the radius $r_{\pm}$ as the maximum distance from the centroid.
  - Why unresolved: The maximum function is non-robust; a single extreme outlier can inflate the radius, potentially flattening the weights ($D(x_k)$) for all other in-class samples.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing the current radius definition against robust estimators (e.g., percentiles or median absolute deviation) on data with high intra-class variance.

## Limitations
- The method's performance may degrade when class distributions are highly non-convex or multi-modal, as the spherical class structure assumption may not hold
- Computational complexity of O(N³) for solving the linear system limits scalability to very large datasets
- The exact value of the small positive constant ξ is not specified, affecting reproducibility and potentially the weight distribution

## Next Checks

1. Verify weight distribution behavior: Implement CI-RKM on a 2D synthetic dataset with injected outliers and visualize the computed weight values D(x_k) to confirm that outliers receive significantly lower weights than inliers.

2. Reproduce ablation study: Implement the 6-dataset ablation study with varying label noise levels (0%, 5%, 10%, 20%) to verify that CI-RKM maintains accuracy advantage over RKM as noise increases.

3. Test class structure assumption: Apply CI-RKM to datasets with known non-spherical class distributions (e.g., concentric circles, moons) and compare performance against datasets with spherical classes to validate the method's assumptions.
