core_contribution: The paper addresses the challenge of training spiking neural networks

  of the spiking mechanism make gradient-based training difficult. To overcome this,
  the authors adapt Random Feature Methods (RFMs) from artificial neural networks

# Random Feature Spiking Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01012
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01012
- Authors: Maximilian Gollwitzer; Felix Dietrich
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel data-driven algorithm S-SWIM trains spiking neural networks without gradient approximation, achieving high accuracies and speedups of 1-3 orders of magnitude compared to SGD

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for time series forecasting by adapting Random Feature Methods (RFMs) from artificial neural networks. The authors propose S-SWIM, a novel data-driven algorithm that trains SNNs without approximating spike function gradients, overcoming the non-differentiability and sparsity issues inherent in spiking mechanisms. The method samples network weights and temporal parameters from probability distributions constructed to separate data points with dissimilar target values.

S-SWIM demonstrates significant performance improvements across multiple time series forecasting benchmarks, achieving high accuracies as a standalone strategy and serving as an effective initialization for gradient-based training, particularly at long prediction horizons. The algorithm is characterized as fast, interpretable, and modular, with additional classification experiments showing applicability to both static image and speech datasets.

## Method Summary
The S-SWIM algorithm addresses spiking neural network training challenges by implementing a random feature approach. It constructs network weights and temporal parameters through a probability distribution designed to separate data points with dissimilar target values. The method involves temporal parameter initialization, weight construction based on distance metrics, normalization to control spiking behavior, and linear regression for output layer weights. This approach enables training without gradient-based methods while maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability.

## Key Results
- S-SWIM achieves high forecasting accuracies as a standalone training strategy
- The method serves as effective initialization for gradient-based training, especially at long prediction horizons
- Demonstrates speedups of one to three orders of magnitude compared to stochastic gradient descent training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The random feature approach works by constructing network weights and temporal parameters from probability distributions that inherently separate data points with dissimilar target values. By avoiding gradient approximation of the spiking mechanism, S-SWIM circumvents the non-differentiability problem while maintaining the computational advantages of random feature methods. The distance-based weight construction and normalization steps ensure controlled spiking behavior, while the linear regression output layer provides efficient learning of the final mapping.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Time Series -> Temporal Parameter Initialization -> Weight Construction (Distance Metrics) -> Normalization -> Linear Regression Output

Critical Path:
The critical computational path involves distance metric calculation between input patterns, weight construction based on these distances, and subsequent normalization to ensure appropriate spiking behavior before linear regression.

Design Tradeoffs:
The algorithm trades potential optimality of gradient-based fine-tuning for computational efficiency and the ability to avoid gradient approximation. The random feature approach sacrifices some precision for speed and interpretability.

Failure Signatures:
Poor separation in the target space may lead to ineffective weight distributions. Inadequate normalization can cause unstable spiking behavior. Linear regression may fail to capture complex temporal dependencies if the random feature space is insufficiently rich.

First Experiments:
1. Test S-SWIM on a simple periodic time series dataset to verify basic functionality
2. Compare convergence speed with standard SGD on a moderate-sized forecasting task
3. Evaluate the impact of different distance metrics on prediction accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability to complex, non-periodic time series data beyond tested benchmarks remains uncertain
- Performance on noisy or irregularly sampled time series is not explicitly addressed
- Interpretability claims lack quantitative metrics or formal analysis to substantiate how S-SWIM provides more insight than standard methods

## Confidence
- Performance claims: Medium
- Methodology validity: Medium
- Speedup comparisons: Medium
- Interpretability benefits: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test S-SWIM on non-periodic, real-world time series datasets with irregular sampling patterns and significant noise
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the normalization and distance metric components to overall performance
3. Perform extended training experiments to evaluate the long-term stability and convergence properties when using S-SWIM initialization followed by gradient-based fine-tuning
