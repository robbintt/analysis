- Style attack exploits Unicode fonts to deceive NLP models while remaining human-readable

## Executive Summary
Style Attack Disguise (SAD) introduces a novel adversarial attack method that exploits stylistic Unicode fonts to create a human-model perception gap. The attack replaces standard characters with visually similar but semantically distinct Unicode variants (mathematical alphabets, regional indicators, circled/squared letters) that models tokenize differently while remaining readable to humans. The method achieves high attack success rates across sentiment classification, machine translation, and multimodal tasks while maintaining semantic similarity and query efficiency.

## Method Summary
SAD employs two attack modes: SADlight (query-efficient, gradual word substitution) and SADstrong (single-query, all-words substitution). Words are ranked by combined semantic importance (AIS - Attention Importance Scoring via sentence embedding distances) and tokenization instability (TIS - fragmentation ratio under font substitution). The attack targets NLP models' vulnerability to non-standard Unicode tokenization, exploiting differences in how WordPiece, BPE, and LLM tokenizers handle stylistic fonts.

## Key Results
- SAD achieves >80% attack success rate on sentiment classification and machine translation
- SADlight maintains semantic similarity >0.96 using <4 average queries
- Successfully attacks commercial services including Google Translate, Baidu Translate, and Alibaba Translate
- Effective across traditional models, LLMs, and multimodal text-to-image/speech tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Stylistic fonts create a human-model perception gap that enables adversarial attacks while preserving readability.
- Mechanism: Unicode characters with visual similarity to standard letters render identically to humans but tokenize as entirely different sequences in NLP models, causing semantic interference.
- Core assumption: Models trained on standard text lack robust representations for stylistic font variants.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "humans easily read stylistic text, models process these characters as distinct tokens, causing interference"
  - [section 1] "humans perceive identical meaning across different font styles and read styled text normally, while models trained on standard text process these characters as distinct tokens"
  - [corpus] Related work on tokenizer bias (Zheng et al., 2025) supports non-canonical tokenization vulnerability, though direct corpus evidence for this specific font-mechanism is limited.
- Break condition: If models are trained or fine-tuned on diverse stylistic fonts, the perception gap diminishes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different tokenizer architectures produce distinct failure modes when processing stylistic fonts.
- Mechanism: WordPiece converts unrecognized stylistic fonts to [UNK] tokens (out-of-vocabulary interference); BPE decomposes them into multiple sub-tokens (expanded interference); LLM tokenizers may over-interpret symbols (e.g., regional indicators activating national-attribute representations).
- Core assumption: Tokenization behavior is consistent within architecture families and predictable across font types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] Explicitly describes three patterns: WordPiece→[UNK], BPE→sub-token decomposition, LLM→over-interpretation with "spurious semantic associations"
  - [section 4.2] "font-based perturbations successfully exploit tokenization vulnerabilities across different architectures"
  - [corpus] Sarabamoun (2025) documents special-character adversarial attacks, providing independent support for tokenizer vulnerability.
- Break condition: Custom tokenizers with explicit stylistic-font handling would neutralize this mechanism.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ranking words by combined semantic importance and tokenization instability optimizes attack efficiency.
- Mechanism: AIS (Attention Importance Scoring) measures semantic contribution via leave-one-out embedding distance; TIS (Tokenization Instability Scoring) measures fragmentation ratio under font substitution. Combined score V(w) = α·AIS + β·TIS prioritizes high-impact, high-fragility words.
- Core assumption: Words with high semantic contribution and high tokenization instability are optimal attack targets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] Equations 3-5 define AIS, TIS, and combined vulnerability score
  - [table 1] SADlight achieves 44-58% ASR with <4 queries vs. baselines requiring 10-30+ queries, demonstrating efficiency
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation for this specific hybrid scoring method; evidence is paper-internal.
- Break condition: If semantic importance and tokenization instability are uncorrelated or inversely related, the hybrid ranking degrades to random selection.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Subword Tokenization (WordPiece, BPE)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how tokenizers split unfamiliar characters determines which interference pattern will occur and how to select effective font substitutions.
  - Quick check question: Given the word " days" tokenized as ["day", "##s"], what happens when "d" is replaced with a mathematical alphabet character?

- Concept: **Unicode Stylistic Characters**
  - Why needed here: The attack space S = M ∪ R ∪ O ∪ Q ∪ V requires knowing which Unicode blocks contain visually similar letters (e.g., U+1D400 range for mathematical bold).
  - Quick check question: What Unicode block contains regional indicator symbols, and how do they differ from standard Latin letters?

- Concept: **Sentence Embedding Attribution**
  - Why needed here: AIS depends on computing L2 distances between sentence embeddings with and without each word.
  - Quick check question: If removing word w_i changes the sentence embedding by 0.02 (L2) and removing w_j changes it by 0.85, which word has higher semantic importance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Font Book -> AIS Module -> TIS Module -> Vulnerability Ranker -> Attack Controller
  (maps characters to stylistic variants) (sentence transformer for semantic importance) (tokenizer for fragmentation analysis) (combines AIS + TIS) (SADlight vs SADstrong selection)

- Critical path:
  1. Input text → tokenize with target model's tokenizer (for TIS)
  2. Compute AIS for all words via sentence transformer
  3. Compute TIS by sampling font variants and measuring fragmentation
  4. Rank words by V(w), descending
  5. Apply font substitutions starting from highest-ranked words
  6. Query target model; if unsuccessful and budget remains, perturb next word

- Design tradeoffs:
  - SADlight vs. SADstrong: Query efficiency (T=25) vs. attack success rate (80%+ vs. 40-60%)
  - α/β weighting: Higher α targets semantic disruption; higher β targets tokenization fragility
  - Font category selection: Regional indicators most effective for LLMs; mathematical alphabets more universal

- Failure signatures:
  - Low ASR with high query count → TIS not correlating with actual model vulnerability; reconsider tokenizer alignment
  - High semantic similarity but low ASR → Font substitutions not causing sufficient tokenization disruption; try different font categories
  - SADstrong underperforms SADlight on LLMs → Excessive stylistic fonts may trigger LLM robustness mechanisms; reduce perturbation scope

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Implement SADlight on SST5 with DistilBERT, verify ASR ≈ 44% with Sim > 0.96 and Query < 4; compare against TextBugger and HotFlip baselines.
  2. **Tokenizer ablation**: Isolate interference patterns by testing identical perturbations on WordPiece (DistilBERT) vs. BPE (RoBERTa); measure ASR difference to validate mechanism 2.
  3. **Font category analysis**: Test each font category (M, R, O, Q, V) independently on a held-out subset to identify which categories drive effectiveness for each target architecture.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What defense mechanisms can effectively mitigate stylistic font-based attacks while preserving legitimate Unicode usage?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "Our future work will focus on developing effective defenses to enhance model robustness against such vulnerabilities."
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates paraphrase defense, which reduces but doesn't eliminate SAD's effectiveness; no specialized defense is proposed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A defense method (e.g., font normalization, adversarial training with stylistic fonts) that maintains model accuracy while reducing SAD's ASR below baseline attack levels.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal proportion of stylistic font substitutions for attacking LLMs, where extensive perturbation triggers detection?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper observes SADstrong underperforms SADlight on LLMs, "suggesting extensive stylistic fonts may trigger LLMs alertness to identify original content."
- Why unresolved: No systematic study of font ratio thresholds exists; the α=β=0.5 weighting and substitution scope are set heuristically.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation experiments varying font substitution density (e.g., 10%-100% of words) across LLMs, measuring ASR and detection rates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does SAD perform on non-Latin scripts (e.g., CJK, Arabic, Devanagari) where stylistic Unicode variants may be limited or nonexistent?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Experiments are limited to English-French and English-Chinese translation; the font substitution space (M, R, O, Q, V) is defined primarily for Latin characters.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't demonstrate cross-script effectiveness or whether similar Unicode-based attack surfaces exist for other writing systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on monolingual CJK, Arabic, or multilingual datasets, with analysis of available stylistic variants per script.

## Limitations

- Font Mapping Completeness: Attack effectiveness depends on comprehensive Unicode coverage; characters without stylistic equivalents limit attack success rate.
- Tokenizer Dependency: Success hinges on predictable tokenization patterns that may not generalize to custom or newer tokenizers designed for Unicode diversity.
- Semantic Similarity Trade-off: The relationship between semantic preservation and attack effectiveness isn't fully characterized, leaving questions about fundamental attack limits.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core mechanism of human-model perception gap is well-supported by consistent experimental results across multiple tasks and architectures.

**Medium Confidence**: Word ranking methodology shows empirical effectiveness but lacks rigorous theoretical justification for why the specific AIS+TIS combination is optimal.

**Low Confidence**: Claim that SADstrong underperforms SADlight on LLMs due to triggering robustness mechanisms is speculative and not experimentally validated.

## Next Checks

1. **Font Coverage Analysis**: Systematically analyze font mapping φ:C→S to quantify substitutable character percentage across text domains and measure correlation with attack success rate.

2. **Tokenizer Generalization Study**: Test attack against broader tokenizer range (SentencePiece variants, GPT tokenizers, custom tokenizers) to validate generalization of interference patterns and identify failure boundaries.

3. **Hybrid Ranking Ablation**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing AIS+TIS ranking against pure AIS, pure TIS, and random ranking to validate whether the hybrid approach provides statistically significant efficiency improvements.
