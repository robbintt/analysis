# Applying non-negative matrix factorization with covariates to label matrix for classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.10375
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10375
- Authors: Kenichi Satoh
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix as the observation in a tri-factorization, with covariates as explanatory variables, enabling probabilistic classification without a separate classifier.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces NMF-LAB, a novel approach to probabilistic classification that directly factorizes the label matrix as an observation within a tri-factorization framework. By incorporating covariates as explanatory variables, NMF-LAB unifies regression and classification tasks, distinguishing itself from existing supervised NMF extensions that merely use labels as constraints. The method demonstrates competitive accuracy across diverse datasets, robustness to noisy labels, and scalability through Nyström approximation on large-scale data like MNIST. The linear model offers interpretability, while kernel-based covariates enhance predictive performance. Additionally, NMF-LAB naturally handles semi-supervised learning scenarios and enables direct probability estimation, making it a versatile tool for various classification tasks.

## Method Summary
NMF-LAB is a supervised non-negative matrix factorization method that directly factorizes the label matrix as the observation in a tri-factorization framework, with covariates serving as explanatory variables. This inverse formulation unifies regression and classification within the tri-NMF framework, distinguishing it from existing supervised NMF extensions that only use labels as constraints. The method leverages covariates to model the relationship between features and labels, enabling probabilistic classification without the need for a separate classifier. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate competitive accuracy, robustness to noisy labels, and scalability via Nyström approximation on MNIST. The linear model offers interpretability, while kernel-based covariates improve predictive performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NMF-LAB works by directly factorizing the label matrix as the observation in a tri-factorization framework, with covariates serving as explanatory variables. This approach allows the method to capture the underlying structure of the data and model the relationship between features and labels in a unified manner. By incorporating covariates, NMF-LAB can leverage additional information beyond the label matrix, leading to improved performance in both regression and classification tasks. The tri-factorization framework enables the method to learn a low-rank representation of the data, which is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets.

## Foundational Learning
- **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF):** A dimensionality reduction technique that decomposes a non-negative matrix into two non-negative matrices, revealing latent structure in the data. *Why needed:* NMF is the core technique used in NMF-LAB to factorize the label matrix and learn a low-rank representation. *Quick check:* Verify that the input data and the resulting factorized matrices are non-negative.
- **Tri-factorization:** An extension of NMF that factorizes a matrix into three matrices, allowing for more complex modeling of the data structure. *Why needed:* Tri-factorization is the underlying framework used in NMF-LAB to incorporate covariates as explanatory variables. *Quick check:* Ensure that the tri-factorization process converges and that the resulting matrices capture the desired structure.
- **Covariates:** Additional variables or features that provide supplementary information about the data. *Why needed:* Covariates are used in NMF-LAB to enhance the modeling of the relationship between features and labels. *Quick check:* Validate that the covariates are relevant and informative for the classification task.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Label Matrix -> NMF-LAB Tri-factorization -> Covariates -> Factorized Matrices -> Classification Probabilities
- **Critical Path:** The critical path involves factorizing the label matrix using NMF-LAB's tri-factorization framework, incorporating covariates as explanatory variables, and deriving classification probabilities from the resulting factorized matrices.
- **Design Tradeoffs:** The use of covariates in NMF-LAB introduces additional complexity but allows for more flexible modeling of the data. The choice between linear and kernel-based covariates involves a tradeoff between interpretability and predictive performance.
- **Failure Signatures:** Potential failure modes include convergence issues in the tri-factorization process, poor choice of covariates leading to overfitting or underfitting, and sensitivity to noise in the label matrix.
- **First Experiments:** 1) Evaluate NMF-LAB on a simple binary classification task with synthetic data to verify the basic functionality. 2) Compare the performance of NMF-LAB with and without covariates on a real-world dataset to assess the impact of incorporating additional information. 3) Test the robustness of NMF-LAB to noisy labels by introducing varying levels of label corruption in the dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The paper does not explicitly state hypotheses, which may limit the ability to evaluate the theoretical contributions against predefined expectations.
- The experimental setup lacks detailed descriptions of baseline comparisons, making it challenging to assess the relative performance of NMF-LAB against state-of-the-art methods.
- The scalability claims rely on Nyström approximation, but the paper does not provide extensive validation on extremely large datasets or real-time applications.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core concept of factorizing the label matrix directly and incorporating covariates is well-explained and distinct from existing approaches.
- **Medium Confidence:** The competitive accuracy and robustness claims are supported by experiments, but the lack of detailed baseline comparisons reduces confidence in the relative performance claims.
- **Low Confidence:** The scalability claims via Nyström approximation are promising but require further validation on larger, more diverse datasets.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive experiments comparing NMF-LAB against state-of-the-art classification methods (e.g., deep learning models, ensemble methods) on benchmark datasets to validate its competitive performance claims.
2. Test the scalability of NMF-LAB on real-world, large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet, web-scale data) to confirm its effectiveness in handling massive data volumes.
3. Investigate the robustness of NMF-LAB under varying noise levels and label corruption scenarios to ensure its reliability in practical applications.
