# Pareto Set Learning for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.06773
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06773
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes PSL-MORL, a novel decomposition-based framework for multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) that employs a hypernetwork to generate policy network parameters for each preference vector. The method achieves dense coverage of the Pareto front and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MORL methods in both hypervolume and sparsity metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PSL-MORL, a hypernetwork-based framework for multi-objective reinforcement learning that generates distinct policy parameters for different preference vectors. By mapping preference vectors to policy network parameters through a hypernetwork and stabilizing training via parameter fusion, the method achieves superior coverage of the Pareto front compared to existing approaches. The framework demonstrates strong performance across both continuous control benchmarks (MO-MuJoCo) and discrete navigation tasks (Fruit Tree Navigation), with theoretical guarantees on model capacity superiority over baseline methods.

## Method Summary
PSL-MORL employs a hypernetwork that takes a preference vector as input and outputs the parameters for a policy network, rather than conditioning a single shared network on preferences. The final policy parameters are computed as a weighted combination of the hypernetwork-generated parameters and a base policy network parameters, providing training stability. The method uses linear scalarization to convert multi-objective rewards into scalar values for standard reinforcement learning algorithms like TD3 and DDQN, with preference vectors sampled from a distribution during training. The framework achieves dense Pareto front coverage by explicitly optimizing for multiple distinct policies through parameter generation rather than preference conditioning.

## Key Results
- PSL-MORL achieves the best average rank across all tested MO-MuJoCo environments, outperforming state-of-the-art MORL methods
- The method demonstrates significant improvements in hypervolume metrics, achieving 5.8× better performance than PD-MORL on Walker2d
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the parameter fusion technique, with performance dropping drastically when using only generated parameters
- PSL-MORL successfully scales to environments with 6 objectives, maintaining dense Pareto front coverage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Preference-Conditioned Parameter Generation
Mapping preference vectors to distinct policy network parameters allows for higher model capacity and better personalization than conditioning a single shared network on preferences. A hypernetwork takes a preference weight vector as input and outputs the specific parameters for the policy network, explicitly decoupling the optimization of conflicting scalarized subproblems while sharing the hypernetwork's learning structure. The optimal policy parameters for different preferences lie on a smooth manifold that can be learned by the hypernetwork.

### Mechanism 2: Parameter Fusion for Training Stability
Training stability is achieved by fusing hypernetwork-generated parameters with a base policy network, preventing the fluctuations common in hypernetwork predictions. Instead of using only the generated parameters, the final policy parameters are computed as a weighted combination of base network and generated parameters, anchoring the generated policy near a robust baseline. The optimal policy for a specific preference is structurally similar to a "base" optimal policy, requiring only a specific deviation vector.

### Mechanism 3: Decomposition via Linear Scalarization
The multi-objective problem is tractable by optimizing a scalarized expected return over a distribution of preferences. Preferences are sampled from a distribution, the environment returns a vector reward which is scalarized linearly, and standard RL algorithms then maximize this scalar value. The underlying Pareto front is convex or can be sufficiently approximated by linear scalarization.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Hypernetworks**
- Why needed here: This is the core engine of the architecture. Unlike standard RL where a network learns weights directly, here a "hypernetwork" learns a mapping from preferences to the weights of the policy network.
- Quick check question: Can you explain how a network $H(x)$ can output the weights $\theta$ for another network $P(s)$, and why $P$ would not be trained via direct backpropagation in this context?

**Concept: Pareto Optimality & Dominance**
- Why needed here: The goal is not a single "best" reward, but a set of non-dominated solutions. Understanding "dominance" is required to interpret the Hypervolume and Sparsity metrics used for evaluation.
- Quick check question: If Policy A yields [Speed: 10, Energy: 2] and Policy B yields [Speed: 8, Energy: 5], does A dominate B?

**Concept: Model Capacity (Rademacher Complexity)**
- Why needed here: The paper justifies its architecture theoretically by claiming higher Rademacher complexity than baselines, implying it can fit more complex functions (diverse policies).
- Quick check question: Why might a single network conditioned on preferences have lower effective capacity than a hypernetwork generating distinct weights?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Input: Preference vector ω (sampled) -> Hypernetwork: MLP that takes ω and outputs θ₂ -> Base Policy: Standard policy network with parameters θ₁ -> Fusion Module: Computes θ = (1-α)θ₁ + αθ₂ -> Actor/Critic: Standard RL components using θ to interact with the MOMDP

**Critical path:**
Sample ω → Generate θ₂ → Fuse θ → Interact with Env → Calculate Scalarized Loss → Backpropagate to both Hypernetwork and Base Policy parameters

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Fusion Coefficient (α): Must be tuned (grid searched). The paper uses different values for different environments (e.g., 0.01 vs 0.05)
- Linear Scalarization: Simple and compatible with any RL algo, but limits discovery to convex fronts

**Failure signatures:**
- Instability: Rewards oscillate wildly (suggests α is too high)
- Mode Collapse: Similar policies generated for different ωs (suggests hypernetwork is not learning or α is too low)
- Sparse Front: High Sparsity metric indicates gaps in the Pareto approximation

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Sanity Check (Ablation on Fusion): Run PSL-MORL against "PSL-MORL-gen" (no fusion) to verify stability drops as shown in Table 2
2. Hyperparameter Sweep: Grid search α ∈ [0.01, 0.5] on a single MO-MuJoCo environment (e.g., HalfCheetah) to find the stability sweet spot
3. Capacity Verification: Compare PSL-MORL against PD-MORL on a complex task (e.g., Ant-v2) to validate the Hypervolume improvement claims in Table 1

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can PSL-MORL be effectively adapted to handle non-linear scalarization functions?
- How does PSL-MORL scale to environments with a large number of objectives (high-dimensional preference spaces)?
- Can the parameter fusion coefficient α be determined adaptively rather than via grid search?

## Limitations
- The method is limited to linear scalarization and cannot handle non-convex Pareto fronts
- Performance may be brittle to hyperparameter choice, particularly the fusion coefficient α
- The theoretical capacity claims rely on idealized conditions that may not hold in practice

## Confidence
- High: Empirical performance claims (HV and SP metrics show consistent improvement over baselines)
- Medium: Theoretical capacity claims (Rademacher complexity proof assumes idealized conditions)
- Low: Generalizability claims (no results on non-convex Pareto fronts despite acknowledging this limitation)

## Next Checks
1. Ablation on hypernetwork depth: Systematically vary hypernetwork hidden layers (1-3) to verify the claimed capacity advantage over PD-MORL
2. Non-convex Pareto test: Design a synthetic environment with a known non-convex Pareto front to confirm the linear scalarization limitation
3. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis: Test PSL-MORL with fixed α=0.01 across all environments to assess robustness to fusion coefficient tuning
