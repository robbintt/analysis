# Sce2DriveX: A Generalized MLLM Framework for Scene-to-Drive Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.14917
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14917
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple driving tasks with 94.29% accuracy in meta-action reasoning and 0.36m L2 error in motion planning

## Executive Summary
Sce2DriveX introduces a human-like chain-of-thought reasoning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that bridges the gap between high-level semantic scene understanding and low-level motion control commands. The framework leverages multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to enhance 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. By constructing a comprehensive VQA driving instruction dataset for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning, Sce2DriveX demonstrates superior performance across multiple autonomous driving tasks including scene understanding, behavior interpretation, motion planning, and control signal generation.

## Method Summary
Sce2DriveX employs a three-stage training pipeline that integrates multimodal perception data with chain-of-thought reasoning to enable human-like decision-making in autonomous driving scenarios. The framework processes both local scene videos and global BEV maps through joint learning mechanisms, allowing for enhanced 3D spatial understanding and reasoning about long-term driving tasks. The approach addresses the fundamental challenge of translating complex semantic scene information into precise motion control commands by mimicking human cognitive processes. A novel VQA driving instruction dataset was constructed to train the model on 3D spatial reasoning and task-oriented decision-making.

## Key Results
- Achieves 94.29% accuracy in meta-action reasoning on nuScenes dataset
- Demonstrates 0.36m L2 error in motion planning, outperforming baseline methods
- Shows robust generalization on Bench2Drive benchmark across multiple driving tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its chain-of-thought reasoning approach that mimics human cognitive processes in driving scenarios. By integrating multimodal joint learning from both local scene videos and global BEV maps, the system develops enhanced 3D perception capabilities. The three-stage training pipeline progressively builds from basic perception to complex reasoning tasks, while the constructed VQA dataset provides rich supervision for spatial understanding and task-oriented decision-making.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Videos + BEV Maps -> Multimodal Encoder -> Chain-of-Thought Module -> Action Decoder -> Control Signals

**Critical Path:**
Perception (Videos + BEV) → Multimodal Fusion → Reasoning (CoT) → Decision Making → Control Output

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Multimodal integration provides richer context but increases computational complexity
- Chain-of-thought reasoning improves decision quality but adds inference latency
- Three-stage training ensures progressive learning but requires more training time

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor performance in adverse weather conditions indicates insufficient environmental robustness
- Inaccurate motion planning suggests issues in 3D spatial reasoning modules
- Suboptimal control signals point to breakdowns in the decision-making chain

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Validate multimodal feature fusion quality by testing on isolated input modalities
2. Evaluate chain-of-thought reasoning quality on simplified driving scenarios
3. Benchmark computational efficiency and real-time inference capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets may not capture real-world complexity
