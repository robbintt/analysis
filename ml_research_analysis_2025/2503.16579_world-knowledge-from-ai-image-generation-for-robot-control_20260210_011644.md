# World Knowledge from AI Image Generation for Robot Control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.16579
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16579
- Authors: Jonas Krumme; Christoph Zetzsche
- Reference count: 31
- One-line primary result: Generative AI can provide useful implicit knowledge to help robots solve under-specified tasks by showing how things are typically arranged in the real world.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates using generative AI image models to give robots implicit knowledge about how to arrange objects in the real world. The authors propose using a robot's camera view, combined with edge maps of the scene layout, to condition an image generation model. This produces images showing how the scene should look after the task is completed. The method is tested in two simulated tasks: placing a bowl on a table among glasses, and hanging a picture frame on a wall. FLUX.1[dev] is used to generate images of the completed tasks, and YOLOv8 detects the objects in the generated images to determine their positions. The simulated robot arm then moves objects to those positions. The results show the approach can successfully generate images that guide the robot to place objects in reasonable, human-like arrangements.

## Method Summary
The method uses a robot's RGB-D camera to capture the current scene, extracts Canny edge maps as structural conditioning, and uses FLUX.1 Canny[dev] to generate a goal image that shows the completed task while preserving the scene layout. YOLOv8x detects objects in the generated image, and depth information plus camera calibration converts bounding box locations to 3D world coordinates. A simulated robot arm (CoppeliaSim) then moves objects to these positions. The approach leverages the implicit world knowledge embedded in the generative model's training data to solve under-specified arrangement tasks.

## Key Results
- Successfully generates images showing completed tasks with objects in reasonable, human-like arrangements
- Demonstrates that generative AI can provide implicit knowledge for solving under-specified robot tasks
- Shows FLUX.1 can insert the correct number of objects when prompted, addressing a common limitation of earlier models
- Proves the concept in simulated environments with two different arrangement tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Conditioning image generation on edge maps preserves scene geometry while allowing the model to insert task-relevant objects.
- Mechanism: A Canny edge map is extracted from the robot's camera view and used as a structural conditioning signal for FLUX.1 Canny[dev]. The text prompt specifies what to add (e.g., "a bowl on the table"). The model generates a goal image that maintains the original layout but includes the requested object in a plausible location.
- Core assumption: The generative model has learned spatial priors about where objects typically belong and can respect edge constraints simultaneously.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "combined with edge maps of the scene layout, to condition an image generation model"
  - [section 3.1]: "we decided to use ideas introduced by ControlNet [15] to guide the layout of the generated scene using edge maps calculated from the original image"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; Kapelyukh et al. [5] uses inpainting instead of edge conditioning for similar rearrangement tasks.
- Break condition: Scenes with ambiguous edges (low contrast, transparent objects) or when the edge map overdetermines the scene, preventing novel object insertion.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The generated goal image encodes implicit world knowledge about normative object arrangements that can guide under-specified tasks.
- Mechanism: The text-to-image model (FLUX.1[dev]) generates an "imagined" completed scene. The model's training on web-scale images embeds priors about where bowls go relative to glasses, or how high pictures hang on walls.
- Core assumption: Statistical regularities in training images reflect human-preferred arrangements that generalize to novel scenes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "generative AI can provide useful implicit knowledge to help robots solve under-specified tasks"
  - [section 1]: "images of the real world often implicitly encode answers to such questions and can show which configurations of objects are meaningful"
  - [corpus]: PhysWorld and DreamVLA explore related "dreaming" paradigms but focus on video/action prediction rather than static goal images.
- Break condition: Tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge underrepresented in training data (e.g., industrial or medical arrangements).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: 2D bounding boxes from object detection can be lifted to 3D positions using depth information and camera calibration.
- Mechanism: YOLOv8x (trained on Open Images V7) detects objects in the generated goal image. The bounding box center or bottom edge provides a 2D pixel location; depth data and camera intrinsics convert this to a 3D world coordinate for the robot arm.
- Core assumption: The detected object location in the generated image corresponds to a physically valid placement in the real scene.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "YOLOv8 detects the objects in the generated images to determine their positions"
  - [section 4.1]: "The position of the bowl on the table is approximated using a depth image from the simulated camera, giving us the distance from the camera for each pixel"
  - [corpus]: DIJE explores dense Jacobian estimation for visual servoing; related but addresses a different problem.
- Break condition: When the generated object position is occluded, outside reachable workspace, or when depth estimation fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **ControlNet-style conditioning**
  - Why needed here: Enables scene-layout preservation while modifying semantic content. Without this, generated images would not match the robot's actual environment.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how an edge map differs from a depth map as a conditioning signal?

- Concept: **Object detection with bounding boxes**
  - Why needed here: Converts the generated image into actionable coordinates. YOLOv8 provides the 2D pixel locations that anchor position extraction.
  - Quick check question: What information does a bounding box provide, and what does it not provide?

- Concept: **Perspective projection and depth-to-3D**
  - Why needed here: Maps 2D image coordinates to 3D world positions the robot can act on. Requires camera intrinsics and depth data.
  - Quick check question: Given a pixel (u, v) and depth z, what additional information do you need to compute the 3D point?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Camera (RGB + depth) → captures scene
  - Canny edge detector → extracts structural conditioning
  - FLUX.1 Canny[dev] → generates goal image conditioned on edge map + text prompt
  - YOLOv8x (Open Images V7) → detects objects in generated image
  - Position estimator → converts bounding boxes + depth to 3D coordinates
  - Robot arm controller (CoppeliaSim in experiments) → executes placement

- Critical path: Camera capture → edge extraction → FLUX generation (CFG=1.6, 20 steps, euler sampler) → YOLO detection → 3D position calculation → robot motion execution

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher CFG (1.6 vs default 1.0) improves prompt adherence but may reduce image coherence
  - YOLOv8x on Open Images V7 covers more categories than COCO-trained variants
  - FLUX.1 chosen over StableDiffusion for better object-count accuracy and prompt following

- Failure signatures:
  - Generated object placed in occupied or unreachable location
  - Wrong number of objects generated (earlier models struggled here)
  - YOLO fails to detect generated object (lighting/style mismatch)
  - Depth estimation returns invalid values at detection boundary

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate bowl-on-table task: verify edge conditioning preserves layout while adding bowl in valid position
  2. Test CFG sensitivity: run generation at CFG 1.0, 1.3, 1.6, 2.0 and measure object insertion success rate
  3. Extend to novel object category not in original experiments (e.g., "place a laptop on the desk") to probe generalization limits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) handle under-specified tasks directly without requiring an explicit image generation module?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that VLMs "might be able to handle such tasks directly without an explicit knowledge generation module" and suggest the future lies in combining sensory info into a single model.
- Why unresolved: This study isolated the image generation capability (FLUX.1), but did not compare it against end-to-end VLM control to see which is more efficient or accurate.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative benchmark between the proposed generation-detection pipeline and a state-of-the-art VLM performing the same object arrangement tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed method transfer successfully from simulation to physical robots with noisy sensors?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The experiments were conducted entirely in the CoppeliaSim simulator. The authors note that "a real robot would likely use a more refined method" for position estimation than the depth approximation used.
- Why unresolved: Simulation offers idealized camera data and object detection; real-world lighting, occlusion, and sensor noise might degrade the quality of the generated goals or the precision of the placement.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful execution of the bowl and picture placement tasks on a physical robotic arm using real camera feeds.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the system capable of handling complex compositional tasks that require specific object ordering, such as food preparation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention tasks like "preparing a sandwich" in the introduction but note that such use cases "require more complex image processing and understanding mechanisms" than the simple placement tasks tested.
- Why unresolved: The current method relies on detecting bounding boxes for placement, which ignores the internal arrangement or stacking order of objects (e.g., cheese inside bread).
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the experiments to tasks where the spatial relationship (stacking/insertion) is critical, rather than just 2D surface placement.

## Limitations
- Validated only in simulation with limited scene diversity, not on physical robots
- Edge map conditioning parameters are not specified, making exact reproduction difficult
- Depth-to-3D position conversion lacks explicit equations or validation
- No real-world robot testing despite claims about "real world" knowledge

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core mechanism: conditioning FLUX.1 with edge maps to preserve scene layout while adding objects
- **Medium confidence** in the YOLO-to-3D position extraction pipeline, given the incomplete technical details
- **Low confidence** in real-world applicability without physical robot validation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the bowl-on-table task with exact Canny edge detection parameters and depth-to-3D conversion equations
2. Test with physically grounded robot (e.g., UR5e) in real scenes with varying lighting and object appearances
3. Evaluate robustness by perturbing edge maps (blur, noise) and measuring impact on object placement accuracy
