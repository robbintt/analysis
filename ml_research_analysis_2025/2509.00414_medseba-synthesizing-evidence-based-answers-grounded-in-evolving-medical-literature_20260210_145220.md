# MedSEBA: Synthesizing Evidence-Based Answers Grounded in Evolving Medical Literature

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.00414
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00414
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: AI system achieving SUS score of 81.7 for evidence-based medical question answering with 90% study relevance and 80% sensible stance labels

## Executive Summary
MedSEBA is an AI-powered system that synthesizes evidence-based answers to medical questions by grounding responses in trustworthy medical studies retrieved from PubMed. It combines large language models with semantic retrieval to generate structured answers with key arguments, stance labels (support/refute), and temporal visualizations of research consensus. The system achieved a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 81.7 (benchmark: 68), with 90% of users finding retrieved studies relevant, 80% finding stance labels sensible, and 90% finding summaries informative. The system enables both everyday health inquiries and advanced research insights through reliable, traceable medical evidence.

## Method Summary
The system employs retrieval-augmented generation with semantic search over PubMed abstracts to ground medical question answering. It uses large language models to synthesize structured responses including key arguments, stance labels indicating support or refutation, and temporal visualizations showing how medical consensus has evolved. The architecture combines semantic retrieval mechanisms with LLM processing to ensure responses are evidence-based rather than purely generative.

## Key Results
- Achieved SUS score of 81.7 (well above benchmark of 68)
- 90% of users found retrieved studies relevant to their queries
- 80% of users found stance labels (support/refute) sensible
- 90% of users found summaries informative and useful

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from grounding LLM responses in verified medical literature through semantic retrieval from PubMed. By combining semantic search with LLM synthesis, it ensures answers are traceable to specific studies while maintaining natural language coherence. The stance labeling and temporal visualization features help users understand both the current state of medical evidence and how it has evolved over time.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic retrieval**: Finding relevant documents through meaning rather than keywords - needed to locate appropriate medical studies; quick check: test with synonym-rich queries
- **LLM grounding**: Anchoring generated text to retrieved evidence - prevents hallucinations while maintaining answer quality; quick check: verify all claims trace to source documents
- **Temporal analysis of literature**: Understanding how medical consensus evolves - provides context for current recommendations; quick check: validate with known historical medical debates
- **Evidence synthesis**: Combining multiple studies into coherent conclusions - creates actionable insights from fragmented research; quick check: compare with systematic review outcomes
- **User interface design for medical information**: Presenting complex evidence clearly to non-experts - ensures accessibility and usability; quick check: usability testing with target users

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: PubMed API -> Semantic Retriever -> LLM Processor -> Answer Synthesizer -> UI Layer
- **Critical path**: Query input -> Semantic search -> Document retrieval -> Stance analysis -> Answer generation -> Visualization
- **Design tradeoffs**: Abstract-only evidence vs. full-text access (speed vs. depth), general-purpose LLM vs. medical-specialized model (cost vs. accuracy)
- **Failure signatures**: Missing relevant studies (poor semantic matching), hallucinated connections (insufficient grounding), outdated consensus (temporal analysis errors)
- **First experiments**: 1) Test retrieval accuracy with known medical queries, 2) Validate stance labels against medical expert judgment, 3) Compare temporal visualizations with actual medical guideline evolution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on subjective user feedback rather than objective medical accuracy measures
- Small sample size (10 participants) without demographic diversity specifications
- Dependence on PubMed abstracts limits depth of medical analysis
- Temporal visualization oversimplifies how scientific consensus actually develops

## Confidence
- **System usability and user satisfaction**: High (SUS scores are standardized, though sample size is small)
- **Medical information accuracy**: Low (no objective validation against medical expert gold standards)
- **Evidence grounding effectiveness**: Medium (retrieval-augmented approach is sound, but verification methods unclear)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct blind expert evaluation comparing system-generated answers against established medical guidelines for accuracy and completeness
2. Test system performance across diverse medical domains (acute vs chronic conditions, rare vs common diseases) to identify knowledge gaps
3. Implement adversarial testing with deliberately misleading or conflicting medical literature to assess robustness of stance detection and consensus visualization
