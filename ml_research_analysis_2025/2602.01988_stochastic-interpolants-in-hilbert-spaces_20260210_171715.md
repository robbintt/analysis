# Stochastic Interpolants in Hilbert Spaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01988
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01988
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First rigorous framework for stochastic interpolants in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes the first rigorous framework for stochastic interpolants in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, addressing fundamental measure-theoretic and well-posedness challenges that have hindered their application to function-valued data. The authors introduce conditional bridges that enable generative modeling between arbitrary functional distributions, supported by theoretical guarantees including existence, uniqueness, and explicit Wasserstein error bounds. Experiments on PDE-based forward and inverse problems demonstrate competitive or state-of-the-art performance, with the ODE solver achieving new benchmarks on Navier-Stokes tasks while showing how appropriate noise parameterization and time-change regularization are critical for numerical stability in infinite dimensions.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a conditional bridge framework that constructs stochastic interpolants between arbitrary functional distributions in Hilbert spaces. The method leverages a linear drift assumption to establish theoretical guarantees of existence, uniqueness, and Wasserstein error bounds. Key innovations include time-change regularization and careful noise parameterization to ensure numerical stability when solving the infinite-dimensional SDE. The framework is validated through applications to PDE-based forward and inverse problems, including Navier-Stokes equations.

## Key Results
- First rigorous theoretical framework for stochastic interpolants in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces
- Conditional bridges enable generative modeling between arbitrary functional distributions
- Explicit Wasserstein error bounds established for the proposed method
- ODE solver achieves new state-of-the-art performance on Navier-Stokes tasks
- Time-change regularization and noise parameterization shown critical for numerical stability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by constructing conditional bridges that interpolate between functional distributions in Hilbert spaces. The linear drift assumption enables rigorous theoretical guarantees while time-change regularization and appropriate noise parameterization ensure numerical stability in infinite dimensions. The Wasserstein error bounds provide explicit quantification of approximation quality between the true and learned interpolants.

- Stochastic differential equations (SDEs): Why needed - model the dynamics of the interpolants; Quick check - understand basic SDE solution concepts
- Conditional bridges: Why needed - enable interpolation between arbitrary distributions; Quick check - grasp the concept of conditioning stochastic processes
- Wasserstein distance: Why needed - measure the quality of approximation between distributions; Quick check - understand basic properties of Wasserstein metrics
- Time-change regularization: Why needed - ensure numerical stability in infinite dimensions; Quick check - recognize how time transformations affect SDE solutions
- Noise parameterization: Why needed - critical for stability in infinite-dimensional settings; Quick check - understand different noise types and their properties

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Linear drift assumption -> Conditional bridge construction -> Time-change regularization -> Noise parameterization -> Wasserstein error bounds

**Critical Path**: The theoretical guarantees (existence, uniqueness, error bounds) depend on the linear drift assumption, which then enables the construction of conditional bridges that are stabilized through time-change regularization and appropriate noise parameterization.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Linear drift provides theoretical tractability but limits expressiveness for nonlinear generative modeling tasks. The framework trades some modeling flexibility for rigorous mathematical guarantees.

**Failure Signatures**: Numerical instability in infinite dimensions without proper time-change regularization and noise parameterization. Poor performance on highly nonlinear functional distributions due to the linear drift limitation.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate existence and uniqueness of conditional bridges for simple functional distributions
2. Test numerical stability with different noise parameterizations on a simple PDE
3. Compare Wasserstein error bounds against empirical performance on Navier-Stokes tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Restrictive linear drift assumption may limit practical applicability to nonlinear generative modeling
- Limited experimental scope, focused primarily on specific PDE-based problems
- Practical implementation challenges due to dependence on careful noise parameterization and time-change regularization

## Confidence
- High: Theoretical contributions establishing existence, uniqueness, and Wasserstein error bounds
- Medium: Experimental results demonstrating competitive performance on Navier-Stokes tasks
- Low: General applicability to arbitrary nonlinear functional distributions without additional theoretical extensions

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on a broader range of nonlinear functional distributions beyond current PDE applications
2. Conduct extensive ablation studies to quantify impact of noise parameterization and time-change regularization on stability across different problem types
3. Scale experiments to larger, more complex functional datasets to assess computational efficiency and practical limitations in real-world applications
