- This paper introduces a 4×4 landscape model to bridge human interpretation and machine representation in qualitative research

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a 4×4 landscape model that bridges human interpretation and machine representation in qualitative research by crossing four levels of meaning-making with four levels of modeling. The framework clarifies what kind of commitments qualitative outputs make and reveals that current LLM-based systems skew toward low-commitment modeling and shallow meaning-making, rarely achieving interpretive or theoretical depth. The landscape provides a specification language for analytic contracts, governance rules, and evaluation protocols, charting a path toward more rigorous, transparent, and interpretable LLM-assisted qualitative analysis.

## Method Summary
The study constructed a dual-axis rubric to classify qualitative research papers along two orthogonal dimensions: Level of Meaning-Making (M1: Descriptive to M4: Theoretical) and Level of Modeling (D1: Static to D4: Dynamics). The empirical corpus was built through PRISMA-style retrieval using 4,493 domain keywords combined with 10 QR methodology terms on Google Scholar, yielding 231 papers after filtering. The computational corpus was created through snowball sampling from seed queries like "LLM Thematic Analysis," yielding 69 papers. Three annotators applied the shared rubrics to classify papers, achieving 85% agreement for meaning-making and 94% for modeling levels. An LLM-based annotation experiment with GPT-5.2 confirmed the framework's operational clarity.

## Key Results
- Manual annotation of 300 papers reveals that current LLM-based systems concentrate heavily in low-commitment regions (M1–M2, D1–D2), rarely achieving interpretive or theoretical depth
- High-end human qualitative research typically couples deep interpretation with richer modeling commitments, creating a systematic gap between current automation and research needs
- The LLM-based annotation experiment achieved 85% agreement for meaning-making and 94% for modeling levels, confirming the framework's operational clarity
- The framework successfully prevents category errors by making analytic commitments explicit and comparable across QR traditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The 4×4 landscape prevents category errors by making analytic commitments explicit and comparable across QR traditions
- Mechanism: Decomposing qualitative outputs into two orthogonal axes—meaning-making (semantic depth) and modeling (representational form)—isolates what kind of inference is being claimed from what kind of structure is asserted
- Core assumption: Meaning-making commitments and modeling commitments are analytically separable
- Evidence anchors: The abstract describes crossing four levels of meaning-making with four levels of modeling; section 3.3 states the landscape prevents category errors
- Break condition: If meaning-making and modeling levels prove empirically correlated in ways that violate orthogonality, the 16-cell structure collapses

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework's level definitions are sufficiently explicit to be applied consistently by independent agents, including LLMs
- Mechanism: Operational definitions include boundary tests and decision rules that reduce ambiguity, enabling both human annotation and automated classification with measurable agreement
- Core assumption: Abstract qualitative distinctions can be operationalized into decision rules that preserve discriminative validity
- Evidence anchors: Section 3.4 confirms the framework's operational clarity with 85% agreement for meaning-making and 94% for modeling levels; section 4 describes consensus protocols applied to 300 papers
- Break condition: If inter-annotator agreement drops substantially with naive users or on edge cases, the operational definitions need refinement

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The landscape reveals a systematic gap: LLM-based QR concentrates in low-commitment regions (M1–M2, D1–D2), while high-quality human QR occupies higher regions (M3–M4, D3–D4)
- Mechanism: By mapping 300 papers onto the 4×4 grid, the distribution makes visible where existing automation fails to match human analytic depth
- Core assumption: The sampled papers are representative of broader practice; the annotation scheme captures the dominant contribution of each paper
- Evidence anchors: Section 4, observation O1 notes computational work concentrates heavily in D1–D2; observation O3 notes high-level modeling almost never appears with low-level meaning-making
- Break condition: If paper sampling systematically underrepresents high-modeling LLM work, the gap diagnosis overstates the problem

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Manifest vs. latent content analysis
  - Why needed here: The meaning-making axis (M1–M4) builds on this classic distinction; M1 corresponds to manifest content, M3–M4 to latent interpretation
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why inferring "implicit goals" from an interview excerpt is qualitatively different from summarizing what was explicitly said?

- Concept: Causal vs. correlational claims in qualitative research
  - Why needed here: The modeling axis distinguishes D2 (temporal ordering without causality) from D3 (directed causal pathways); conflating these produces invalid mechanism claims
  - Quick check question: If a stage model shows "Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3," does this commit to Phase 1 causing Phase 2? Why or why not?

- Concept: Feedback loops and system dynamics
  - Why needed here: D4 requires iterative state change and feedback as explanatory machinery, not just rhetorical reference to "systems"
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a model with a cycle in its diagram (D3) and a model whose core explanation depends on endogenous feedback-driven evolution (D4)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Meaning-making axis (M1–M4): Semantic commitment module; determines how far outputs go beyond surface text
  - Modeling axis (D1–D4): Representational structure module; determines what kind of artifact is produced (map, timeline, causal graph, dynamical system)
  - Evidence anchors: Required for every node/edge; enforce traceability
  - Fitness-to-corpus scorer: Evaluates model quality via coverage, contradiction rate, structural consistency

- Critical path:
  1. Define target cell (e.g., M3/D3) based on analytic goals
  2. Configure meaning-making module for target depth (e.g., frame-based inference for M3)
  3. Configure modeling module for target structure (e.g., directed influence edges for D3)
  4. Enforce evidence anchoring at each inference step
  5. Apply fitness scoring; iterate if fit falls below threshold

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher cells (M3–M4, D3–D4) provide richer insight but require stronger warrants and are more fragile to hallucination
  - Lower cells (M1–M2, D1–D2) are more robust and automatable but may underserve research questions requiring mechanism or theory
  - Traceability requirements scale with commitment level; D4 without evidence anchors is unverifiable

- Failure signatures:
  - Hallucination: LLM generates interpretive claims (M3/M4) or causal edges (D3) without corpus evidence
  - Category error: System outputs themes (M2) when task requires mechanism explanation (D3)
  - Traceability loss: Multi-step synthesis breaks excerpt-to-claim audit trail
  - Over-commitment: System claims feedback dynamics (D4) but diagram is merely a pathway with a cycle; no state-update semantics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate annotation reliability: Apply the M/D rubric to a held-out set of 20 papers; measure inter-annotator agreement against author benchmarks
  2. Gap replication on new corpus: Collect 50 recent LLM-QR papers (2024–2025); test whether the M1–M2/D1–D2 skew replicates
  3. Fitness scorer prototype: Implement the evidence-anchored scoring pipeline on a small coded corpus; evaluate whether fit scores correlate with human quality judgments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How can LLM systems be designed to adaptively select the appropriate level of meaning-making and modeling based on the evidence available in a corpus?
  - Basis in paper: Section 5.2 calls for "mechanisms that let the system decide which level... is warranted... with calibrated abstention"
  - Why unresolved: Current systems tend to skew toward low-commitment outputs regardless of data richness, or require manual prompting for higher levels
  - What evidence would resolve it: An automated system that dynamically modulates its output complexity based on corpus saturation or ambiguity metrics

- **Question:** What automatic metrics can effectively operationalize "fitness-to-corpus" for complex structural outputs like causal pathways (D3) or feedback dynamics (D4)?
  - Basis in paper: Section 5.2 identifies "automatic goodness-of-fit metrics for qualitative models" as a "key missing ingredient for scalable automation"
  - Why unresolved: Standard NLP metrics are insufficient for narrative or structural coherence, and systematic approximations remain unclear
  - What evidence would resolve it: Development of evaluation protocols that quantify evidence coverage, contradiction rates, and semantic consistency in structural models

- **Question:** Do the risks of fabrication and epistemic drift in LLM-assisted qualitative research vary systematically across the levels of the 4×4 landscape?
  - Basis in paper: Section 5.1 hypothesizes that risks might not distribute uniformly and suggests the landscape could scaffold "systematic benchmarking" to establish governance rules
  - Why unresolved: The paper notes a lack of empirical studies mapping error types to specific meaning-making and modeling commitments
  - What evidence would resolve it: A benchmarking study comparing the reliability and accuracy of LLM outputs across different landscape cells

## Limitations

- The orthogonality assumption between meaning-making and modeling axes remains untested in external corpora; current validation relies on author-annotated samples
- GPT-5.2 (used for LLM validation) is not publicly available, requiring substitution with accessible models that may differ in reasoning capabilities
- The gap diagnosis may be biased by the corpus construction method, which could underrepresent high-modeling computational work in fields like simulation-based social science

## Confidence

- **High**: The framework's operational definitions are explicit and enable reproducible annotation (confirmed by 85-94% agreement rates)
- **Medium**: The claim about systematic gaps in LLM-QR (concentrating in low-commitment regions) is supported by current data but needs replication on new, independent corpora
- **Low**: The orthogonality assumption (meaning-making and modeling are separable dimensions) lacks external validation and could collapse the 16-cell structure if violated

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the annotation study with a new, independent corpus of 50 recent LLM-QR papers (2024-2025) to verify the M1-M2/D1-D2 skew pattern
2. Test inter-annotator reliability using the framework with naive users on edge cases (M3/M4 and D3/D4 boundaries) to assess operational clarity
3. Validate the orthogonality assumption by examining whether meaning-making and modeling levels show systematic correlations in a larger sample that would violate the 16-cell structure
