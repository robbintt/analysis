# Regional Bias in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.16349
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16349
- Reference count: 20
- Ten LLMs evaluated across 100 neutral forced-choice prompts reveal 3.8-fold variation in regional bias levels (FAZE scores 9.5 to 2.5)

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates regional bias across ten large language models using FAZE, a prompt-based framework measuring geographic preference tendencies under neutral scenarios. The evaluation reveals substantial variation in bias levels, with FAZE scores ranging from 9.5 (GPT-3.5) to 2.5 (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). High-scoring models consistently make unwarranted region-specific recommendations, while low-scoring models predominantly acknowledge insufficient information or treat options as equivalent. The findings demonstrate that regional bias is neither uniform nor inherent to model scale but is strongly influenced by training data, architecture, and alignment strategies. This work highlights the importance of systematic bias evaluation and introduces a replicable framework for measuring geographic fairness in LLMs.

## Method Summary
The study employs FAZE (Framework for Analysing Zonal Evaluation), a prompt-based method measuring regional bias through 100 neutral forced-choice scenarios. Prompts present equivalent options between regions (e.g., hiring decisions, travel recommendations) and classify responses as "Unknown" (model declines, acknowledges equivalence, or cites insufficient information) or "Non-Unknown" (model selects a specific region). The FAZE score formula is (N_total - N_unknown) / N_total × 10, producing a 0-10 scale where lower scores indicate less bias. Models are evaluated via single-run responses through chat interfaces without temperature sampling or system prompts.

## Key Results
- FAZE scores range from 9.5 (GPT-3.5) to 2.5 (Claude 3.5 Sonnet), revealing a 3.8-fold variation in bias levels across models
- High-scoring models (GPT-3.5, Llama 3) consistently provide region-specific responses even when prompts explicitly state equivalence
- Low-scoring models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral 7B) predominantly acknowledge insufficient information or treat options as equivalent

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Models with stronger alignment toward epistemic caution exhibit lower regional bias scores. When models are trained or fine-tuned to recognize uncertainty and avoid unwarranted commitments, they default to "unknown" responses in contextually neutral scenarios rather than selecting specific regions based on latent statistical associations from pretraining data. This pattern reflects genuine uncertainty acknowledgment rather than superficial refusal templates.

### Mechanism 2
Regional bias arises from latent geographic associations encoded during pretraining on imbalanced corpora. Models trained on text corpora with over-representation of certain regions (particularly Western sources) develop statistical priors that associate those regions with positive attributes, which surface when prompts lack distinguishing information—models default to higher-probability completions aligned with training distribution.

### Mechanism 3
Regional bias is decoupled from model scale—smaller models can achieve lower bias than larger ones. Bias levels are determined more by alignment objectives, data curation, and post-training strategies than by parameter count. Smaller models with explicit fairness training can outperform larger models lacking such interventions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Behavioral bias evaluation via neutral probes**: FAZE measures bias through forced-choice prompts designed to be contextually symmetric, revealing model tendencies when no legitimate basis for preference exists. *Quick check*: Can you explain why a prompt stating "both options are equivalent" tests for bias rather than reasoning capability?

- **Epistemic uncertainty acknowledgment**: Low-bias models distinguish between "I cannot determine" and "I prefer X"—the former is the desired behavior under information insufficiency. *Quick check*: What response pattern indicates appropriate epistemic caution versus arbitrary commitment?

- **Binary classification trade-offs in bias measurement**: FAZE collapses responses into Unknown/Non-Unknown, prioritizing interpretability over nuance; understanding this simplification is critical for correct score interpretation. *Quick check*: What types of bias expression might a binary classification scheme miss?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Prompt dataset (100 forced-choice scenarios) → Response classifier (Unknown vs Non-Unknown) → FAZE score calculator (formula) → Evaluation protocol (single-run)
- **Critical path**: Design/prompts must maintain contextual neutrality → Submit prompts to target model via consistent interface → Classify each response as Unknown or Non-Unknown → Compute FAZE score and interpret
- **Design tradeoffs**: Single-run evaluation misses response variability but simulates typical user experience; binary classification sacrifices nuance for reproducibility; English-only prompts limit cross-linguistic generalizability
- **Failure signatures**: Model produces region-agnostic refusals for all prompts (may indicate over-cautious alignment); inconsistent classification between raters (suggests ambiguous response wording); scores shift dramatically across prompt rephrasings (prompt sensitivity dominates)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate FAZE on your target model with sample prompts to establish baseline score; 2) Introduce temperature sampling to assess bias pattern stability; 3) Extend prompt set with scenarios covering underrepresented regions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Do regional bias patterns persist when prompts are translated into non-English languages, and how does linguistic framing affect geographic preference tendencies? (All prompts administered in English only; models may exhibit different bias patterns in languages associated with specific regions)

- **Open Question 2**: Which specific training data compositions, architectural choices, or alignment strategies causally reduce regional bias in LLMs? (Study identifies correlation but cannot isolate which factors drive reduced bias)

- **Open Question 3**: How stable are regional bias measurements across multiple response generations with temperature sampling? (Single-run evaluation captures only first-response behavior; stochasticity may produce different bias manifestations)

- **Open Question 4**: What targeted debiasing interventions effectively reduce regional bias without compromising model utility? (Paper measures bias but does not test mitigation approaches)

## Limitations
- Prompt set sensitivity and coverage gaps may limit generalizability of bias measurements
- Binary classification approach sacrifices nuance and may underestimate subtle preference patterns
- Single-run evaluation misses response variability that temperature sampling would reveal
- English-only prompts restrict cross-linguistic generalizability of findings

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Substantial variation in regional bias across models (3.8-fold difference in FAZE scores) is directly supported by reported measurements
- **Medium confidence**: Regional bias being decoupled from model scale requires more rigorous validation beyond single smaller model outperforming larger ones
- **Low confidence**: Distinguishing genuine epistemic caution from superficial refusal heuristics cannot be determined with current methodology

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-annotator reliability testing on response classification to establish classification rubric robustness
2. Implement temperature sampling (3-5 runs per prompt at T=0.7) to assess response stability and determine whether bias patterns persist
3. Extend the prompt set with 20-30 additional scenarios targeting underrepresented regions to test geographic coverage gaps
