# Benefiting from Negative yet Informative Feedback by Contrasting Opposing Sequential Patterns

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.14786
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14786
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Dual-Transformer architecture with composite loss outperforms state-of-the-art by improving true-positive metrics while reducing false positives

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating negative feedback into sequential recommendation systems. The authors propose a novel approach that processes positive and negative user interaction sequences separately using two transformer encoders. A composite loss function, combining positive and negative cross-entropy with a contrastive term, is introduced to better model opposing sequential patterns. Experiments on four datasets from different domains demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of increasing true-positive metrics (Hit Rate and NDCG) while reducing the number of wrongly promoted negative items.

## Method Summary
The proposed PNFRec method processes positive and negative user interaction sequences separately using two transformer encoders with shared item embeddings. The model employs a composite loss function combining positive cross-entropy, negative cross-entropy, and a contrastive term. During inference, only the positive encoder is used on the positive sequence to generate recommendations. The approach aims to prevent the "averaging out" of opposing signals that occurs when training on mixed sequences, thereby learning more distinct sequential patterns for positive and negative feedback.

## Key Results
- The proposed method achieves improvements in ΔNDCG@10 by up to 33% compared to baselines
- PNFRec increases true-positive metrics (Hit Rate and NDCG) while reducing false positives
- The method shows consistent performance improvements across four datasets from different domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Separating positive and negative interaction sequences allows the model to learn distinct temporal patterns for likes and dislikes, preventing the "averaging out" of opposing signals that occurs when training on mixed sequences. The model creates two independent sub-sequences ($S_p$ and $S_n$) from a user's interaction history and trains two separate Transformer encoders on these sequences, isolating the learning of sequential dependencies for positive feedback from those of negative feedback.

### Mechanism 2
A composite loss function, specifically the addition of a Negative Cross-Entropy (CE) term, forces the model to actively learn to predict which items a user will dislike, directly penalizing the promotion of negative items. The loss function $L = L_{CE_p} + \alpha L_{CE_n} + \beta L_c$ includes a term ($L_{CE_n}$) that is trained to correctly predict the next item in the negative sequence, providing a strong signal for what to avoid.

### Mechanism 3
A contrastive loss term aligns the representation of a user's positive intent with desirable future items while pushing it away from items in their negative sequence, creating a clearer separation in the embedding space. The contrastive loss $L_c$ is calculated between the normalized embeddings of the predicted next positive item and all items in the corresponding user's negative sequence, helping distinguish between items the user might like and those they might dislike.

## Foundational Learning

- **Transformer Encoder for Sequential Data**: Core backbone that processes sequences of item IDs using self-attention to capture contextual relationships between items in a user's history.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why self-attention is suitable for capturing long-range dependencies in a sequence compared to RNNs?

- **Cross-Entropy Loss for Next Item Prediction**: Primary training objective that treats the next item in the sequence as the target class and trains the model to assign it the highest probability among all items.
  - Quick check question: In a recommendation system with 100,000 items, what is a common technique to make the cross-entropy calculation computationally tractable?

- **Contrastive Learning**: Key mechanism for separating positive and negative signals that involves learning representations by pulling similar items closer and pushing dissimilar items apart in the embedding space.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the temperature parameter in contrastive loss functions like InfoNCE?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input User History -> Form $S_p$ and $S_n$ -> Shared Embedding Layer -> Positional Embeddings -> Positive Encoder + Negative Encoder -> Composite Loss -> Final Loss
- **Critical path**: Input User History -> Form $S_p$ -> Positive Encoder -> Predicted Scores
- **Design tradeoffs**: The model uses a single shared embedding table for both encoders, ensuring positive and negative representations are in the same vector space essential for the contrastive loss.
- **Failure signatures**: Mode collapse if contrastive loss is too strong, imbalanced signal if $\alpha$ is too high, data sparsity issues for users with overwhelmingly positive or negative feedback
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement SASRec baseline trained on only positive sequences to establish baseline for HR@10 and NDCG@10
  2. Ablation study with PNFRec architecture using different loss combinations (only L_CEp, L_CEp + L_CEn, L_CEp + L_c, L_CEp + L_CEn + L_c)
  3. Hyperparameter sensitivity grid search for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values to find optimal balance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the PNFRec architecture be adapted to effectively generate recommendations for user histories that contain exclusively negative interactions?
- Can the boundary between positive and negative feedback in implicit datasets be learned dynamically rather than relying on fixed heuristics?
- Would utilizing the negative encoder during the inference phase improve the model's ability to filter out irrelevant items in real-time?

## Limitations
- The exact logic for splitting sequences into positive and negative sets, particularly the "median of ratings" threshold, is not fully specified and could vary across datasets
- The method relies on having explicit negative signals (e.g., low ratings, skips) and its effectiveness on datasets where negative feedback is inherently noisy or absent is not addressed
- Optimal values for hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are likely dataset-dependent without a robust method for selecting these parameters

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core architectural design (dual Transformer encoders) and composite loss function combining positive and negative cross-entropy with contrastive term are clearly described and logically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: Experimental results are promising but lack extensive ablation studies to fully isolate component contributions, and the claim about preventing "averaging out" would benefit from more direct evidence

## Next Checks
1. Implement ablation study on loss components by systematically training PNFRec with different combinations (only L_CEp, L_CEp + L_CEn, L_CEp + L_c, and L_CEp + L_CEn + L_c) on a chosen dataset
2. Conduct comprehensive grid search for loss weights $\alpha$ and $\beta$ over a wider range to identify optimal balance and understand model sensitivity
3. Experiment with different thresholds for defining negative feedback on ML-1M to clarify ambiguity around "median of ratings" instruction and assess impact on model performance
