# Temporal Anchoring in Deepening Embedding Spaces: Event-Indexed Projections, Drift, Convergence, and an Internal Computational Architecture

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.09693
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09690
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Introduces operator-theoretic framework for temporal anchoring in embedding spaces with convergence proofs and Manuscript Computer equivalence theorem

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a mathematical framework for temporal anchoring in embedding spaces, where drift maps are interleaved with event-indexed blocks of affine projections. The authors prove convergence theorems under specific conditions and formalize a Manuscript Computer whose computations are defined by these operators. The framework provides theoretical foundations for understanding how embedding spaces can be stabilized through intermittent projection events while allowing drift between events.

## Method Summary
The method involves modeling embedding space trajectories as sequences of operators with variable-length inter-event drift periods. The core technique uses a variable-block contraction lemma where convergence is governed by the product of Lipschitz factors tending to zero. The drift-projection convergence theorem shows that nonexpansive drift maps interleaved with affine projections onto nested affine sets guarantee convergence when these sets have a non-empty intersection. For attention layers, the authors prove softmax is 1/2-Lipschitz and derive sufficient conditions for layer-wise contraction based on head Lipschitz constants and projection subspace overlap.

## Key Results
- Proved variable-block contraction lemma with explicit uniform-gap envelopes
- Developed drift-projection convergence theorem with rigorous perturbation bounds
- Demonstrated layer-wise contraction conditions for multi-head attention
- Validated all results through Monte-Carlo sweeps confirming SLLN-based thresholds
- Established finite-run equivalence theorem for Manuscript Computer architecture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Variable-Block Contraction Lemma
- Claim: Embedding space trajectories converge when event-indexed contraction blocks are applied, even with variable-length drift periods, provided the product of Lipschitz factors tends to zero
- Mechanism: Sequence of operators (T_t) with Lipschitz moduli (τ_t) interspersed with event blocks; convergence governed by infinite product of these moduli
- Core assumption: Common fixed point z exists for all operators (T_t z = z)
- Break condition: Product of τ_t does not tend to 0 or common fixed point does not exist

### Mechanism 2: Drift-Projection Convergence Theorem
- Claim: Convergence guaranteed when nonexpansive drift maps are interleaved with affine projections onto closed, nested affine sets, provided intersection of these sets is non-empty
- Mechanism: Alternates between drift phase (Lipschitz maps) and anchoring phase (projections onto affine sets); metric projections are firmly nonexpansive
- Core assumption: Sets A_k have non-empty intersection (z ∈ ⋂_k A_k)
- Break condition: Affine anchor sets have empty intersection or drift factors are too large

### Mechanism 3: Layer-wise Contraction of Multi-Head Attention
- Claim: Multi-head attention layer can be designed as contraction in ℓ2 norm with sufficient conditions based on head Lipschitz constants, projection subspace overlap, and output matrix norm
- Mechanism: Softmax proven 1/2-Lipschitz; layer's overall Lipschitz constant bounded by norm of output map times factor from head Lipschitz constants and subspace overlap
- Core assumption: Heads modeled as compositions of projections and Lipschitz maps
- Break condition: Output matrix has large spectral norm or heads have high Lipschitz constants with significant overlap

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Firmly Nonexpansive Maps**
- Why needed here: Convergence proofs rely on metric projections onto closed affine sets being firmly nonexpansive
- Quick check question: What is the defining inequality for a firmly nonexpansive map T, and how does it differ from a standard nonexpansive map?

**Concept: Product of Lipschitz Moduli**
- Why needed here: Core convergence theorem based on rate of decay of product of Lipschitz constants over time
- Quick check question: In Drift-Projection Convergence Theorem, what is expression for block factor λ_k, and what must happen to infinite product of these factors for convergence?

**Concept: Affine Subspaces and Their Intersection**
- Why needed here: "Anchors" modeled as projections onto affine sets; existence of common point in intersection is central feasibility assumption
- Quick check question: What is primary risk mentioned in Section 11 if affine anchor sets (A_k) have empty intersection?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: State vector x_t → drift operators S_t → event times n_k → affine anchor sets A_k → projection operators P_Ak → Manuscript Computer (MC)

**Critical path**: Instantiate core simulation harness (Section 12) and implement mathematical operators (drift maps, affine projections); understand scheduling parameters (M, ρ, µ) relation to convergence condition

**Design tradeoffs**: Balance inter-event drift rate (ρ), anchoring frequency (gap M), and event contraction strength (µ); higher drift tolerated with more frequent events or stronger contraction; overlap index (Ω) for attention layers trades off head diversity against contraction stability

**Failure signatures**:
1. Divergence/Explosion: Log-distance plot shows increasing slope
2. Oscillation: State oscillates without converging if anchor sets infeasible
3. Attention Layer Instability: Expansive attention layer (Lipschitz > 1) destabilizes process

**First 3 experiments**:
1. Replicate Core Convergence/Divergence Plots: Run provided pseudocode harness with convergent/divergent parameter sets to generate staircase envelope plot
2. SLLN Threshold Sweep: Use Monte-Carlo harness to sample random gaps and drifts; plot distribution of terminal average slope to confirm SLLN threshold at 0
3. Attention Layer Contraction Test: Compute Lipschitz constants for attention heads and spectral norm of W_o; apply overlap-aware contraction test to determine if layer guaranteed contraction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can SLLN-based random scheduling criterion be extended to non-i.i.d. settings such as Markovian or adversarially perturbed schedules?
- Basis: Paper states i.i.d. assumption is restrictive and only provides adversarial counterexample
- Why unresolved: Real-world drift patterns may exhibit temporal dependencies or strategic adaptation
- What evidence would resolve it: Extension with weaker dependence assumptions or empirical demonstration E[Y1] < 0 threshold remains valid under Markovian drift

**Open Question 2**: Are layer-contraction conditions for multi-head attention tight, or can they be relaxed while preserving convergence guarantees?
- Basis: Paper provides sufficient conditions but does not establish necessity; overlap index characterization in trained transformers unexplored
- Why unresolved: Bounds may be conservative; actual trained attention layers might remain contractive even when conditions violated
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical evaluation across trained transformer layers, correlation with measured Lipschitz constants, identification of counterexamples where bounds are loose

**Open Question 3**: Can MC abstraction be extended to infinite or unbounded computations while preserving perturbation bounds?
- Basis: Theorem 9.4 applies to finite runs and authors explicitly state "not a universality claim"
- Why unresolved: Framework requires ∏k τnk → 0 and Σk δnk < ∞, forcing decaying Lipschitz moduli or bounded execution length
- What evidence would resolve it: Construction showing specific infinite schedules preserve variation-of-constants bound, or proof no such extension possible without additional structural assumptions

**Open Question 4**: What are necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence when anchor sets do not have common fixed point?
- Basis: Theorem 5.2 requires ⋂k Ak ≠ ∅ as key assumption; mitigation section notes guarantees fail otherwise
- Why unresolved: In practice, anchor constraints may conflict yet system might still exhibit stable behavior
- What evidence would resolve it: Characterization of limit sets when ⋂k Ak = ∅, conditions for quasi-cycles or bounded orbits, numerical examples demonstrating structured non-convergent behavior

## Limitations

- Critical feasibility assumption: Intersection of all affine anchor sets must be non-empty for convergence guarantees
- Manuscript Computer utility and ontological convergence claims lack empirical validation beyond synthetic examples
- Empirical validation uses synthetic data only with no testing on real-world embedding systems
- Convergence framework breaks down if anchors are set incorrectly or drift causes infeasibility

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Variable-Block Contraction Lemma and proof have strong mathematical grounding with clearly stated conditions
**Medium Confidence**: Drift-Projection Convergence Theorem and Attention Layer Contraction results are well-derived but practical applicability depends on feasibility assumptions
**Low Confidence**: Manuscript Computer's practical utility and comprehensive Ontological Convergence claims are theoretically interesting but lack thorough empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. **Feasibility Stress Test**: Implement systematic sweep over anchor set configurations to empirically verify ⋂_k A_k ≠ ∅ is necessary and sufficient for convergence; generate divergence plots when anchor sets become infeasible

2. **Real-World Attention Layer Analysis**: Apply contraction analysis framework to actual multi-head attention implementations from transformer models; measure empirical Lipschitz constants and subspace overlaps, compare theoretical bounds against observed behavior

3. **Manuscript Computer Benchmark**: Implement MC architecture and run on standard sequence modeling task (language modeling or time series prediction); compare performance and convergence behavior against conventional RNN or transformer architectures under identical conditions
