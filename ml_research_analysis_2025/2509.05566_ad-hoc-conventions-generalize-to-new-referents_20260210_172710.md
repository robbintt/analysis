core_contribution: This study investigates how people generalize ad hoc naming conventions
  to new, visually similar objects. Using the KiloGram dataset of abstract tangrams,
  pairs of participants first described objects independently, then coordinated on
  names through repeated reference games, and finally described the original objects
  again.

# Ad hoc conventions generalize to new referents
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05566
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05566
- Reference count: 40
- People develop shared naming conventions that generalize to visually similar but undiscussed objects

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how ad hoc naming conventions formed through repeated reference games generalize to new objects. Using the KiloGram dataset of abstract tangrams, pairs of participants described objects independently, coordinated on names through repeated reference games, and then described the original objects again. Results showed that partners developed shared conventions, becoming more accurate, efficient, and semantically aligned. Critically, this alignment generalized to undiscussed objects within the same visual threads, with generalization strength decreasing nonlinearly with visual similarity (consistent with Shepard's law). Nameability affected baseline alignment but not the degree of generalization. These findings demonstrate that ad hoc conventions reflect conceptual alignment rather than arbitrary rigid designators, with implications for theories of reference and adaptive AI systems.

## Method Summary
Participants played repeated reference games using abstract tangrams from the KiloGram dataset. In the initial phase, participants described objects independently. They then engaged in coordination games where one partner requested an object and the other selected from alternatives based on the description. This cycle repeated with feedback and opportunities to update descriptions. After coordination, participants described the original objects again. The study tracked changes in description accuracy, efficiency, and semantic similarity between partners, as well as how these patterns generalized to undiscussed objects within the same visual threads.

## Key Results
- Partners developed shared conventions through repeated reference games, showing increased accuracy, efficiency, and semantic alignment
- Conventions generalized to undiscussed objects within the same visual threads, with generalization decreasing nonlinearly as visual similarity decreased
- Nameability affected baseline alignment between participants but not the degree to which conventions generalized across visual threads

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying ad hoc convention formation and generalization appears to involve iterative coordination and feedback between communication partners. As participants repeatedly describe and identify objects, they implicitly negotiate shared meanings and develop efficient reference schemes. This process appears to create conceptual alignment that extends beyond the specific objects discussed to visually similar but undiscussed items. The nonlinear decrease in generalization with visual similarity suggests that the alignment reflects graded conceptual similarity rather than rigid categorical boundaries.

## Foundational Learning
1. Shepard's law of generalization - why needed: explains the nonlinear relationship between similarity and generalization; quick check: does the generalization curve follow an exponential decay pattern?
2. Ad hoc convention formation - why needed: understanding how temporary communication protocols emerge; quick check: do conventions persist after interaction ends?
3. Semantic alignment measurement - why needed: quantifying how communication partners converge on shared meanings; quick check: can we detect alignment without explicit agreement?
4. Reference game methodology - why needed: provides controlled environment for studying communication; quick check: does the game structure capture natural communication patterns?
5. Visual thread organization - why needed: creates controlled similarity gradients for testing generalization; quick check: are the threads capturing perceptually meaningful groupings?
6. Nameability concept - why needed: explains baseline differences in how easily objects can be described; quick check: does nameability correlate with other object properties?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Participants -> Independent description phase -> Coordination games -> Description update -> Generalization testing -> Data analysis

Critical path: Independent description → Coordination games (repeated reference games with feedback) → Description update → Generalization measurement

Design tradeoffs: Controlled abstract stimuli provide clean similarity measures but may not generalize to naturalistic categories; dyadic interaction captures basic coordination but misses multi-party dynamics; single round of coordination limits understanding of longer-term convention evolution

Failure signatures: If no convergence occurs during coordination games, the methodology may not capture convention formation; if generalization doesn't follow similarity gradients, the conceptual alignment hypothesis may be incorrect; if nameability effects appear during generalization, the distinction between baseline alignment and generalization may be invalid

First experiments:
1. Test generalization patterns with naturalistic images instead of abstract tangrams
2. Examine whether extended interaction across multiple coordination rounds strengthens or weakens generalization
3. Investigate whether similar patterns emerge in three or more participant communication settings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Major uncertainties remain regarding the generality of these findings. The study relies on a single dataset of abstract tangrams, which may not generalize to more naturalistic or complex visual categories. The communication task involves only dyads, limiting conclusions about multi-party convention formation. Additionally, the focus on visual similarity within pre-defined "threads" constrains our understanding of how conventions might develop across more diverse object sets. The study measures generalization only after one round of reference games, leaving open questions about whether continued interaction would strengthen or weaken cross-thread generalization.

## Limitations
- Single dataset of abstract tangrams may not generalize to naturalistic visual categories
- Only dyadic communication limits understanding of multi-party convention formation
- Pre-defined visual threads constrain understanding of cross-category convention development
- Single round of coordination games leaves open questions about longer-term effects

## Confidence
High: The core finding that partners develop shared conventions through repeated reference games is well-supported by the convergence data. The demonstration that this alignment generalizes to new referents within visual threads is also robust, with clear evidence of decreased generalization as visual similarity decreases (Shepard's law).

Medium: The interpretation that ad hoc conventions reflect conceptual alignment rather than arbitrary rigid designators is plausible but not definitively proven by these data alone. While the generalization patterns support this view, alternative explanations cannot be fully ruled out.

Low: The implications for adaptive AI systems and reference theories, while intriguing, extend beyond the empirical scope of the study and would require additional investigation to validate.

## Next Checks
1. Test whether the same generalization patterns emerge with naturalistic images (e.g., ImageNet categories) rather than abstract tangrams
2. Examine whether these effects persist and evolve with extended interaction across multiple rounds of reference games
3. Investigate whether similar patterns emerge in multi-party communication settings beyond the dyadic structure used here
