## Executive Summary
YETI is a multimodal AI agent framework designed to proactively intervene in augmented reality tasks without user prompts. The system uses lightweight features—SSIM-based frame filtering and object count alignment signals from a vision-language model—to detect when intervention is needed. By reducing computational overhead compared to full sensor fusion, YETI enables real-time, on-device intervention detection. Experiments on the HoloAssist dataset demonstrate that YETI achieves strong performance on assembly, cooking, and repair tasks while using 6500x less memory than traditional approaches.

## Method Summary
YETI processes egocentric video frames at 1 FPS, filtering out redundant frames using SSIM and computing object counts via PaliGemma-3b-mix-448. An alignment signal (ΔC) captures changes in object counts between frames, and local extrema in this signal are used to trigger intervention logic. The system employs two variants—Global and Local YETI—that differ in how they set thresholds for intervention detection. The pipeline is evaluated on the HoloAssist dataset using precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy metrics, with ground-truth intervention labels within a ±5-second window.

## Key Results
- Global YETI achieves 80.4% precision, 65.1% recall, and 71.9% F1-score on the HoloAssist test set.
- Local YETI variant improves recall (81.6%) but lowers precision (63.1%) compared to Global YETI.
- YETI’s SSIM + object count features require 6500x less memory than full sensor fusion baselines.
- Best performance on "Correct Mistake" task: 11.68% precision, 84.26% recall, 20.48% F1-score.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Frame similarity filtering reduces redundant scene information.
- Mechanism: SSIM measures structural similarity between consecutive frames; high SSIM values (static scenes) are filtered out, allowing the system to focus computational resources on frames with meaningful changes where intervention is more likely needed.
- Core assumption: Significant state changes in a procedural task correlate with moments where proactive intervention (e.g., correction or confirmation) is valuable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "learns scene understanding signals based on interpretable notions of Structural Similarity (SSIM) on consecutive video frames"
  - [section 3.4]: "filter out frames with SSIM values exceeding a threshold τ, effectively removing redundant temporal information"
  - [corpus]: Corpus signals are weak or missing for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If scene changes are frequent but not indicative of task state (high visual noise), SSIM filtering may prune useful frames.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Changes in object counts can signal intervention opportunities.
- Mechanism: A VLM (PaliGemma) counts objects in each frame; the change in count (ΔC) between frames forms an "alignment signal" used to identify moments when user activity aligns with expected task steps. Local extrema in this signal trigger intervention logic.
- Core assumption: Users pause or alter their interactions with objects during key decision or action points, which correspond to moments suitable for intervention.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "alignment signal which the AI Agent can learn to identify if the video frames corresponding to the user's actions on the task are consistent with expected actions"
  - [section 3.3]: "if a user agent is being guided... they will not be moving objects around while they process the instructions. Rather, they will be listening"
  - [corpus]: Corpus signals are weak or missing for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If object counts change due to extraneous factors (lighting, occlusion) unrelated to task progress, the signal will produce false positives.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Lightweight, interpretable signals enable real-time proactive intervention on edge devices.
- Mechanism: Instead of heavy sensor fusion (depth, pose, IMU), YETI uses SSIM and object count alignment as primary features. These are orders of magnitude smaller, allowing an on-device agent to detect and act on intervention opportunities with lower latency.
- Core assumption: Proactive intervention timing is more sensitive to scene state and object dynamics than to fine-grained body pose or depth cues.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "determine when it should proactively intervene"
  - [section 1, Table 1]: "features that take 6500 times less memory, as seen in Table 1"
  - [corpus]: Sensible Agent framework discusses proactive AR agents but focuses on unobtrusive interaction; PROPER benchmark focuses on knowledge gap navigation, not lightweight real-time signals. No direct corpus support for this efficiency claim.
- Break condition: If tasks require precise spatial reasoning (e.g., alignment tasks), SSIM and object counts may be insufficient for timely intervention.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Egocentric Vision**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how tasks look from a first-person view is critical to interpreting the visual input to YETI.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why an object-counting model might behave differently on first-person video compared to third-person video?

- Concept: **Proactive vs. Reactive Agents**
  - Why needed here: The entire premise of YETI is moving from user-prompted (reactive) to agent-initiated (proactive) assistance.
  - Quick check question: What is one key difference in system design required for a proactive agent compared to a standard voice assistant?

- Concept: **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure)**
  - Why needed here: SSIM is a core technical component of the YETI algorithm. Understanding its strengths and weaknesses is necessary for tuning.
  - Quick check question: If a user is in a dimly lit room, how might this affect SSIM calculations between frames?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Frame extraction -> VLM object counting -> SSIM computation -> Alignment signal computation (ΔC) -> Logic core (thresholding, episode management) -> Intervention decision.
- Critical path: Frame extraction -> VLM object counting -> SSIM computation -> Alignment signal computation (ΔC) -> Logic core (thresholding, episode management) -> Intervention decision.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Precision vs. Recall: The `Local` YETI variant has higher precision but lower recall than the `Global` variant. Choose based on whether it's worse to miss an intervention or to provide an unnecessary one.
  - Sensitivity vs. Noise: The extrema range `r` and SSIM threshold `τ` control sensitivity. Wider ranges/higher thresholds increase detections but may increase false positives due to noise.
  - Latency vs. History: The episode interval `k` requires accumulating frames before making a decision. Larger `k` may improve decision quality but introduces initial latency.
- Failure signatures:
  - High False Positives: Agent intervenes too often, disrupting the user. Likely caused by a low SSIM threshold or wide extrema range.
  - Missed Interventions: Agent fails to intervene when needed. Likely caused by a high SSIM threshold, narrow extrema range, or the `Local` variant missing global context.
  - Slow Response: High latency between an event and intervention. May be due to a large episode interval `k` or compute bottlenecks in the VLM.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Establish a baseline on a subset of the HoloAssist dataset using the default hyperparameters from Table 3 (τ=0.9, m=1, r=±1, k=5) to verify pipeline functionality and reproduce reported F1 scores.
  2. Perform a parameter sweep on the SSIM threshold (τ) from 0.5 to 0.95 to find the optimal tradeoff between precision and recall for a specific target task (e.g., assembly vs. cooking).
  3. Compare `Global` vs. `Local` YETI variants on a held-out test set, measuring not only F1 score but also average latency per intervention, to quantify the performance-efficiency tradeoff.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the integration of richer sensory data (hand pose, eye gaze, depth) significantly improve the precision of proactive interventions without compromising the YETI algorithm's computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they aim to "enhance YETI’s intervention capabilities by incorporating richer sensory data" to provide a more comprehensive understanding of user context.
- Why unresolved: The current YETI framework relies on lightweight features (SSIM and object count) specifically to reduce overhead, and it is unclear if adding complex modalities negates this efficiency advantage.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis on the HoloAssist benchmark showing precision/recall improvements using the extended feature set while measuring on-device latency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can adaptive learning mechanisms based on user feedback successfully reduce false positive interventions in YETI?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose to "explore adaptive learning mechanisms that allow the AI agent to continuously refine its intervention strategies based on user feedback."
- Why unresolved: The current results show high recall but lower precision (e.g., 11.68% precision for "Correct Mistake"), suggesting the agent interrupts too frequently; it is unknown if feedback loops can correct this without manual parameter tuning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal user studies demonstrating an increase in precision and user satisfaction scores as the agent adapts to specific user behaviors over time.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the YETI framework generalizable to Vision-Language Models (VLMs) other than PaliGemma for generating alignment signals?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note they "plan to evaluate YETI’s performance across a broader spectrum of VLMs to assess its generalizability."
- Why unresolved: The current methodology relies on PaliGemma's specific output distribution for object counting prompts; different model architectures might produce misaligned count estimates or inconsistent signals.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark results running the YETI algorithm with alternative VLMs (e.g., LLaVA, GPT-4o) on the HoloAssist dataset to verify if performance metrics are maintained.

## Limitations
- The "local extrema range" update logic in Algorithm 1 is underspecified, which could impact reproducibility of intervention detection.
- The 6500x memory reduction claim compared to full sensor fusion lacks corpus support and detailed methodology.
- Baseline comparison configurations (e.g., random forest/MLP parameters) are not fully specified, limiting direct reproducibility.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The overall architecture (SSIM filtering + VLM object counting + rule-based intervention logic) is technically sound and well-defined. The evaluation methodology (precision, recall, F-measure with ±5s tolerance) is standard and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific implementation details of the YETI algorithm, particularly the "local extrema range" management and conversation interval enforcement, are described but lack complete clarity for exact replication.
- **Low Confidence**: The efficiency claims (6500x memory reduction) and the specific random forest/MLP baseline configurations are not sufficiently detailed or supported by corpus evidence.

## Next Checks
1. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary SSIM threshold (τ) and extrema range (r) to quantify their impact on precision-recall tradeoff, and determine if the chosen defaults (τ=0.9, r=±1) are optimal or task-dependent.
2. **Algorithm Logic Clarification**: Implement and test both hypothesized interpretations of the "local extrema range" update logic to determine which matches the reported F1 scores, and document the exact sequence of frame filtering, extremum detection, and threshold application.
3. **Efficiency Benchmarking**: Measure actual memory usage and inference latency of YETI's SSIM + object count pipeline versus a full sensor fusion baseline on the same hardware to verify the claimed 6500x reduction and identify the dominant cost factors.
