- Key outcome: Introduces Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), applying BERT-style self-supervised learning to oversampled complex baseband signals for symbol recovery under impulsive noise

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), a self-supervised framework that applies BERT-style training to oversampled complex baseband signals. MSM treats inter-symbol contribution from pulse shaping as contextual information: it masks a random subset of symbols and trains a Transformer to predict their identifiers from surrounding samples. The method is demonstrated on symbol recovery under Middleton Class-A impulsive noise, where the model infers corrupted symbols using learned waveform context.

For non-impaired signals, the model achieves high symbol error rates across diverse modulations (BPSK, QPSK, PSK8/16, QAM4/16/64/256). Under impulsive noise, it successfully recovers masked symbols with performance remaining stable across SNR ranges, as the masking isolates impulsive interference. The work suggests that Transformers can interpret waveform structure beyond simple detection, enabling context-aware receivers for challenging communication channels.

## Method Summary
MSM treats inter-symbol contribution from pulse shaping as contextual information: it masks a random subset of symbols and trains a Transformer to predict their identifiers from surrounding samples. The method is demonstrated on symbol recovery under Middleton Class-A impulsive noise, where the model infers corrupted symbols using learned waveform context. For non-impaired signals, the model achieves high symbol error rates across diverse modulations (BPSK, QPSK, PSK8/16, QAM4/16/64/256). Under impulsive noise, it successfully recovers masked symbols with performance remaining stable across SNR ranges, as the masking isolates impulsive interference.

## Key Results
- MSM achieves high symbol error rates across diverse modulations (BPSK, QPSK, PSK8/16, QAM4/16/64/256) for non-impaired signals
- Under impulsive noise, MSM successfully recovers masked symbols with stable performance across SNR ranges
- The masking strategy effectively isolates impulsive interference, enabling context-aware symbol recovery

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MSM leverages the Transformer's attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies in oversampled signals. By masking symbols and training the model to predict them from context, MSM learns the waveform structure and inter-symbol relationships introduced by pulse shaping. This allows the model to infer corrupted symbols based on surrounding signal patterns rather than simple threshold detection, making it robust to impulsive noise that would overwhelm traditional receivers.

## Foundational Learning
- **Middleton Class-A Noise Model**: Mathematical framework for impulsive interference in communication channels; needed to simulate realistic noise environments; quick check: verify noise parameters (A, Г) match target scenarios
- **Oversampling in Digital Communications**: Sampling at rates above Nyquist to capture pulse shaping effects; needed to provide context for symbol recovery; quick check: confirm sampling rate supports pulse shape resolution
- **Transformer Attention Mechanism**: Self-attention layers that capture dependencies between signal samples; needed to learn contextual relationships; quick check: validate attention patterns on known waveforms

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Baseband Signal -> Oversampler -> Masked Symbol Modeling -> Transformer Encoder -> Symbol Prediction
**Critical Path**: Oversampled signal → Masking → Transformer encoding → Symbol identification
**Design Tradeoffs**: Oversampling increases context but computational load; masking ratio affects learning difficulty and noise robustness
**Failure Signatures**: Poor symbol recovery indicates insufficient context from undersampling or inadequate masking strategy
**First Experiments**: 1) Train without masking to establish baseline; 2) Vary oversampling rate to find optimal context; 3) Test different masking ratios for noise robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on synthetic Middleton Class-A noise models, which may not fully capture real-world impulsive interference characteristics
- Performance under practical channel impairments like multipath propagation, carrier frequency offsets, and timing synchronization errors is not evaluated
- The method requires oversampling, which increases computational complexity and bandwidth requirements

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Transformer's ability to learn waveform context from oversampled samples, symbol recovery performance on synthetic data under known conditions
- **Medium confidence**: Generalization to real-world impulsive noise environments, robustness to channel impairments beyond AWGN and Middleton noise
- **Low confidence**: Computational efficiency for real-time implementation, scalability to long sequences, performance with unknown or time-varying pulse shaping

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MSM performance on over-the-air captured signals with real impulsive noise rather than synthetic Middleton Class-A models
2. Test robustness to practical impairments including multipath channels (ITU channel models), carrier frequency offsets, and symbol timing errors
3. Benchmark computational latency and resource requirements against conventional matched-filter based receivers for real-time feasibility assessment
