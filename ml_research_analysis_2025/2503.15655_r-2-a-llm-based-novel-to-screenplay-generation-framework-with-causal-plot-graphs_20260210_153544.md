# R$^2$: A LLM Based Novel-to-Screenplay Generation Framework with Causal Plot Graphs
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.15655
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15655
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Outperforms three existing approaches with 51.3%, 22.6%, and 57.1% absolute increases in pairwise comparison win rate

## Executive Summary
This paper presents R2, a novel LLM-based framework for automatically adapting novels into screenplays. The key challenges addressed are LLM hallucinations causing inconsistencies and the need to extract effective plot lines with complex causal relationships. R2 tackles these by proposing two techniques: hallucination-aware refinement (HAR) to iteratively identify and eliminate hallucinations, and causal plot-graph construction (CPC) to efficiently extract causality-embedded plot lines. The framework mimics the human screenplay rewriting process with Reader and Rewriter modules, using HAR and CPC to generate coherent and consistent screenplays. Experimental results demonstrate that R2 significantly outperforms three existing approaches in pairwise comparison at the overall win rate for GPT-4o.

## Method Summary
R2 is an LLM-based framework that adapts novels into screenplays through a two-stage process mimicking human rewriting. The framework uses a Reader module to extract plot elements and a Rewriter module to generate screenplay content. Two key techniques address the main challenges: HAR (Hallucination-Aware Refinement) iteratively identifies and eliminates inconsistencies through multiple LLM passes, while CPC (Causal Plot-Graph Construction) builds causal relationships between plot elements to maintain narrative coherence. The framework processes the novel in segments, constructs causal plot graphs to identify key narrative threads, and then generates screenplays that preserve these causal relationships while eliminating hallucinated content.

## Key Results
- R2 achieves 51.3% absolute increase in pairwise comparison win rate over the first baseline
- R2 achieves 22.6% absolute increase in pairwise comparison win rate over the second baseline
- R2 achieves 57.1% absolute increase in pairwise comparison win rate over the third baseline
- All improvements measured using GPT-4o as judge in pairwise comparisons

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework addresses two fundamental challenges in novel-to-screenplay adaptation: maintaining narrative consistency while avoiding LLM hallucinations, and preserving complex causal relationships between plot elements. HAR works by treating the screenplay generation as an iterative refinement process, where each pass identifies inconsistencies and hallucinations, then generates corrected versions. This mimics human editing workflows where writers revise their work multiple times. CPC constructs a graph representation of causal relationships between plot elements, allowing the system to track how events influence each other and maintain narrative coherence. By combining these approaches, R2 can generate screenplays that are both internally consistent and faithful to the source material's causal structure.

## Foundational Learning
- **LLM Hallucination**: When language models generate factually incorrect or inconsistent information. Why needed: Novel-to-screenplay adaptation requires strict adherence to source material, making hallucinations particularly problematic. Quick check: Does the output contradict established facts in the source text?
- **Causal Plot Graphs**: Graph structures representing how events in a narrative influence each other. Why needed: Screenplays require maintaining narrative coherence and logical flow between scenes. Quick check: Can you trace how each plot event follows from previous events?
- **Iterative Refinement**: The process of repeatedly improving output through multiple passes. Why needed: Single-pass generation often contains errors that compound, while iterative refinement allows for error correction. Quick check: Does performance improve with additional refinement iterations?
- **Pairwise Comparison**: Evaluation method where two outputs are compared directly to determine which is better. Why needed: Provides relative quality assessment rather than absolute scores, which is more robust for subjective creative tasks. Quick check: Is there consistent agreement among multiple judges?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Novel Text -> Reader Module -> Plot Element Extraction -> CPC (Causal Plot-Graph Construction) -> HAR (Hallucination-Aware Refinement) -> Rewriter Module -> Screenplay Output
- **Critical Path**: The Reader extracts plot elements, CPC builds causal relationships, HAR refines to eliminate hallucinations, and Rewriter generates the final screenplay
- **Design Tradeoffs**: R2 prioritizes consistency and causal coherence over raw generation speed, using multiple LLM calls per iteration in HAR at the cost of computational efficiency
- **Failure Signatures**: Hallucinations manifest as plot inconsistencies or contradictions with source material; causal relationship failures appear as logical gaps in narrative flow
- **First Experiments**: 1) Test HAR on a single novel chapter with known hallucinations, 2) Validate CPC on a simple three-event causal chain, 3) Run end-to-end on a short story with clear causal structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on pairwise comparisons using GPT-4o as judge, raising questions about objectivity
- HAR technique requires three additional LLM calls per iteration, potentially impacting computational efficiency
- CPC approach effectiveness for complex, non-linear narratives or multiple parallel plot threads not adequately addressed

## Confidence
- High confidence: General framework architecture and identification of hallucination as key challenge
- Medium confidence: Quantitative improvements over baselines, dependent on evaluation methodology validity
- Low confidence: Long-term effectiveness for very long screenplays and scalability to different literary styles

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluations with professional screenwriters to assess quality and practical utility of R2-generated screenplays
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of HAR and CPC components and assess computational overhead trade-offs
3. Test R2 on diverse novel genres and styles to evaluate generalizability beyond the experimental corpus
