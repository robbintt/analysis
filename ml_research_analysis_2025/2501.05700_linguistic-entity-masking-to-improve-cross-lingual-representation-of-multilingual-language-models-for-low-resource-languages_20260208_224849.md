# Linguistic Entity Masking to Improve Cross-Lingual Representation of Multilingual Language Models for Low-Resource Languages

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.05700
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05700
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: LEM improves cross-lingual representations for low-resource languages by masking linguistically salient tokens (NEs, nouns, verbs) during continual pre-training

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Linguistic Entity Masking (LEM), a novel masking strategy designed to improve cross-lingual representations of multilingual pre-trained language models (multiPLMs) for low-resource languages. Unlike existing masking strategies that treat all tokens equally, LEM focuses on masking single tokens within linguistic entities—named entities, nouns, and verbs—which are more prominent in defining sentence structure and semantics. The authors evaluate LEM on three downstream tasks (bitext mining, parallel data curation, and code-mixed sentiment analysis) using three low-resource language pairs: English-Sinhala, English-Tamil, and Sinhala-Tamil. Experiment results show that continually pre-training XLM-R with LEM consistently outperforms models pre-trained with standard MLM+TLM across all tasks and language pairs.

## Method Summary
The method involves two-stage continual pre-training: (1) LEM_mono on dependent monolingual data (source and target sides from parallel corpus, stacked), and (2) LEM_para on concatenated parallel sentences. LEM masks single tokens within linguistic entities (NEs, verbs, nouns) up to 15% of tokens using 80%-10%-10% corruption. NER and POS taggers identify entities before training, with sub-word level mappings stored in dictionaries. The approach uses XLM-R-base as the starting model and evaluates on bitext mining, parallel data curation via NMT, and sentiment classification.

## Key Results
- LEM consistently outperforms standard MLM+TLM pre-training across all three low-resource language pairs and tasks
- Dependent monolingual data from parallel corpora (60K sentences) outperforms independent monolingual data (100K-500K sentences) for continual pre-training
- Masking a single token within linguistic entities preserves more context than span-based approaches (91.47 average recall vs. 83.40 for 3-token masking in Sinhala-Tamil)
- LEM is robust to noisy parallel data while maintaining high performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Selective Attention to Semantically Salient Tokens
Masking linguistically prominent tokens (named entities, nouns, verbs) forces the model to learn more robust cross-lingual representations than random masking. NEs, nouns, and verbs receive higher self-attention weights and carry more syntactic/semantic load. By preferentially masking these tokens, the model must leverage both local context and cross-lingual alignment to reconstruct them, strengthening representation quality.

### Mechanism 2: Single-Token Masking Preserves Contextual Integrity
Masking exactly one token per linguistic entity preserves more usable context than span-based approaches, improving prediction accuracy. Morphologically rich languages (Sinhala, Tamil) produce long sub-word sequences. Whole-word or span masking removes large contiguous regions, severely degrading context. Single-token masking leaves surrounding entity tokens visible.

### Mechanism 3: Dependent Monolingual Data Creates Implicit Cross-Lingual Signal
Using source and target sides from parallel corpora as monolingual data (dependent) outperforms independent monolingual data for continual pre-training. Dependent data maintains implicit translation relationships even during monolingual training, priming the model for the subsequent parallel-data stage.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
  - Why needed here: LEM modifies the standard MLM objective; you must understand baseline random masking (15% of tokens, 80/10/10 corruption) to reason about the changes.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why 80% mask replacement, 10% random token, 10% unchanged is standard practice?

- **Concept**: Translation Language Modeling (TLM)
  - Why needed here: The paper's LEM_para extends TLM by applying entity-aware masking to concatenated parallel sentences.
  - Quick check question: How does concatenating parallel sentences before masking differ from independent MLM on each sentence?

- **Concept**: Sub-word Tokenization in Morphologically Rich Languages
  - Why needed here: Sinhala/Tamil inflections produce long sub-word sequences, which motivated the single-token masking design.
  - Quick check question: Why does morphological richness make whole-word or span masking problematic?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: NER + POS taggers → entity dictionary → LEM_mono training → LEM_para training → downstream evaluation
- **Critical path**: 1) Obtain/clean monolingual and parallel data, 2) Run NER and POS tagging to identify NEs/nouns/verbs, 3) Pre-compute entity dictionaries (sub-word level mapping), 4) LEM_mono training (60 epochs, early stopping), 5) LEM_para training (60 epochs, early stopping), 6) Evaluate on bitext mining / parallel curation / sentiment
- **Design tradeoffs**: NER/POS accuracy vs. training time (pre-computing dictionaries shifts compute cost to pre-processing), entity type selection (NEs alone performed best for Sinhala-Tamil; verbs alone for English-Sinhala), data quality vs. quantity (dependent data outperformed independent despite smaller size)
- **Failure signatures**: NER/POS errors reduce LEM effectiveness, using independent monolingual data for LEM_mono degrades cross-lingual alignment, masking >2 tokens per entity causes performance drop
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate LEM_mono + LEM_para for one language pair using provided hyperparameters, 2) Ablate entity types (NEs only, verbs only, nouns only) to identify optimal combination, 3) Compare dependent vs. independent monolingual data with your own corpora

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can the LEM strategy be effectively scaled to continually pre-train a single multilingual model for multiple languages simultaneously, rather than creating specialized encoders for specific language pairs?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state in Section 8: "As future work, we will continually pre-train a single multilingual model for multiple languages using the LEM strategy. This is in contrast to the current approach which yields specialized encoders for each language pair."
- **Why unresolved**: The current study validates the approach only on pairwise continual pre-training and has not tested the feasibility or performance retention of a unified global model.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Evaluation of an XLM-R model continually pre-trained with LEM on a diverse, multi-language corpus, measuring its performance on bitext mining and sentiment tasks against the pair-specific models.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How does the LEM strategy perform across a broader linguistic spectrum, specifically regarding diverse language families?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors note in Section 8: "Thirdly, we will investigate the impact of the LEM strategy on language families, examining its effectiveness across a broader linguistic spectrum."
- **Why unresolved**: The current experiments are limited to English (Indo-European), Sinhala (Indo-Aryan), and Tamil (Dravidian), leaving the generalizability to other morphological structures unproven.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Application of LEM to languages from diverse families (e.g., Austronesian or Altaic) to determine if the focus on single-token linguistic entities remains beneficial for morphologically distinct languages.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: To what extent does the performance of LEM depend on the accuracy of the underlying Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging tools?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] Section 8 highlights a limitation where "The LEM strategy is very much driven by the accuracy of the underlying tools," noting that sub-optimal performance and errors in Sinhala and Tamil taggers may affect final results.
- **Why unresolved**: It is unclear if the reported gains are near the theoretical ceiling for this method or if they would significantly increase with perfect linguistic annotations.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An ablation study comparing model performance when using "gold-standard" manual annotations versus the current automatic taggers.

## Limitations

- **Language Scope Limitation**: LEM was validated exclusively on three low-resource Indo-Aryan languages, limiting generalizability to other language families and structures.
- **NER Model Dependency**: LEM's effectiveness depends on accurate named entity recognition, but the paper uses an in-house multilingual NER model without releasing code or providing performance metrics.
- **Downstream Task Generalization**: While LEM shows consistent improvements across three tasks, the evaluation framework is limited to these specific tasks without investigating other cross-lingual applications.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- LEM's masking strategy improves cross-lingual representations over standard MLM+TLM for evaluated low-resource language pairs
- Single-token masking within linguistic entities preserves more context than span-based approaches
- Dependent monolingual data from parallel corpora outperforms independent monolingual data for continual pre-training

**Medium Confidence**:
- LEM's effectiveness stems from forcing the model to learn cross-lingual representations for semantically salient tokens
- The optimal entity combination varies by language pair (NEs for Sinhala-Tamil, verbs for English-Sinhala)
- LEM is robust to noisy parallel data while maintaining high performance

**Low Confidence**:
- Attention patterns directly correlate with linguistic importance for downstream tasks
- The 80-10-10 corruption ratio is optimal for entity-aware masking
- LEM's benefits would scale proportionally with larger monolingual corpora

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Lingual Generalization Test**: Evaluate LEM on a different language family (e.g., Turkic or Niger-Congo) to verify whether entity-prioritized masking generalizes beyond Indo-Aryan languages.

2. **NER Quality Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary NER accuracy by using different NER models (spaCy, HuggingFace, Stanza) for the same language pairs to measure how LEM's downstream performance correlates with NER precision/recall.

3. **Scaling Study with Independent Monolingual Data**: Replicate the dependent vs. independent data comparison using a much larger independent monolingual corpus (500K-1M sentences) to test whether alignment matters more than scale when independent data quality and quantity are substantially increased.
