# Community detection robustness of graph neural networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24662
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24662
- Reference count: 0
- This paper systematically evaluates GNN robustness for community detection across perturbation types using ECS metric

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates the robustness of six graph neural network architectures for community detection under various perturbations including node attribute manipulations, edge topology distortions, and adversarial attacks. Using element-centric similarity (ECS) as the evaluation metric, the research compares supervised GNNs (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE) with unsupervised methods (DiffPool, MinCut, DMoN) on synthetic LFR benchmarks and real-world citation networks. Results show that while supervised GNNs achieve higher baseline accuracy, they demonstrate reduced robustness under targeted and adversarial perturbations. DMoN, with its modularity-based objective, exhibits the strongest resilience across perturbation scenarios, particularly when community structure is well-defined.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates six GNN architectures on community detection tasks under perturbations. Models include three supervised (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE) and three unsupervised (DiffPool, MinCut, DMoN) approaches. The evaluation uses synthetic LFR graphs with 1000 nodes and mixing parameters μ∈[0.1,0.5], plus real-world Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed citation networks. Perturbations include location/scale shifts on node attributes, random/betweenness-based edge deletions, and adversarial attacks (Nettack/Metattack). Performance is measured using Element-Centric Similarity (ECS) between predicted and ground truth communities. Models are trained with specified hyperparameters (e.g., GCN: LR=0.01, 2 layers, 32 hidden units) and evaluated across 50 independent realizations.

## Key Results
- Supervised GNNs achieve higher baseline accuracy but show reduced robustness under targeted and adversarial perturbations
- DMoN's modularity-based optimization provides stronger resilience across perturbation scenarios compared to supervised methods
- Community strength (mixing parameter μ) significantly influences robustness, with stronger communities reducing performance loss
- Node attribute perturbations, especially location shifts and targeted edge deletions, cause the largest degradation in community recovery performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Unsupervised modularity-based objectives (DMoN) can provide greater robustness to perturbations than supervised GNNs in community detection tasks.
- Mechanism: Supervised methods learn decision boundaries tightly coupled to training data distributions. When perturbations alter these distributions, learned boundaries misclassify communities. Unsupervised modularity maximization optimizes a global graph-theoretic objective that is less sensitive to small perturbations because it aggregates information at the community level, reducing the impact of localized noise.
- Core assumption: The global modularity score is sufficiently stable under tested perturbation regimes that optimizing for it yields more consistent community partitions than relying on fine-grained feature-structure couplings learned via supervised training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "supervised GNNs tend to achieve higher baseline accuracy, while unsupervised methods, particularly DMoN, maintain stronger resilience under targeted and adversarial perturbations."
  - [section III B 3 / Results and Discussion] "DMoN's modularity-based optimization that considers global network structure rather than local feature patterns, provides a grounded justification for its robustness"
  - [corpus] Corpus papers discuss GNN robustness generally but do not provide empirical evidence specific to community detection and the modularity objective.
- Break condition: This mechanism may fail if perturbations are designed to specifically maximize disruption of the modularity score itself, or if the graph's inherent community structure is extremely weak.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Stronger community structure (low mixing parameter μ) provides a protective effect against various perturbation types for all GNN architectures.
- Mechanism: Lower μ means more edges are within communities, creating denser, more distinct clusters. When communities are strong, the signal from dense intra-community edges and coherent attributes is high, maintaining a strong signal-to-noise ratio longer compared to graphs with weak communities where the signal is already weak and easily overwhelmed.
- Core assumption: The LFR benchmark's definition of community strength via the mixing parameter μ is a reliable proxy for the inherent difficulty of the community detection task and the resilience of the structure to noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "robustness appears to be strongly influenced by community strength, with well-defined communities reducing performance loss."
  - [section III A 1 / Results and Discussion - GCN] "Networks with stronger community structure (μ=0.1, μ=0.2) maintain ECS scores above 0.4 even at the highest perturbation levels, while networks with weaker communities (μ=0.4, μ=0.5) deteriorate rapidly, falling below 0.2."
  - [corpus] The provided corpus excerpts do not explicitly discuss the role of community strength as a mitigating factor for robustness.
- Break condition: The protective effect of strong communities diminishes as perturbation intensity reaches extreme levels that fundamentally destroy the dense intra-community connectivity.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Node attribute perturbations involving location shifts cause larger performance degradation in community recovery than scale shifts or structural edge deletions, particularly for supervised models.
- Mechanism: Location shifts directly change the geometric relationships between node features in the embedding space. Supervised GNNs and attention mechanisms rely heavily on these relative feature positions to compute attention weights or learn classification boundaries. A shift in location disrupts the learned feature space geometry, causing a cascade of errors in the message-passing process.
- Core assumption: The specific way location shifts are implemented in the paper accurately simulates a fundamental disruption to feature-space geometry that is more damaging than other tested perturbation types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "node attribute perturbations associated with targeted edge deletions and shift in attribute distributions tend to cause the largest degradation in community recovery."
  - [section V / Table V] "Mean perturbations consistently cause the largest stepwise differences across all architectures (ranging from 5.3% for DiffPool to 13.8% for GCN), indicating that causing a shift in location of distribution of node attributes can be adversarial towards community recovery."
  - [corpus] Corpus papers study attacks on node features but do not explicitly rank location vs. scale shifts in the context of community detection.
- Break condition: This mechanism is specific to the models and perturbation types tested. A GNN architecture explicitly designed to be invariant to feature translations would not exhibit this vulnerability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Modularity Optimization in Community Detection**
  - Why needed here: This is the core objective function of the most robust model (DMoN). Understanding it is crucial to grasp why an unsupervised approach can outperform supervised ones in robustness.
  - Quick check question: If you were designing an attack specifically to defeat a modularity-optimizing GNN, what property of the graph's edge structure would you try to manipulate?

- **Message Passing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates six GNN architectures, and their sensitivity to perturbations is fundamentally linked to how they aggregate information via message passing. Robustness differences arise from variations in this mechanism.
  - Quick check question: Why does the message-passing mechanism make GNNs vulnerable to small perturbations in either node attributes or graph edges?

- **Element-Centric Similarity (ECS)**
  - Why needed here: This is the evaluation metric used to measure community detection performance and robustness. Interpreting the results requires understanding what an ECS score represents.
  - Quick check question: Why is ECS considered a more versatile metric for comparing community partitions than metrics that only work for disjoint communities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Attributed Graph G=(V,E) with adjacency matrix A and node feature matrix X -> GNN Encoders (Supervised & Unsupervised: GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, DiffPool, MinCut, DMoN) -> Community Assignment Layer (Softmax function applied to GNN outputs to produce soft cluster assignment matrix C) -> Objective Functions (Supervised: Cross-entropy loss; Unsupervised: Modularity maximization, Normalized MinCut, Hierarchical pooling) -> Evaluation (Element-Centric Similarity between predicted partition C and ground truth partition)

- **Critical path:** Understanding the trade-off between supervised accuracy (high baseline) and unsupervised robustness (DMoN). The key is that DMoN's modularity objective provides resilience, while the supervised models' tight coupling to training data makes them brittle under distribution shift.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Accuracy vs. Robustness: Supervised models achieve higher ECS on clean data but degrade faster under perturbations. Unsupervised models have lower baseline ECS but are more robust.
  - Model Complexity vs. Robustness: GAT's attention mechanism allows learning structural weights but proves highly sensitive to perturbations that affect the feature space geometry it relies upon.
  - Objective Function Choice: The modularity-based objective is more stable to local perturbations than objectives relying on precise feature boundaries.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Rapid ECS drop under location perturbations: A strong indicator of a model over-reliant on specific feature distributions (e.g., GAT).
  - High vulnerability to targeted edge deletions: Indicates a model's performance is heavily dependent on a few high-betweenness edges (e.g., GCN).
  - Collapse under adversarial attacks (Nettack/Metattack): Models that fail to maintain community structure under these sophisticated attacks are likely overfitting to the graph's clean topology and attributes.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Benchmark Baseline Performance:** Run all six GNN models on the LFR benchmark with varying mixing parameters (μ=0.1 to 0.5) and no perturbations. Measure baseline ECS to establish the accuracy hierarchy.
  2. **Sensitivity to Location vs. Scale Perturbations:** Implement the paper's attribute perturbation strategy (adding Gaussian noise with varying location and fixed scale, and vice-versa). Compare the ECS degradation curves for a supervised model (e.g., GAT) and an unsupervised model (DMoN) to confirm the differential impact of location shifts.
  3. **Adversarial Attack Resilience:** Apply Nettack and Metattack to the citation networks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed). Evaluate the ECS scores for GCN and DMoN to observe the robustness gap highlighted in the paper's conclusion.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do neural scaling laws apply to GNN-based community detection, and how do model size and training data volume correlate with perturbation resistance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that investigating neural scaling laws is "essential for designing new robust models" as this area remains largely unexplored for graph learning.
- Why unresolved: The current study evaluates fixed-size architectures and does not vary model complexity or data volume to observe scaling effects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results plotting community detection performance and robustness metrics against increasing parameter counts and dataset sizes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can hyperbolic embeddings enhance the robustness of GNNs for community detection compared to standard Euclidean approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that "looking at GNNs through the lens of hyperbolic embeddings" may be an attractive path to shed light on sustaining uncertainties and perturbations.
- Why unresolved: All experiments in the study utilized standard GNN architectures operating in Euclidean space; no hyperbolic layers or geometries were tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of community detection performance on perturbed graphs using GNNs with hyperbolic convolution layers versus standard GCN/GAT baselines.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific theoretical properties of modularity-based objectives confer greater robustness to adversarial attacks compared to spectral or supervised losses?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper empirically demonstrates that DMoN (modularity-based) is more robust than MinCut (spectral) or supervised methods, it only hypothesizes that this is due to the consideration of "global network structure" without formal proof.
- Why unresolved: The study is a systematic computational evaluation; it does not include a theoretical analysis of the loss landscapes or curvature properties that might explain DMoN's superior stability.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical derivation of the perturbation bounds for modularity maximization versus cross-entropy or normalized cut losses, supported by ablation studies isolating the loss function from the architecture.

## Limitations
- The paper does not specify adversarial attack budgets for Nettack and Metattack, which could significantly affect observed robustness differences
- Real-world dataset preprocessing specifics are not fully disclosed, limiting reproducibility
- The study focuses on static graphs and does not address dynamic or temporal robustness

## Confidence
- Confidence in the claim that DMoN's modularity-based optimization provides superior robustness: High
- Confidence in the protective effect of strong communities (low μ): Medium
- Confidence in the differential impact of location vs. scale attribute perturbations: Low-Medium

## Next Checks
1. Verify ECS baseline scores on clean data to establish the expected accuracy hierarchy before perturbation analysis
2. Test DMoN against a modularity-targeted adversarial attack to validate the robustness of the modularity objective itself
3. Apply location and scale perturbations to a GNN architecture explicitly designed for feature translation invariance to test if the observed vulnerability is universal
