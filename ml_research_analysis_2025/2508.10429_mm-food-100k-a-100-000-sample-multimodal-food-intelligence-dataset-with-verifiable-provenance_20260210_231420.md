core_contribution: This work introduces MM-Food-100K, a high-quality multimodal food
  intelligence dataset with verifiable provenance and royalty-based contributor rewards.
  Built from a 1.2M corpus via community sourcing and AI-assisted QA, it pairs images
  with structured annotations (dish, ingredients, nutrition, portion) across Packaged,
  Chain, and Homemade/Street sources.

# MM-Food-100K: A 100,000-Sample Multimodal Food Intelligence Dataset with Verifiable Provenance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.10429
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10429
- Reference count: 28
- Introduces a 100K-sample multimodal food dataset with verifiable provenance and contributor rewards

## Executive Summary
MM-Food-100K is a high-quality multimodal food intelligence dataset containing 100,000 samples with verifiable provenance and royalty-based contributor rewards. The dataset was constructed from a 1.2M corpus through community sourcing and AI-assisted quality assurance, pairing images with structured annotations across dish, ingredients, nutrition, and portion data. The Codatta protocol enables wallet-linked provenance tracking and revenue sharing based on usage. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned models consistently outperform out-of-box baselines for food classification and calorie prediction tasks.

## Method Summary
The dataset was built by filtering a 1.2M-image corpus to 100K high-quality samples using community sourcing and AI-assisted quality assurance. Images were paired with structured annotations covering dish names, ingredients, nutritional information, and portion sizes across three sources: packaged foods, chain restaurants, and homemade/street foods. The Codatta protocol provides wallet-linked provenance tracking and implements a revenue-sharing mechanism where contributors earn royalties based on dataset usage. The construction methodology emphasizes data quality through human-in-the-loop verification and AI-powered annotation validation.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned models consistently outperform out-of-box baselines on food classification and calorie prediction
- Dataset covers diverse food categories across packaged, chain, and homemade/street sources
- Codatta protocol enables verifiable provenance and revenue sharing for contributors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset addresses the dual-market failure in food data acquisition by combining community sourcing with AI-assisted quality control. The verifiable provenance system creates accountability and trust, while the revenue-sharing mechanism provides economic incentives for contributors. The multimodal approach captures both visual and structured data dimensions essential for food intelligence applications. The QA-driven filtering ensures high annotation quality despite the large scale.

## Foundational Learning
- **Community sourcing** - why needed: Enables large-scale data collection at lower cost; quick check: verify contributor diversity and geographic coverage
- **AI-assisted QA** - why needed: Scales quality control beyond manual review capacity; quick check: measure false positive/negative rates in automated filtering
- **Wallet-linked provenance** - why needed: Creates verifiable data lineage and ownership; quick check: test wallet linking reliability across different blockchain networks
- **Revenue sharing mechanics** - why needed: Provides sustainable incentive model for contributors; quick check: validate royalty calculation accuracy
- **Multimodal annotation** - why needed: Captures comprehensive food intelligence beyond images alone; quick check: assess annotation completeness rates
- **Cross-source diversity** - why needed: Ensures model generalization across food contexts; quick check: verify balanced representation across packaged/chain/homemade categories

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Community Contributors -> Data Submission -> AI-Assisted QA -> Annotation Validation -> Dataset Repository -> Model Training -> Usage Tracking -> Revenue Distribution
**Critical Path:** Data collection → QA filtering → annotation → model training → performance evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs:** Community scale vs. quality control, open access vs. contributor compensation, centralized curation vs. decentralized provenance
**Failure Signatures:** Poor annotation quality manifests as model performance degradation on edge cases; provenance failures show as attribution gaps; incentive misalignment appears as contributor drop-off
**First 3 Experiments:** 1) Test inter-rater reliability on held-out samples, 2) Evaluate model performance across broader architecture range, 3) Pilot wallet-linking system with small contributor group

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Quality thresholds and inter-rater agreement metrics are not reported, limiting confidence in annotation consistency
- Provenance/revenue sharing depends on Codatta protocol adoption, which may face practical deployment challenges
- Experimental evaluation covers only narrow baseline models and tasks, limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- Dataset size and composition: **High** - well-documented construction from 1.2M corpus to 100K subset
- Model performance claims: **Medium** - results show consistent outperformance but limited baseline comparison
- Provenance/revenue sharing mechanism: **Low** - dependent on external protocol adoption and untested at scale

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-rater reliability analysis on a held-out sample of annotations to quantify QA consistency
2. Test model performance across a broader range of architectures including larger foundation models
3. Implement a pilot deployment of the wallet-linking and revenue-sharing mechanism to validate the provenance tracking system
