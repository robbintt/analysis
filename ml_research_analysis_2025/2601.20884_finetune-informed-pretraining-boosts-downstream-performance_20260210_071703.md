# Finetune-Informed Pretraining Boosts Downstream Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20884
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20884
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: FIP improves multimodal pretraining by focusing on the target modality used during downstream fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a method that improves multimodal pretraining by focusing representation learning on the modality most used during downstream fine-tuning. Instead of treating all modalities equally, FIP uses asymmetric masking (more aggressive masking for the target modality), deeper decoders for the target modality, and higher loss weighting for it. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signal tasks, FIP improves downstream classification accuracy, particularly in low-signal-to-noise regimes. Specifically, at -10 dB SNR, FIP-DenoMAE achieved 69.2% accuracy versus 68.4% for the baseline and 55.4% for a standard ViT, showing improved noise robustness and better feature separation in t-SNE visualizations. The approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and requires no extra data or supervision.

## Method Summary
FIP modifies multimodal masked autoencoding by introducing asymmetric treatment of modalities based on their downstream importance. The method combines three key modifications: higher masking ratios for the target modality (80% vs 60% for others), deeper decoders for the target modality (8 layers vs 4 layers for others), and higher loss weighting for the target modality (1.0 vs 0.5 for others). These changes force the shared encoder to prioritize learning robust representations of the target modality while still benefiting from cross-modal context. The approach requires knowing the target modality before pretraining and applies the asymmetric treatment throughout the pretraining phase before standard encoder-only fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- At -10 dB SNR, FIP-DenoMAE achieved 69.2% accuracy versus 68.4% for the baseline and 55.4% for a standard ViT
- t-SNE visualizations show improved feature separation and noise robustness in FIP representations
- FIP maintains cross-modal benefits while prioritizing target-modality performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Asymmetric Masking
Higher masking ratios for the target modality force the encoder to learn more robust structural representations. By masking 80% of target-modality patches (vs. 60% for others), the reconstruction task becomes harder for the primary modality. This difficulty pressure causes the shared encoder to allocate representational capacity toward capturing deeper structure in the target while auxiliary modalities provide contextual cues from their less-masked inputs. The core assumption is that the encoder distributes capacity based on reconstruction difficulty, with harder tasks driving richer features.

### Mechanism 2: Asymmetric Decoder Capacity
A deeper decoder for the target modality shifts reconstruction burden away from the encoder, preserving encoder generality while improving target-modality fidelity. The target modality receives an 8-layer decoder versus 4-layer decoders for others. Following MAE principles, a lightweight encoder paired with a heavier decoder allows the encoder to learn transferable features without needing to encode all reconstruction details. The asymmetric decoder specifically enhances target-modality reconstruction without modifying the shared encoder architecture. The assumption is that decoder depth modulates how much reconstruction-specific information the encoder must retain.

### Mechanism 3: Weighted Reconstruction Loss
Explicitly weighting the target-modality loss higher (1.0 vs 0.5) biases gradient updates toward target-modality representations. The loss function L_FIP = w_target * L_target + Σ w_other * L_other with w_target = 1.0, w_other = 0.5 causes backpropagation to prioritize encoder weight updates that improve target-modality reconstruction, while still receiving cross-modal context from auxiliary losses. The assumption is that gradient magnitude directly influences which features the encoder retains, while non-zero weights on other modalities preserve cross-modal benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- **Masked Autoencoding (MAE)**
  - Why needed here: FIP builds directly on MAE's reconstruction-based pretraining. Understanding how masking induces representation learning is essential for grasping why asymmetric masking works.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why masking 75% of image patches in MAE leads to better transfer than masking 50%?

- **Vision Transformer (ViT) Architecture**
  - Why needed here: The encoder-decoder backbone is ViT-based with 12 encoder layers and modality-specific decoders. Understanding patch embeddings and transformer blocks is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between patch size, sequence length, and computational cost in a ViT?

- **Multimodal Fusion via Shared Encoders**
  - Why needed here: FIP modifies how a shared encoder learns from multiple modalities (constellation diagrams, scalograms, raw signals, noise) without changing encoder architecture.
  - Quick check question: Why might a shared encoder for multiple modalities outperform separate encoders per modality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: 4 input modalities → per-modality patch embeddings → shared 12-layer ViT encoder → target modality 8-layer decoder, other modalities 4-layer decoders each → weighted MSE losses

- **Critical path**: 1. Identify downstream target modality before pretraining 2. Set masking ratios: p_target = 0.80, p_other = 0.60 3. Configure decoder depths: L_d,target = 8, L_d,other = 4 4. Set loss weights: w_target = 1.0, w_other = 0.5 5. Pretrain for 100 epochs on unlabeled multimodal data 6. Fine-tune on labeled target-modality data only

- **Design tradeoffs**: Higher p_target improves target robustness but may reduce reconstruction quality; deeper target decoder adds ~15% parameters but only at pretraining; non-zero w_other preserves cross-modal context but dilutes target focus

- **Failure signatures**: Target modality reconstruction collapses (blank/constant outputs) → p_target too aggressive; no improvement over baseline → check that target modality matches downstream use; good reconstruction but poor downstream accuracy → encoder may be overfitting to reconstruction; reduce decoder depth

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Ablation on masking asymmetry**: Fix decoder depth and loss weights; sweep p_target from 0.60 to 0.90 while holding p_other = 0.60. Plot downstream accuracy vs. p_target.
  2. **Ablation on decoder depth**: Fix masking and loss; compare L_d,target = {4, 6, 8, 12}. Verify that encoder-only fine-tuning shows benefits.
  3. **Ablation on loss weighting**: Fix masking and decoder; sweep w_target from 0.5 to 2.0 with w_other = 0.5. Identify saturation point where auxiliary modalities contribute minimally.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does FIP generalize to other multimodal domains beyond wireless signal constellation diagrams, such as vision-language or audio-visual tasks? The abstract claims the method is "broadly applicable across multimodal masked modeling pipelines," yet experiments are restricted to the wireless Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) domain. Application of FIP to standard benchmarks like COCO or AudioSet would verify if asymmetric pretraining benefits general vision-language tasks.

### Open Question 2
How sensitive is the performance of FIP to the specific hyperparameter configurations for masking ratios, decoder depth, and loss weights? The paper fixes specific asymmetric values (p_target=0.8, L_d,target=8, w_target=1.0) without presenting ablation studies on these settings. A systematic ablation study varying p_target, L_d,target, and w_target independently across different signal-to-noise ratios would identify optimal general heuristics.

### Open Question 3
Does the aggressive prioritization of the target modality degrade the representation quality of the auxiliary modalities? The method explicitly down-weights the reconstruction loss (w_other=0.5) and masking difficulty for non-target modalities. Downstream evaluation on tasks specifically requiring the auxiliary modalities (e.g., classifying using only scalograms) would ensure balanced capability and check for "catastrophic forgetting."

## Limitations

- Evaluation is restricted to wireless signal classification tasks, leaving cross-domain generalizability unproven
- The asymmetric masking strategy (80% vs 60%) may not transfer to domains where the target modality contains less inherent structure
- The approach requires knowing the target modality before pretraining, limiting applicability when fine-tuning objectives are determined later

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of asymmetric masking improving target-modality reconstruction robustness, following directly from established MAE principles
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that deeper target decoders preserve encoder generality while improving reconstruction fidelity, though the paper doesn't explicitly demonstrate encoder feature transferability
- **Medium confidence**: The assertion that weighted loss functions effectively bias representation learning toward the target modality, though the relationship between weight ratios and downstream performance could be more thoroughly characterized

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain robustness test**: Apply FIP to a non-wireless multimodal dataset (e.g., medical imaging with MRI/CT/PET modalities) to verify the approach generalizes beyond signal processing tasks.

2. **Masking ratio sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the target modality masking ratio from 60% to 95% while measuring both reconstruction quality and downstream accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs for different data types.

3. **Dynamic target modality selection**: Implement a version where the target modality is determined during fine-tuning rather than pretraining, and measure performance degradation compared to the optimal pre-specified case.
