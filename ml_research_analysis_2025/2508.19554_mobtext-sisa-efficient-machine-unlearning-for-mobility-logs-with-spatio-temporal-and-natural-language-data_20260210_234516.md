# MobText-SISA: Efficient Machine Unlearning for Mobility Logs with Spatio-Temporal and Natural-Language Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19554
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19554
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Similarity-aware shard assignment using multimodal embeddings improves RMSE and convergence speed for unlearning in care-taxi duration prediction

## Executive Summary
MobText-SISA introduces a machine unlearning framework tailored for mobility data that combines GPS trajectories, timestamps, and free-form textual notes. The authors extend the SISA paradigm with a similarity-aware shard assignment strategy, clustering embedded multimodal trip records and distributing them across shards to preserve distributional balance and reduce heterogeneity. Each shard is trained incrementally and independently; deletion requests trigger retraining only of the affected shard, enabling exact unlearning with lower computational overhead. Experiments on a ten-month real-world care-taxi dataset (5,193 trips) show that MobText-SISA maintains baseline predictive accuracy and consistently outperforms random sharding in RMSE and convergence speed. The work establishes a practical foundation for privacy-compliant analytics on heterogeneous urban mobility data.

## Method Summary
MobText-SISA employs a multimodal embedding approach to create coherent clusters of trip records, which are then distributed across shards using a round-robin strategy to maintain balance. Each shard is trained independently using a 3-layer MLP classifier with exponential label smoothing and early stopping. Upon deletion requests, only the affected shard is retrained from its last valid checkpoint, ensuring exact unlearning while minimizing computational cost. The method leverages UMAP for dimensionality reduction and Gaussian Mixture Models for clustering, integrating text notes with numeric features to enhance trip representation.

## Key Results
- MobText-SISA maintains baseline predictive accuracy while outperforming random sharding in RMSE and convergence speed
- The clustering-based shard assignment preserves inter-shard diversity and reduces distributional heterogeneity
- Isolated constituent retraining guarantees exact unlearning with lower computational overhead than full-model retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Similarity-Aware Shard Assignment
- Claim: Clustering-based shard distribution preserves predictive accuracy under data fragmentation better than random sharding.
- Mechanism: Each trip's multimodal features (numeric + text) are embedded into a shared latent space, projected to 2D via UMAP, clustered with Gaussian Mixture Models, then distributed across shards in round-robin fashion—ensuring each shard receives balanced samples from every cluster.
- Core assumption: Inter-shard distributional heterogeneity drives accuracy loss more than class imbalance alone; reducing this heterogeneity enables constituent models to learn complementary rather than idiosyncratic patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "employs similarity-aware clustering to distribute samples across shards so that future deletions touch only a single constituent model while preserving inter-shard diversity"
  - [Section 2.2] "Clusters are traversed in a round-robin manner, one sample per shard, so highly similar trips land in distinct shards. This spreads deletion impact while preserving representativeness"
  - [corpus] TraceHiding (arXiv:2509.17241) addresses similar mobility unlearning but uses importance-aware selection rather than distributional balancing—suggesting clustering-based balancing is a distinct design choice with tradeoffs.
- Break condition: If clusters are incoherent (e.g., GMM fails to yield meaningful structure at certain shard counts), round-robin assignment degrades to near-random distribution. The paper notes an anomaly at 8 shards potentially caused by clustering failure.

### Mechanism 2: Isolated Constituent Retraining for Exact Unlearning
- Claim: Restricting retraining to the affected shard guarantees exact unlearning while reducing computational overhead versus full-model retraining.
- Mechanism: Upon deletion request, the system identifies the shard containing target records, discards any checkpoints after those records were incorporated, and retrains only that constituent model from its last valid state.
- Core assumption: Records belong to exactly one shard (disjoint partitioning); no cross-shard data dependencies exist.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Deletion requests trigger retraining solely of the affected shard from its last valid checkpoint, guaranteeing exact unlearning"
  - [Section 2.4] "Only the affected constituent models are retrained, using exactly the retained data; all other shards and their models remain unchanged"
  - [corpus] Efficient Verified Machine Unlearning For Distillation (arXiv:2503.22539) notes SISA achieves efficient unlearning via checkpointing—this paper disables slicing/checkpointing to isolate shard-partition effects.
- Break condition: If deletion requests span multiple shards (e.g., a user's trips distributed across many shards), retraining cost increases proportionally. The round-robin strategy mitigates this by design but cannot eliminate it.

### Mechanism 3: Multimodal Embedding for Coherent Clustering
- Claim: Jointly embedding numeric trajectory features and free-text notes enables clustering that reflects semantic trip similarity.
- Mechanism: Text notes encoded via frozen BERT, compressed to 32 dimensions via PCA, concatenated with scaled numeric attributes (timestamps, coordinates, mobility indicators), then used as input for UMAP projection and GMM clustering.
- Core assumption: Free-text notes contain predictive signal for trip duration and meaningful semantic structure for clustering.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 2.1] "we treat them as a first-class input modality and integrate them with the numeric features to enrich the representation of each trip instance"
  - [Section 2.2] "The note is embedded with a frozen BERT encoder, then compressed to 32 dimensions via PCA; the result is concatenated with the scaled numeric fields"
  - [corpus] Spatio-Temporal Graph Unlearning (arXiv:2511.09404) operates on structured graph data without natural language—this paper's text integration is domain-specific to care-taxi operator notes.
- Break condition: If text notes are sparse, noisy, or uninformative (e.g., mostly empty or boilerplate), BERT embeddings add noise rather than signal. The paper does not report text quality analysis.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: SISA (Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, Aggregated) Training**
  - Why needed here: The core framework MobText-SISA extends. Without understanding SISA's partition-retrain-aggregate loop, the shard assignment innovation has no context.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why SISA reduces unlearning cost compared to full retraining?

- **Concept: Gaussian Mixture Models for Soft Clustering**
  - Why needed here: The shard assignment strategy uses GMM to define soft similarity among trips before round-robin distribution.
  - Quick check question: How does GMM's soft assignment differ from hard k-means clustering, and why might that matter for trip similarity?

- **Concept: Dimensionality Reduction (UMAP + PCA)**
  - Why needed here: High-dimensional multimodal embeddings are projected to 2D for clustering visualization and efficiency.
  - Quick check question: What information loss occurs when projecting BERT embeddings through PCA then UMAP, and how might that affect cluster quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Care-taxi dispatch system → structured numeric fields + free-text notes → BERT encoder (frozen) → 32-dim PCA → concatenate with scaled numeric features → UMAP projection → GMM clustering → round-robin shard assignment → K independent MLPs (3-layer) → ensemble prediction → unlearning request → identify affected shard → retrain from scratch
- **Critical path:** Embedding quality → clustering coherence → shard balance → constituent model performance → ensemble accuracy. The round-robin assignment is the linchpin; poor clustering propagates to all downstream stages.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - More shards → lower per-shard data → faster unlearning but higher accuracy degradation risk
  - Clustering-based vs. random sharding: clustering preserves accuracy but adds preprocessing overhead
  - Classification vs. regression: classification chosen for stability under distribution shift, but loses ordinal smoothness
- **Failure signatures:**
  - 8-shard anomaly in experiments: premature convergence + potential GMM cluster incoherence
  - Empty or near-identical text notes → noisy embeddings → poor clustering
  - Highly skewed user distribution → one user dominates a shard → high retraining frequency
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Implement random sharding with 2, 4, 8, 16 shards on the care-taxi dataset; measure RMSE and epochs to establish comparison baseline.
  2. **Ablation on text modality:** Run MobText-SISA with and without BERT text embeddings to quantify text contribution to clustering coherence and prediction accuracy.
  3. **Cluster quality audit:** Visualize UMAP projections colored by GMM cluster assignment vs. ground-truth duration buckets; assess whether clusters capture meaningful semantic structure or collapse to noise.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can model aggregation strategies be optimized to enhance robustness when using similarity-aware sharding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that "further research is warranted regarding the aggregation of machine learning models trained independently on each shard" to enhance performance and robustness.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses primarily on the partitioning methodology and uses standard aggregation, leaving the interaction between advanced aggregation techniques and similarity-aware shards unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing weighted averaging or stacked generalization against the baseline aggregation method, specifically measuring accuracy recovery after unlearning requests.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the efficiency trade-offs when integrating the SISA "Slice" mechanism with the proposed clustering-based sharding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 2.4 notes that the authors "do not employ the Slice mechanism or any caching strategy" in order to isolate the effects of partitioning.
- Why unresolved: It is uncertain whether the computational overhead of the proposed UMAP and GMM clustering negates the time-savings usually provided by SISA's incremental checkpointing (slicing).
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of end-to-end retraining time for unlearning requests, contrasting the proposed full-retraining method against a version augmented with slicing and caching.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the performance anomaly observed at 8 shards a systemic instability in the clustering approach or a dataset-specific outlier?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.3 identifies the 8-shard result as an "anomaly," attributing it to the possibility that "Gaussian-mixture-model clustering failed to yield coherent clusters at this particular shard count."
- Why unresolved: The paper offers a hypothesis but does not validate if the clustering method fundamentally breaks down at specific partition granularities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of cluster quality metrics (e.g., Silhouette score) across a denser range of shard counts (e.g., 7, 8, 9 shards) to correlate cluster coherence with prediction RMSE.

## Limitations

- The paper does not specify critical hyperparameters for UMAP, GMM, or the MLP training procedure, which could significantly impact reproducibility.
- The analysis of text note quality and informativeness is absent, leaving open the question of whether the BERT embeddings contribute meaningful signal or add noise to the clustering process.
- The claim that classification with label smoothing is superior to regression for this task is stated but not rigorously justified.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core SISA framework and shard assignment strategy are well-defined. The claim that similarity-aware clustering improves RMSE and convergence speed over random sharding is supported by the experimental results on the care-taxi dataset.
- **Medium Confidence:** The mechanism by which multimodal embedding enables coherent clustering is plausible, but the paper lacks a rigorous analysis of text embedding quality and cluster interpretability. The assertion that isolated retraining guarantees exact unlearning is correct in principle but depends on the assumption of disjoint partitioning.
- **Low Confidence:** The exact impact of hyperparameter choices on model performance and unlearning efficiency is unclear due to missing specifications. The claim that classification with label smoothing is superior to regression for this task is stated but not rigorously justified.

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Systematically vary UMAP and GMM parameters to assess their impact on cluster quality, shard balance, and downstream prediction accuracy. Identify a stable configuration that maximizes both accuracy and unlearning efficiency.
2. **Text Embedding Ablation:** Compare MobText-SISA performance with and without BERT text embeddings. Quantify the contribution of text to clustering coherence and prediction accuracy. Analyze the distribution and informativeness of text notes to understand their role.
3. **Cluster Interpretability:** Visualize UMAP projections colored by GMM cluster assignment and ground-truth duration buckets. Assess whether clusters capture meaningful semantic structure or collapse to noise. If clusters are incoherent, investigate alternative embedding or clustering strategies.
