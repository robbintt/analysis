# Lesion-Aware Generative Artificial Intelligence for Virtual Contrast-Enhanced Mammography in Breast Cancer

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.03018
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03018
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Seg-CycleGAN improves PSNR (26.88) and SSIM (0.8537) over CycleGAN baseline for virtual CESM generation

## Executive Summary
This study introduces Seg-CycleGAN, a generative adversarial network that incorporates lesion segmentation maps into CycleGAN to produce virtual contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) images from standard low-energy mammography inputs. By applying localized cycle-consistency and identity losses weighted by segmentation masks, the model enhances lesion reconstruction while maintaining overall image quality. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset show that Seg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline CycleGAN model in PSNR and SSIM metrics while preserving background tissue quality. The results suggest that segmentation-aware generative models offer a viable pathway toward safer, contrast-free alternatives for breast cancer diagnosis, with potential applications in computer-aided diagnosis systems and clinical workflows where CESM images are unavailable or incomplete.

## Method Summary
The proposed Seg-CycleGAN extends the standard CycleGAN architecture by incorporating lesion segmentation maps into the training process, introducing localized loss terms that focus on tumor regions to improve lesion reconstruction accuracy. The model uses weighted L1 losses computed within lesion regions (via segmentation masks) for both cycle-consistency and identity losses, while maintaining standard adversarial training. The architecture employs Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-5, weight decay 1e-5, and β parameters of 0.5 and 0.999. Training follows a two-stage approach: pre-training on public CESM data without segmentation losses, then fine-tuning on the target CESM@UCBM dataset with segmentation-guided losses. Evaluation uses 10-fold cross-validation with 80/10/10 patient splits, and performance is measured using PSNR, SSIM, MSE, and VIF metrics.

## Key Results
- Seg-CycleGAN achieves PSNR of 26.88 compared to 26.79 for baseline CycleGAN
- Seg-CycleGAN achieves SSIM of 0.8537 compared to 0.8532 for baseline CycleGAN
- Qualitative assessments confirm more accurate lesion regions while preserving background tissue quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Seg-CycleGAN model works by extending CycleGAN with localized loss terms that specifically target lesion regions during training. By computing cycle-consistency and identity losses within the segmentation mask regions (multiplied by the mask), the model focuses its reconstruction efforts on tumor areas where accuracy is most critical for diagnosis. This targeted approach allows the generator to preserve global image quality while enhancing the fidelity of lesion features, addressing the limitation of standard CycleGAN which treats all regions equally during training.

## Foundational Learning

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- **Why needed**: GANs enable image-to-image translation by learning to generate realistic synthetic images that can fool discriminators
- **Quick check**: Verify the model can generate visually plausible CESM images from LE inputs

### CycleGAN Architecture
- **Why needed**: CycleGAN enables unpaired image-to-image translation without requiring pixel-level correspondences
- **Quick check**: Confirm the baseline CycleGAN implementation can translate LE to DES images before adding segmentation guidance

### Segmentation-Aware Training
- **Why needed**: Localized losses guide the model to focus on diagnostically important regions (lesions) rather than treating all image areas equally
- **Quick check**: Visualize error heatmaps to confirm reduced errors in lesion regions compared to standard CycleGAN

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input LE Image -> Generator (with segmentation guidance) -> Synthetic DES Image -> Discriminator
                             |                                  ^
                             |                                  |
                             -> Segmentation Mask (training only) -> Cycle Loss

### Critical Path
1. Pre-training generators on public CESM dataset without segmentation guidance
2. Fine-tuning with segmentation-weighted losses (γ parameter tuning)
3. 10-fold cross-validation evaluation with PSNR/SSIM metrics

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Segmentation guidance vs. generalization**: Higher γ values improve lesion reconstruction but may reduce overall image quality
- **Pre-training strategy**: Two-stage training balances learning general translation patterns with fine-tuning for specific dataset characteristics

### Failure Signatures
- **Mode collapse**: Discriminator loss approaches zero, indicating generator fails to produce diverse outputs
- **Lesion disappearance**: Errors concentrate in lesion regions, suggesting insufficient segmentation guidance
- **Background artifacts**: Over-enhancement of lesion regions degrades surrounding tissue quality

### Three First Experiments
1. Train baseline CycleGAN on CESM@UCBM dataset to establish reference performance metrics
2. Implement Seg-CycleGAN with γ=35 and compare lesion-specific PSNR vs. baseline
3. Visualize error heatmaps (target vs. generated) overlaid with segmentation masks to verify localized error reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Does incorporating lesion segmentation maps into the training process of the discriminators (rather than only the generators) improve the visual realism and diagnostic accuracy of virtual CESM images?
- **Basis in paper**: The conclusion states that in the current study, segmentation maps "do not influence the decisions of the discriminators," and suggests extending the architecture to include them as a future direction.
- **Why unresolved**: The current Seg-CycleGAN architecture guides only the generators using segmentation maps; the impact of guiding the discriminators to focus on tumor regions is unknown.
- **Evidence to resolve it**: A comparative study where discriminator loss is modulated by segmentation masks, evaluated using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and radiologist preference scores.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can multimodal explainable AI strategies be effectively integrated to interpret the decision-making process across LE and synthetic DES modalities?
- **Basis in paper**: The conclusion explicitly calls for placing emphasis on "the development of multimodal explainable AI strategies" to improve trust and transparency.
- **Why unresolved**: Generative models typically lack interpretability; clinicians currently have no mechanism to understand how the model synthesizes specific lesion features from low-energy inputs.
- **Evidence to resolve it**: Development of saliency maps or attention mechanisms that correlate input LE features with synthesized DES outputs, validated through clinician feedback.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What is the optimal strategy for selecting the segmentation-guided weighting parameter (γ) to balance global image fidelity and lesion reconstruction?
- **Basis in paper**: The Results section notes that specific γ values (35, 100) were selected empirically based on "the absence of a clear deterministic trend" linking performance to the parameter.
- **Why unresolved**: It is unclear if the chosen weights are optimal or if they generalize well to other datasets, as the relationship between weighting and image quality appears inconsistent.
- **Evidence to resolve it**: An ablation study performing a grid search over a continuous range of γ values to identify a stable performance curve or an adaptive weighting mechanism.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on synthetic ground truth, preventing validation of clinical utility without external validation on independent clinical cohorts
- Only a single γ value (35) was reported as optimal without systematic sensitivity analysis across a wider range
- Architectural details of generators and discriminators are unspecified, particularly number of residual blocks and normalization layers

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: PSNR (26.88) and SSIM (0.8537) improvements over baseline CycleGAN are statistically supported by the 10-fold cross-validation protocol and direct comparison metrics
- **Medium confidence**: Qualitative improvements in lesion region reconstruction are plausible given the localized loss design, but subjective assessment lacks quantitative lesion-specific metrics
- **Low confidence**: Clinical applicability claims remain speculative without external validation, radiologist reader studies, or comparison against real CESM acquisition in diagnostic performance

## Next Checks
1. Conduct external validation using a completely independent CESM dataset (e.g., from a different institution) to assess generalization and confirm PSNR/SSIM improvements hold across domains
2. Perform sensitivity analysis of γ parameter by training Seg-CycleGAN with γ ∈ {10, 35, 100, 200} and plot PSNR/SSIM vs. γ to identify optimal range and robustness
3. Add quantitative lesion-specific evaluation by computing Dice coefficient or lesion-wise PSNR for tumor regions only, comparing Seg-CycleGAN vs. CycleGAN to confirm localized reconstruction gains
