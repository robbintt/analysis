# A two-stream network with global-local feature fusion for bone age assessment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.18331
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18331
- Authors: Qiong Lou; Han Yang; Fang Lu
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves mean absolute errors of 3.81 months (RSNA) and 5.65 months (RHPE)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents BoNet+, a two-stream deep learning architecture for automated bone age assessment that effectively balances global skeletal features with local bone details. The model combines a Transformer module for extracting global hand morphology features with a RFAConv module for enhanced local feature extraction from key skeletal regions. By integrating both global hand structure information and local bone morphology, the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
The proposed BoNet+ architecture employs a dual-stream design where one stream uses Transformer modules to capture global hand morphology through self-attention mechanisms, while the other stream utilizes RFAConv modules to enhance local feature extraction from key skeletal regions. This design addresses the challenge of efficiently balancing complementary global and local features in bone age assessment. The model is trained end-to-end on standard bone age assessment datasets, with careful attention to feature fusion strategies that combine the strengths of both streams.

## Key Results
- Achieves mean absolute error of 3.81 months on RSNA test set
- Achieves mean absolute error of 5.65 months on RHPE test set
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both benchmark datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-stream architecture works by separately optimizing global and local feature extraction, then intelligently fusing these complementary information streams. The Transformer module captures contextual relationships across the entire hand radiograph through self-attention, enabling understanding of global skeletal patterns and developmental stages. Meanwhile, the RFAConv module focuses on detailed local bone features through region-specific attention mechanisms. The fusion strategy allows the model to leverage both coarse-grained developmental patterns and fine-grained bone-specific features, resulting in more accurate age predictions than single-stream approaches.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Transformer-based feature extraction** - Why needed: Captures long-range dependencies and global hand morphology patterns; Quick check: Verify attention maps show coherent hand-wide feature relationships
2. **RFAConv (Region-focused Attention Convolution)** - Why needed: Enhances local bone feature extraction from specific anatomical regions; Quick check: Confirm local feature maps highlight individual bone boundaries
3. **Feature fusion strategies** - Why needed: Combines complementary global and local information effectively; Quick check: Test different fusion weights to find optimal combination
4. **Dual-stream architecture** - Why needed: Separates concerns between global context and local detail processing; Quick check: Compare performance with single-stream baseline
5. **End-to-end training** - Why needed: Ensures consistent optimization across both streams and fusion layers; Quick check: Monitor convergence of both streams during training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Image -> Transformer Stream -> Global Features + RFAConv Stream -> Local Features -> Fusion Layer -> Output Layer

**Critical Path:** Image → Dual-stream feature extraction → Feature fusion → Age regression

**Design Tradeoffs:** The two-stream design adds complexity and computational cost compared to single-stream approaches, but provides significant performance gains by separately optimizing global and local feature extraction. The fusion strategy must carefully balance the contributions of each stream.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor global feature extraction may lead to inaccurate age predictions for unusual hand postures or developmental abnormalities. Inadequate local feature extraction could result in errors when individual bones show atypical development.

**First Experiments:** 1) Ablation study removing Transformer module to quantify global feature contribution, 2) Ablation study removing RFAConv module to measure local feature importance, 3) Test different fusion strategies (early vs late fusion) to optimize information combination

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited cross-dataset validation beyond RSNA and RHPE datasets
- No exploration of performance across different ethnic groups or age subgroups
- Absence of discussion regarding clinical workflow integration and real-world utility

## Confidence

**Model architecture and technical implementation:** High - Clear methodology with specific architectural details
**Performance metrics on tested datasets:** High - Well-defined numerical results with statistical measures
**Generalization to other populations:** Low - Insufficient external validation and demographic diversity testing
**Clinical impact and practical utility:** Low - No evaluation of real-world clinical integration or workflow impact

## Next Checks

1. Test BoNet+ model on additional external datasets from different geographic regions and populations to assess generalizability across diverse demographic groups
2. Conduct radiologist-in-the-loop study comparing model predictions against expert readings in a prospective clinical setting
3. Perform systematic ablation studies removing Transformer and RFAConv modules to quantify their individual contributions to overall performance
