# MusGO: A Community-Driven Framework For Assessing Openness in Music-Generative AI

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Community-validated framework for assessing openness in music-generative AI models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents MusGO, a framework for assessing openness in music-generative AI models that adapts an existing LLM openness framework to the music domain. The framework was validated through a survey of 110 MIR community members and identifies 13 categories of openness, distinguishing between 8 essential and 5 desirable categories. When applied to 16 state-of-the-art models, MusGO reveals significant variability in openness levels, with training data and source code availability being the most prominent gaps.

## Method Summary
The authors adapted an existing LLM openness framework to create MusGO by tailoring it specifically for music generation models. They validated the framework through a survey of 110 members from the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community, collecting perceptions on what constitutes openness in music-generative AI. The resulting framework consists of 13 categories organized into essential (8) and desirable (5) components. The framework was then applied to assess 16 state-of-the-art music-generative AI models, providing a structured evaluation of their openness characteristics.

## Key Results
- MusGO framework validated by 110 MIR community members shows 13 openness categories: 8 essential, 5 desirable
- Application to 16 state-of-the-art models reveals significant variability in openness levels
- Major gaps identified in training data availability and source code accessibility
- Framework enables structured, fine-grained assessment of music-generative AI openness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by providing a structured taxonomy that captures the unique characteristics of music-generative AI models while maintaining comparability across different systems. By adapting existing LLM frameworks and validating through community input, it creates a shared vocabulary for discussing openness that accounts for music-specific considerations like training datasets and creative output quality.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Openness assessment methodology** - Why needed: To create standardized evaluation across diverse music AI models; Quick check: Can you identify the 13 categories in the framework?
2. **Music-specific openness dimensions** - Why needed: General AI frameworks miss music domain requirements; Quick check: Do you understand why training data is more critical for music models?
3. **Community validation process** - Why needed: Ensures framework reflects practitioner needs and perspectives; Quick check: Can you explain how the 110-person survey influenced category selection?
4. **Essential vs desirable distinction** - Why needed: Helps prioritize what constitutes minimum acceptable openness; Quick check: Can you differentiate between essential and desirable categories?
5. **Multi-stakeholder perspective** - Why needed: Music generation involves diverse user communities; Quick check: Who are the key stakeholder groups for music AI openness?
6. **Structured assessment approach** - Why needed: Enables systematic comparison across models; Quick check: Can you apply the framework to a simple model example?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Community Survey -> Category Identification -> Framework Structure -> Model Assessment -> Leaderboard Integration

**Critical Path**
Survey → Category Refinement → Framework Definition → Model Application → Community Feedback Loop

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Depth vs breadth: Comprehensive 13-category framework may be complex but captures nuance
- Academic vs practical focus: Community survey weighted toward researchers may miss practitioner perspectives
- Static vs dynamic assessment: Framework provides snapshot but may need evolution as technology advances

**Failure Signatures**
- Over-emphasis on technical metrics at expense of creative considerations
- Framework becoming obsolete as new model architectures emerge
- Community bias limiting applicability to broader music industry stakeholders

**First Experiments**
1. Apply MusGO to a newly released music generation model to test framework adaptability
2. Conduct targeted survey with musicians and producers to validate music-specific categories
3. Compare MusGO assessment results with actual model performance and usability metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Community survey primarily captured academic and researcher perspectives, potentially missing other stakeholder viewpoints
- Framework validation based on relatively modest sample size (110 respondents)
- Long-term applicability to emerging model architectures remains untested
- May not fully capture domain-specific considerations unique to music generation

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Framework adaptation methodology is sound and well-documented; training data and source code gaps are empirically supported

**Medium Confidence:** Community survey validation provides reasonable support but limited by sample size and sampling bias; essential/desirable distinction shows consistency but may evolve

**Low Confidence:** Predictions about framework's applicability to future architectures and long-term relevance remain speculative without longitudinal validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct validation surveys with broader stakeholder groups including musicians, music producers, and legal experts to assess framework comprehensiveness across all user communities
2. Apply MusGO to music-generative AI models released over a 2-3 year period to evaluate whether openness trends improve and whether framework categories remain relevant as technology evolves
3. Test MusGO's applicability by applying it to other creative domain models (e.g., text-to-image or video generation) to determine whether music-specific adaptations are necessary or whether a more generalized creative-AI openness framework could be developed
