# A Meta-Knowledge-Augmented LLM Framework for Hyperparameter Optimization in Time-Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01445
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01445
- Reference count: 38
- This paper proposes LLM-AutoOpt, a meta-knowledge-augmented LLM framework for hyperparameter optimization in time-series forecasting that achieves improved predictive performance with lower RMSE compared to BO and LLM baselines without meta-knowledge.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LLM-AutoOpt, a framework that combines Bayesian optimization with LLM-based contextual reasoning for hyperparameter optimization in time-series forecasting. The approach encodes dataset meta-features, model descriptions, historical optimization outcomes, and target objectives into structured prompts to guide LLM reasoning. Experiments on the Jena Climate dataset demonstrate that meta-knowledge significantly enhances LLM-guided optimization, achieving lower RMSE while providing more interpretable decisions compared to standard BO or LLM-only approaches.

## Method Summary
LLM-AutoOpt operates in two phases: first, Bayesian optimization explores the hyperparameter space and returns top configurations; second, these results plus dataset meta-features are encoded into structured prompts for an LLM (Qwen2.5-72B with temperature=0.2) to iteratively refine recommendations. The framework enforces JSON output constraints while allowing internal reasoning fields for interpretability. Meta-knowledge includes statistical features, temporal characteristics, and historical BO outcomes, all formatted to constrain LLM exploration to task-relevant regions.

## Key Results
- LLM-AutoOpt achieves RMSE of 1.11 versus 1.19 for BO baseline and shows superior performance to LLM-AutoOpt-NoMeta
- The meta-knowledge approach prevents "epoch inflation" behavior seen in LLM-AutoOpt-NoMeta, where models repeatedly increase epochs as a generic fix
- LLM-AutoOpt provides grounded and task-aware reasoning, explicitly linking hyperparameter changes to architectural considerations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured meta-knowledge grounding reduces unproductive LLM exploration and improves recommendation quality
- Mechanism: Dataset meta-features (autocorrelation, stationarity, seasonality), model specifications, and historical BO outcomes are encoded as structured prompts, constraining LLM reasoning to task-relevant regions of the hyperparameter space
- Core assumption: LLMs can translate statistical meta-features into meaningful hyperparameter adjustments when properly grounded
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The framework encodes dataset meta-features, model descriptions, historical optimization outcomes, and target objectives as structured meta-knowledge within LLM prompts"
  - [section 4.2, RQ4]: "LLM-AutoOpt-NoMeta frequently selects extreme configurations, particularly large epoch counts, as a generic mechanism for RMSE reduction. This behavior indicates a lack of structural understanding"
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus support; neighbor papers focus on HPO methods without LLM-specific meta-knowledge integration

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bayesian optimization initialization mitigates cold-start effects and provides strong inductive bias
- Mechanism: BO explores the hyperparameter space first; the best-performing trial becomes task-specific meta-knowledge that the LLM refines rather than explores blindly
- Core assumption: BO identifies configurations in promising regions that LLM can further optimize
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "using BO to initialize the search and mitigate cold-start effects"
  - [section 3.1]: "Conditioning the LLM on this configuration provides a strong inductive bias, enabling it to refine an already high-quality solution rather than reasoning from an uninformed prior"
  - [corpus]: Related work (Feurer et al., Lindauer & Hutter) confirms warm-starting BO with meta-learning improves convergence

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Structured output constraints with internal reasoning fields balance interpretability and execution stability
- Mechanism: Prompts enforce single valid JSON output, prohibit duplicates, and require adherence to bounds; internal reasoning fields expose justification without destabilizing downstream parsing
- Core assumption: LLMs can follow strict formatting constraints when explicitly instructed
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "It enforces a single valid JSON output, prohibits duplicate hyperparameters, and requires adherence to predefined types and search space bounds"
  - [section 4.2, RQ5]: "LLM-AutoOpt provides grounded and task-aware reasoning, explicitly linking hyperparameter changes to architectural considerations"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence on JSON-constrained LLM outputs for HPO

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Bayesian Optimization surrogate modeling**
  - Why needed here: BO provides initial exploration; understanding Gaussian process surrogates and acquisition functions explains why warm-starting helps
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why BO might stagnate in suboptimal regions on multimodal landscapes?

- Concept: **Time-series meta-features (ACF, stationarity, seasonality decomposition)**
  - Why needed here: These features form the grounding signal; without understanding them, you cannot validate whether meta-features capture relevant dynamics
  - Quick check question: What does a high ADF p-value indicate about a time series, and how might it influence lag selection?

- Concept: **LLM in-context learning and temperature control**
  - Why needed here: The LLM reasons zero-shot over structured prompts; temperature governs exploration vs. determinism
  - Quick check question: Why might temperature=0.2 be preferred over temperature=0.8 for optimization tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Meta-feature extractor -> BO module -> Prompt constructor -> LLM reasoner -> Training evaluator -> Stopping criterion

- Critical path:
  1. Extract meta-features -> 2. Run BO initialization (N trials) -> 3. Construct prompt with best BO config + meta-features -> 4. LLM proposes new config -> 5. Train model, compute RMSE -> 6. If RMSE improves, update best config; loop to step 3 until target met

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. speed: BO alone is faster (82s optimization time); LLM-AutoOpt achieves lower RMSE (1.11 vs. 1.19) but takes 177s
  - Meta-feature richness vs. prompt length: More features improve grounding but increase token costs and potential noise
  - Temperature setting: Lower (0.2) reduces hallucination but may limit creative exploration; higher risks invalid outputs

- Failure signatures:
  - "Epoch inflation": LLM without meta-knowledge repeatedly increases epochs as generic fix (RMSE still high, training time explodes)
  - Constraint violation: JSON parsing errors indicate temperature too high or bounds underspecified
  - Stagnation: RMSE plateaus above target; BO initialization may have been insufficient

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation: Run LLM-AutoOpt-NoMeta vs. LLM-AutoOpt on same BO seeds; quantify meta-knowledge contribution to RMSE reduction
  2. BO trial sensitivity: Vary initial BO trials (3, 5, 10); measure impact on convergence speed and final RMSE
  3. Temperature sweep: Test temperature ∈ {0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8}; track JSON validity rate, RMSE variance, and reasoning quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does LLM-AutoOpt generalize across diverse time-series forecasting datasets with varying temporal characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "results are based on a single multivariate forecasting benchmark. Further evaluation across diverse datasets... is necessary to assess the generality and scalability of the approach."
- Why unresolved: Only the Jena Climate dataset was tested; it is unclear whether the meta-knowledge encoding and prompt design transfer to domains with different seasonality patterns, sampling rates, or noise structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation across multiple benchmark datasets (e.g., M4, M5, electricity consumption, financial time series) showing consistent RMSE improvements over BO baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can meta-feature selection be automated to identify the most informative dataset descriptors for LLM-based HPO?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion identifies "automated meta-feature selection" as a direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current meta-feature set is manually curated; the relative importance of individual features (e.g., ADF statistics vs. trend strength) for optimization quality remains unknown, and redundant features may introduce noise.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study or learned selection mechanism that identifies a minimal sufficient subset of meta-features achieving comparable or better optimization performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does LLM-AutoOpt perform with alternative deep sequence architectures such as Transformers or temporal convolutional networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future work includes "extensions to additional forecasting domains and deep sequence models."
- Why unresolved: Only Bi-LSTM was evaluated; the framework's effectiveness for architectures with different inductive biases (e.g., self-attention mechanisms) is untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments across LSTM, Transformer, and TCN architectures demonstrating whether meta-knowledge benefits are architecture-agnostic or model-specific.

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of meta-knowledge grounding critically depends on the LLM's ability to meaningfully interpret statistical meta-features, which is assumed but not directly validated
- The prompt template and exact JSON constraints are not specified, making faithful reproduction uncertain
- BO initialization parameters (number of trials, acquisition function, trust region formulation) are underspecified, potentially affecting reproducibility

## Confidence
- High confidence: RMSE improvement over BO baseline (1.11 vs 1.19) and LLM-NoMeta behavior (epoch inflation, poor reasoning)
- Medium confidence: The general mechanism of meta-knowledge improving LLM reasoning quality, given the clear distinction in ablation results
- Low confidence: The specific contribution of individual meta-features to LLM decisions, due to lack of feature attribution analysis

## Next Checks
1. **Feature ablation study**: Systematically remove individual meta-feature categories (statistical, ACF/PACF, stationarity, decomposition) and measure impact on RMSE and reasoning quality
2. **Temperature sensitivity validation**: Replicate the temperature sweep with comprehensive logging of JSON validity rates, RMSE variance, and qualitative assessment of reasoning traces
3. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Apply the framework to a different time-series forecasting dataset (e.g., electricity demand, traffic flow) to assess whether meta-knowledge grounding transfers beyond Jena Climate
