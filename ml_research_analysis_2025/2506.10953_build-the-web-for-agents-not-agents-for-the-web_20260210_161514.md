- Primary result: Position paper proposing Agentic Web Interfaces (AWIs) designed for AI agents rather than human users

## Executive Summary
Current web agents are limited by interfaces designed for human users, creating inefficiencies in representation, resource management, and safety. This paper proposes a paradigm shift toward Agentic Web Interfaces (AWIs) that are specifically designed for agent use rather than human use. The authors outline six guiding principles for AWI design and emphasize that implementing this vision requires collaboration across multiple ML disciplines including Human-AI Interaction, AI Safety, NLP, Multimodality, Reinforcement Learning, Planning, and Generalization.

## Method Summary
This position paper identifies key limitations of current web agent interfaces and proposes the AWI paradigm as a solution. The authors formalize web agents using policy π(at|i, ot, a1, o1) conditioned on intent, current observation, and history. Rather than providing a specific implementation, they offer concrete suggestions including unified higher-level actions, compatibility with traditional UIs, access controls, progressive information transfer, and agentic task queues. The paper distinguishes AWIs from the Model Context Protocol by highlighting that AWIs maintain state and provide standardized interfaces, while MCP is a stateless protocol for tool use.

## Key Results
- Current web agents struggle with inefficient DOM trees (potentially >1M tokens, ~$40/task with GPT-4.1) and limited web API action ranges
- AWIs should implement progressive information transfer to reduce token consumption while preserving decision-making capability
- Access control alignment in AWIs can reduce safety risks by restricting agent permissions below human-equivalent levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Progressive Information Transfer
Providing agents with filtered, task-relevant representations reduces token consumption while preserving decision-making capability. AWIs constrain information sent to agents—sending resized images, embeddings, or partial data initially—rather than full DOM trees or complete screenshots. Agents request additional detail on-demand. This assumes agents can complete most tasks without full-resolution assets or exhaustive structural data.

### Mechanism 2: Stateful Interface Standardization
Maintaining client-side state within the interface enables more efficient sequential actions than stateless protocols. Unlike MCP, AWIs track state universally—allowing agents to sort a previously-filtered list without resending the entire dataset. This reduces bandwidth and latency for multi-step tasks, assuming web navigation frequently involves state-dependent operations.

### Mechanism 3: Access Control Alignment
Purpose-built agent ACLs reduce safety risks by restricting agent permissions below human-equivalent levels while preserving task capability. AWIs implement agent-specific access controls that restrict sensitive operations, require explicit user confirmation for destructive actions, and use privacy-preserving intermediaries for credentials. This assumes most web tasks can be completed with a subset of full human permissions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sequential Decision-Making Framework**
  - Why needed here: The paper formalizes web agents using policy π(at|i, ot, a1, o1) conditioned on intent, current observation, and history. Understanding this formalism is essential for designing AWI-compatible agents.
  - Quick check question: Given intent i="book a flight," what observations ot would an AWI provide that differ from a raw DOM tree?

- **Concept: DOM Tree vs. Accessibility Tree Representations**
  - Why needed here: Current agents receive webpage state through DOM trees (verbose, includes rendering-only elements) or accessibility trees (semantic structure). AWIs must improve on both.
  - Quick check question: For a dropdown menu with 50 hidden options, what information should an AWI include versus exclude?

- **Concept: JSON-RPC 2.0 and Stateless Protocols**
  - Why needed here: Understanding MCP's stateless design clarifies why AWIs propose stateful alternatives for web navigation tasks requiring context persistence.
  - Quick check question: How would sorting a filtered product list differ between a stateful AWI and a stateless MCP implementation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User Intent → Agent Policy π → [AWI Layer] → Website Backend ↔ [Bidirectional UI Sync] ← Human Browser
- **Critical path:** 1. Define unified high-level action space (abstracting primitive clicks/typing into semantic actions) 2. Implement observation filtering with progressive transfer 3. Deploy state tracker for context persistence across actions 4. Integrate ACLs with user confirmation triggers for sensitive operations
- **Design tradeoffs:** Standardization vs. site-specific coverage; Efficiency vs. completeness; Safety vs. autonomy
- **Failure signatures:** 1. Representation gap: Agent fails when task requires information excluded from initial transfer 2. State desync: AWI state diverges from actual site state due to concurrent human modifications 3. ACL overblocking: Common tasks require excessive confirmations, causing user abandonment
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Token efficiency benchmark: Compare token consumption and success rate across DOM-based, screenshot-based, and AWI representations using WebArena tasks 2. Stateful vs. stateless comparison: Implement prototype AWI for one e-commerce site and measure bandwidth and completion time for multi-step tasks 3. ACL safety-utility curve: Test three ACL configurations measuring task completion rate, user intervention frequency, and safety incident rate under adversarial prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What specific information types and compression levels allow an AWI to provide "optimal representations" that minimize token usage while retaining decision-critical context? While the paper identifies that DOM trees are inefficient and screenshots lack hidden data, it does not propose a concrete schema for what constitutes an "optimal" state representation for generalist agents.

### Open Question 2
How can a standardized set of high-level actions be defined to cover diverse website functionalities without becoming overly complex or requiring extensive site-specific customization? The paper acknowledges that current action spaces are inconsistent across frameworks, but defining a universal standard that maps to the unique internal logic of millions of distinct websites remains a collaborative hurdle.

### Open Question 3
How can access controls within AWIs effectively distinguish between authorized agent automation and malicious traffic without reintroducing friction for human users? The paper mentions using passkeys or biometrics but does not detail the mechanism for verifying an autonomous agent's authorization level in a way that prevents spoofing or misuse of elevated privileges.

## Limitations

- The paper presents a conceptual framework rather than an implemented system, leaving critical design questions unresolved
- The proposed unified action space lacks concrete specification—no taxonomy, parameter schemas, or cross-site compatibility requirements are defined
- Progressive information transfer depends on determining which elements are "decision-relevant," but the paper provides no criteria for this selection

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The identification of current web agent limitations (DOM inefficiency, safety concerns, API restrictions) is well-supported by industry experience
- **Medium confidence:** The six guiding principles for AWI design are reasonable but untested; their practical utility remains theoretical
- **Low confidence:** Specific implementation suggestions (unified actions, progressive transfer) lack empirical validation and may not generalize across diverse web architectures

## Next Checks

1. **Token efficiency benchmark:** Compare token consumption and success rate across DOM-based, screenshot-based, and AWI representations using WebArena tasks. Measure cost-per-task and identify failure modes specific to each representation type.

2. **Stateful vs. stateless comparison:** Implement prototype AWI for one e-commerce site. Measure bandwidth consumption and task completion time for multi-step operations (filter→sort→add-to-cart) against equivalent MCP-style queries to quantify statefulness benefits.

3. **ACL safety-utility curve:** Test three access control configurations (unrestricted, task-based, confirm-all-destructive) measuring task completion rate, user intervention frequency, and safety incident rate under adversarial prompts to find optimal balance points.
