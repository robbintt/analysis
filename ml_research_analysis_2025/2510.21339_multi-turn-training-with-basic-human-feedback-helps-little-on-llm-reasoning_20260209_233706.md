core_contribution: This study investigates whether multi-turn training with human
  feedback is necessary for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models
  (LLMs). While single-turn reinforcement learning is standard for training reasoning
  abilities, real-world applications often involve multi-turn interactions where users
  provide feedback to refine model outputs.

# Multi-turn Training with Basic Human Feedback Helps Little on LLM Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.21339
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21339
- **Reference count:** 7
- **Key outcome:** Multi-turn training with basic human feedback degrades single-turn reasoning performance without clear multi-turn advantages on GSM8K

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether multi-turn training with human feedback improves reasoning capabilities in LLMs. While standard practice uses single-turn reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks, real-world applications often involve multi-turn interactions. The authors compare single-turn training against three multi-turn strategies (UACR, ULCR, UADR) on GSM8K mathematical reasoning. Surprisingly, models trained in single-turn settings generalize effectively to both single- and multi-turn inference scenarios. In contrast, multi-turn trained models show significant degradation in single-turn reasoning performance with no clear advantage in multi-turn inference, suggesting robust single-turn training remains more effective for complete-information tasks.

## Method Summary
The study compares single-turn versus multi-turn reinforcement learning training strategies using GRPO via the VeRL framework on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct. Multi-turn training involves generating responses, checking correctness, and regenerating with feedback if incorrect (max 8 turns). Three strategies are tested: UACR (update all responses with consistent reward), ULCR (update only final response with consistent reward), and UADR (update all responses with decay reward). The human feedback prompt is minimal: "Your response is incorrect, or your answer is not given in the correct form. You need to reflect on your answer and try again." Models are trained for 5 epochs with evaluation using both Pass@K and sequential K-turn accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- Single-turn trained models generalize effectively to both single- and multi-turn inference scenarios
- Multi-turn trained models exhibit significant degradation in single-turn reasoning performance
- No clear advantage for multi-turn trained models in multi-turn inference scenarios
- Findings suggest robust single-turn training remains more effective for complete-information tasks like mathematical reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly provide a mechanistic explanation for why multi-turn training with basic feedback fails to improve reasoning performance. Potential hypotheses include that the minimal feedback prompt provides insufficient guidance for learning, that the historical context introduces noise that confuses the model, or that the reward sparsity in multi-turn scenarios impedes effective gradient updates. Without further analysis from the authors, the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

## Foundational Learning
**GSM8K dataset**: Standard benchmark for mathematical reasoning tasks
- Why needed: Provides standardized evaluation of reasoning capabilities
- Quick check: Contains 8,500 grade school math word problems

**GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**: Reinforcement learning algorithm for training LLMs
- Why needed: Enables policy gradient optimization with KL regularization
- Quick check: Uses group-relative advantage estimation for stability

**VeRL framework**: Framework for reinforcement learning with language models
- Why needed: Provides infrastructure for multi-turn rollout and training
- Quick check: Supports both single-turn and multi-turn training paradigms

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: GSM8K dataset -> VeRL framework -> GRPO algorithm -> Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model

**Critical path**: Data loading -> Multi-turn rollout generation -> Reward calculation -> Model parameter updates via GRPO

**Design tradeoffs**: Minimal feedback prompt simplifies training but may limit multi-turn learning potential; 3B parameter model enables faster experimentation but may not scale to larger models

**Failure signatures**: Multi-turn trained models showing degraded single-turn performance (expected per findings); reward sparsity in UACR/ULCR strategies causing training instability

**3 first experiments**:
1. Implement single-turn training baseline with GRPO on GSM8K
2. Implement multi-turn rollout mechanism with basic feedback prompt
3. Train and compare all three multi-turn strategies (UACR, ULCR, UADR) against single-turn baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: Does multi-turn training benefit reasoning tasks characterized by incomplete information, where intermediate steps are necessary for the final solution?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors categorize tasks into "complete" and "incomplete" information, noting that for incomplete tasks, "previous operation process is fairly necessary," but only experiment on complete information tasks (GSM8K)
- Why unresolved: The study concludes multi-turn training is unnecessary, but this conclusion is explicitly restricted to tasks where the problem can be solved independently in one turn
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the UACR, ULCR, and UADR training strategies to complex agentic tasks or multi-step tool use where information is gathered incrementally

**Open Question 2**: Does the quality of human feedback influence the efficacy of multi-turn training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study isolates "basic human feedback" (binary correctness) and finds it unhelpful. It is unclear if richer feedback signals would change the outcome
- Why unresolved: The feedback mechanism was limited to a generic retry prompt upon failure. Feedback containing specific error hints or reasoning guidance might enable multi-turn training to improve rather than degrade single-turn performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing training runs using basic correctness feedback versus instructive/grounding feedback on the same reasoning benchmarks

**Open Question 3**: Do these findings scale to larger model architectures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The experiments were conducted exclusively on the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model
- Why unresolved: Smaller models may struggle with the "distraction" of historical context in multi-turn training more than larger models with greater context fusion capabilities
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the single-turn vs. multi-turn training comparison on larger foundation models (e.g., 70B parameters or larger)

## Limitations
- Task-specificity: Findings based exclusively on GSM8K math word problems may not generalize to other reasoning tasks
- Feedback simplicity: Minimal generic feedback prompt may not represent optimal multi-turn interaction design
- Model scale: Results based on 3B parameter model may not scale to larger architectures

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Single-turn RL training effectively generalizes to multi-turn inference scenarios on GSM8K
- **Medium confidence**: Multi-turn training with basic feedback degrades single-turn performance without clear multi-turn advantages
- **Medium confidence**: For complete-information tasks like mathematical reasoning, robust single-turn training remains more effective than multi-turn approaches with simple feedback

## Next Checks
1. **Replication with GRPO hyperparameters**: Implement the three multi-turn strategies (UACR, ULCR, UADR) with systematic hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings and test robustness across different configurations

2. **Cross-task validation**: Test the single-turn vs multi-turn training comparison on additional reasoning datasets (e.g., MATH, SVAMP) to assess generalizability beyond GSM8K

3. **Feedback quality experiment**: Compare the minimal feedback prompt against more informative feedback types (hints, step-specific corrections) to determine if feedback richness moderates the effectiveness of multi-turn training
