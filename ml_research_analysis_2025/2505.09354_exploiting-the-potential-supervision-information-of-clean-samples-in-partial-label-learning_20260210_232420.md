# Exploiting the Potential Supervision Information of Clean Samples in Partial Label Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.09354
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09354
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CleanSE achieves top performance on 3/5 real-world PLL datasets and consistently outperforms 7 state-of-the-art methods on synthetic benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CleanSE, a novel method for partial label learning that leverages the hidden supervision information of clean samples (those with single true labels). While existing PLL approaches focus on disambiguating partial labels based on individual instance characteristics, CleanSE recognizes that clean samples can provide valuable guidance for identifying true labels among candidate sets. The method employs a dual strategy: k-NN-based reweighting that assigns higher confidence to candidate labels matching clean sample labels in nearest neighbor space, and a trackable count loss that characterizes global label distribution by establishing bounds on label frequencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate CleanSE's superiority over state-of-the-art PLL methods across multiple benchmark and real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
CleanSE partitions the PLL dataset into clean samples (D_c) and partial samples (D_p). For each partial sample, it identifies k-nearest neighbors from D_c in the feature space and assigns higher weights to candidate labels that match these neighbors' true labels. Simultaneously, it calculates a global count loss that constrains the model's predicted label distribution to match bounds derived from known clean sample counts and candidate sets. The final loss combines the standard classification loss with the count loss term, optimized jointly to leverage both local relationships and global distribution constraints.

## Key Results
- CleanSE achieves top performance on 3 out of 5 real-world datasets (Lost, BirdSong, MSRCv2) compared to 7 state-of-the-art PLL methods
- Consistent superiority demonstrated across 4 synthetic benchmark datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR-10)
- Ablation studies confirm both reweighting and count loss components contribute to performance improvements
- Method shows effectiveness across different batch sizes, with effects varying by dataset characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reweighting candidate labels based on clean sample neighbors improves disambiguation accuracy.
- Mechanism: For each partial label sample, the method identifies its k-nearest neighbors among clean samples in feature space. If a clean neighbor's true label is present in the partial sample's candidate set, that candidate receives higher weight in the loss function, providing local guidance from unambiguous examples.
- Core assumption: Nearby instances in learned feature space are more likely to share the same true label (label clusterability assumption).
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section 3.2 describe the k-NN reweighting scheme; corpus evidence is weak for this specific mechanism in PLL.
- Break condition: Label clusterability assumption is violated (highly intermixed classes or unrepresentative clean samples).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A global count loss constrains label distribution, preventing over/under-prediction of certain classes.
- Mechanism: Calculates trackable probability for label counts given known clean sample counts and partial sample candidate sets, then minimizes entropy/KL divergence to encourage predictions within these bounds.
- Core assumption: Partial labels are generated by flipping non-true labels with some probability, enabling tractable count probability computation.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section 3.3 detail count loss derivation; corpus evidence is weak for this exact tractable count loss method.
- Break condition: Partial label generation process assumptions are incorrect, invalidating calculated count probabilities.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combined use of local reweighting and global count loss provides complementary supervision.
- Mechanism: Reweighting provides strong instance-level guidance but can be sparse/noisy; count loss provides weaker but globally consistent signal. Joint optimization leverages both granular and holistic information.
- Core assumption: Both mechanisms' assumptions hold sufficiently well that their combined signal is more reliable than either alone.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract frames method as "dual approach"; section 4.4 ablation study shows combining both components yields best performance; related work explores combined signals in PLL.
- Break condition: One mechanism's assumption is fundamentally flawed, introducing more noise than signal and degrading combined performance.

## Foundational Learning

**Partial Label Learning (PLL)**
- Why needed: This is the core problem being addressed - understanding that each training instance has a set of candidate labels, only one of which is true.
- Quick check: Can you explain why standard supervised learning algorithms fail when applied directly to a PLL dataset?

**Label Disambiguation**
- Why needed: The central challenge in PLL is identifying the true label from the candidate set; CleanSE is a specific disambiguation strategy.
- Quick check: What is the goal of a disambiguation strategy in PLL?

**k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
- Why needed: The method uses k-NN algorithm to find local relationships between clean and partial samples.
- Quick check: How does the k-NN algorithm determine which data points are considered "neighbors"?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Data Partitioner -> k-NN Reweighting Engine -> Global Count Loss Calculator -> Combined Loss Optimizer

**Critical path:** The k-NN Reweighting Engine is critical - its output directly modifies the primary classification loss. If neighbors are uninformative, the model reverts to weaker global signal.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- k-NN vs. Alternative Similarity Metrics: Uses Euclidean distance in feature space; assumption is this aligns with semantic similarity. Tradeoff: Computationally simpler but may fail in high-dimensional or non-linear spaces.
- Count Loss Granularity: Calculated per mini-batch; assumption is batch distribution approximates global distribution. Tradeoff: Improves efficiency but may introduce noise if batches are not representative.

**Failure signatures:**
- Dominance of Global Loss: If λ hyperparameter is too large, model may ignore local features and force predictions to match global distribution, leading to poor individual accuracy.
- Uninformative Reweighting: If clean samples are extremely sparse or feature space is poorly formed, k-NN step may find few or irrelevant neighbors, causing reweighting to be random or ineffective.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Hyperparameter Sensitivity Check: Systematically vary λ and temperature T on validation set to find optimal balance between reweighting and count loss terms.
2. Ablation Study: Train with (a) only reweighting loss, (b) only count loss, and (c) both to quantify contribution of each component to final accuracy.
3. Dataset Scaling Test: Run on progressively smaller subsets of training data to test robustness of k-NN reweighting when density of clean samples decreases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Method's performance critically depends on availability of clean samples and quality of feature representation space
- Global count loss assumes specific partial label generation process that may not hold in all real-world datasets
- In scenarios with very few clean samples or poorly separable classes, k-NN reweighting may become unreliable

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Experimental results showing CleanSE outperforming baseline methods on benchmark and real-world datasets.

**Medium Confidence:** Theoretical derivation of count loss and its effectiveness, as it relies on assumptions about partial label generation process not universally validated.

**Medium Confidence:** Claim that combined reweighting and count loss provides complementary supervision, based on ablation study though mechanism is plausible.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Clean Sample Scarcity:** Systematically reduce number of clean samples (D_c) in training set and measure CleanSE's performance degradation compared to baselines to test reliance on k-NN component.

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization of k-NN Weights:** Train model on one dataset, fix k-NN weight generation, and evaluate on different but related dataset to test if learned reweighting strategy generalizes.

3. **Ablation on Count Loss Assumptions:** Design synthetic dataset where partial label generation violates method's assumptions (e.g., non-uniform label flipping) and compare CleanSE's performance to variant omitting count loss.
