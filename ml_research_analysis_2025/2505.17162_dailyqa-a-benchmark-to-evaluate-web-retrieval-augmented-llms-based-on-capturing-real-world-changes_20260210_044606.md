# DailyQA: A Benchmark to Evaluate Web Retrieval Augmented LLMs Based on Capturing Real-World Changes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.17162
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17162
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Reranking retrieved web documents significantly improves time-sensitive QA performance over raw search results

## Executive Summary
DailyQA is a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models on time-sensitive question answering using web retrieval. The benchmark constructs a weekly-updated query set paired with daily-updated answers derived from Wikipedia revision logs, measuring LLMs' ability to handle frequently changing factual information. Experiments show that reranking retrieved documents improves performance, larger models perform better, but the task remains challenging, highlighting the need for better handling of temporal constraints in retrieval-augmented generation systems.

## Method Summary
The benchmark constructs queries from Wikipedia infobox changes, generating time-sensitive questions that require web retrieval to answer. It pairs weekly-updated query sets with daily-updated answer sets derived from revision logs. The evaluation pipeline uses DuckDuckGo for web search, Trafilatura for document extraction, and applies various retrieval strategies including raw snippets, full documents, and reranking. The benchmark includes quality checks for query correctness and searchability, and classifies queries by frequency (frequent/infrequent updates) and domain (7 categories).

## Key Results
- Reranking retrieved documents (bge-v2-m3) improves performance from 0.479 to 0.502 Subset Match
- Increasing model scale from 7B to 72B improves Rouge-L and F1 scores significantly
- Naive time injection into queries or reranking by modification date does NOT improve performance
- Frequent-update queries show lower accuracy than infrequent-update queries, indicating retrieval brings outdated documents

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reranking retrieved web documents improves time-sensitive QA performance over using raw search results
- Mechanism: Semantic reranking (using bge-v2-m3) reorders retrieved chunks by relevance to the query, surfacing content where the answer appears rather than relying on search engine ranking which may prioritize popularity or recency incorrectly
- Core assumption: The correct answer exists somewhere in the top-k retrieved documents; the challenge is ranking, not retrieval
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we compare the ability of different models to process time-sensitive web information and find that rerank of web retrieval results is critical"
  - [section: Results, Table 1] Rerank pipeline achieves SM=0.502 vs Doc=0.479 vs Snippet=0.263 (Search w/o Time condition)
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support; related work on temporal retrieval (Temporal Leakage paper) suggests date-filtered retrieval is unreliable

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Increasing model scale improves answer extraction from noisy web documents, particularly for precision
- Mechanism: Larger models (72B vs 7B/32B) better identify and extract the specific factual detail matching the query from documents containing distracting or outdated information
- Core assumption: The bottleneck is the LLM's ability to process and synthesize from multiple complex documents, not the retrieval itself
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section: Results] "Increasing the scale of the model helps a lot in the metrics of Rouge-L and F1 on DailyQA... significant improvement in Rouge-L and F1"
  - [section: Table 1] Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Rerank): SM=0.502, F1=0.446 vs Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct: SM=0.444, F1=0.264
  - [corpus] ALAS paper suggests autonomous knowledge updating benefits from stronger base models

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Naive time injection into queries or reranking by modification date does NOT improve performance
- Mechanism: Adding explicit date constraints to search queries or prioritizing documents by their modification timestamp failed because (a) search engines may not accurately interpret temporal intent, and (b) webpage modification time ≠ information validity time
- Core assumption: Temporal signals in web metadata are unreliable indicators of content freshness
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section: Results] "the modification of adding timestamps by rules may not achieve the expected results"
  - [section: Table 1] Search w/ Time consistently underperforms Search w/o Time; Rerank-T (0.311 SM) underperforms Rerank (0.502 SM)
  - [corpus] Temporal Leakage paper directly supports this: "71% of questions return at least one page containing strong post-cutoff leakage" when using date filters

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline stages
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates multiple RAG configurations (Snippet, Doc, Rerank, Rerank-T); understanding the pipeline is prerequisite to interpreting results
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why reranking occurs after document retrieval but before LLM generation?

- Concept: Temporal knowledge cutoff problem in LLMs
  - Why needed here: DailyQA is designed to test LLMs on information that changed after their training cutoff; understanding this motivates the benchmark design
  - Quick check question: Why can't a static-pretrained LLM answer "What is LeBron James' career total points as of today?" without retrieval?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for QA (Subset Match, Rouge-L, F1, LLM-as-judge accuracy)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses multiple metrics to capture different aspects of answer quality
  - Quick check question: Why might a model score high on subset match but low on Rouge-L?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Data Pipeline: Wikipedia revision logs → infobox extraction → query generation (LLM) → quality check (correctness + searchability) → answer extraction (daily)
  2. Evaluation Pipeline: Query + date specification → web search (DuckDuckGo) → document fetching (Trafilatura) → [optional: chunking + reranking with bge-v2-m3] → LLM generation → metric computation
  3. Classification Layer: Frequency tags (frequent/infrequent based on 3-week change pattern) + domain tags (7 categories via LLM)

- Critical path: Query generation quality → retrieval coverage → reranking effectiveness → LLM extraction. The quality check module (correctness verification + DuckDuckGo searchability filter) is the gating step that determines whether generated queries are usable

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Infobox-only extraction: High precision, structured data but limited to facts representable in infobox format; misses prose-based updates
  - Weekly query updates vs daily answer updates: Balances dataset freshness with computational cost of pipeline runs
  - Reranking overhead: ~2-3x latency increase but substantial accuracy gains (0.479 → 0.502 SM)

- Failure signatures:
  - Low SM with high Rouge-L: Model finding related but wrong information (temporal mismatch)
  - Frequent-update queries underperforming infrequent by >2x: Retrieval bringing outdated documents
  - Rerank-T underperforming Rerank: Timestamp metadata unreliable on target domain

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce the Rerank vs Doc vs Snippet comparison on a single week's data to validate your pipeline implementation matches reported metrics
  2. Test your domain of interest (e.g., Sports vs Politics) to understand difficulty distribution relevant to your use case
  3. Implement a time-aware retrieval strategy (e.g., prompt the LLM to extract and compare dates from retrieved documents) and compare against the reported Rerank-T baseline to validate whether content-based temporal reasoning outperforms metadata-based approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can agentic retrieval strategies improve performance on time-sensitive queries where standard query modification fails?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "Precise retrieval through agentic RAG may be a promising approach" after finding that adding timestamps directly to queries degraded performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experiments focused on standard pipelines (Snippet, Doc, Rerank), finding that "Search w/ Time" performed worse than "Search w/o Time."
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating an agentic framework that outperforms the "Rerank" baseline on DailyQA by dynamically formulating search queries.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can systems extract the effective validity time of information from content rather than relying on unreliable webpage metadata?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study notes the "modification time of a web page is not equivalent to the effective time of the information," suggesting content-based analysis is needed.
- Why unresolved: The authors' Rerank-T method, which relied on modification dates, failed to improve results, leaving the challenge of identifying specific temporal validity open.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that parses document text to determine factual effective dates, resulting in higher accuracy than metadata-based reranking.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do state-of-the-art reasoning models (e.g., GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) perform on DailyQA compared to the instruct models tested?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Limitations section states the authors "did not evaluate the state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1, etc.," leaving their temporal adaptability unmeasured.
- Why unresolved: Resource constraints prevented the inclusion of these specific high-capability models in the evaluation suite.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation results of the full DeepSeek-R1 or GPT-o1 models on the DailyQA benchmark.

## Limitations

- The benchmark relies on Wikipedia infoboxes, limiting evaluation to structured factual updates rather than broader real-world information changes
- The evaluation uses a single search engine (DuckDuckGo) and single reranker (bge-v2-m3), potentially limiting generalizability
- The negative results for time-aware retrieval may be implementation-specific rather than fundamental limitations

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core finding that reranking retrieved documents significantly improves performance over raw search results (0.479 vs 0.502 SM) is well-supported by experimental data across multiple model sizes and conditions.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that naive time injection into queries doesn't help is reasonably supported, but the negative result may be implementation-specific rather than fundamental.

**Low Confidence**: The benchmark's generalizability to real-world temporal QA beyond Wikipedia-style structured updates is uncertain, as the claim that this represents a challenging testbed is somewhat circular.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Generalization Test**: Run the DailyQA pipeline on a non-Wikipedia knowledge base (e.g., news articles or scientific publications) to validate whether the retrieval-LLM architecture performs similarly when answers are in unstructured prose rather than infoboxes.

2. **Temporal Signal Exploration**: Implement a content-based temporal reasoning approach where the LLM extracts and compares dates from retrieved documents to determine currency, comparing this against the Rerank-T baseline to determine if metadata-based temporal filtering can be improved.

3. **Retrieval Backend Comparison**: Repeat the Rerank vs Doc vs Snippet experiments using a different search engine (e.g., Google Custom Search or Bing) and a different reranker (e.g., ColPali or GTE) to validate whether the performance gains are pipeline-specific or generalize across retrieval components.
