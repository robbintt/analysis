# TrialMatchAI: An End-to-End AI-powered Clinical Trial Recommendation System to Streamline Patient-to-Trial Matching

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.08508
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08508
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: AI system for automated patient-to-trial matching achieving over 90% recall and eligibility classification accuracy in oncology use cases.

## Executive Summary
TrialMatchAI is an open-source AI system designed to automate patient-to-trial matching in clinical trials by processing both structured and unstructured clinical data. The system leverages fine-tuned large language models within a retrieval-augmented generation framework to normalize biomedical entities, retrieve relevant trials via hybrid search, re-rank results at the criterion level, and perform eligibility assessments using medical Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Evaluated on synthetic benchmarks and real-world oncology patient data, TrialMatchAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with over 90% recall within the top 3% of trials and correctly classifies over 90% of eligibility criteria. The system emphasizes transparency, privacy, and modularity for clinical deployment.

## Method Summary
TrialMatchAI employs a retrieval-augmented generation framework with fine-tuned large language models to process heterogeneous clinical data. The system first normalizes biomedical entities from both structured records and unstructured physician notes, then retrieves relevant trials using a hybrid lexical and semantic search approach. It re-ranks results at the criterion level and performs eligibility assessments using medical Chain-of-Thought reasoning. The architecture is modular and designed for clinical deployment, with evaluations conducted on synthetic benchmarks (TREC 2021, 2022) and real-world oncology patient data, demonstrating high recall and accurate eligibility classification.

## Key Results
- Achieved over 90% recall within the top 3% of trials in benchmark evaluations.
- Correctly classified over 90% of eligibility criteria in expert assessments.
- Retrieved at least one relevant trial within the top 20 recommendations for 92% of real cancer patients tested.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TrialMatchAI works by integrating fine-tuned large language models with retrieval-augmented generation to handle the complexity of clinical trial eligibility criteria. The system's hybrid search combines lexical and semantic methods to improve retrieval accuracy, while criterion-level re-ranking ensures that the most relevant trials are prioritized. Medical Chain-of-Thought reasoning enables the system to interpret nuanced eligibility requirements, bridging the gap between unstructured clinical narratives and structured trial criteria. The modular architecture allows for transparency and adaptability across different clinical settings.

## Foundational Learning
- **Biomedical Entity Normalization**: Required to standardize clinical terminology across diverse data sources; quick check involves validating entity mappings against established ontologies.
- **Hybrid Search (Lexical + Semantic)**: Combines keyword matching with meaning-based retrieval for robust trial discovery; quick check compares retrieval recall across different search strategies.
- **Criterion-Level Re-ranking**: Ensures trials are prioritized based on individual eligibility requirements; quick check measures ranking accuracy against expert-curated trial lists.
- **Medical Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Enables interpretation of complex eligibility logic; quick check involves testing reasoning accuracy on synthetic eligibility scenarios.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Integrates search and generation for dynamic trial assessment; quick check evaluates response coherence and relevance in clinical contexts.
- **Modular System Design**: Facilitates adaptation and transparency in clinical workflows; quick check involves assessing component interchangeability and documentation clarity.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Patient Data Ingestion -> Biomedical Entity Normalization -> Hybrid Search (Lexical + Semantic) -> Trial Retrieval -> Criterion-Level Re-ranking -> Eligibility Assessment (Medical Chain-of-Thought) -> Recommendations

**Critical Path**: The most critical path is from patient data ingestion through biomedical entity normalization to hybrid search and trial retrieval, as errors in this pipeline directly impact downstream eligibility assessment and recommendation accuracy.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system prioritizes accuracy and interpretability over raw speed, using fine-tuned LLMs and multi-stage re-ranking rather than a single-pass retrieval model. This increases computational overhead but improves transparency and clinical trust.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor recall may indicate issues with entity normalization or hybrid search coverage; inaccurate eligibility classification suggests reasoning model limitations or insufficient training data for complex criteria.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Validate biomedical entity normalization accuracy on a held-out set of clinical notes.
2. Compare recall performance of hybrid search versus purely lexical or semantic baselines.
3. Test eligibility assessment accuracy on synthetic trials with known criteria to benchmark reasoning performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance metrics focus on recall and eligibility classification accuracy, with limited reporting on precision and false positive rates.
- System performance may not generalize beyond oncology or to underrepresented populations and rare diseases.
- Real-world validation was limited to only 25 cancer patients, raising concerns about deployment readiness.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: System architecture, modularity, and retrieval-augmented generation framework feasibility.
- **Medium confidence**: Benchmark performance metrics due to reliance on synthetic data and limited real-world cohorts.
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability across non-oncology domains and scalability in diverse clinical settings.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct multi-center real-world trials across multiple cancer types and non-oncology domains to assess cross-domain performance and generalizability.
2. Perform prospective clinical workflow integration studies to measure actual impact on trial recruitment timelines and physician acceptance.
3. Systematically evaluate precision, false positive rates, and interpretability for end users, especially in the context of rare disease trials and underrepresented populations.
