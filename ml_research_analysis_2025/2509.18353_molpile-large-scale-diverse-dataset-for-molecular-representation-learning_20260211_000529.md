# MolPILE -- large-scale, diverse dataset for molecular representation learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.18353
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18353
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 222 million molecule dataset improves molecular ML pretraining benchmarks

## Executive Summary
MolPILE is a comprehensive dataset of 222 million small molecules constructed from six major chemical databases to address limitations in existing molecular representation learning datasets. The dataset provides broad chemical space coverage with rigorous deduplication and standardization, achieving superior diversity and synthesizability compared to commonly used datasets like ChEMBL, ZINC, and GDB-17. When used for pretraining Mol2vec and ChemBERTa models, MolPILE consistently improves performance across 48 benchmark datasets spanning MoleculeNet, TDC, WelQrate, ToxBench, and ApisTox, with average AUROC gains of 1.79-1.09 and MAE reductions of 0.2-0.2.

## Method Summary
MolPILE was constructed using an automated curation pipeline that integrated data from six major chemical databases, followed by systematic deduplication, structure standardization, and quality filtering. The dataset emphasizes broad chemical diversity across elements and functional groups while maintaining synthesizability through SAScore-based filtering. The curation process prioritizes data quality and chemical validity, resulting in a dataset that covers significantly more chemical space than traditional pretraining datasets while maintaining high structural integrity.

## Key Results
- Pretrained Mol2vec on MolPILE achieves +1.79 AUROC and -0.203 MAE improvements across benchmarks
- Pretrained ChemBERTa on MolPILE achieves +1.09 AUROC and -0.200 MAE improvements across benchmarks
- Median SAScore of 3.05 indicates moderate synthetic accessibility while maintaining diversity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from its unprecedented scale and diversity, which enables molecular ML models to learn more generalizable representations. By covering a broader chemical space than existing datasets, MolPILE exposes models to more diverse molecular patterns and interactions during pretraining. The rigorous quality control and deduplication ensure that models learn from unique, valid molecular structures rather than redundant or erroneous data. The balanced representation across different chemical elements and functional groups prevents models from developing biases toward overrepresented chemical motifs.

## Foundational Learning

**Chemical Diversity Metrics**: Understanding how to measure and quantify molecular diversity is crucial for evaluating dataset quality. This is needed to assess whether MolPILE truly covers broader chemical space. Quick check: Compare element frequency distributions between MolPILE and benchmark datasets.

**SAScore and Synthetic Accessibility**: SAScore quantifies how difficult a molecule would be to synthesize in practice. This is needed to ensure the dataset contains practically useful molecules. Quick check: Verify SAScore calculations match established implementations.

**Molecular Fingerprints and Representations**: Knowledge of how molecules are encoded for ML (e.g., SMILES, molecular graphs) is essential for understanding pretraining methodology. This is needed to comprehend how Mol2vec and ChemBERTa learn from the data. Quick check: Confirm fingerprint generation matches published methods.

**Benchmark Dataset Curation**: Understanding the composition and characteristics of benchmark datasets (MoleculeNet, TDC, etc.) is crucial for interpreting performance improvements. This is needed to evaluate whether improvements generalize across different task types. Quick check: Verify benchmark dataset statistics match published values.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Chemical databases -> Curation pipeline -> Deduplication and standardization -> MolPILE dataset -> Pretraining (Mol2vec/ChemBERTa) -> Benchmark evaluation

**Critical Path**: Database integration and quality filtering -> Large-scale deduplication -> Structure standardization -> SAScore-based synthesizability assessment -> Model pretraining -> Benchmark validation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Scale vs. quality (prioritized high-quality, diverse data over raw quantity), diversity vs. synthesizability (balanced broad coverage with practical accessibility), computational cost vs. thoroughness (accepted longer processing for more rigorous curation)

**Failure Signatures**: Overfitting to specific chemical spaces, poor generalization to underrepresented elements, unrealistic synthetic accessibility, benchmark-specific optimizations that don't transfer

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test model performance on held-out chemical spaces not well-represented in MolPILE
2. Evaluate pretraining efficiency curves to determine optimal dataset size
3. Compare performance across different subsets of the six source databases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Modest absolute performance gains (1-2% AUROC) may not represent transformative improvements for practical applications
- SAScore-based synthesizability assessment may oversimplify real-world synthetic challenges
- Benchmark performance improvements may not fully translate to real-world molecular discovery contexts

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Dataset quality and diversity claims | High |
| Benchmark performance improvements | Medium |
| Dataset scale claims | High |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies testing model performance when trained on subsets of MolPILE to determine whether the full dataset size is necessary for observed improvements, or if specific database sources contribute more significantly to performance gains.

2. Perform real-world applicability testing by deploying Mol2vec and ChemBERTa models pretrained on MolPILE to predict molecular properties in industrial or pharmaceutical discovery contexts, comparing against models trained on traditional datasets.

3. Evaluate model robustness to distribution shifts by testing pretrained models on molecular datasets from underrepresented chemical spaces in MolPILE, particularly focusing on elements and functional groups with lower representation in the current dataset.
