# Reinforcement Learning with $ω$-Regular Objectives and Constraints

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19849

- This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that combines ω-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing separate treatment of safety requirements and optimization targets.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates ω-regular objectives with explicit safety constraints. The authors develop a model-based approach using linear programming to maximize the probability of satisfying ω-regular objectives while adhering to ω-regular constraints within specified thresholds. The work addresses a critical gap in existing RL approaches by allowing safety requirements and optimization targets to be treated separately, which is particularly important for real-world applications where safety is paramount.

The key theoretical contribution is the proof that optimal policies can be expressed as convex combinations of two stationary policies, and that for almost-sure constraints, stationary or deterministic policies suffice. The authors also present a translation to constrained limit-average problems that preserves optimality, addressing limitations of previous approaches that failed to maintain optimality when translating temporal logic specifications to reward-based formulations.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that formulates the constrained ω-regular problem as a linear program. The approach uses automata representations of ω-regular specifications to encode both objectives and constraints. The algorithm maximizes the probability of satisfying the objective while ensuring constraint thresholds are met. The key insight is that the solution space can be restricted to convex combinations of two stationary policies, dramatically simplifying the optimization problem. For almost-sure constraints, the authors prove that simpler stationary or deterministic policies are sufficient, further reducing computational complexity.

## Key Results
- Proves optimal policies exist as convex combinations of two stationary policies
- Shows stationary or deterministic policies suffice for almost-sure constraints
- Presents translation to constrained limit-average problems that preserves optimality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the structure of ω-regular languages and their automata representations. By encoding both objectives and constraints as ω-regular properties, the approach can handle complex temporal specifications that capture safety requirements and performance goals. The linear programming formulation exploits the convexity properties of the policy space when expressed as convex combinations, enabling efficient optimization. The preservation of optimality through the translation to limit-average problems ensures that the theoretical guarantees hold even when using alternative formulations.

## Foundational Learning

**ω-regular languages**: Formal languages that capture infinite sequences with specific temporal patterns. Needed to express complex safety and performance specifications. Quick check: Verify understanding of Büchi automata as acceptors for ω-regular languages.

**Convex combinations of policies**: Representation of policies as weighted combinations of simpler policies. Needed to exploit the mathematical structure of the solution space. Quick check: Confirm that the policy space remains convex when combining stationary policies.

**Linear programming in RL**: Optimization framework for policy search when the model is known. Needed to efficiently solve the constrained optimization problem. Quick check: Validate that the constraint matrices correctly represent the ω-regular specifications.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Environment model -> ω-regular automata construction -> Linear program formulation -> Solution extraction -> Policy evaluation

**Critical path**: The critical computational path involves constructing automata representations of the specifications, formulating the linear program with these automata, solving the LP to find optimal policy weights, and extracting the final policy. The bottleneck is typically the automaton construction and LP solution time.

**Design tradeoffs**: Model-based approach provides strong theoretical guarantees but requires known dynamics, trading off generality for optimality. The convex combination representation simplifies optimization but may require solving larger LPs than alternative formulations. The separation of objectives and constraints enables clearer specification but adds complexity to the problem formulation.

**Failure signatures**: Failure to find feasible solutions indicates that constraint thresholds are too strict relative to the objective. Poor performance suggests incorrect automaton construction or numerical issues in the LP solver. Oscillatory behavior may indicate that the convex combination weights are not properly optimized.

**First experiments**: 1) Verify the framework on simple safety-critical tasks with known optimal policies. 2) Test constraint satisfaction on environments where safety thresholds are critical. 3) Compare the convex combination approach against standard constrained RL methods on benchmark problems.
