# The Curious Case of Visual Grounding: Different Effects for Speech- and Text-based Language Encoders

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.15837
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15837
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Visual grounding increases cross-modal alignment between speech and text models, but this effect is driven mainly by enhanced word identity encoding rather than semantic meaning.

## Executive Summary
This study analyzes how visual grounding affects internal word representations in speech-based (SLE) versus text-based (TLE) language encoders. Using global representational comparisons and targeted clustering analyses, the authors find that visual grounding increases alignment between spoken and written language representations, but this effect is driven mainly by enhanced word identity encoding rather than semantic meaning. In contrast to TLEs, where visual grounding improves semantic clustering, SLEs show degraded semantic discriminability after grounding, despite maintaining phonetic clustering. The findings reveal that current visual grounding methods effectively refine semantic structure in text models but disrupt pre-existing semantic patterns in speech models, suggesting a need for more targeted approaches to enrich speech-based representations with visually-informed semantics.

## Method Summary
The study compares pretrained speech-based (wav2vec2-base) and text-based (BERT) language encoders with their visually grounded counterparts (FaST-VGS+ and VG-BERT). Layerwise word-level representations are extracted via mean-pooling over frames/tokens for single-word inputs from LibriSpeech and MALD datasets. Representational similarity is measured using CKA between models, while clustering quality is evaluated using silhouette coefficients on phonetic and semantic groups. LDA projections are optimized for group separability, with leave-one-out reporting and 95% confidence intervals over multiple samplings.

## Key Results
- Visual grounding increases alignment between speech and text models, primarily through enhanced word identity encoding rather than semantic meaning
- Grounding improves semantic clustering in text-based encoders but degrades it in speech-based encoders
- Speech-based representations show strong phonetic clustering that remains intact after grounding, while semantic clustering degrades

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Visual grounding increases cross-modal alignment between speech and text models primarily by enhancing word identity (lexical) features rather than semantic meaning.
- **Mechanism:** The contrastive loss used in visually grounded training forces speech representations to match text/image referents. Since the base SLE is phonetically dominated, the path of least resistance for the model is to sharpen the distinctiveness of specific word tokens (identity) to minimize loss, rather than reorganizing the entire space around abstract semantic relationships.
- **Core assumption:** The "alignment" observed via CKA reflects shared structural geometry rather than just point-wise mapping.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "alignment... seems mainly driven by enhanced encoding of word identity rather than meaning."
  - [section 3.1] "FaST-VGS+ more saliently represents word identity than wav2vec2... relative similarities between synonyms are even slightly decreased."
- **Break condition:** If the audio input is degraded to the point where phonetic discrimination is impossible, word identity clustering should collapse, removing the alignment benefit.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Visual grounding improves semantic clustering in Text-based Language Encoders (TLEs) but degrades it in SLEs due to differences in pre-existing representational geometry.
- **Mechanism:** TLEs possess a robust semantic structure pre-grounding. Visual grounding acts as a refinement signal, reshaping dimensions to improve discriminability. In contrast, SLEs have semantic information squeezed into a small subspace dominated by acoustic features. The grounding signal disrupts this fragile geometry, "breaking" the pre-existing semantic structure without successfully replacing it with visually-informed semantics.
- **Core assumption:** The degradation in semantic silhouette scores represents a loss of semantic information rather than a transformation into a non-linear semantic manifold that LDA cannot capture.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.5] "SLE embeddings change more substantially with visual grounding (CKA-similarity ≈ 0.46)... [correlating] changes... reveals a strong positive correlation for SLEs... but a strong negative correlation for TLEs."
- **Break condition:** If an auxiliary loss is applied to explicitly preserve the SLE's layer 7 geometry during visual fine-tuning, the semantic degradation should attenuate.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Acoustic/phonetic dominance in SLEs acts as a bottleneck that prevents the effective integration of visually-grounded semantics.
- **Mechanism:** Self-supervised speech models are trained on low-level acoustic prediction objectives. This forces the representational space to prioritize phonetic distinctiveness over semantic similarity. When visual signals are introduced, they cannot easily "overwrite" the dominant acoustic features; instead, the model appears to trade off the weakly encoded semantic subspace to accommodate the new visual features, resulting in net semantic loss.
- **Core assumption:** The phonetic features are "entangled" with the semantic dimensions in the SLE's latent space.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 1] "unimodal SLE representations are generally dominated by sound- rather than meaning-based similarities."
- **Break condition:** If the SLE is pre-trained with a semantic objective before visual grounding, the phonetic dominance should be lower, potentially mitigating the semantic degradation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Representational Similarity Analysis (CKA)**
  - **Why needed here:** Essential for distinguishing whether two models process information similarly or if grounding fundamentally alters the geometry of the embedding space.
  - **Quick check question:** If Model A and Model B have a CKA similarity of 0.9, are they likely using similar features to solve the task?

- **Concept:** **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) vs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses LDA to prove that semantic information exists in subspace even if global clustering fails. Understanding the difference between unsupervised variance (PCA) and supervised separation (LDA) is key to interpreting the "degradation" results.
  - **Quick check question:** Which method would you use to find the dimensions that best separate "concrete" vs. "abstract" words if you had the labels?

- **Concept:** **Contrastive Learning Objectives**
  - **Why needed here:** The mechanism of grounding relies on contrastive loss (pulling positive pairs together, pushing negatives apart). Understanding this explains why "word identity" (the anchor) improves while abstract "semantics" (shared across negatives) might suffer.
  - **Quick check question:** In a batch containing "dog" (audio+image) and "cat" (audio+image), does standard contrastive loss encourage the "dog" audio to move closer to the "cat" audio because they are both animals?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Audio Input -> Conv Encoder -> Context Network (Transformer) -> Contrastive Loss (Audio+Visual) -> Fine-tuned Audio Backbone
- **Critical path:**
  1. Audio Input -> Conv Encoder -> Context Network (Transformer)
  2. Fine-tuning loop: Audio Embedding + Visual Embedding -> Contrastive Loss
  3. Analysis Extraction: Mean-pooling over frame representations for single-word inputs
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Fine-tuning vs. Frozen Backbone: FaST-VGS+ fine-tunes the audio backbone, allowing semantic degradation to occur. Freezing the backbone might prevent degradation but limit grounding effectiveness.
  - Objective Mixing: FaST-VGS+ uses a mix of cross-modal contrastive loss and wav2vec2 self-supervised loss. Balancing these determines the extent of phonetic dominance vs. visual alignment.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Semantic Bleaching: High performance on word-image retrieval, but low silhouette scores for semantic categories (e.g., synonyms cluster poorly)
  - Layer-wise Collapse: Semantic decodability peaks in middle layers (L7) in ungrounded models but flattens or shifts inconsistently in grounded models
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce Layer-wise CKA: Compute CKA between wav2vec2 and FaST-VGS+ layer-by-layer to confirm the magnitude of representational shift (target: ~0.46 similarity)
  2. Probing Semantic vs. Phonetic: Train linear probes (LDA) on the MALD dataset (phonetic vs. semantic groups) to verify that semantic accuracy drops in the grounded model while phonetic accuracy remains stable
  3. Ablation on Concreteness: Evaluate clustering on "Concrete" vs. "Abstract" word groups to confirm that grounding disproportionately helps (or hurts less) concrete concepts due to image dataset bias

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does the observed degradation of semantic clustering in speech encoders negatively impact performance on downstream tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that "Relating differences in model-internal geometry to downstream task performance remains an important area of future work" which could refine the significance of their findings.
- **Why unresolved:** The study focused exclusively on intrinsic evaluations (geometry and clustering) rather than extrinsic utility.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking grounded vs. ungrounded speech models on semantic downstream tasks (e.g., spoken retrieval or entailment) to see if degraded clustering correlates with lower accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can visual grounding effectively enrich speech representations if the training objective targets semantically relevant dimensions in middle model layers rather than output layers?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors suggest "visual grounding could potentially be more effective... if visual information can specifically target semantically relevant dimensions present in middle model layers."
- **Why unresolved:** Current grounding methods may disrupt transient semantic structure because the visual loss is applied to acoustically dominated output representations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments applying visual grounding losses specifically to intermediate layers (e.g., layer 7) and measuring resultant semantic clustering.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Why does visual grounding refine semantic structure in text models while disrupting pre-existing semantic patterns in speech models?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] In Section 3.5, the authors ask, "Why does visual grounding seem to enhance semantic structure in TLEs, but have the opposite effect in SLEs?"
- **Why unresolved:** The analysis confirms the divergence but does not isolate the mechanistic cause of this disruption.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Probing the interaction between pre-training modalities (audio vs. text) and visual loss functions to identify if acoustic noise interferes with visual gradient updates.

## Limitations
- The precise CKA variant and LDA configuration remain unspecified, creating uncertainty in metric interpretation
- The semantic degradation observed in SLEs could alternatively represent a transformation into a non-linear semantic manifold rather than true information loss
- The grounding signal's effectiveness depends on the quality and diversity of the visual dataset used during fine-tuning, which isn't fully characterized

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The finding that visual grounding increases alignment between speech and text models primarily through enhanced word identity encoding rather than semantic meaning
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that grounding improves semantic clustering in TLEs while degrading it in SLEs
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that acoustic/phonetic dominance in SLEs acts as a bottleneck preventing effective integration of visually-grounded semantics

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on Semantic Preservation**: Implement an auxiliary loss during visual fine-tuning that explicitly preserves the SLE's layer 7 geometry, then measure whether semantic degradation attenuates while maintaining grounding benefits
2. **Semantic Manifold Analysis**: Apply non-linear dimensionality reduction (t-SNE or UMAP) to visualize whether semantic information transforms into a non-linear manifold rather than disappearing, particularly in grounded SLE representations
3. **Concrete vs Abstract Bias Quantification**: Systematically analyze the grounding dataset's bias toward concrete concepts and measure whether semantic improvements/degradations correlate with concept concreteness, isolating this from the core mechanism
