# Personalized Interpretability -- Interactive Alignment of Prototypical Parts Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.05533
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05533
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: Interactive prototype refinement method achieves 88.3% improvement in prototype consistency while maintaining classification accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces YoursProtoP, a novel approach to addressing concept inconsistency in concept-based interpretable neural networks. The method enables users to interactively refine prototypes that inappropriately combine multiple visual features by providing guided splitting functionality. Through a user study across synthetic and real-world datasets, the authors demonstrate significant improvements in prototype consistency while maintaining model accuracy, achieving higher purity compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
YoursProtoP addresses the challenge of concept inconsistency in concept-based interpretable neural networks by enabling interactive prototype refinement. The method works by allowing users to identify problematic prototypes and annotate patches containing distinct concepts. The system then automatically adapts the model architecture to separate these concepts while preserving classification accuracy. The approach was validated through comprehensive user studies on both synthetic (FunnyBirds) and real-world datasets (CUB, CARS, PETS), demonstrating significant improvements in prototype consistency and purity metrics.

## Key Results
- 88.3% of split prototypes rated as more consistent by users
- Higher purity (0.90 vs 0.84) compared to baseline PIP-Net on CUB dataset
- Maintained classification accuracy (84.3%) after prototype splitting
- Significant improvements in prototype consistency across all tested datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by leveraging user expertise to identify and correct concept inconsistencies in prototypes. When users detect that a prototype combines multiple visual features, they can provide annotations that guide the system in splitting the prototype into more coherent parts. The automatic adaptation of model architecture ensures that these changes maintain the model's ability to perform accurate classifications while improving interpretability.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept-based interpretability**: Understanding how neural networks can be interpreted through learned concepts rather than individual neurons. Why needed: Provides the foundation for understanding prototype-based methods. Quick check: Can identify what visual features correspond to learned concepts.

**Prototype splitting**: The process of dividing prototypes that combine multiple concepts into separate, more consistent prototypes. Why needed: Core mechanism for improving interpretability. Quick check: Can determine if a prototype contains multiple distinct concepts.

**User interaction in ML**: Methods for incorporating human feedback into machine learning model refinement. Why needed: Enables personalized interpretability adjustments. Quick check: Can collect and process user annotations effectively.

**Concept consistency**: Measuring whether prototypes represent single, coherent visual concepts. Why needed: Primary metric for evaluating interpretability improvements. Quick check: Can assess if prototypes contain multiple distinct features.

**Purity metrics**: Quantitative measures of how well prototypes represent single concepts. Why needed: Provides objective evaluation of method effectiveness. Quick check: Can calculate purity scores for prototypes.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: User Interface -> Annotation Collection -> Prototype Analysis -> Model Adaptation -> Updated Model
- Users identify inconsistent prototypes through the interface
- System collects user annotations of problematic patches
- Analysis identifies which prototypes need splitting
- Model architecture automatically adapts to separate concepts
- Updated model maintains classification accuracy

**Critical path**: User identifies inconsistent prototype → provides annotations → system processes annotations → model architecture adapts → validation of improved consistency and maintained accuracy

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- User effort vs. automated refinement quality
- Interpretability improvements vs. computational overhead
- Prototype granularity vs. classification accuracy

**Failure signatures**:
- Prototypes remain inconsistent despite user intervention
- Classification accuracy degrades after splitting
- User annotation process becomes too burdensome

**First 3 experiments to run**:
1. Test prototype splitting on synthetic data with known concept distributions
2. Validate accuracy maintenance on controlled datasets with simple concepts
3. Measure user satisfaction with interpretability improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out additional open questions beyond those addressed in the study.

## Limitations
- Scalability to complex domains with overlapping or abstract concepts remains uncertain
- Reliance on user-provided patches introduces potential bias and depends on user expertise
- Computational overhead of the splitting process is not thoroughly addressed
- Long-term stability of models after multiple iterative refinements is not evaluated

## Confidence
- High confidence: Prototype splitting effectiveness on synthetic data (FunnyBirds)
- Medium confidence: Real-world dataset performance (CUB, CARS, PETS)
- Low confidence: Scalability to complex concepts and real-world deployment scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on datasets with more complex, overlapping visual concepts to evaluate scalability limits
2. Conduct longitudinal studies to assess model stability after multiple iterative refinements
3. Compare user experience and annotation burden against alternative interpretability methods
