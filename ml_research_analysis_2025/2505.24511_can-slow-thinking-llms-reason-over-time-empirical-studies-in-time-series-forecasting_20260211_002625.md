core_contribution: Time series forecasting (TSF) traditionally relies on fast-thinking
  paradigms that map historical observations directly to future sequences, often overlooking
  explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics. This paper investigates whether slow-thinking
  large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1, can reason over
  temporal patterns for TSF without task-specific training.

# Can Slow-thinking LLMs Reason Over Time? Empirical Studies in Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24511
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24511
- Reference count: 40
- Slow-thinking LLMs achieve competitive zero-shot time series forecasting through reasoning-based inference without task-specific training

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) can reason over temporal patterns for time series forecasting without task-specific training. The authors propose TimeReasoner, which reformulates TSF as a conditional reasoning task using hybrid instructions and prompting strategies to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that slow-thinking LLMs achieve strong zero-shot forecasting performance, particularly in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. The study highlights both the potential and limitations of reasoning-based forecasting paradigms, offering insights into interpretable and generalizable TSF frameworks.

## Method Summary
TimeReasoner operates through a training-free inference pipeline using slow-thinking LLMs without task-specific fine-tuning. The method constructs hybrid instructions combining instructive prompts, timestamps, raw sequential values (without normalization), and contextual features. Three reasoning strategies are supported: one-shot, decoupled, and rollout reasoning. The approach uses DeepSeek-R1 API with temperature=0.6, top-p=0.7, and max-tokens=8,192, running three independent generations per input and aggregating results via mean. Evaluation is conducted across 10 diverse time series datasets with varying lookback and prediction windows, measuring MSE and MAE with channel-independent evaluation.

## Key Results
- Slow-thinking LLMs achieve competitive zero-shot forecasting performance without task-specific training
- Hybrid instruction with raw values and timestamps outperforms normalization-based approaches
- Reasoning strategy effectiveness varies by horizon: rollout excels at short horizons, decoupled reasoning dominates at long horizons
- Performance degrades predictably when key instruction components (timestamps, context) are removed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hybrid instruction preserves temporal and semantic signals that normalization typically erodes.
- Mechanism: By encoding raw sequential values, timestamps, and contextual descriptions directly into the prompt, the model can reason over absolute magnitudes and calendar-aligned patterns rather than abstracted statistics.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained LLM's semantic knowledge includes useful priors about temporal regularities and domain-specific dynamics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TimeReasoner integrates hybrid instructions consisting of task directives, timestamps, sequential values, and optional contextual features."
  - [section 6.2.1] "Removal [of timestamps] causes a pronounced drop, highlighting the importance of temporal cues."
  - [corpus] Related work "LLM-PS" (arXiv:2503.09656) similarly emphasizes temporal pattern and semantic encoding for LLM-based forecasting, though without the slow-thinking focus.
- Break condition: If raw values exceed the LLM's context window or contain extreme outliers without context, magnitude reasoning may fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Inference-time multi-step reasoning captures regime shifts and contextual dependencies without parameter updates.
- Mechanism: Slow-thinking LLMs generate explicit intermediate reasoning traces (pattern identification → strategy selection → self-reflection), enabling iterative hypothesis revision within a single forward pass.
- Core assumption: The model's reasoning traces meaningfully influence the final numerical output rather than serving as post-hoc rationalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs."
  - [section 6.6.1] "We observe a common three-stage structure: (1) Data inspection and pattern identification; (2) Strategy selection and justification; (3) Self-reflection and contextual checks."
  - [corpus] "Time Series Forecasting as Reasoning" (arXiv:2506.10630) proposes a related reinforced slow-thinking approach, suggesting convergent validation of the paradigm.
- Break condition: If the reasoning chain becomes excessively long, overfitting to transient patterns or amplifying stochastic variability degrades accuracy (see Figure 8 heatmap analysis).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multiple reasoning strategies adapt to different horizon lengths by trading off error propagation versus refinement depth.
- Mechanism: Rollout reasoning minimizes error accumulation at short horizons through incremental prediction; decoupled reasoning enables deeper within-pass refinement for long-horizon dependencies.
- Core assumption: The optimal strategy varies by task configuration (lookback length, predict window) rather than being universally best.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.2.2] "Rollout Reasoning performs best at short horizons (H=48, 96), but its error grows more rapidly as the horizon increases... Decoupled Reasoning becomes the best-performing method at longer horizons."
  - [section 4.4] Describes all three strategies: one-shot, decoupled, and rollout.
  - [corpus] "Evaluating System 1 vs. 2 Reasoning Approaches" (arXiv:2503.01895) directly benchmarks reasoning paradigms for TSF, providing external context on strategy comparison.
- Break condition: If the prediction horizon exceeds the model's effective reasoning coherence length, all strategies exhibit error accumulation regardless of architecture.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Fast-thinking vs. slow-thinking paradigms in sequence modeling**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly contrasts traditional TSF (direct sequence mapping, single inference pass) with slow-thinking approaches (multi-step reasoning, inference-time computation scaling). Understanding this distinction is essential for interpreting why TimeReasoner reformulates TSF as conditional reasoning.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model that maps historical observations directly to future values in one pass might struggle with long-range contextual dependencies?

- **Concept: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and reasoning traces**
  - Why needed here: TimeReasoner relies on eliciting CoT-style reasoning from slow-thinking LLMs. The paper analyzes how reasoning trace length correlates with forecasting accuracy (Figure 8), and failure modes emerge from malformed traces.
  - Quick check question: What is the hypothesized relationship between CoT length and forecasting quality, and at what point does additional reasoning depth become counterproductive?

- **Concept: Zero-shot and training-free inference in foundation models**
  - Why needed here: TimeReasoner operates without task-specific fine-tuning, distinguishing it from prior LLM-based TSF approaches that require adaptation. This requires understanding how pre-trained knowledge transfers to numerical time series reasoning.
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between zero-shot inference flexibility and domain-specific fine-tuning for time series forecasting tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Hybrid Instruction Builder -> Inference-Time Reasoning Engine -> Reasoning Strategy Selector -> Reasoning Exploration Module -> Output Parser

- **Critical path:**
  1. Prepare hybrid instruction (validate timestamp alignment, preserve raw scale, inject domain context if available)
  2. Select reasoning strategy based on horizon length (short → rollout; long → decoupled)
  3. Execute inference with appropriate hyperparameters (temperature=0.6, top-p=0.7 as paper defaults)
  4. Aggregate multiple generations for stability
  5. Validate output format and parse predictions

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Raw vs. normalized input**: Paper shows raw values outperform Z-score and RevIN normalization (Table 3), but this may increase sensitivity to outliers
  - **Reasoning depth vs. stability**: Longer CoT traces correlate with worse MSE rankings (Figure 8), suggesting calibration is essential
  - **Strategy flexibility vs. implementation complexity**: Supporting all three strategies requires additional orchestration logic

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Peak clipping**: Systematic underestimation/overestimation at extremes, flattening turning points
  - **Phase-shift error**: Correct shape but temporal misalignment
  - **Copy-paste repeat**: Direct replication of lookback segments without adaptation
  - **Constant collapse**: Degeneration to near-constant outputs ignoring variability
  - These patterns (Figure 10) indicate reasoning trace degradation rather than numerical precision issues

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline validation**: Replicate Table 2 results on ETTh1 and one additional dataset using DeepSeek-R1 with one-shot reasoning, confirming competitive MSE/MAE against DLinear and PatchTST baselines
  2. **Ablation on hybrid instruction components**: Remove timestamps and separately remove contextual features, measuring performance degradation to validate Table 3 findings (expected: ~3-5x MSE increase without timestamps)
  3. **Strategy horizon sensitivity**: Compare rollout vs. decoupled reasoning across H∈{48, 96, 144, 192} on a single dataset, confirming the crossover pattern in Figure 2 where rollout degrades at longer horizons

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can principled uncertainty quantification be effectively integrated into slow-thinking LLM reasoning traces for time series forecasting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states that reasoning trajectories exhibit uncertainty, explicitly calling for "future work on principled uncertainty quantification."
- Why unresolved: The current study relies on aggregating multiple independent generations to mitigate variability, but it lacks a theoretical framework or mechanism to provide calibrated confidence intervals for the generated forecasts.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that correlates the internal consistency of reasoning tokens with forecast error bounds, providing statistically reliable confidence intervals rather than just point estimates.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can specific failure modes inherent to LLM-based forecasting—such as peak clipping, phase-shift errors, and constant collapse—be systematically mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Failure Case Analysis (Section 6.6.3) identifies these four specific patterns and asserts that "addressing them will require enhancing sensitivity to extremes, improving phase anchoring... and discouraging trivial or degenerate outputs."
- Why unresolved: The paper empirically observes that slow-thinking LLMs naturally drift into these degenerate behaviors (e.g., smoothing out peaks) when extrapolating, but the proposed TimeReasoner framework does not contain mechanisms to prevent them.
- What evidence would resolve it: An augmentation to the prompting strategy or inference constraints that statistically significantly reduces the frequency of these four error types compared to the baseline TimeReasoner performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent can reasoning depth (Chain-of-Thought length) be dynamically calibrated to prevent performance degradation in long-horizon forecasting?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 6.6.1 notes that "excessively long reasoning chains... can degrade predictive performance" by drifting from salient signals, highlighting the need to balance reasoning depth with focus.
- Why unresolved: While the paper observes a negative correlation between excessive CoT length and accuracy, it does not propose a method to control or truncate the reasoning process *during* inference to optimize this trade-off.
- What evidence would resolve it: A stopping criterion or adaptive reasoning strategy that maximizes predictive accuracy (MSE) by terminating the thought process before the "drift" effect occurs, verified across varying prediction horizons.

## Limitations
- Peak clipping and phase-shift errors indicate reasoning traces can degrade numerical precision
- The optimal reasoning strategy varies by horizon length, requiring additional orchestration logic
- Without task-specific fine-tuning, the approach may struggle with datasets requiring specialized domain knowledge or extreme outlier handling

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Hybrid instruction outperforms normalization-based baselines; slow-thinking reasoning provides interpretability advantages over direct mapping; performance degrades predictably when key instruction components are removed
- **Medium confidence**: Cross-dataset generalization claims are promising but based on limited datasets; the three-stage reasoning pattern is consistently observed but its causal relationship to forecasting accuracy needs further validation
- **Low confidence**: The exact prompt template structure and numerical prediction parsing strategy are underspecified, potentially affecting reproducibility of reported results

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce baseline performance** on ETTh1 and one additional dataset using DeepSeek-R1 with one-shot reasoning, confirming competitive MSE/MAE against DLinear and PatchTST baselines
2. **Validate hybrid instruction ablation** by removing timestamps and separately removing contextual features, measuring performance degradation to confirm Table 3 findings
3. **Test strategy horizon sensitivity** by comparing rollout vs. decoupled reasoning across H∈{48, 96, 144, 192} on a single dataset, confirming the crossover pattern where rollout degrades at longer horizons
