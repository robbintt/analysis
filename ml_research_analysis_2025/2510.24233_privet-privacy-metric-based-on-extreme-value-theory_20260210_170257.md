# PRIVET: Privacy Metric Based on Extreme Value Theory

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24233
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24233
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Sample-level privacy metric using extreme value theory to detect memorization in generative models, outperforming global metrics.

## Executive Summary
PRIVET introduces a novel sample-level privacy metric that leverages extreme value theory (EVT) to detect privacy leakage in synthetic data from deep generative models. The method computes nearest-neighbor distances and models their extreme tail behavior to assign interpretable privacy scores to individual synthetic samples. Unlike global metrics, PRIVET can identify specific leaked samples and distinguish between underfitting and memorization, making it particularly effective in low-data regimes and high-dimensional settings.

## Method Summary
PRIVET operates by computing 1-nearest-neighbor distances from synthetic samples to both training and test sets, then fitting the lower tail of the training-to-training distance distribution to a Weibull or Gumbel distribution using EVT. For each synthetic sample ranked r, it calculates the probability of observing that rank under the fitted distribution, producing a log-ratio score comparing training vs test proximity. Samples with extreme negative scores are flagged as privacy leaks. The method is modality-agnostic, working with appropriate distance metrics (Hamming for genomics, Euclidean for embeddings).

## Key Results
- PRIVET consistently detects injected privacy leaks in controlled genetic experiments where global metrics fail.
- The method successfully distinguishes memorization from underfitting by comparing synthetic-to-train vs synthetic-to-test distances.
- PRIVET is robust to low sample sizes and high-dimensional settings where traditional metrics lose sensitivity.
- Critical finding: the choice of embedding representation significantly impacts detection performance, with DINOv2 embeddings failing on certain image transformations while wavelet features succeed.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Tail Modeling of Nearest-Neighbor Distances via EVT
Nearest-neighbor distances in generative modeling follow Extreme Value Theory (EVT) distributions (Weibull or Gumbel), allowing statistical definition of "anomalously close" samples. The algorithm fits the lower tail of training-to-training distances to a parametric EVT form, serving as a null hypothesis for expected proximity. If a synthetic sample's distance falls in the extreme tail, it's flagged as potential memorization. This relies on i.i.d. sampling from an underlying density.

### Mechanism 2: Train-Test Log-Ratio for Underfitting Regimes
Privacy leakage is detected even under underfitting by comparing likelihood of synthetic sample proximity to training vs test sets. The log-ratio score Δπr = log(πtrain/πtest) identifies samples significantly closer to training than test, implying specific training information retention rather than general distribution learning. This differentiates "copying" from "learning general features" when global metrics suggest underfitting.

### Mechanism 3: Order Statistics for Sample-Level Granularity
Using r-th order statistics provides interpretable, sample-level probabilities rather than single global scores. Instead of minimum distance, the algorithm examines distance distribution sorted by rank r, computing probability of observing r-th smallest distance via binomial statistics from EVT fit. This identifies specific leaked samples (local assessment) and aggregates to global risk metric (NPL - Number of Privacy Leaks).

## Foundational Learning

- **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**: Provides mathematical basis for modeling distribution tails (rare events). Here, rare events are very small distances between data points. Understanding EVT is necessary to grasp why Weibull/Gumbel distributions are chosen over Gaussian assumptions. Quick check: Why is a Gaussian distribution insufficient for modeling probability of exact duplicate?

- **Nearest Neighbor (NN) Statistics**: Core metric relies on distance to nearest neighbor as proxy for "uniqueness" or "memorization." Must understand how distance metrics (Hamming, Euclidean) define neighborhood. Quick check: How does curse of dimensionality affect reliability of nearest-neighbor distances in high-dimensional genetic data?

- **Overfitting vs. Memorization**: PRIVET explicitly distinguishes model failure to generalize (underfitting) from data leakage (privacy breach). Mechanism detects divergence between train and test proximity that persists even when model hasn't fully converged. Quick check: Can model leak private information even if FID score suggests underfitting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Layer (Train Set, Test Set, Synthetic Set) -> Distance Engine (1-NN distances) -> EVT Calibrator (Weibull/Gumbel fit) -> Scoring Module (binomial CDF, log-ratio) -> Output (per-sample flags, global NPL)
- **Critical path**: EVT fit on Train-Train distances is most sensitive step. Poor calibration (wrong tail quantile) causes miscalibrated probability scores.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Metric Choice - embedding selection significantly impacts performance (DINOv2 fails on certain image transformations). Tail Threshold - trade-off between statistical robustness and adherence to extreme value limit.
- **Failure signatures**: Embedding Collapse - high false negatives in image data because semantic embeddings don't align with pixel-level duplication metrics. Small Test Sets - high variance in privacy score if test set too small.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run PRIVET on controlled genetic experiment with fcopy=0.5, verify NPL matches ground truth injected copies. 2) Run copycat experiment on CIFAR-10 using DINOv2 vs Wavelet features, confirm DINOv2 fails on JPEG/Elastic transforms. 3) Train RBM for 1 epoch (underfitting), inject exact duplicates, verify PRIVET detects them despite global underfitting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
To what extent do residual dependencies between nearest-neighbor distances of close-by synthetic samples violate the independence assumption used in binomial estimation of PRIVET scores? The authors state these dependencies are "sub-dominant" but don't quantify impact on calibration. Evidence needed: theoretical or empirical analysis comparing error rates under independence assumption vs model accounting for spatial correlation.

### Open Question 2
How can feature representations be optimized to ensure distance metrics capture perceptually meaningful near-duplicates in privacy audits? The paper identifies DINOv2 failure as critical limitation but doesn't propose method for creating privacy-specific embeddings. Evidence needed: benchmark using modified/fine-tuned embedding space that successfully aligns low Euclidean distance with high perceptual similarity for transformations where DINOv2 fails.

### Open Question 3
Can distance metric assigning greater weight to sensitive features be effectively integrated into PRIVET to detect leaks when private information contributes marginally to overall data variance? This is proposed as mitigation strategy but not implemented. Evidence needed: extension using weighted distance metric (e.g., emphasizing rare alleles) demonstrating superior detection rates in low-contribution leakage scenarios.

## Limitations
- EVT tail calibration assumes i.i.d. sampling and sufficient tail data, may fail for highly discrete domains or very small sample sizes.
- Sensitivity to embedding choice means privacy metric inherits representation limitations rather than measuring intrinsic data similarity.
- Underfitting detection mechanism requires representative test set, which may not exist for truly novel synthetic distributions.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: EVT-based mechanism for modeling nearest-neighbor distances and controlled experiments demonstrating privacy leak detection are methodologically sound and well-validated.

**Medium Confidence**: Modality-agnostic claims require qualification - embedding choice significantly impacts performance, particularly for images where semantic embeddings may not capture pixel-level duplication.

**Low Confidence**: Assertion that PRIVET "consistently outperforms" existing metrics across all regimes is based on comparison with limited baselines in controlled settings; real-world performance remains to be demonstrated.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Non-IID Data**: Test PRIVET on genetic data with population structure (non-i.i.d. sampling) to verify EVT assumptions hold when i.i.d. assumption is violated.

2. **Embedding Ablation Study**: Systematically compare multiple embedding strategies (DINOv2, random features, learned representations) across same image datasets to quantify how representation choice affects privacy detection rates.

3. **Small Sample Regime**: Evaluate PRIVET's performance when training sets contain fewer than 100 samples to determine minimum viable sample size for reliable EVT tail fitting.
