# Exact Evaluation of the Accuracy of Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems with Gaussian Data Distributions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07008
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07008
- Reference count: 40
- This work introduces a Conditional Gaussian Diffusion Model (CGDM) that leverages exact Gaussian formulas for forward and backward processes in inverse problems with Gaussian data distributions.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the accuracy of diffusion models as priors for solving inverse problems with Gaussian data distributions, focusing on deblurring tasks. The authors introduce a Conditional Gaussian Diffusion Model (CGDM) that exploits exact Gaussian formulas for the forward and backward processes, enabling precise evaluation of algorithm performance. Through rigorous comparison using the 2-Wasserstein distance metric, the study demonstrates that CGDM provides superior accuracy in approximating the true conditional distribution compared to existing methods like Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and Pseudoinverse-Guided Diffusion Models (ΠGDM). While ΠGDM offers computational efficiency, CGDM emerges as the more faithful approach for uncertainty quantification in inverse problems under Gaussian assumptions.

## Method Summary
The study develops a framework for exact evaluation of diffusion model accuracy in inverse problems by leveraging the closed-form expressions available when data distributions are Gaussian. The authors introduce the Conditional Gaussian Diffusion Model (CGDM) that uses analytical formulas for both the forward process (adding Gaussian noise) and backward process (denoising). They compare CGDM against two existing algorithms - Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and Pseudoinverse-Guided Diffusion Models (ΠGDM) - using the 2-Wasserstein distance as a rigorous metric for distribution comparison. The Gaussian assumption enables derivation of exact conditional distributions, allowing precise measurement of how well each algorithm approximates the true posterior. The experimental setup focuses on deblurring tasks where ground truth conditional distributions can be computed analytically.

## Key Results
- CGDM demonstrates superior alignment with the true conditional law compared to DPS and ΠGDM under Gaussian assumptions
- ΠGDM exhibits computational efficiency but notable bias in posterior approximation
- DPS fails to adequately capture the posterior distribution, showing significant deviation from ground truth
- The 2-Wasserstein distance metric provides a rigorous quantitative measure for comparing algorithm performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology succeeds because it exploits the mathematical tractability of Gaussian distributions to derive exact formulas for the forward and backward processes in diffusion models. Under Gaussian assumptions, the conditional distributions can be computed analytically, providing ground truth against which algorithms can be evaluated. The 2-Wasserstein distance offers a geometrically meaningful metric for comparing probability distributions, capturing both location and shape differences. By working in the Gaussian regime where closed-form solutions exist, the study can precisely quantify the approximation error introduced by different algorithmic approaches, revealing systematic biases and failure modes that would be difficult to detect in more general settings.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
CGDM -> Forward Process (Gaussian) -> Backward Process (Analytical) -> Conditional Distribution -> 2-Wasserstein Evaluation

**Critical Path**
The critical path involves: (1) defining the Gaussian forward process, (2) deriving the analytical backward process, (3) generating samples from the conditional distribution, and (4) computing the 2-Wasserstein distance to ground truth.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The Gaussian assumption enables exact analysis but severely limits practical applicability. CGDM prioritizes accuracy over computational efficiency, while ΠGDM trades accuracy for speed. The choice of 2-Wasserstein distance balances geometric interpretability with computational tractability.

**Failure Signatures**
Algorithms exhibit systematic biases when deviating from Gaussian assumptions. DPS shows significant deviation from ground truth conditional distributions. ΠGDM displays computational efficiency but accuracy compromises. Non-Gaussian noise models reveal limitations of the exact analysis framework.

**First Experiments**
1. Implement CGDM with varying noise schedules to study impact on posterior approximation
2. Compare 2-Wasserstein distances across multiple blur kernel configurations
3. Evaluate computational time versus accuracy tradeoffs between CGDM and ΠGDM

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Restrictive Gaussian data distribution assumption limits applicability to real-world scenarios
- Exact formulas may not generalize to non-Gaussian or multimodal posterior distributions
- 2-Wasserstein distance metric may not capture all aspects of practical performance
- Computational efficiency claims require more extensive benchmarking across diverse problem scales

## Confidence
- Theoretical derivations under Gaussian assumptions: High
- Practical relevance beyond synthetic deblurring tasks: Medium
- Generalization to non-Gaussian noise models: Low
- Computational efficiency comparisons: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test algorithms on non-Gaussian noise models (e.g., Poisson, Laplacian) to assess robustness beyond theoretical assumptions
2. Evaluate performance on real-world imaging datasets with known ground truth to validate synthetic results
3. Conduct ablation studies on the impact of different forward process parameterizations on posterior approximation quality
