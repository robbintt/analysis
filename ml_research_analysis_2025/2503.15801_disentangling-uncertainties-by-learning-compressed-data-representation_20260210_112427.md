# Disentangling Uncertainities by Learning Compressed Data Representation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.15801
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15801
- **Reference count**: 6
- **Primary result**: Proposed CDRM achieves AUROCs of 0.8876 and 0.9981 on uncertainty separation tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in learned regressive system dynamics models, which are crucial for safe control and reinforcement learning applications. Traditional methods like Gaussian Processes, Bayesian networks, and model ensembles suffer from high computational complexity or inaccurate uncertainty estimation. The authors propose a Compressed Data Representation Model (CDRM) that learns a neural network encoding of the data distribution using contrastive loss with Langevin dynamics sampling, enabling direct sampling from the output distribution without being constrained to a Gaussian prior.

The CDRM approach theoretically achieves better memory and computational complexity compared to bin-based compression methods while demonstrating superior capability to separately identify aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Empirical evaluations show CDRM can handle multimodal output distributions, a challenging scenario where existing methods consistently fail, achieving high AUROC scores on test sets containing mixtures of both uncertainty types.

## Method Summary
The CDRM method learns a compressed representation of the data distribution using a neural network encoder trained with contrastive loss. Langevin dynamics sampling is employed to enable direct sampling from the learned output distribution without assuming a Gaussian prior. This approach allows the model to capture complex, potentially multimodal output distributions while maintaining computational efficiency through compressed representation. The contrastive loss function helps the model learn meaningful representations that can distinguish between different types of uncertainty, while the compressed encoding reduces memory requirements compared to traditional bin-based methods.

## Key Results
- CDRM achieves AUROCs of 0.8876 and 0.9981 on a single test set containing a mixture of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties
- The method demonstrates superior capability to separately identify both uncertainty types compared to existing approaches
- CDRM successfully handles multimodal output distributions, a scenario where existing methods consistently fail

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CDRM works by learning a compressed representation of the data distribution that captures the essential characteristics needed for uncertainty estimation. The contrastive loss function encourages the model to learn meaningful representations that can distinguish between different uncertainty types, while Langevin dynamics sampling enables direct sampling from the learned distribution. By avoiding the constraint of a Gaussian prior, CDRM can capture complex, multimodal output distributions that better reflect real-world uncertainty patterns. The compressed representation reduces computational overhead while maintaining the ability to separate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties effectively.

## Foundational Learning
- **Aleatoric uncertainty**: Represents inherent randomness in the data that cannot be reduced with more information. Why needed: Critical for understanding the fundamental limits of predictability in system dynamics. Quick check: Verify that the model captures irreducible noise in the training data.
- **Epistemic uncertainty**: Represents uncertainty due to limited data or model capacity that can be reduced with more information. Why needed: Essential for identifying areas where the model needs improvement or additional data. Quick check: Ensure the model identifies regions with sparse training data as high epistemic uncertainty.
- **Contrastive loss**: A loss function that learns representations by comparing similar and dissimilar pairs. Why needed: Enables the model to learn meaningful compressed representations that capture uncertainty characteristics. Quick check: Verify that similar data points have closer representations than dissimilar ones.
- **Langevin dynamics sampling**: A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for sampling from complex distributions. Why needed: Allows direct sampling from the learned output distribution without Gaussian assumptions. Quick check: Confirm that samples follow the learned distribution characteristics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input data -> Neural network encoder -> Compressed latent representation -> Contrastive loss + Langevin dynamics -> Output distribution

**Critical path**: Data input flows through the neural network encoder to produce a compressed latent representation, which is then used with contrastive loss and Langevin dynamics sampling to generate the output distribution that captures both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

**Design tradeoffs**: The compressed representation reduces memory and computational requirements but may lose some fine-grained information. The contrastive loss enables better representation learning but adds complexity to training. Avoiding Gaussian priors allows handling multimodal distributions but requires more sophisticated sampling methods.

**Failure signatures**: Poor uncertainty separation indicates issues with contrastive loss training or latent space dimensionality. Inability to handle multimodal distributions suggests insufficient model capacity or inadequate sampling. High computational overhead may indicate inefficient compression or sampling implementation.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test CDRM on synthetic data with known aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components to verify separation capability
2. Evaluate performance on multimodal synthetic distributions to confirm handling of complex output patterns
3. Compare computational requirements and memory usage against bin-based compression baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method's effectiveness on multimodal output distributions was validated on synthetic or controlled test scenarios rather than complex real-world systems where mode collapse or representation drift could occur
- Contrastive loss with Langevin dynamics sampling introduces computational overhead that scales with latent space dimensionality, potentially limiting applicability to high-dimensional state spaces common in robotics or autonomous systems
- Theoretical complexity advantages over bin-based methods assume idealized conditions that may not hold when dealing with noisy, high-dimensional data distributions in practice

## Confidence

**High confidence**: CDRM's superior AUROC scores on uncertainty separation tasks and its ability to handle multimodal distributions compared to baseline methods.

**Medium confidence**: The theoretical memory and computational complexity advantages, as these depend heavily on implementation details and data characteristics not fully explored in the paper.

**Low confidence**: Real-world applicability to safety-critical control systems, given the limited validation on synthetic test sets rather than deployed systems.

## Next Checks

1. Test CDRM on high-dimensional real-world robotic control datasets to verify scalability and performance under realistic noise conditions.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of Langevin dynamics sampling versus alternative sampling strategies to the uncertainty disentanglement performance.
3. Evaluate CDRM's uncertainty estimates during active learning or exploration phases in reinforcement learning to assess whether epistemic uncertainty guides effective exploration.
