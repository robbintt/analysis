# StructCoh: Structured Contrastive Learning for Context-Aware Text Semantic Matching

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.02033
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02033
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves 86.7% F1-score on legal statute matching, representing a 6.2% absolute gain over state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
StructCoh introduces a graph-enhanced contrastive learning framework that addresses limitations in text semantic matching by combining structural reasoning with representation optimization. The method employs a dual-graph encoder that constructs syntactic dependency graphs and topic interaction graphs, then uses graph isomorphism networks to propagate structural features. A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at multiple granularities through node-level regularization and graph-aware contrastive learning with dynamic negative sampling. Experiments on legal document matching and academic plagiarism detection benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements, with StructCoh achieving 86.7% F1-score on legal statute matching, representing a 6.2% absolute gain over state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs two complementary graph views for each text segment: a Syntactic Dependency Graph capturing grammatical structure through tokens and POS tags, and a Topic Interaction Graph encoding entity relationships and topic co-occurrences. Both graphs are processed by Graph Isomorphism Networks to generate node embeddings, which are then fused through cross-graph attention mechanisms. The method employs hierarchical contrastive learning with node-level InfoNCE loss for fine-grained alignment and graph-level InfoNCE loss with dynamic hard negative mining for global consistency. The dual-graph approach enables the model to capture both surface-level syntactic patterns and deeper semantic relationships between topics and entities.

## Key Results
- Achieves 86.7% F1-score on legal statute matching (COLIEE-2023), representing 6.2% absolute improvement over previous state-of-the-art
- Demonstrates consistent performance gains across GLUE benchmarks including MRPC, QQP, STS-B, MNLI, QNLI, and RTE
- Shows particular effectiveness in identifying argument structure similarities and handling paraphrased content through structured representation alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-graph architecture enables the model to capture complementary aspects of text structure simultaneously. The syntactic dependency graph provides grammatical and structural information that helps identify argument patterns and logical relationships, while the topic interaction graph captures semantic relationships between entities and concepts. The hierarchical contrastive learning framework ensures that both fine-grained token-level alignments and global document-level similarities are optimized. Dynamic hard negative mining focuses training on challenging cases where texts have high surface similarity but different meanings, improving the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN):** Needed for processing graph-structured data while preserving structural information. Quick check: verify GIN can distinguish different graph structures through injective readout functions.
- **Syntactic Dependency Parsing:** Required to extract grammatical relationships and argument structures. Quick check: ensure dependency trees capture subject-verb-object relationships accurately.
- **Topic Modeling/NER:** Essential for constructing the topic interaction graph with meaningful entity and topic nodes. Quick check: verify extracted entities correspond to real-world concepts in the text.
- **Contrastive Learning with InfoNCE:** Core mechanism for learning representations that bring similar texts closer while pushing dissimilar ones apart. Quick check: confirm temperature scaling produces stable training dynamics.
- **Dynamic Hard Negative Mining:** Improves learning efficiency by focusing on challenging negative samples. Quick check: verify mining threshold identifies truly difficult negative pairs.
- **Cross-graph Attention Fusion:** Combines syntactic and semantic features into unified representations. Quick check: ensure attention weights properly reflect the importance of each graph view.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Text -> Stanford CoreNLP Parser -> Syntactic Dependency Graph -> GIN Encoder -> Node Embeddings -> Cross-Attention -> Topic Graph -> GIN Encoder -> Node Embeddings -> Attentive Pooling -> Global Representation -> Contrastive Loss
- **Critical Path:** Graph Construction (Stanford CoreNLP + NER/LDA) -> Dual-Graph Encoding (GIN) -> Cross-Attention Fusion -> Hierarchical Contrastive Learning (Node-level + Graph-level)
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Dual-graph approach increases computational complexity but provides richer structural information; hierarchical loss improves fine-grained alignment but requires careful hyperparameter tuning
- **Failure Signatures:** GPU OOM during batch processing, loss divergence with NaN values, poor performance on paraphrased content suggesting ineffective structural alignment
- **Three First Experiments:**
  1. Verify graph construction pipeline produces valid dependency trees and topic graphs from sample legal text
  2. Test GIN encoder output dimensionality and ensure cross-attention fusion produces meaningful combined embeddings
  3. Validate contrastive loss computation with simple synthetic data where ground truth alignments are known

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Node alignment strategy for contrastive loss is only broadly described as "strict string matching or entity matching" without specifying exact implementation
- Dynamic hard negative sampling threshold (γ) is described as tunable but without empirical guidance on optimal values
- Specific initialization strategy for GIN layers and optimization hyperparameters are not provided

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Dual-graph architecture combining syntactic dependencies with topic interaction graphs is clearly specified and theoretically sound
- **Medium Confidence:** Hierarchical contrastive learning framework is well-defined but effectiveness depends heavily on unspecified threshold parameter
- **Low Confidence:** Ablation studies lack detail on whether components were tested in isolation or with shared parameters

## Next Checks
1. Systematically vary the hard negative sampling threshold γ (0.5-0.9) and document its impact on both legal domain F1-scores and GLUE benchmark performance
2. Compare strict string matching versus entity-based alignment for defining positive node pairs in the contrastive loss and measure effect on convergence speed
3. Evaluate StructCoh on non-legal, non-academic text matching tasks (e.g., product description matching, news article clustering) to assess cross-domain generalization
