# Faster Verified Explanations for Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.00164
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00164
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** FaVeX computes verified explanations significantly faster than prior work, enabling verifier-optimal explanations on larger networks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FaVeX, an algorithm that accelerates the computation of verified explanations for neural network predictions. FaVeX combines batch and sequential processing of input features while reusing information from previous verification queries. The method introduces verifier-optimal robust explanations that partition features into invariants, counterfactuals, and unknowns, explicitly accounting for verifier incompleteness. Experimental results show FaVeX significantly reduces computation time for standard robust explanations on small networks and enables efficient computation of verifier-optimal explanations on larger convolutional networks.

## Method Summary
FaVeX accelerates verified explanation computation by combining batch processing (via binary search) with sequential feature processing, and by reusing information from previous verification queries. The algorithm integrates with the OVAL branch-and-bound verifier, using α-β-CROWN for bounds, Gurobi for MILP subproblems, and ReLU splitting. Key optimizations include restricted-space counterfactual search (PGD-10) and branch reuse through caching leaf constraints. The method also introduces verifier-optimal robust explanations that explicitly partition input features into invariants, counterfactuals, and unknowns, rather than forcing binary decisions on all features.

## Key Results
- FaVeX significantly reduces computation time for standard robust explanations on small networks (FC-10x2, FC-50x2)
- The algorithm enables efficient computation of verifier-optimal explanations on larger convolutional networks (CNN-3, CNN-7)
- FaVeX finds hundreds of counterfactuals in networks with hundreds of thousands of non-linear activations
- Verifier-optimal setting yields substantially more counterfactuals than standard robust explanations on large networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The acceleration comes from two main mechanisms: (1) batch processing via binary search reduces the number of expensive verification queries, and (2) reusing information from previous queries through branch reuse avoids redundant computations. The verifier-optimal explanation framework explicitly handles verifier incompleteness by allowing "unknown" regions, which enables more efficient search strategies and produces more informative explanations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Branch-and-bound verification:** Systematic exploration of the input space to verify neural network properties; needed for formally certifying explanations
- **α-β-CROWN bounds:** Efficient linear relaxation techniques for neural network verification; provide sound over-approximations for bounding activations
- **Leaf reuse mechanism:** Caching and reusing constraints from previously explored verification paths; reduces redundant computation across queries
- **Restricted-space search:** Limiting the search space for counterfactuals using PGD-based initialization; improves efficiency of finding counter-examples
- **Verifier incompleteness:** Recognition that formal verifiers may not terminate or may be inconclusive; necessitates handling "unknown" regions in explanations

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Input images → FaVeX traversal → OVAL verifier (α-β-CROWN + Gurobi + ReLU splitting) → Verified explanations
- **Critical path:** Image → Feature traversal (batch+sequential) → Verification queries (with leaf reuse) → Explanation output
- **Design tradeoffs:** Batch processing vs. sequential processing (speed vs. precision), caching depth vs. memory usage, verifier optimality vs. computation time
- **Failure signatures:** Zero counterfactuals in standard setting (expected), slow runtimes with deep leaf reuse (tune cache limit), incorrect feature ordering (verify traversal strategy)
- **First experiments:** 1) Implement FaVeX with OVAL on CNN-3 using MNIST/CIFAR-10; 2) Compare "Standard" vs "Verifier-optimal" settings; 3) Test impact of cache limit k on runtime and memory

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Can more complex strategies for reusing information across queries further accelerate the verification process?** The paper identifies exploring more complex ways to re-use information from various queries as a promising direction for improving scalability.
- **How do different training methods interact with the formal explainability of neural networks?** The authors explicitly list exploring the interaction between training methods and formal explanability as a key direction for future work.
- **Can verifier-optimal robust explanations be effectively adapted to non-vision data domains?** The conclusion states that testing and potentially adapting verifier-optimal robust explanations and FaVeX to other data domains is an exciting avenue for future work.

## Limitations
- Exact model architectures and training configurations are not fully specified, particularly for FC-10x2 and FC-50x2 models
- Implementation details of the OVAL verifier's branching heuristic and its integration with FaVeX are not provided
- Evaluation is limited to small-scale experiments, leaving scalability to very large networks uncertain

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the conceptual framework of verifier-optimal explanations and the use of branch-and-bound with leaf reuse for acceleration
- **Medium confidence** in the scalability claims for larger networks, as the evaluation is limited to small-scale experiments
- **Low confidence** in the reproducibility of exact runtimes and counterfactual counts without access to source code and model checkpoints

## Next Checks
1. Implement FaVeX and run on CNN-3 (first 10 MNIST/CIFAR-10 images) to verify speedup over standard verification and the yield of counterfactuals in the verifier-optimal setting
2. Test the impact of the cache limit k on runtime and memory usage to determine an optimal value for leaf reuse
3. Compare the explanation sizes and runtimes of FaVeX with and without the traversal strategy to validate its contribution to efficiency
