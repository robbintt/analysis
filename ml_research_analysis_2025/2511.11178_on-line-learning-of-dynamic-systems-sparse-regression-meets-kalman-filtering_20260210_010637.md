# On-line learning of dynamic systems: sparse regression meets Kalman filtering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11178
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11178
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents the Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF), a novel framework that combines sparse regression (Sindy) with Kalman filtering to enable real-time identification of nonlinear dynamical systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF), a unified framework that bridges sparse regression and Kalman filtering for real-time identification of nonlinear dynamical systems. The key innovation treats unknown system parameters as dynamic states, enabling the filter to estimate parsimonious models from streaming data without requiring validation datasets. SKF demonstrates three key capabilities: identifying time-invariant systems, tracking smoothly time-varying parameters, and detecting abrupt changes in switching systems.

The approach is validated on chaotic Lorenz systems with drifting or switching parameters and real aircraft flight data, showing that SKF can recover interpretable sparse models while maintaining strong predictive capability. The method uses prediction error minimization to automatically estimate sparsity levels and variance parameters, providing a practical solution for online system identification that unifies two previously separate frameworks.

## Method Summary
The Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) combines sparse regression (Sindy) with Kalman filtering by treating unknown system parameters as states in a dynamic system. The method works by augmenting the state vector with model parameters, allowing the Kalman filter to simultaneously estimate the system state and identify the governing equations from streaming data. Prediction error minimization is used to automatically estimate sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants without requiring validation data. The filter maintains linear computational complexity with respect to dataset size while providing sparse, interpretable models with strong predictive capability for future system behavior.

## Key Results
- Recovers time-invariant systems matching classical Sindy performance
- Identifies smoothly time-varying systems with parameters evolving as stochastic processes
- Detects abrupt changes in switching systems with automatic estimation of switching instants
- Demonstrates effectiveness on chaotic Lorenz systems and real aircraft flight data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by unifying sparse regression and Kalman filtering through parameter augmentation. By treating unknown parameters as states in the Kalman filter, the system can continuously update model structure and coefficients as new data arrives. The prediction error minimization automatically tunes sparsity levels and noise parameters, eliminating the need for validation data. This creates a closed-loop system where parameter estimates, model structure, and noise characteristics co-evolve in real-time.

## Foundational Learning
- Sparse regression (Sindy): Identifies parsimonious models by selecting relevant terms from a library of candidate functions; needed for interpretability and avoiding overfitting in system identification
- Kalman filtering: Recursive Bayesian estimation for state estimation in dynamic systems; needed for real-time processing of streaming data
- Parameter augmentation: Treating model parameters as dynamic states; needed to unify parameter identification with state estimation
- Prediction error minimization: Automatic parameter tuning without validation data; needed for practical real-time deployment
- Switching systems: Models with discrete parameter changes; needed to handle abrupt system changes in real-world applications

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Data -> Library construction -> SKF filter -> Parameter estimates -> Model structure -> Predictions
- Critical path: Streaming data → Library generation → Parameter augmentation → Kalman update → Sparsity selection → Model output
- Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. computational complexity; model sparsity vs. predictive power; automatic tuning vs. manual parameter selection
- Failure signatures: Over-sparse models (underfitting), over-complex models (overfitting), sensitivity to initial conditions, poor handling of high-dimensional systems
- First experiments: 1) Simple linear system identification, 2) Lorenz system with known time-varying parameters, 3) Aircraft model with switching dynamics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Scalability to high-dimensional systems with many potential terms remains untested
- Automatic sparsity selection may be sensitive to noise levels and could select overly sparse or complex models
- Performance characterization relies heavily on synthetic chaotic systems and a single aircraft dataset

## Confidence
- High confidence in the theoretical framework unification of Sindy and Kalman filtering
- Medium confidence in the automatic sparsity and parameter estimation mechanisms based on current experimental evidence
- Medium confidence in real-time performance claims without extensive computational complexity analysis
- Low confidence in scalability claims without testing on higher-dimensional systems

## Next Checks
1. Test SKF on high-dimensional nonlinear systems (e.g., multi-agent systems or large-scale mechanical systems) to verify scalability claims
2. Conduct systematic sensitivity analysis of the automatic sparsity selection mechanism under varying noise conditions and different system complexities
3. Evaluate SKF's performance on non-chaotic, steady-state systems to assess robustness across different dynamical regimes beyond the current focus on time-varying and switching systems
