# TrajAware: Graph Cross-Attention and Trajectory-Aware for Generalisable VANETs under Partial Observations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.06665
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06665
- **Reference count**: 28
- **Primary result**: Reinforcement learning framework for VANET routing that achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios across diverse network sizes without retraining

## Executive Summary
TrajAware introduces a reinforcement learning framework for vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) routing that addresses the challenges of dynamic topologies and partial observations. The method combines action space pruning, graph cross-attention, and trajectory-aware prediction to enable generalizable routing decisions across varying network conditions. Evaluated using SUMO simulator with real-world city maps, TrajAware demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving near-optimal paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for edge devices.

## Method Summary
TrajAware employs a three-component reinforcement learning approach for VANET routing. Action space pruning reduces redundant neighbor options while preserving reachability, addressing the combinatorial complexity of routing decisions. Graph cross-attention enables the model to generalize across diverse network sizes by learning attention patterns between nodes. Trajectory-aware prediction estimates real-time vehicle positions under partial observations, compensating for incomplete network information. The framework is trained using a leave-one-city-out validation approach with SUMO simulator and real-world maps, demonstrating robust performance across unseen environments without requiring retraining.

## Key Results
- Achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios in both full and partial observation scenarios
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in diverse network conditions and across unseen environments
- Maintains high generalisability without retraining while operating efficiently on constrained edge devices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its three integrated components working synergistically. Action space pruning reduces the decision complexity from O(n) to manageable levels while preserving critical routing information through reachability analysis. Graph cross-attention allows the model to learn transferable patterns across different network topologies, enabling generalization without retraining. Trajectory-aware prediction compensates for partial observations by estimating vehicle positions using learned motion patterns, ensuring routing decisions remain effective even with incomplete information. This combination addresses the core challenges of VANETs: dynamic topologies, partial observability, and the need for generalizable solutions across diverse urban environments.

## Foundational Learning

**Graph Neural Networks**: Neural networks that operate on graph-structured data by aggregating information from neighboring nodes
- *Why needed*: To process VANET topology information and learn transferable patterns across different network sizes
- *Quick check*: Can the model maintain performance when network size changes by 50%?

**Reinforcement Learning for Routing**: Using RL agents to learn optimal routing policies through interaction with network environments
- *Why needed*: To adapt to dynamic VANET conditions where traditional shortest-path algorithms fail
- *Quick check*: Does the agent improve performance over time with more training episodes?

**Attention Mechanisms**: Neural network components that learn to focus on relevant parts of input data
- *Why needed*: To identify important node relationships in complex VANET topologies
- *Quick check*: Can the model identify critical nodes in high-density traffic scenarios?

**Trajectory Prediction**: Estimating future positions of moving objects based on historical motion patterns
- *Why needed*: To compensate for partial observations in VANETs where not all vehicles are visible
- *Quick check*: What is the prediction error under high-speed or erratic movement conditions?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: VANET Environment -> Partial Observations -> Trajectory Prediction -> Graph Representation -> Action Space Pruning -> Graph Cross-Attention -> Routing Decision -> Reward Signal

**Critical Path**: The trajectory prediction and graph cross-attention components form the critical path, as they directly impact routing decisions under partial observations. Action space pruning serves as a preprocessing step that significantly reduces computational complexity without sacrificing performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades some routing optimality for generalization and computational efficiency. While the pruned action space may occasionally eliminate theoretically optimal paths, the reduction in complexity enables real-time operation on edge devices and ensures consistent performance across diverse environments.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation typically manifests as increased path lengths or reduced delivery ratios in highly dynamic scenarios with rapid topology changes. The model may struggle when pruning eliminates critical alternative paths or when trajectory predictions fail under unusual movement patterns.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Validate action space pruning effectiveness by comparing reachability preservation across different pruning ratios
2. Test graph cross-attention generalization by evaluating performance on networks 2-3x larger than training instances
3. Assess trajectory prediction accuracy under varying observation window sizes and vehicle densities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on simulation with SUMO, lacking real-world deployment validation
- Leave-one-city-out validation may not capture extreme environmental variations or different traffic dynamics
