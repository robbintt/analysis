# Bispectral OT: Dataset Comparison using Symmetry-Aware Optimal Transport

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.20678
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20678
- Authors: Annabel Ma; Kaiying Hou; David Alvarez-Melis; Melanie Weber
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces Bispectral Optimal Transport (BOT) that achieves 84% class preservation accuracy on rotated MNIST vs 33% for naive OT

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Bispectral Optimal Transport (BOT), a symmetry-aware extension of optimal transport that compares data using bispectral representations invariant to group actions. The key innovation is computing transport plans in a bispectral feature space that removes nuisance variation (like rotations) while preserving discriminative structure, enabling meaningful correspondences based on semantic labels rather than geometric orientation. Experiments on benchmark datasets transformed with rotations demonstrate that BOT achieves substantially higher class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT across all datasets and distance metrics.

## Method Summary
The method extends optimal transport to handle datasets with group symmetries by computing transport plans in a bispectral feature space. This bispectral representation captures second-order statistics that are invariant to group actions while preserving discriminative structure. The approach computes pairwise distances between bispectral features of datasets, then solves the optimal transport problem in this invariant space. The bispectral features are constructed using group Fourier transforms and bispectral invariants, allowing the method to identify correspondences based on semantic similarity rather than geometric orientation. The transport plan obtained in this invariant space can then be mapped back to the original feature space for interpretation.

## Key Results
- BOT improves MNIST matching accuracy from 33% to 84% when comparing rotated to unrotated images
- MDS visualizations show rotation-invariant bispectral space clusters digits by label while raw pixel features scatter uniformly
- BOT brings rotationally symmetric digits (6 and 9) closer together in the bispectral space compared to naive OT

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BOT works by transforming data into a bispectral representation that is invariant to group actions while preserving discriminative structure. This allows the optimal transport computation to focus on semantic differences rather than geometric variations. The bispectral features capture second-order statistics through group Fourier transforms, creating a representation where rotationally equivalent objects have similar bispectral signatures. This invariance property ensures that the transport plan captures meaningful correspondences based on class labels rather than superficial geometric differences like orientation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Optimal Transport**: Mathematical framework for comparing probability distributions by finding minimal cost mappings between them. Needed for computing dataset correspondences. Quick check: Can compute Wasserstein distance between two discrete distributions.
- **Group Theory and Symmetry**: Mathematical framework for describing transformations that preserve structure (rotations, reflections, etc.). Needed to formalize nuisance variation. Quick check: Can identify symmetry group for a given dataset.
- **Bispectral Invariants**: Features computed from second-order statistics that remain unchanged under group actions. Needed to create rotation-invariant representations. Quick check: Can compute bispectral features for rotated images.
- **Group Fourier Transforms**: Mathematical tool for decomposing functions on groups into frequency components. Needed to construct bispectral invariants. Quick check: Can apply Fourier transform on rotation group SO(2).
- **Feature Space Optimal Transport**: Computing OT in learned or transformed feature spaces rather than raw data space. Needed to incorporate domain knowledge. Quick check: Can solve OT problem using precomputed features.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Data -> Bispectral Feature Extraction -> Bispectral Distance Matrix -> Optimal Transport Solver -> Transport Plan

**Critical Path**: The bispectral feature extraction is the critical component that enables symmetry-awareness. Without proper invariance properties, the transport plan would be dominated by geometric differences rather than semantic similarities.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Computational cost vs invariance: Bispectral features are more expensive to compute than raw features but provide rotation invariance
- Representation power vs simplicity: Bispectral representations capture more structure than first-order features but are less interpretable
- Exact vs approximate invariance: Perfect invariance may be computationally prohibitive, requiring approximation strategies

**Failure Signatures**:
- Poor class preservation indicates insufficient invariance in bispectral features
- High computational cost suggests need for feature approximation or dimensionality reduction
- Unstable transport plans indicate sensitivity to hyperparameters in bispectral computation

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare bispectral OT vs raw OT on rotated MNIST with varying rotation angles
2. Visualize bispectral feature distributions for different digit classes
3. Test sensitivity to bispectral feature dimensionality and approximation parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper notes that while BOT shows strong performance on rotation-based transformations, its performance on other group actions (reflections, scaling, affine transformations) and different data types beyond images remains unexplored. The computational complexity of bispectral feature computation for large-scale datasets is also identified as a potential limitation requiring further investigation.

## Limitations
- Computationally intensive bispectral feature computation, particularly for large datasets or high-dimensional data
- Experiments focus primarily on rotation symmetry with digit datasets, limiting generalizability
- Performance on other group actions (reflections, scaling, affine transformations) remains untested
- Reliance on precomputed features may not be practical for all applications

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| BOT achieves 84% accuracy on rotated MNIST vs 33% for naive OT | High |
| Bispectral features preserve discriminative structure while removing nuisance variation | Medium |
| Method generalizes beyond rotations and digit datasets | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Test BOT on non-image datasets (e.g., molecular structures, time series) with different group symmetries to assess generalizability
2. Compare computational efficiency against alternative symmetry-aware methods like group-invariant CNNs on large-scale datasets
3. Evaluate performance when group actions are unknown or partially known, simulating real-world conditions where symmetry structure must be inferred
