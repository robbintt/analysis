# Emotion Recognition in Signers
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.15376
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15376
- Reference count: 15
- eJSL dataset introduced for Japanese Sign Language emotion recognition, with EANwH model achieving 32.72% weighted accuracy and 20.03% macro F1 on BOBSL-M_C benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces eJSL, a novel dataset for emotion recognition in Japanese Sign Language signers, addressing the challenge of distinguishing grammatical facial expressions from genuine emotional expressions in signing contexts. The authors demonstrate that combining textual emotion recognition from subtitles, temporal segment selection, and hand motion features significantly improves emotion recognition performance over facial features alone. The proposed EANwH model establishes a strong baseline for emotion recognition in signers, outperforming vision-capable large language models while highlighting the ongoing challenges of data scarcity and the complexity of affective expression in sign languages.

## Method Summary
The authors address emotion recognition in signers by leveraging three key innovations: using textual emotion recognition from subtitles to mitigate data scarcity, employing temporal segment selection to identify optimal windows for emotion analysis, and incorporating hand motion features alongside facial expressions. They introduce the eJSL dataset specifically designed for this task and evaluate their EANwH model on both eJSL and BOBSL datasets. The approach combines multimodal inputs (text, visual, and temporal information) to better capture the nuanced relationship between sign language production and emotional expression, with empirical results showing that hand motion features provide additional discriminative power beyond facial expressions alone.

## Key Results
- EANwH model achieves 32.72% weighted accuracy and 20.03% macro F1 on BOBSL-M_C benchmark, outperforming vision-capable LLMs
- Textual emotion recognition on subtitles effectively mitigates data scarcity challenges in signer emotion recognition
- Temporal segment selection improves accuracy by identifying optimal analysis windows
- Incorporating hand motion features enhances recognition beyond facial features alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by recognizing that emotion recognition in signers requires distinguishing between grammatical facial expressions (which are linguistic markers in sign language) and genuine affective expressions. By using textual emotion recognition from subtitles, the model can leverage available linguistic context to infer emotional content. Temporal segment selection allows the model to focus on time windows where emotional expressions are most salient rather than processing entire signing sequences. Hand motion features capture additional expressive elements that complement facial expressions, as signers often use their hands to convey emotional intensity and nuance beyond what facial expressions alone can communicate.

## Foundational Learning
- Japanese Sign Language (JSL) - A natural sign language used in Japan, distinct from spoken Japanese with its own grammar and syntax; needed to understand the specific linguistic context and challenges of distinguishing grammatical vs. affective expressions in this language
- Multimodal emotion recognition - The process of identifying emotions using multiple data streams (text, visual, audio); needed because signer emotion involves complex interactions between linguistic and non-linguistic features
- Temporal segment selection - The technique of identifying and focusing on specific time windows within a sequence for analysis; needed to isolate moments where emotional expressions are most pronounced in signing
- Cross-modal learning - Methods that learn from multiple input modalities to improve task performance; needed to integrate textual, visual, and temporal information for comprehensive emotion recognition
- Vision-capable LLMs - Large language models that can process visual input alongside text; needed as comparison baselines to demonstrate the advantage of specialized signer emotion recognition approaches
- Data augmentation in sign language - Techniques to artificially expand limited sign language datasets; needed to address the data scarcity challenge specific to signer emotion recognition tasks

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Text features (subtitles) -> Visual features (facial/hand motion) -> Temporal segment selection -> Emotion classification
Critical path: The model processes subtitle text to extract linguistic emotion cues, extracts visual features from facial expressions and hand movements, applies temporal segment selection to identify optimal analysis windows, then fuses these modalities for final emotion classification
Design tradeoffs: The architecture balances computational efficiency with recognition accuracy by selectively processing temporal segments rather than entire signing sequences, and by choosing which modalities to emphasize based on their discriminative power
Failure signatures: The model may struggle with emotions that have subtle expressions, cases where grammatical facial expressions closely resemble affective expressions, or when hand motions and facial expressions convey conflicting emotional information
First experiments:
1. Evaluate baseline performance using only facial features to establish the importance of hand motion incorporation
2. Test different temporal segment selection strategies to optimize analysis window identification
3. Compare text-only emotion recognition performance against multimodal approaches to quantify the contribution of visual features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The achieved performance (32.72% weighted accuracy, 20.03% macro F1) remains relatively low, indicating the fundamental challenge of emotion recognition in signers
- The paper lacks comprehensive error analysis to determine whether failures stem from annotation quality, feature extraction limitations, or inherent ambiguities in mapping facial expressions to emotions in signing contexts
- Limited exploration of alternative state-of-the-art emotion recognition approaches for comparison beyond vision-capable LLMs

## Confidence
- Dataset contributions: Medium - methodology is sound and results are reproducible with released datasets
- Baseline performance: Medium - results are verifiable but absolute performance remains modest
- Text-based emotion recognition mitigating data scarcity: High - empirical demonstration is convincing
- Hand motion incorporation improving recognition: Medium - supported by ablation studies but generalizability not extensively validated

## Next Checks
1. Conduct detailed error analysis on misclassified samples to determine whether failures are systematic or random, and whether they correlate with specific linguistic or non-linguistic features
2. Test the proposed temporal segment selection approach across multiple sign language datasets to evaluate whether the improvement generalizes beyond eJSL and BOBSL
3. Compare EANwH performance against specialized emotion recognition models trained directly on signer data to establish whether this represents state-of-the-art for the task
