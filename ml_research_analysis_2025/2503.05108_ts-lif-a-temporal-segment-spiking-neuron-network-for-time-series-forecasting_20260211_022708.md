# TS-LIF: A Temporal Segment Spiking Neuron Network for Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.05108
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05108
- **Reference count:** 25
- **Primary result:** Dual-compartment spiking neuron model consistently outperforms traditional LIF-based models in time series forecasting accuracy and robustness.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TS-LIF, a dual-compartment spiking neuron model designed to improve time series forecasting. The model addresses the limitations of conventional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons, which struggle with long-term dependencies and multi-scale temporal dynamics. TS-LIF incorporates dendritic and somatic compartments, each specialized for processing distinct frequency components, with a direct somatic current injection to reduce information loss. The model is evaluated on four benchmark datasets using TCN, GRU, and Transformer architectures, consistently outperforming traditional LIF-based models in both accuracy (R2) and robustness (RSE), particularly in long-term forecasting scenarios. TS-LIF also demonstrates resilience to missing input data, maintaining superior accuracy under challenging conditions. The proposed model advances the application of spiking neural networks in time series forecasting by combining biologically inspired design with computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
TS-LIF is a dual-compartment spiking neuron model that decomposes input signals into low and high-frequency components through differential decay rates. The dendritic compartment uses a high decay factor ($\alpha_1 \approx 1$) as a low-pass filter for long-term integration, while the somatic compartment uses a low decay factor ($\alpha_2 \approx 0$) as a high-pass filter for immediate fluctuations. A direct somatic current injection bypasses the dendritic bottleneck, preserving high-frequency details. The model is trained using surrogate gradients on multivariate time series forecasting tasks with TCN, GRU, and Transformer backbones. Stability is ensured through eigenvalue constraints on the system matrix.

## Key Results
- TS-LIF consistently outperforms traditional LIF-based models on four benchmark datasets
- The model demonstrates superior performance in long-term forecasting scenarios
- TS-LIF shows resilience to missing input data, maintaining accuracy under 20-40% missing rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Frequency Segregation via Differential Decay Rates
- **Claim:** If the decay factors $\alpha$ for the dendritic and somatic compartments are set at opposing extremes, the neuron decomposes the input signal into low and high-frequency components.
- **Mechanism:** The dendritic compartment uses a high decay factor ($\alpha_1 \approx 1$), functioning as a low-pass filter that integrates long-term history. The somatic compartment uses a low decay factor ($\alpha_2 \approx 0$), functioning as a high-pass filter sensitive to immediate fluctuations. The final output is a weighted sum of these two streams.
- **Core assumption:** Time-series forecasting accuracy is bottlenecked by the single-timescale processing of standard Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "The dendritic and somatic compartments specialize in capturing distinct frequency components... enhancing the neuron's ability to process both low- and high-frequency information."
  - [section 4.1]: "When $\alpha_1$ is close to 1, the dendritic membrane potential $v_d[t]$ acts like a moving average... Conversely, when $\alpha_2$ is close to 0, the somatic potential $v_s[t]$ rapidly adapts."
  - [corpus]: HetSyn (2508.11644) supports the general efficacy of "synaptic heterogeneity" for integrating versatile timescales in SNNs.
- **Break condition:** If $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ converge to similar values, the frequency separation effect vanishes, reducing the model to a standard, less effective LIF.

### Mechanism 2: Information Preservation via Direct Somatic Injection
- **Claim:** A direct pathway for input current to the soma mitigates the information loss that typically occurs when signals must traverse the dendritic tree first.
- **Mechanism:** The architecture introduces a "shortcut" term $(1-\alpha_2)c[t]$ that injects input current directly into the soma (Eq. 5). This mimics biological axosomatic synapses, ensuring that high-frequency details are not entirely "smoothed out" by the dendritic low-pass filtering before reaching the spike generation mechanism.
- **Core assumption:** Standard dendritic integration acts as a bottleneck that deletes fine-grained temporal details necessary for precise forecasting.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "The newly introduced direct somatic current injection reduces information loss during intra-neuronal transmission."
  - [section 4.1]: "In the dual-compartment model... input current $c[t]$ flows through the dendrites before reaching the soma, which can result in information loss... To address this, we propose... shortcut mechanisms."
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence in neighbors; related work focuses on delays or resets rather than bypass pathways.
- **Break condition:** If the direct injection weight is too low relative to the dendritic input, the soma fails to recover high-frequency components.

### Mechanism 3: Stability via Constrained Interaction
- **Claim:** The dual-compartment system remains stable (non-exploding) only if the interaction weights $\beta$ and decay rates $\alpha$ satisfy specific eigenvalue constraints.
- **Mechanism:** The paper derives a stability condition (Theorem 1) where the eigenvalues of the system matrix must lie within the unit circle ($|\lambda| < 1$). This ensures that the feedback loop between the dendrite and soma (governed by $\beta_1, \beta_2$) does not cause voltage divergence over long sequences.
- **Core assumption:** Effective long-term memory in SNNs requires rigorous guarantees against gradient explosion or voltage instability.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "We provide a theoretical stability analysis of the TS-LIF model."
  - [section 4.2]: "For the system to remain stable, it is necessary that $|\lambda| < 1$ for both eigenvalues... This explains why the TC-LIF model... requires $\beta_1\beta_2 \le 0$."
  - [corpus]: *Delays in Spiking Neural Networks* (2512.01906) broadly aligns with using state-space formalism to manage temporal stability.
- **Break condition:** If $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \beta_1\beta_2 \ge 2$, the system becomes unstable, leading to unbounded membrane potentials.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Dynamics**
  - **Why needed here:** TS-LIF is a modification of the standard LIF model. Understanding the base mechanics (membrane potential decay $\alpha$, reset mechanisms, and spike generation) is required to grasp what the "Temporal Segment" extension changes.
  - **Quick check question:** If a standard LIF neuron has a decay factor $\alpha=0.9$, how much of the membrane potential from time $t-1$ remains at time $t$?

- **Concept: Frequency Response (Transfer Functions)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper validates its design by analyzing the neuron in the frequency domain using Z-transforms, proving that the two compartments act as distinct digital filters.
  - **Quick check question:** What does the magnitude of a transfer function $H(z)$ represent in the frequency domain?

- **Concept: Eigenvalue Stability Analysis**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper relies on linear system theory (Theorem 1) to prove that the dual-compartment feedback loop does not diverge.
  - **Quick check question:** In a discrete linear system, what happens to the state over time if an eigenvalue has a magnitude greater than 1?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (Multivariate time series $X \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times C}$) -> Conv + BN -> TS-LIF (spike trains $S$) -> Backbone (TCN/GRU/Transformer) -> Output

- **Critical path:** The stability calculation (Section 4.2) is the most sensitive step. When initializing or tuning hyperparameters, you must check the eigenvalues $\lambda$ derived from $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \beta_1, \beta_2$ to ensure $|\lambda| < 1$. If this condition breaks, the training will diverge.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Complexity vs. Capacity:** TS-LIF introduces significantly more parameters (dual alphas, betas, gammas, kappa) per neuron compared to standard LIF.
  - **Stability vs. Memory:** Pushing $\alpha_1 \to 1$ improves long-term memory (low-pass) but risks stability if interaction $\beta$ is not carefully regularized.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Loss Explosion:** Caused by violating Theorem 1 stability conditions (e.g., $\beta$ interaction too strong).
  - **Smoothing:** If $\kappa$ heavily weights the dendrite and ignores the soma, the model may lose responsiveness to sudden changes (high-frequency loss).
  - **Silent Neurons:** If thresholds $v_{th}$ are too high relative to the segregated voltages, the "direct injection" might not be enough to fire the soma alone.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Frequency Response Validation:** Replicate Section 4.4/5.1. Feed a mixed sine wave (0.5Hz + 4Hz) into a single isolated TS-LIF neuron; plot $v_d$ and $v_s$ to visually confirm that the dendrite tracks the low frequency and the soma tracks the high frequency.
  2. **Stability Boundary Test:** Train a simple backbone on a toy dataset. Systematically increase $\beta$ values until they violate the stability condition ($|\lambda| \ge 1$) and observe the immediate spike in training loss (NaNs).
  3. **Missing Data Robustness:** Follow Section 5.3.1. Train on the Electricity dataset and randomly mask 20-40% of input timestamps. Compare the RSE degradation against a vanilla LIF baseline to verify the robustness claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can SNN filtering mechanisms be designed to explicitly and efficiently model cross-variable correlations in multivariate time series forecasting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Appendix A.13 that current SNN-based models lack explicit mechanisms for capturing inter-variable correlations and intend to explore this.
- Why unresolved: The current TS-LIF architecture focuses primarily on decomposing temporal features (intra-variable) within dendritic and somatic compartments, leaving the modeling of relationships between different variables (inter-variable) unaddressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified TS-LIF architecture incorporating a cross-variable attention or filtering mechanism, benchmarked against models like Crossformer or iTransformer on multivariate datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the TS-LIF architecture be generalized effectively to other comprehensive time series analysis tasks, such as anomaly detection, generation, and classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix A.13 lists "developing more generalized SNN structures for comprehensive time series analysis tasks" as a primary direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper exclusively validates TS-LIF on forecasting benchmarks (Metr-la, Pems-bay, Solar, Electricity), leaving its utility for tasks requiring different loss functions or output representations unproven.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results applying TS-LIF to standard anomaly detection datasets (e.g., SMD, SWaT) or generation tasks, showing competitive performance against specialized ANNs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the theoretical energy efficiency of TS-LIF translate to practical gains when deployed on physical neuromorphic hardware?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper claims energy efficiency and calculates theoretical consumption in Appendix A.5 using operation counts (SOPs vs. FLOPs), all experiments are simulated on standard hardware (GPUs).
- Why unresolved: Theoretical energy models often fail to account for the overhead of spike encoding/decoding, memory access costs, and communication latency in physical devices, creating a gap between simulation and real-world application.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical power consumption and latency measurements from a TS-LIF implementation deployed on a neuromorphic chip (e.g., Intel Loihi or SpiNNaker) compared to an ANN baseline.

## Limitations

- **Incomplete methodological details:** The surrogate gradient function and training loss function are not explicitly specified, making exact reproduction challenging.
- **Limited generalizability:** The model is only validated on four standard forecasting datasets, raising questions about performance on other time series domains.
- **Single-task focus:** The paper only evaluates TS-LIF on forecasting tasks, leaving its utility for other time series analysis tasks unexplored.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The theoretical stability analysis (Theorem 1) and frequency response analysis are mathematically rigorous and well-supported by the proofs provided.
- **Medium Confidence:** The reported performance improvements over LIF-based baselines are convincing, but the lack of implementation details (optimizer, surrogate gradient) creates uncertainty about exact reproduction.
- **Medium Confidence:** The missing data robustness claims are supported by results but only tested on one dataset (Electricity) with limited missing rates (20-40%).

## Next Checks

1. **Frequency Decomposition Verification:** Feed a synthetic signal with known low (0.5 Hz) and high (4 Hz) frequency components into a single TS-LIF neuron and plot the membrane potentials $v_d[t]$ and $v_s[t]$ to visually confirm the frequency segregation mechanism described in Mechanism 1.

2. **Stability Constraint Testing:** Systematically vary the interaction parameter $\beta$ in a controlled experiment to identify the exact threshold where the stability condition $|\lambda| < 1$ is violated, observing the corresponding training instability (loss explosion or NaNs).

3. **Generalization Assessment:** Apply TS-LIF to a non-forecasting time series task such as anomaly detection or classification to evaluate whether the dual-compartment design provides benefits beyond the forecasting domain where it was developed.
