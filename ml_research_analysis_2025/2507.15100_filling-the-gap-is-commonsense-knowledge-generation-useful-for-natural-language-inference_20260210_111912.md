# Filling the Gap: Is Commonsense Knowledge Generation useful for Natural Language Inference?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.15100
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15100
- Authors: Chathuri Jayaweera; Brianna Yanqui; Bonnie Dorr
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Hybrid approach with selectively filtered commonsense axioms improves NLI accuracy by 1.99%-6.88%

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether Large Language Models can generate and effectively utilize commonsense knowledge for Natural Language Inference. The authors propose a three-prompt pipeline that generates commonsense axioms and selectively injects them into the NLI reasoning process. While explicit knowledge injection doesn't consistently improve overall results, the hybrid approach that selectively provides highly factual axioms based on helpfulness ratings yields consistent accuracy improvements across tested configurations. The work demonstrates that targeted commonsense knowledge can help models overcome bias toward the Neutral class and improve their ability to distinguish between inference categories.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a three-prompt pipeline: P1 generates commonsense axioms from premise-hypothesis pairs, P2 predicts NLI labels with axioms appended, and P3 serves as baseline without external knowledge. A hybrid approach uses Claude-3.5-Sonnet to rate axiom helpfulness on a 1-10 scale, with threshold-based filtering selecting between P1+P2 and P3 outputs. The method is evaluated on SNLI and ANLI benchmarks using Llama-3.1-70B and gpt-oss-120b models, with each prompt run five times and results averaged.

## Key Results
- Hybrid approach with selective axiom filtering yields consistent accuracy improvements of 1.99% to 6.88% across tested configurations
- Adding commonsense axioms prior to inference prediction improves models' ability to distinguish Entailment from other inference classes
- Both models exhibit bias toward the Neutral class when lacking additional context, which targeted commonsense knowledge helps overcome

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Selectively injecting commonsense axioms improves NLI accuracy by providing real-world context missing from literal text.
- Core assumption: LLMs encode reliable commonsense knowledge that can be extracted and applied to specific reasoning instances.
- Evidence anchors: Hybrid approach yields consistent accuracy improvements of 1.99% to 6.88%; adding axioms improves ability to distinguish Entailment.
- Break condition: Overly generalized axioms that assume facts not present in premise-hypothesis pair can introduce errors.

### Mechanism 2
- A helpfulness-rating filter functions as an oracle-like selector to identify which instances benefit from external knowledge.
- Core assumption: Judge model's helpfulness ratings correlate with actual utility for downstream inference accuracy.
- Evidence anchors: Threshold that maximizes performance is identified (θ=8 for ANLI, θ=9 for SNLI); hybrid approach yields largest performance gains.
- Break condition: If helpfulness ratings are inaccurate, selector may filter out beneficial axioms or retain unhelpful ones.

### Mechanism 3
- Commonsense axioms reduce LLM bias toward the Neutral class by supplying missing contextual evidence.
- Core assumption: Neutral bias stems from knowledge gaps rather than fundamental reasoning limitations.
- Evidence anchors: Both models predict Neutral without additional context; targeted knowledge helps overcome this bias.
- Break condition: If premise-hypothesis pair genuinely lacks sufficient information, forcing non-Neutral prediction increases error.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Natural Language Inference (NLI) task definition**
  - Why needed here: Understanding NLI classification into Entailment, Contradiction, or Neutral is foundational to interpreting all results.
  - Quick check question: Given "A dog is sleeping on a couch" (premise) and "An animal is resting" (hypothesis), what is the correct label and why?

- Concept: **Commonsense axioms as natural language bridging principles**
  - Why needed here: The paper treats axioms as informal reasoning steps connecting premises to hypotheses via world knowledge.
  - Quick check question: What axiom would help determine whether "People are standing outside a building" contradicts "The people are inside"?

- Concept: **LLM-as-judge evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The hybrid approach depends entirely on Claude-3.5-Sonnet's helpfulness ratings as a filtering mechanism.
  - Quick check question: What are two failure modes when using an LLM to evaluate another LLM's outputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: P1 (Axiom Generator) -> Jh (Helpfulness Judge) -> (if rating ≥ threshold) P2 (Inference with Axioms) -> final prediction; (else) P3 (Baseline Inference) -> final prediction
- Critical path: P1 generates axiom → Jh rates helpfulness → threshold comparison → P2 or P3 prediction based on rating
- Design tradeoffs: Precision vs. breadth in axiom generation; oracle dependency of hybrid approach; balancing general vs. specific axioms
- Failure signatures: Low overall accuracy improvement; high Neutral misclassification rate; high variance across runs
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline replication: Run P3 on 100 SNLI samples to establish baseline accuracy and Neutral-class bias
  2. Axiom quality audit: Manually evaluate 20-30 P1-generated axioms for factuality and relevance before scaling
  3. Threshold sensitivity analysis: Plot accuracy vs. helpfulness threshold (θ=1-10) on held-out data to identify optimal thresholds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- How can systems reliably identify which premise-hypothesis pairs benefit from external commonsense knowledge without relying on a "helpfulness" rating that requires access to the gold label?
- Basis: Authors state primary challenge is developing reliable techniques for identifying beneficial inference problems without oracle availability.
- Why unresolved: Hybrid approach requires gold labels for helpfulness rating, impossible in live inference scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that predicts axiom utility without gold labels matching oracle-based hybrid performance.

### Open Question 2
- Can prompting strategies or verification mechanisms be developed to prevent LLMs from generating "overly generalized" commonsense axioms that lead to incorrect inferences?
- Basis: Study found axioms sometimes introduce false assumptions (e.g., assuming woman helping girl is her mother).
- Why unresolved: Current prompts do not fully mitigate hallucination risk of overly general axioms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Generation protocol reducing logical fallacies in axioms and improving performance on distractor pairs.

### Open Question 3
- Does performance improvement from selective commonsense knowledge injection generalize to multilingual NLI datasets?
- Basis: Study limited to English language; authors aim for work to serve as foundation for multilingual research.
- Why unresolved: Experiments conducted exclusively on English SNLI and ANLI datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Reproduction on multilingual NLI benchmark (e.g., XNLI) showing consistent accuracy gains.

### Open Question 4
- To what extent do LLM-generated helpfulness ratings correlate with human judgments of axiom utility?
- Basis: Evaluation relies on LLM to assess helpfulness without full human annotation.
- Why unresolved: Validity of hybrid approach depends on judge's rating, but only small subset manually reviewed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Human annotation study comparing axiom helpfulness ratings to LLM judge's scores.

## Limitations

- The hybrid approach requires gold labels for helpfulness rating during inference, making direct deployment impractical
- Performance gains depend heavily on the assumption that helpfulness ratings accurately predict downstream utility
- Study uses relatively small evaluation sets (1500 pairs per dataset), limiting statistical power for detecting smaller effect sizes
- "gpt-oss-120b" model specification remains unclear, potentially affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The baseline finding that LLMs exhibit Neutral-class bias without external context, supported by clear qualitative and quantitative evidence across both models and datasets
- **Medium confidence**: The overall accuracy improvements from the hybrid approach, though promising, depend on oracle assumptions and may not generalize to datasets with different bias patterns
- **Low confidence**: The mechanism that helpfulness ratings serve as reliable filters for axiom utility, as this core assumption lacks direct validation and could fail with different judge models

## Next Checks

1. **Helpfulness rating ablation**: Evaluate whether hybrid approach's gains persist when helpfulness ratings are replaced with random filtering or alternative selection criteria to validate oracle assumption
2. **Generalization test**: Apply approach to a dataset with minimal Neutral bias (e.g., MNLI) to test whether improvements generalize beyond SNLI/ANLI's specific patterns
3. **Oracle-free variant**: Develop and test a threshold-free variant that always includes axioms meeting minimum quality criteria rather than using gold-label-dependent selection, to assess practical deployability
