## Quick Facts

- Provides real-time AI feedback during 3D CAD design via ambient audio interface

## Executive Summary
FeedQUAC is an ambient AI design companion that provides real-time, read-aloud feedback from diverse personas during 3D CAD design. A study with eight experienced designers showed that participants received an average of 13.25 feedback instances per 25-minute session, with 5.26 manual requests. Participants rated the system as highly ambient, convenient, and playful, and found it less stressful than human feedback. They valued the validation, inspiration, and diverse perspectives it provided. Limitations included the AI's lack of design-stage context and limited user control. The findings suggest that ambient AI feedback can effectively support designers, especially when human feedback is unavailable, and highlight the need for future tools to balance user involvement and system control.

## Method Summary
FeedQUAC is a cross-platform desktop application built with JavaScript and Electron that provides ambient AI feedback during 3D CAD design. The system captures screenshots (full screen, active window, or cursor area), encodes them to Base64, and constructs prompts combining persona descriptions, feedback generation prompts, and context prompts with previous feedback history. These prompts are sent to GPT-4-Vision for analysis, and the resulting text is converted to speech using ElevenLabs TTS API. The audio feedback plays immediately while text displays in a minimal overlay. The system uses eight distinct personas (Mentor, Cheerleader, Critic, etc.) and aims for a 5-10 second latency between request and response.

## Key Results
- Average of 13.25 feedback instances per 25-minute session, with 5.26 manual requests
- Participants rated the system as highly ambient, convenient, and playful
- All eight participants found AI feedback less stressful than human feedback
- The Critic persona was most frequently used (31 times), followed by specific persona requests

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Ambient Multimodal Offloading
Providing feedback via a secondary auditory channel while maintaining a minimal visual footprint may reduce cognitive load and preserve "flow state" compared to traditional screen-dominant feedback interfaces. The system leverages ambient technology by using audio and peripheral visuals rather than modality-blocking popups, allowing designers to maintain focus on the primary visual task while receiving background information.

### Mechanism 2: Persona-Based Perspective Framing
Framing identical AI capabilities through distinct personas may elicit diverse cognitive responses from users, increasing the perceived value of feedback. The system uses prompt engineering to inject personality traits into the LLM, mimicking human social dynamics where feedback variance depends on the provider's role.

### Mechanism 3: Reduced Social Friction
Replacing human feedback loops with AI agents lowers the "social stakes" of feedback solicitation, potentially increasing feedback frequency and iteration speed. Human feedback carries implicit social costs (fear of judgment, relationship management, timing), while FeedQUAC removes these by providing an "always available" agent that is "not socially judgmental."

## Foundational Learning

- **Rubber Duck Debugging**: The tool works as a "virtual rubber duck" where the act of externalizing thought (hearing feedback) aids cognition, even when feedback is imperfect. *Quick check: Can you explain why an inanimate object can effectively serve as a "sounding board" without actual intelligence?*

- **Context Windows (Multimodal LLMs)**: The system relies on passing visual context (screenshots) and text context (history) to GPT-4-Vision. Understanding token limits is vital for debugging why feedback repeats or misses details. *Quick check: What happens to the AI's "memory" of the design process if you exceed the context window length?*

- **Ubiquitous / Calm Computing**: The paper distinguishes its "ambient" approach from "feature-rich" creativity tools. This distinction drives the architectural decision to use a small overlay and audio rather than a large dashboard. *Quick check: According to Mark Weiser's vision, what is the ultimate goal of "calm technology"?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Electron Desktop App -> Context Capture -> Prompt Constructor -> Inference Engine -> Output Synthesizer
- **Critical path**: User triggers Command+R -> Electron captures screen -> Base64 -> Prompt Constructor builds payload -> API call to Vision model -> Text response -> TTS API call -> Audio file generation -> Audio plays locally while text displays in overlay
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Ambient vs. Missed Information: Interface is ignorable, protecting focus but risking missed critical feedback
  - Context Richness vs. Setup Effort: Automatically grabs screenshots but lacks design stage context
  - Latency vs. Quality: GPT-4-Vision introduces 5-10s latency; faster local model might reduce latency but lose nuance
- **Failure signatures**: 
  - "Off-Stage" Hallucination: AI provides detailed feedback on manufacturing when user is in early prototyping
  - Repetition Loop: Without sufficient memory context, AI may repeat the same generic praise or critique
  - Visual Context Ambiguity: Screenshot captures whole screen, AI critiques CAD software UI rather than design geometry
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Context Window Ablation: Run with no feedback history vs. full history, measure repetitive feedback rates
  2. Persona Distinctiveness Test: Blind test same image to all 8 personas, measure output tone/vocabulary distinctiveness
  3. Latency Tolerance Threshold: Introduce artificial delays (5s, 10s, 20s), measure user engagement drop-off

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the optimal number of AI personas for a design feedback tool, and does this optimal number vary based on individual user preferences or project type? The study was insufficient to determine if users would settle on a few favorite personas or require the full diverse set over long-term use. Longitudinal usage data tracking persona selection frequency across multiple design projects would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How can ambient systems dynamically determine when to surface critical feedback to prevent it from being overlooked without disrupting the user's cognitive flow? The current system used fixed intervals or manual requests, lacking an intelligent mechanism to detect user engagement levels or feedback criticality. Experiments with adaptive notification systems correlating delivery timing with user idle states would provide evidence.

### Open Question 3
Does integrating explicit context-setting features (like chat or pre-session surveys) degrade the perceived ambient nature and effort-reward trade-off of the tool? Participants wanted more context control but the authors argue increased interaction may reduce the tool's lightweight nature. A comparative study measuring cognitive load and perceived ambience between minimal and context-rich versions would resolve this tension.

## Limitations
- Design-task generalizability: Study focused on single 3D modeling task (bioprinter design), unclear if benefits extend to other domains
- Persona consistency validation: No quantitative validation performed to ensure LLM consistently maintains distinct personas
- Interaction design constraints: Single hotkey and minimal overlay limit user control over when and how feedback is received

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Users found the system ambient and less stressful than human feedback (supported by direct quotes and consistent ratings)
- **Medium Confidence**: The system provides valuable "validation" and "inspiration" (supported by qualitative data but dependent on subjective interpretation)
- **Low Confidence**: Persona-based framing significantly enhances feedback value (supported by usage frequency but lacking comparative evidence)

## Next Checks
1. **Persona Distinctiveness Test**: Conduct blind study where same design screenshots are fed to all 8 personas, have independent raters evaluate tone/vocabulary distinctiveness
2. **Context Window Ablation Study**: Run tool with no history, limited history (2 instances), and full history, measure repetition rates and user frustration
3. **Latency Tolerance Threshold**: Introduce controlled delays (5s, 10s, 15s, 20s) between hotkey press and audio feedback, track when users begin to disengage
