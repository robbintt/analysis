# How Low Can You Go? Searching for the Intrinsic Dimensionality of Complex Networks using Metric Node Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.01723
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01723
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Euclidean metric embeddings achieve exact network reconstruction in substantially lower dimensions than LPCA, with scalable linearithmic O(N log N) reconstruction checks for large graphs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental question of how low-dimensional Euclidean space can exactly represent a complex network's structure. The authors introduce a logarithmic search procedure that efficiently identifies the minimal embedding dimension required for lossless reconstruction. Their key innovation is demonstrating that metric-based L2 embeddings consistently achieve exact reconstruction at lower dimensions than traditional LPCA methods - for instance, Cora requires only 6-7 dimensions versus 16 for LPCA. Critically, they scale this approach to graphs with up to a million nodes by introducing an efficient O(N log N) reconstruction check using KD-trees, providing the first examples of scalable exact reconstruction for large networks.

## Method Summary
The method centers on finding the minimal embedding dimension $D^*$ that enables exact network reconstruction. It uses a binary search procedure (Algorithm 1) that starts with a high dimension and iteratively reduces it when exact reconstruction is achieved, initializing subsequent runs via truncated SVD of the current embeddings. The L2 metric model represents networks as $R = \beta - ||x_i - y_j||^2$, contrasting with LPCA's $R = XY^\top$. Optimization uses ADAM with learning rate 1.0, halved after 500 epochs without improvement, and a maximum of 30,000 epochs. For large graphs, exact reconstruction is verified using KD-trees to achieve O(N log N) complexity instead of O(N²).

## Key Results
- L2 metric embeddings achieve exact reconstruction at substantially lower dimensions than LPCA: Cora requires 6-7 dimensions versus 16 for LPCA
- The search procedure scales to large networks - Amazon (334K nodes) can be embedded in just 13 dimensions
- The method provides the first examples of scalable exact reconstruction for graphs with up to a million nodes
- KD-tree-based reconstruction checks enable O(N log N) verification of exact reconstruction for large-scale networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the geometric properties of metric spaces, where distances between nodes provide sufficient information to reconstruct the original adjacency matrix exactly when the embedding dimension is sufficient. The logarithmic search efficiently navigates the non-convex optimization landscape by using successful embeddings as warm starts for lower dimensions via SVD projection. The L2 metric's distance-based formulation appears more amenable to finding exact solutions than LPCA's dot-product approach, particularly when combined with the iterative dimension reduction strategy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Metric Embedding Theory**: Why needed - Understanding how distance preservation enables network reconstruction; Quick check - Verify that pairwise distances in embedding space can reconstruct original edges
- **SVD Initialization**: Why needed - Efficient warm-starting of optimization in lower dimensions; Quick check - Confirm SVD projection reduces dimensionality while preserving reconstruction quality
- **KD-tree Nearest Neighbor Search**: Why needed - Scalable exact reconstruction verification for large graphs; Quick check - Implement KD-tree search and verify O(N log N) scaling
- **Binary Search Optimization**: Why needed - Efficient navigation of non-convex loss landscape; Quick check - Run search with different upper bounds and verify convergence
- **Exact Reconstruction Criterion**: Why needed - Defining success as zero reconstruction error; Quick check - Verify ||Â-A||F/||A||F = 0 condition
- **Bernoulli Log-Likelihood**: Why needed - Probabilistic loss function for link prediction; Quick check - Confirm loss formulation matches Eq. 3

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Binary Search -> L2/LPCA Model -> SVD Hot-start -> KD-tree Verification -> Exact Reconstruction Check

**Critical Path**: The binary search algorithm forms the critical path, with each iteration requiring model training, exact reconstruction verification, and SVD-based warm-starting for the next lower dimension attempt.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity for exact reconstruction - the logarithmic search reduces iterations but each requires full model training. The KD-tree optimization enables scalability but requires careful implementation for exact distance verification.

**Failure Signatures**: LPCA instability manifests as inconsistent dimension identification across runs (Figure 3), while the L2 metric shows more stable behavior. Local minima in the loss landscape can cause premature convergence to suboptimal dimensions.

**First Experiments**: 1) Implement the L2 reconstruction model and Bernoulli loss function; 2) Implement binary search with SVD initialization and verify on Cora; 3) Add KD-tree verification and test on medium-sized graph before scaling up.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can non-Euclidean geometries, such as hyperbolic space or $L_\infty$-norm based spaces, achieve lower exact embedding dimensions than the Euclidean $L_2$-norm?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Conclusion: "future work should further investigate properties of other choices of geometry on the extracted dimensionality $D^*$."
- Why unresolved: The current study primarily focuses on Euclidean metrics ($L_2$), and while initial comparisons with Poincaré embeddings showed similar performance, the authors have not exhaustively explored other metric spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparisons of the exact embedding dimension ($D^*$) on identical benchmark datasets using optimized solvers for hyperbolic or $L_\infty$ geometries.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is it possible to design an optimization procedure that guarantees convergence to the true minimum embedding dimension rather than just an upper bound?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes the method "does not necessarily identify the lowest possible network embedding dimension but an upper bound $D^*$ and can be prone to issues of local minima."
- Why unresolved: The random initialization and non-convex nature of the loss landscape mean the search can get stuck in local minima, causing variability in the identified dimensions (e.g., LPCA instability in Figure 3).
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified search algorithm or theoretical guarantee demonstrating that the identified dimension is strictly the lower bound, or consistent identification of lower dimensions across random seeds.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why does stochasticity in graph generation prevent the recovery of exact embedding dimensions, whereas deterministic generation allows it?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] In Supplementary A.11, the authors observe that stochastic network generation prevents EED recovery, but making the generation process deterministic allows perfect reconstruction.
- Why unresolved: The paper empirically notes this failure mode but does not provide a theoretical explanation for why noise in the link generation process creates a floor on the recoverable dimensionality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis linking the level of stochastic noise in the graph generation process to the necessary inflation of the embedding dimension $D$.

## Limitations
- The exact centering operation for SVD initialization is ambiguously described, which could affect reproducibility of the hot-start procedure
- LPCA shows instability across runs, requiring multiple experiments to quantify variability
- KD-tree implementation details for large-scale exact reconstruction are not fully specified

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mathematical formulation (L2 reconstruction, Bernoulli loss, exact reconstruction criterion) and the algorithmic framework (binary search with SVD hot-starting) are clearly specified

**Medium Confidence**: The empirical results for Cora, Citeseer, and HepPh are reproducible given the specifications, though LPCA instability may require multiple runs

**Low Confidence**: The large-scale Amazon results (13 dimensions for 334K nodes) depend on the unspecified KD-tree implementation details

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce Cora Results**: Run the search procedure on Cora to verify exact reconstruction at D=6 (L2) and D=9 (LPCA), including multiple runs to quantify LPCA instability

2. **Implement SVD Initialization**: Test different centering strategies (row-mean vs. global-mean) to verify which produces the expected loss improvement shown in Figure 7

3. **Scale Validation**: Implement the KD-tree-based exact reconstruction check on a medium-sized graph (e.g., HepPh) to verify the O(N log N) scaling claim before attempting Amazon-scale experiments
