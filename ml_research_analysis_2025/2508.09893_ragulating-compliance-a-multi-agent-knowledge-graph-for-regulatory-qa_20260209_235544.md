# RAGulating Compliance: A Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph for Regulatory QA

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.09893
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09893
- **Reference count**: 4
- **Primary result**: Multi-agent KG+RAG framework achieves 4.73 factual correctness and 0.2888 retrieval accuracy at 0.75 similarity threshold

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of regulatory compliance question answering, which demands precise, verifiable information that large language models often struggle to provide. The authors propose a multi-agent framework that integrates a knowledge graph of regulatory triplets with retrieval-augmented generation. By extracting subject-predicate-object (SPO) triplets from regulatory documents and embedding them alongside textual evidence in a unified vector database, the system significantly outperforms conventional methods in both accuracy and navigation. The approach enables efficient information flow with faster shortest path and higher interconnectedness while maintaining traceability to source documents.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a multi-agent pipeline to build and query an ontology-free knowledge graph from regulatory documents. First, the Document Ingestion Agent segments raw regulatory text into atomic sections and extracts metadata. The Extraction Agent then uses an LLM to identify SPO triplets within each section. The Normalization and Cleaning Agent deduplicates entries, standardizes entities, and resolves synonyms. Triplets are embedded using a custom BERT-based model trained on eCFR text and stored in a unified vector database alongside their source sections. At query time, the Retrieval Agent matches query embeddings to triplet embeddings via cosine similarity, retrieving both structured facts and associated text. The Story-Building Agent compiles relevant evidence, and the Generation Agent produces the final answer grounded in cited sources.

## Key Results
- Achieves factual correctness score of 4.73 out of 5 on LLM-judged regulatory QA
- Improves retrieval accuracy to 0.2888 at 0.75 similarity threshold compared to conventional methods
- Enables efficient information flow with average shortest path of 1.3300 and average degree of 1.6080

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Triplet-Level Semantic Alignment Improves Retrieval Precision
Retrieving SPO triplets rather than entire text chunks yields higher accuracy at stricter similarity thresholds because triplets capture the "who-did-what-to-whom" core of regulatory facts in a compact, semantically-aligned form. The embedding function preserves factual relationships such that semantically related queries map to relevant triplets. Triplet extraction accuracy and completeness are critical assumptions.

### Mechanism 2: Unified Vector Database Enables Traceable Graph+Text Retrieval
Storing triplet embeddings and their associated text sections in a single enriched vector database allows both graph-based reasoning and efficient retrieval with built-in provenance for verification. The linking function accurately captures provenance from triplets to source sections. The vector DB must handle dual retrieval efficiently without significant latency or storage overhead.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Agent Modularity Improves Scalability and Maintainability
Delegating ingestion, extraction, cleaning, retrieval, and generation to specialized agents enables independent scaling, easier debugging, and iterative refinement of each pipeline stage. Agents can operate asynchronously without tight coupling. The LLM-based extraction must be reliable enough to avoid cascading errors through the pipeline.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Knowledge Graphs and SPO Triplets**
  - Why needed here: The system's core innovation is representing regulatory facts as subject-predicate-object triplets, enabling structured retrieval and graph navigation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a triplet like ("Part 117", "requires", "15-day appeal") differs from unstructured text in terms of retrieval and reasoning?

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: The framework grounds LLM responses in retrieved regulatory content, reducing hallucinations and improving verifiability.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between standard RAG (retrieving text chunks) and triplet-based RAG (retrieving SPO facts with linked text)?

- **Concept: Vector Embeddings and Similarity Search**
  - Why needed here: Triplets and queries are embedded into dense vectors; retrieval depends on cosine similarity in this space.
  - Quick check question: If two triplets have high cosine similarity but different regulatory implications, how might this affect answer correctness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Document Ingestion Agent -> Extraction Agent -> Normalization and Cleaning Agent -> Triplet Store and Indexing Agent -> Retrieval Agent -> Story-Building Agent -> Generation Agent
- **Critical path:** Extraction → Cleaning → Embedding/Indexing → Retrieval → Story-Building → Generation. Errors in extraction or cleaning propagate directly to retrieval quality and answer correctness.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Ontology-free vs. schema-based KG: Flexibility and rapid adaptation vs. risk of vocabulary fragmentation and inconsistent entity naming
  - Single unified vector DB vs. separate triplet/text stores: Simplified provenance vs. potential scaling and query complexity
  - LLM-based extraction vs. rule-based: Higher coverage and adaptability vs. noise and hallucination risk in triplets
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low overlap scores at high similarity thresholds: indicates embedding or triplet quality issues
  - High average shortest path or low average degree: suggests poor triplet interconnectedness or incomplete extraction
  - Answers lacking citations or mismatched source sections: broken linking function Λ
  - Pipeline stalls or timeouts: agent orchestration failures or unhandled exceptions
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline retrieval comparison: Run the same regulatory queries with (a) pure text-chunk RAG, (b) triplet-only retrieval, and (c) the hybrid triplet+text system. Measure section overlap, factual correctness, and latency.
  2. Triplet extraction quality audit: Manually sample 100 extracted triplets from the eCFR corpus. Check for completeness, correctness, and consistency.
  3. Ablation on cleaning/normalization: Run the pipeline with and without the Normalization and Cleaning Agent. Compare retrieval accuracy and navigation metrics.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework be extended to support multi-step logical reasoning and evidence chaining for complex regulatory queries beyond simple factual lookups?
- Basis in paper: Section 8.2 notes that "complex regulatory questions demand deeper logical reasoning or chaining of evidence," suggesting the integration of advanced reasoning LLMs.
- Why unresolved: The current agentic pipeline optimizes for triplet-level retrieval and fact verification but does not detail mechanisms for synthesizing answers requiring inference across disparate subgraphs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of multi-hop reasoning capabilities on a dataset requiring transitive logic with corresponding accuracy metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What mechanisms are required to enable efficient, incremental updates to the knowledge graph when source regulations change?
- Basis in paper: Section 8.2 highlights the aim to "develop incremental update mechanisms that re-ingest altered documents and regenerate only those triples affected by the changes."
- Why unresolved: The paper describes an extraction and cleaning pipeline but does not specify the technical implementation for dynamic updates or version control within the vector database and graph structure.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proposed algorithm or system architecture capable of processing regulatory amendments and identifying specific graph delta changes without full corpus re-ingestion.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the ontology-free approach lead to vocabulary fragmentation, and how can automated canonicalization resolve this without manual schema definition?
- Basis in paper: Section 8.1 acknowledges that the approach "can lead to vocabulary fragmentation" and that "canonicalization and entity resolution help unify concepts."
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions a "Normalization and Cleaning Agent," it relies on standardizing entities without a predefined schema, which risks limiting the ability to detect synonymous entities across different regulatory sections effectively.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative analysis of entity resolution accuracy and a comparison of graph connectivity metrics against a schema-based baseline.

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on LLM-based triplet extraction, introducing potential noise and hallucination into the knowledge graph
- Factual correctness metric is LLM-judged, raising concerns about subjectivity and potential bias in evaluation
- Performance benchmarked only against conventional methods without comparison to other advanced RAG or KG-based approaches

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The modular multi-agent architecture and its role in improving scalability and maintainability are well-defined and supported by literature. The retrieval accuracy improvements at higher similarity thresholds are directly measurable from the results.
- **Medium Confidence:** The mechanism by which triplet-level semantic alignment improves retrieval precision is plausible but relies on assumptions about embedding quality and extraction accuracy that are not fully validated. The unified vector database's efficiency and traceability benefits are asserted but not empirically tested for scalability.
- **Low Confidence:** The factual correctness score is LLM-judged, which introduces subjectivity and potential bias. The impact of the Normalization and Cleaning Agent on graph connectivity and answer quality is claimed but not directly measured.

## Next Checks

1. **Manual Triplet Extraction Audit:** Sample 100 triplets from the eCFR corpus and manually verify their correctness, completeness, and consistency. Categorize errors to quantify the reliability of the extraction pipeline.

2. **Retrieval Performance Ablation:** Compare retrieval accuracy and latency between the hybrid triplet+text system and a pure text-chunk RAG baseline across multiple similarity thresholds. Validate whether the claimed improvement holds under different query types and corpus sizes.

3. **Cleaning Agent Impact Analysis:** Run the pipeline with and without the Normalization and Cleaning Agent. Measure changes in graph connectivity and retrieval accuracy to quantify the impact of deduplication and entity resolution on overall system performance.
