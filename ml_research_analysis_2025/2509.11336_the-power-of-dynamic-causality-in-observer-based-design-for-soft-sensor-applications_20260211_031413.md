- Traditional observer design fails to capture dynamic causality in complex systems

## Executive Summary
Traditional soft sensor design relies on linearized observability or statistical correlations that miss the dynamic causal relationships between inputs and states. This work introduces a framework using liquid-time constant (LTC) networks—continuous-time neural architectures with input-dependent time constants—to systematically identify and prune sensor inputs with minimal causal influence on state estimation. The methodology iteratively trains LTC observers, quantifies each input's causal impact through perturbation analysis, removes inputs with negligible effect, and retrains until performance degradation. Tested on three mechanistic systems, the approach consistently identified minimal sensor sets aligned with underlying physics while improving prediction accuracy.

## Method Summary
The framework trains liquid-time constant (LTC) neural observers on mechanistic ODE systems, then iteratively prunes inputs using perturbation-based causal scoring. Each hidden neuron maintains an input-dependent time constant τ_i that adapts processing speed to input complexity. After training, small perturbations are applied to each input channel and the resulting trajectory divergence measures causal influence. Inputs with negligible scores are pruned and the network retrained until validation error increases significantly. The approach was validated on spring-mass-damper, continuous stirred-tank reactor, and predator-prey models with synthetic noise and engineered interaction terms.

## Key Results
- Consistently identified minimal sensor sets aligned with underlying physics while improving prediction accuracy
- Automatically distinguished essential physical measurements from noise (noise signals consistently scored below 0.02)
- Determined when derived interaction terms provided complementary versus redundant information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Input-Dependent Temporal Scaling
Liquid Time-Constant networks capture system dynamics more effectively than fixed-time recurrent architectures by adapting their processing speed to input complexity. Each hidden neuron maintains a state defined by a time constant τ_i that is a function of the input u(t), allowing the network to "slow down" integration during stable periods and "speed up" during rapid transients.

### Mechanism 2: Perturbation-Based Causal Scoring
Systematically disturbing input channels in a trained observer reveals their true dynamic contribution, separating causal drivers from statistical correlations. After training, the framework applies a small perturbation ε to a specific input channel j and measures the resulting divergence in the state trajectory. If an input is merely correlated, the perturbation does not alter the underlying learned dynamics, resulting in a low causality score.

### Mechanism 3: Iterative Causal Re-estimation
Causal influence is not static and must be re-evaluated as the sensor configuration shrinks. The framework employs a loop: Train → Score → Prune → Retrain. Removing an input changes the information available to the observer, and a variable that appeared marginally causal in a "noisy" full-input model may become highly essential in a reduced model.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Observability vs. Causality** - The paper explicitly contrasts its method with traditional "linearized observability." Observability asks "Can I mathematically solve for the state?" while causality asks "Does this input physically drive the state change?" Quick check: If you remove a sensor and the system becomes unobservable but state prediction accuracy remains unchanged, was that sensor causal?

- **Concept: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)** - LTCs are a specialized form of Neural ODEs. Understanding that the network is defined by a differential equation d h/dt rather than discrete layers is crucial for understanding why perturbation analysis works. Quick check: How does the solver step size (Δt) affect the stability of the backpropagation through the LTC network?

- **Concept: The "Do-Calculus" Intuition** - The perturbation mechanism is a practical implementation of Pearl's *do*-operator. It changes the logic from "seeing X predicts Y" to "doing X changes Y." Quick check: Why does intervening on a noise signal fail to change the output trajectory in a well-trained observer?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer -> LTC Cell (Semi-implicit Euler) -> Readout (Linear) -> Causal Scorer (Perturbation) -> Pruning Agent

- **Critical path:** 1) Define the ODE system (LTC) with inputs. 2) Train via MSE loss using Adam + Gradient Clipping. 3) Stop training, switch to inference mode. 4) Apply perturbation ε to input channel 1, run forward pass, record score. Repeat for all channels. 5) Compare scores to threshold τ. If min(score) < τ, drop that input. 6) Re-initialize or warm-start the network with reduced input dimension and return to Step 2.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Perturbation Scale (ε): Too small results in numerical noise; too large pushes the model outside its training distribution. Adaptive Pruning: Aggressive pruning is faster but risks removing marginally useful sensors that become essential only after noise is gone.

- **Failure signatures:** Spurious Correlation Retention: High causality scores for noise channels (seen in first iteration of Ecological model). Fix: Run multiple iterations; spurious correlations often collapse in later epochs. Performance Collapse: Validation error spikes immediately after pruning. Fix: The threshold τ is too high; the "minimal" set was actually essential.

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Implement the LTC observer on the simple mechanical system with 2 physical inputs and 1 pure noise input. Verify the noise score is <0.02 while physical inputs are >0.3. 2) Train on the Chemical reactor with the interaction term F_in × V removed. Verify that prediction accuracy drops, proving the interaction term is causally necessary. 3) Run the iterative pruning on the Ecological model while varying ε (e.g., 10⁻² vs 10⁻³) to determine if the final sensor set remains stable.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the framework incorporate adaptive perturbation strategies or joint input analysis to handle systems with strongly correlated sensors?
- How does the methodology perform on real-world data characterized by measurement delays and sampling irregularities?
- Does the approach remain robust under sensor failure and scale to higher-dimensional systems?

## Limitations
- Reliance on continuous-time neural architectures introduces implementation challenges and training instability
- Pruning threshold τ is currently set empirically without principled theoretical basis for different system classes
- Performance on highly stochastic systems with significant process noise remains untested

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of input-dependent time constants in LTC networks is well-supported by the ODE formulation
- **Medium Confidence:** The perturbation-based causal scoring works as described for the tested systems but needs validation on different noise structures
- **Low Confidence:** The iterative re-estimation claim is theoretically sound but the practical threshold for "significant" validation degradation is qualitative and system-dependent

## Next Checks
1. Test the perturbation scale sensitivity by running the Ecological model with ε values spanning 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻² and document how the final sensor set changes
2. Implement the interaction term ablation on the Chemical reactor and verify the claimed 15% prediction accuracy drop when F_in × V is removed
3. Apply the framework to a system with known observability-causality mismatch to validate the method's ability to distinguish these cases
