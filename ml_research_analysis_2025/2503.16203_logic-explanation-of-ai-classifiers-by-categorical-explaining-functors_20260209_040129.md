# Logic Explanation of AI Classifiers by Categorical Explaining Functors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.16203
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16203
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Framework using category theory to ensure logically consistent Boolean explanations for fuzzy classifiers, validated on synthetic XOR and fuzzy OR benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating coherent, logically consistent explanations for opaque AI classifiers, particularly focusing on how current post-hoc XAI methods often fail to guarantee alignment between explanations and the model's underlying reasoning. The authors propose a novel framework using category theory to formally define an "explaining functor" that maps continuous fuzzy functions representing concept-based neural networks into Boolean explanations, ensuring that logical entailment is structurally preserved. This approach identifies a special class of δ-coherent fuzzy functions that guarantee consistent Boolean explanations by design, and extends this to all fuzzy functions via quotient categories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks show significant improvements in explanation fidelity, particularly for non-δ-coherent functions.

## Method Summary
The method introduces an explaining functor $F_\delta$ that maps fuzzy concept-based neural networks to Boolean explanations, ensuring logical consistency. The core idea is to define a class of δ-coherent fuzzy functions where thresholding continuous outputs preserves logical structure. For naturally incoherent functions, the framework extends via quotient categories using a δ-coherency function Γ to repair explanations. The approach is implemented using Logic Explained Networks (LENs) with PReLU activations, trained on synthetic benchmarks (XOR and fuzzy OR functions) with coherence regularization and domain extension techniques.

## Key Results
- LENs with coherence regularization achieve 94.8% fidelity for XOR explanations
- Extended functor improves fuzzy OR explanation fidelity from 67.1% to 83.8%
- The explaining functor structurally preserves logical entailment for δ-coherent functions
- Quotient category approach successfully handles non-δ-coherent functions through domain extension

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: δ-Coherence Preservation
The framework ensures logical consistency by restricting classifiers to δ-coherent functions, where thresholding continuous outputs yields the same result as thresholding inputs first. This constraint δ∘f = δ∘f∘δ allows the explaining functor to translate fuzzy logic operations into Boolean logic without contradictions.

### Mechanism 2: Categorical Functor Compositionality
By defining the explanation process as a categorical functor $F_\delta: C_δ → B$, the framework guarantees that explanations of composite systems equal the composition of individual explanations. This ensures global explanation faithfulness through layer-by-layer analysis.

### Mechanism 3: Quotient Category Repair
For naturally incoherent functions, the quotient category construction via δ-coherency function Γ repairs explanations by treating incoherent inputs as equivalence classes. Domain extension adds auxiliary features to distinguish problematic regions, recovering explanation fidelity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Category Theory (Categories, Functors)**: Formal language of the paper; functors map objects and morphisms while preserving relationships. Quick check: Does $F(g ∘ f) = F(g) ∘ F(f)$ for functor $F$? (Yes)
- **Fuzzy Logic & T-norms**: Continuous operators mapping [0,1] to Boolean logic; understanding why translation is hard requires knowing Łukasiewicz t-norms don't always translate cleanly. Quick check: Why does thresholding $x=0.6, y=0.6$ potentially yield different results for $x ⊗ y$ versus thresholding first?
- **Logic Explained Networks (LENs)**: Neural networks designed for First-Order Logic translation; differ from MLPs by producing interpretable logical rules. Quick check: How do LENs differ from standard MLPs in output interpretability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Layer (fuzzy concepts) -> LEN (classifier) -> Projection δ (discretization) -> Explaining Functor $F_δ$ (explanation extraction) -> Coherency Check/Γ-Correction (repair)
- **Critical path**: Determination of δ-coherence; verify if trained model satisfies δ∘f = δ∘f∘δ. If not, trigger quotient category extension by identifying incoherent points T and applying correction.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Naive functor is simpler with cleaner logic but fails on incoherent functions; extended functor improves fidelity but complicates rules with auxiliary variables.
- **Failure signatures**: Inconsistent explanations (same rule explaining opposite labels), fidelity drop (model accuracy vs explanation accuracy gap)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Sanity Check (XOR): Train LEN with coherence regularization, verify correct XOR formula extraction with ~95% fidelity. 2) Stress Test (Fuzzy OR): Train on non-coherent Łukasiewicz t-conorm, demonstrate naive functor failure (67% fidelity). 3) Repair Validation: Apply extended functor to Fuzzy OR, verify fidelity recovery (~84%) and inspect logic rules with auxiliary variable.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can categorical formulation be validated on concept-based models with sub-symbolic data like images? Basis: Authors propose empirical validation over concept-based models, especially with sub-symbolic data like images, which remains untested beyond synthetic benchmarks.
- **Open Question 2**: Can framework extend to non-logic-based methods like LIME or saliency maps? Basis: Authors suggest extension to support other explanation types, but unclear how categorical structures adapt to continuous attribution methods.
- **Open Question 3**: Can functors formally investigate structural connections between distinct XAI methods? Basis: Authors propose investigating how apparently incomparable XAI methods may be connected by categorical functors, but no unified categorical space encompassing multiple families yet exists.

## Limitations
- Experiments limited to synthetic benchmarks (XOR and fuzzy OR), leaving real-world applicability unproven
- Extended functor for non-δ-coherent functions introduces auxiliary features that may reduce interpretability
- Strong assumption that models can learn or be regularized to satisfy δ-coherence without significant accuracy loss

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mathematical formulation of explaining functor and properties (Theorems 1-2) are sound within category theory framework
- **Medium Confidence**: Experimental results on synthetic tasks are internally consistent but generalizability to real-world problems uncertain
- **Low Confidence**: Practical impact of coherence regularization on model accuracy and scalability of quotient approach for pervasive incoherence not addressed

## Next Checks
1. Apply framework to standard real-world dataset (e.g., UCI Adult, MNIST) and evaluate fidelity and interpretability versus heuristic methods
2. Conduct ablation study on XOR task varying coherence regularization strength to quantify tradeoff between explanation fidelity and model accuracy
3. Measure number of auxiliary features required by quotient category approach as incoherence region grows to assess scalability
