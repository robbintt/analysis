# RBF++: Quantifying and Optimizing Reasoning Boundaries across Measurable and Unmeasurable Capabilities for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.13307
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13307
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** RBF++ framework quantifies reasoning boundaries using weighted harmonic mean of measurable capabilities and constant assumptions for unmeasurable ones, validated across 38 models and 13 tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RBF++, a framework that quantifies and optimizes reasoning boundaries for Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models. The framework addresses the critical gap in evaluating reasoning limits by defining reasoning boundaries as the maximum task difficulty where accuracy exceeds a threshold. RBF++ combines measurable capabilities using a weighted harmonic mean while handling unmeasurable capabilities through constant assumptions and boundary division. The work demonstrates effectiveness across 38 models and 13 tasks, introduces MARP++ prompting for multimodal reasoning (improving accuracy by over 5%), and shows that reinforcement learning significantly enhances reasoning boundaries in advanced models like DeepSeek-R1.

## Method Summary
RBF++ quantifies reasoning boundaries by defining them as the maximum task difficulty where accuracy exceeds a threshold. The framework combines multiple measurable capabilities using a weighted harmonic mean approach, where each capability contributes according to its importance. For unmeasurable capabilities, the framework employs constant assumptions and boundary division strategies. The method involves empirical testing across diverse tasks to establish boundary functions for individual capabilities, then mathematically combines these using the weighted harmonic mean formula. The framework is validated through extensive experiments with 38 different models across 13 reasoning tasks, covering both unimodal and multimodal domains.

## Key Results
- RBF++ framework successfully quantifies reasoning boundaries across 38 models and 13 tasks, demonstrating generalization across measurable and unmeasurable domains
- MARP++ prompting method improves multimodal reasoning accuracy by over 5% compared to baseline approaches
- Reinforcement learning significantly enhances reasoning boundaries in advanced models like DeepSeek-R1, with notable improvements in both PFRB and CIRB categories
- The weighted harmonic mean approach effectively combines multiple measurable capabilities while constant assumptions handle unmeasurable ones

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RBF++ works by providing a quantitative framework that transforms the abstract concept of reasoning capability into measurable boundaries. The weighted harmonic mean captures the synergistic relationship between different reasoning capabilities, where improving one capability can compensate for limitations in others. The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to distinguish between measurable capabilities (like mathematical operations) that can be empirically tested, and unmeasurable ones (like abstract reasoning) that require assumption-based handling. This dual approach allows for comprehensive boundary quantification across diverse reasoning tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reasoning Boundary Definition**: The maximum task difficulty where accuracy exceeds a threshold - needed to establish quantitative metrics for abstract reasoning capabilities
- **Weighted Harmonic Mean**: Mathematical formula for combining multiple capabilities - needed to capture synergistic relationships between different reasoning skills
- **Capability Measurement**: Empirical testing of individual reasoning components - needed to establish baseline boundaries for measurable capabilities
- **Constant Assumption Method**: Handling unmeasurable capabilities through fixed values - needed to address abstract reasoning components that cannot be directly measured
- **Boundary Division**: Separating measurable and unmeasurable capabilities - needed to apply appropriate quantification methods to different capability types

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Task Generation -> Capability Measurement -> Boundary Function Calculation -> Weighted Harmonic Mean Combination -> Validation Across Models
**Critical Path:** The core workflow involves first establishing individual capability boundaries through empirical testing, then combining them using the weighted harmonic mean formula, and finally validating across diverse model-task combinations
**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades off precision in unmeasurable capability quantification for practical applicability by using constant assumptions, while maintaining accuracy through rigorous measurement of measurable capabilities
**Failure Signatures:** Poor boundary quantification occurs when unmeasurable capability assumptions are violated, or when capabilities exhibit strong dependencies that violate the independence assumption
**First Experiments:** 1) Test individual capability boundary measurement on a simple mathematical task, 2) Validate weighted harmonic mean combination on two measurable capabilities, 3) Apply MARP++ prompting to a multimodal task and measure accuracy improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Why do different reinforcement learning strategies (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 vs. OpenAI o3-mini) result in divergent scaling patterns across reasoning boundary categories, such as the inability of o3-mini to master medium-complexity tasks (CFRB) despite successfully improving infeasible ones (CIRB)?
- **Basis in paper:** Section V notes that while DeepSeek-R1 shows balanced improvement, "o3-mini primarily enhances the CIRB... however, this improvement does not lead to mastery in the area," causing it to underperform on medium-complexity tasks like MATH.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper observes the performance gap but does not isolate the specific RL training dynamics or architectural differences that cause one model to "master" a boundary while another only manages to make previously impossible tasks partially possible.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis of the reward modeling and optimization trajectories for DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini, specifically correlating reward signals with accuracy gains in the PFRB vs. CIRB regions.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent does the assumption that sub-reasoning boundaries (e.g., planning vs. operation) are mutually independent hold in complex, cross-modal tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** Appendix A, Assumption 5 states that "All basic reasoning boundary for combined reasoning boundary are mutually independent," which is mathematically necessary for the derivation of the combination law.
- **Why unresolved:** While the harmonic mean provides a good fit, the paper does not explore if "cross-talk" or dependencies exist (e.g., difficult planning causing operation errors) that might violate the weighted harmonic mean formulation in specific edge cases.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies on tasks where planning and operations are highly coupled to see if the theoretical boundary $B(t_1, t_2)$ deviates significantly from the empirical boundary predicted by the independent harmonic mean.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Are the specific numerical constraints used in MARP++ (e.g., "5 basic operations per step," "multiplications < 1.5e5") universal across different model scales, or do they function as model-specific hyperparameters that require tuning?
- **Basis in paper:** Appendix D details the MARP++ prompt with specific numerical limits, which likely correspond to the observed boundaries of GPT-4o.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates MARP++ effectiveness on GPT-4o but does not verify if these hard-coded constraints are optimal for smaller models (e.g., LLaMA-3-8B) or if they simply act as transferable priors.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments applying MARP++ to a diverse set of models (small vs. large) while varying the constraint values to determine if optimal performance requires model-specific calibration of the prompt boundaries.

## Limitations
- The framework relies on constant assumptions for unmeasurable capabilities, which may not generalize well across diverse domains and lack empirical validation
- The specific numerical constraints in MARP++ (e.g., operation limits, multiplication thresholds) may function as model-specific hyperparameters requiring tuning rather than universal values
- The reinforcement learning findings are based on limited model samples, raising questions about broader applicability beyond DeepSeek-R1

## Confidence
- **High**: Mathematical formulation of reasoning boundaries using weighted harmonic mean is sound and well-validated
- **Medium**: Overall framework effectiveness demonstrated across 38 models and 13 tasks
- **Low**: Constant assumption approach for unmeasurable capabilities lacks empirical validation across diverse domains

## Next Checks
1. Validate the constant assumption approach for unmeasurable capabilities across at least three additional diverse domains to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies on the weighted harmonic mean parameters to determine optimal weighting strategies for different capability combinations
3. Test MARP++ prompting across a broader range of multimodal tasks and model architectures to verify the consistency of the 5% improvement claim
