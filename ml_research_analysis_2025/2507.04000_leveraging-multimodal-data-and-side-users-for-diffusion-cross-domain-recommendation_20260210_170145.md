# Leveraging Multimodal Data and Side Users for Diffusion Cross-Domain Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.04000
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04000
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** MuSiC achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain cold-start recommendation, with up to 31.34% improvement over baselines on Amazon datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MuSiC, a cross-domain recommendation model that addresses cold-start problems by leveraging multimodal data and side users. The model extracts item features using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and user features using prompt learning, then employs a cross-domain diffusion module to generate target domain feature vectors. This two-stage approach first learns target domain distribution from side users, then transfers knowledge from overlapping users. Experiments on Amazon datasets show MuSiC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baselines in cold-start item recommendation scenarios.

## Method Summary
MuSiC uses MiniCPM-V to extract multimodal item features (images + text) and Llama3-8B to extract user features from reviews, producing 32-dimensional vectors. The core innovation is a two-stage diffusion training process: Stage 1 trains the model to reconstruct target domain features for side users (those only in the target domain), learning the target distribution. Stage 2 fine-tunes the model using overlapping users, conditioning the diffusion on auxiliary domain features to transfer knowledge. During inference, cold-start users' auxiliary features guide the diffusion process to generate target domain vectors for recommendation.

## Key Results
- MuSiC significantly outperforms baseline models on Amazon datasets, achieving up to 31.34% improvement in cold-start item recommendation scenarios
- The two-stage diffusion approach demonstrates superior performance compared to single-stage methods, validating the importance of learning target domain distribution from side users
- Performance degrades gracefully as cold-start ratios increase, with MuSiC maintaining effectiveness even at 80% cold-start scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) create domain-unified item representations that align cross-domain features better than ID-based embeddings.
- **Mechanism:** The model uses MiniCPM-V (an MLLM) to process item images and text via prompt learning. It extracts the "first-last-avg" hidden state (average of first and last token embeddings) rather than generated text. This captures semantic content inherent to the item (e.g., a movie's visual style) rather than interaction patterns, facilitating alignment between domains like Books and Movies.
- **Core assumption:** MLLMs trained on broad data provide more transferable semantic features than collaborative filtering IDs or standard PLMs.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "employ a multimodal large language model to extract item multimodal features... without fine-tuning."
  - [section 3.2] "allows the model to extract fused item features... resulting in the first-last-avg representation."
  - [corpus] "ExplainRec" and "Unifying Inductive... Learning" papers support the trend of using LLMs to handle sparse data and zero-shot generalization in recommendations.
- **Break condition:** If items lack visual/textual metadata, or if the MLLM fails to capture domain-invariant features (e.g., domain-specific jargon is lost), alignment fails.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Leveraging "side users" (users exclusive to the target domain) enables the model to learn the target domain's feature distribution more accurately.
- **Mechanism:** Standard CDR focuses only on overlapping users, which may not represent the target domain's full variance. MuSiC's Stage 1 trains the diffusion model to reconstruct target features for side users ($L_{dm\_us}$). This forces the model to learn the general shape and density of the target vector space before attempting to transfer specific users.
- **Core assumption:** Side users share similar preference distributions with potential cold-start users in the target domain.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "neglect of side users... leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space distribution."
  - [section 3.5.2] "The training process is divided into two stages: the model first optimizes the diffusion loss $L_{dm\_us}$ for side users..."
  - [corpus] Corpus papers (e.g., "Federated Mixture-of-Expert") focus heavily on overlapping users; this paper uniquely isolates the "side user" contribution in ablation studies (Table 3).
- **Break condition:** If side users are statistically distinct from the cold-start target audience (distribution shift), the learned prior will misguide the generation.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** A conditional diffusion process generates robust target domain features for cold-start users by treating cross-domain transfer as a generative denoising task.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of a deterministic mapping function (which can overfit), the model uses a "Vectorized U-Net" within a diffusion framework. It starts with noise and the user's auxiliary domain feature ($f^A_u$) as a condition. It iteratively denoises this to produce the target feature ($f^T_u$).
- **Core assumption:** The transformation from auxiliary to target space can be modeled as a reverse diffusion process guided by semantic content.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "propose the cross-domain diffusion module to learn the generation of feature vectors... understanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation."
  - [section 3.3.2] "We use the auxiliary domain feature vectors... as additional conditions to guide the conditional generation."
  - [corpus] "Exploring Preference-Guided Diffusion Model..." validates the broader efficacy of diffusion in CDR, though MuSiC specifically adapts U-Net for vectors rather than graphs.
- **Break condition:** If the diffusion steps ($T$) are too few (insufficient refinement) or too many (excessive noise accumulation), generation quality degrades (see Figure 3).

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Diffusion Models (DDPM)
- **Why needed here:** The core engine of MuSiC is a diffusion model. You must understand the difference between the forward process (adding noise) and the reverse process (denoising) to grasp how features are "generated."
- **Quick check question:** How does the model use the auxiliary domain feature during the reverse diffusion step? (Hint: It acts as a condition).

### Concept: Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR)
- **Why needed here:** The paper addresses the "cold-start" problem. Understanding the distinction between "overlapping users" (bridge) and "cold-start users" (target) is essential.
- **Quick check question:** Why do traditional mapping functions (like EMCDR) fail in this context according to the authors? (Hint: Overfitting/point-to-point mapping limits).

### Concept: LLM Embeddings
- **Why needed here:** The model does not fine-tune the LLM. It relies on extracting embeddings from hidden layers.
- **Quick check question:** Why extract the average of the first and last hidden layers rather than just the last layer?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Raw Text (Reviews/Descriptions) + Images -> MiniCPM-V (Items) & Llama3-8B (Users) -> MLPs -> Vectorized U-Net (modified for 1D vectors) -> Target Domain User Vector $\hat{f}^T_{uc}$

### Critical path:
1. **Stage 1:** Train Diffusion to reconstruct Target features for Side Users (unconditional)
2. **Stage 2:** Fine-tune Diffusion for Overlapping Users (conditional on Aux features)
3. **Inference:** Generate Target features for Cold-Start Users (conditional on their Aux features)

### Design tradeoffs:
- **Tanh vs. ReLU:** Authors claim Tanh is superior because it preserves negative values (semantic integrity) and bounds outputs [-1, 1], stabilizing diffusion training (Section 4.4.2)
- **Offline vs. Online:** MLLM extraction is computationally expensive (>10 hours offline), but diffusion training is fast (<30 mins)

### Failure signatures:
- **High β (80% cold-start):** Performance degrades relative to baselines because the diffusion model has insufficient overlapping users to learn the transfer pattern (Section 4.2)
- **Dual Cold-Start:** Standard baselines collapse (MAE > 4.0), while MuSiC remains robust due to MLLM content features (Table 4)

### First 3 experiments:
1. **Sanity Check (Ablation):** Run `w/o side` to confirm that removing side user training degrades RMSE, validating the distribution learning hypothesis
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning (Steps T):** Vary diffusion steps (2, 5, 10, 20, 50) to find the sweet spot where RMSE minimizes (paper suggests ≈10)
3. **Activation Probe:** Swap `tanh` for `ReLU` in the feature projection MLP to observe the reported drop in stability and accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the multimodal feature extraction process be optimized for near real-time application given the high computational overhead?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4.6 states that the feature extraction using MLLMs is an offline process requiring over 10 hours, whereas the diffusion training takes less than 30 minutes.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper establishes that the heavy computational cost is currently managed by treating extraction as a one-time offline task, leaving the challenge of reducing this latency for dynamic or real-time environments unaddressed.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A study evaluating the performance-latency trade-off when using smaller, faster encoders or knowledge distillation techniques to compress the MLLM without significant loss in recommendation accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does MuSiC maintain its performance advantages when transferring knowledge between domains with significant semantic gaps or non-product-based interactions?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The experiments are limited to three Amazon product subsets (Movie, Music, Book), which share structural similarities in metadata and user behavior; the paper does not test on disparate domains (e.g., social media to e-commerce).
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper demonstrates effective alignment between similar product domains, it is unclear if the "domain-unified encoded representations" derived from MLLMs are sufficient to bridge the larger distributional differences found in heterogeneous domain pairs.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results on cross-domain datasets involving dissimilar modalities or interaction types (e.g., MovieLens to Flickr, or location-based services to retail) showing comparable improvements over baselines.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is there an adaptive or theoretical optimal method for determining the number of diffusion steps T to balance reconstruction accuracy and noise reduction?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 4.4.1 demonstrates that performance varies significantly with the step count T (peaking at 10 but dropping at 50 or 2) and relies on grid search to find the "optimal point" for specific tasks.
- **Why unresolved:** The sensitivity to T suggests that the current linear schedule or fixed step count is not universally robust, raising the question of whether the noise schedule or step count can be learned or adapted dynamically per user.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Implementation of an adaptive diffusion sampler that terminates the reverse process based on a convergence metric, showing consistent performance without the need for manual hyperparameter tuning for T.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How can the framework be extended to handle cold-start users who lack textual review history in the auxiliary domain?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 3.2 explicitly states that the method relies on textual review data $X_r$ for user feature extraction using Llama3-8B, implying a reliance on the existence of such text.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper does not address scenarios where "cold-start" implies a total lack of interaction and content data (reviews) in the auxiliary domain, which would render the LLM-based user feature extraction ineffective.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study or modified framework incorporating side information (e.g., demographics) or graph-based structural features to replace missing review text for users in the auxiliary domain.

## Limitations
- **Implementation opacity:** Critical details like MLLM prompts, exact U-Net architecture, and training hyperparameters are underspecified, making exact reproduction uncertain
- **Limited evaluation scope:** Experiments are confined to three Amazon product domain pairs, raising questions about generalizability to more dissimilar domains
- **Computational overhead:** MLLM feature extraction requires >10 hours offline, creating significant barriers for real-time applications

## Confidence
- **High:** The two-stage diffusion training framework and the use of multimodal features for cold-start scenarios are well-established approaches with solid experimental backing
- **Medium:** The specific implementation details (MLLM prompts, U-Net architecture, exact training procedure) are critical but underspecified, making exact reproduction uncertain
- **Low:** The generalizability claim to other datasets and domains beyond the three Amazon pairs tested is not supported by evidence

## Next Checks
1. **Reimplementation Fidelity:** Attempt to reproduce the MuSiC results on one domain pair (e.g., Books→Movies) using the described methodology, focusing on exact replication of the two-stage diffusion training and feature extraction pipeline
2. **MLLM Feature Robustness:** Test whether the "first-last-avg" hidden state approach consistently outperforms alternatives (e.g., last layer only, average of all layers) across different domain pairs and item types
3. **Side-User Distribution Sensitivity:** Systematically vary the ratio and composition of side users in the training data to quantify the sensitivity of the diffusion model's performance to the learned target domain distribution
