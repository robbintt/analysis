# BeDiscovER: The Benchmark of Discourse Understanding in the Era of Reasoning Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.13095
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13095
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Reasoning models excel at arithmetic temporal tasks but struggle with nuanced discourse phenomena like implicit rhetorical relations and full-document reasoning.

## Executive Summary
BeDiscovER introduces a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate discourse-level knowledge in reasoning-oriented large language models. The benchmark compiles 52 publicly available datasets across five discourse tasks: discourse marker understanding, temporal reasoning, discourse relation recognition, sentence ordering, and dialogue discourse parsing. Covering lexical, sentential, and documental levels, BeDiscovER provides a unified evaluation pipeline for assessing model performance on discourse understanding. The authors evaluate reasoning models including Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-5-mini, finding that while these models show strong performance in arithmetic temporal reasoning, they struggle with full document reasoning and subtle semantic phenomena like rhetorical relation recognition.

## Method Summary
The BeDiscovER benchmark aggregates 52 publicly available datasets spanning five core discourse tasks across lexical, sentential, and documental levels. The evaluation pipeline standardizes task formats and assessment metrics to enable fair comparison across reasoning models (Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-5-mini) and baselines. The benchmark specifically targets discourse marker understanding, temporal reasoning, discourse relation recognition, sentence ordering, and dialogue discourse parsing. Performance is measured across heterogeneous datasets, with particular attention to how reasoning models handle explicit versus implicit discourse phenomena and arithmetic versus contextual temporal reasoning.

## Key Results
- Reasoning models show strong performance on arithmetic temporal reasoning tasks but struggle with nuanced discourse phenomena.
- Models exhibit significant performance gaps on implicit rhetorical relation recognition and full-document reasoning tasks.
- State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate notable reasoning gaps in discourse understanding despite advances in other reasoning domains.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BeDiscovER works by providing a standardized evaluation framework that exposes the specific discourse-level capabilities and limitations of reasoning-oriented LLMs. The benchmark's comprehensive coverage across multiple discourse tasks and levels (lexical, sentential, documental) reveals systematic patterns in model performance, particularly highlighting the distinction between explicit, structured reasoning tasks (like arithmetic temporal reasoning) and more nuanced semantic understanding tasks (like implicit rhetorical relations).

## Foundational Learning
- **Discourse Marker Understanding**: Why needed - Discourse markers signal relationships between text segments; quick check - Model correctly identifies pragmatic functions of connectives like "however" or "therefore"
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Why needed - Understanding temporal relationships is crucial for narrative comprehension; quick check - Model accurately orders events and resolves temporal ambiguities
- **Discourse Relation Recognition**: Why needed - Identifying implicit and explicit discourse relations is fundamental to discourse coherence; quick check - Model distinguishes between causal, contrastive, and elaborative relations
- **Sentence Ordering**: Why needed - Coherent text requires proper sentence arrangement; quick check - Model reconstructs logical flow from shuffled sentences
- **Dialogue Discourse Parsing**: Why needed - Dialogue structure differs from monologue and requires specialized understanding; quick check - Model correctly identifies dialogue acts and conversational structure

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Datasets -> Preprocessing Pipeline -> Task-Specific Evaluators -> Unified Scoring System -> Performance Analysis
**Critical Path**: Data ingestion → Task standardization → Model inference → Metric computation → Comparative analysis
**Design Tradeoffs**: The benchmark prioritizes comprehensive coverage over depth in individual tasks, potentially diluting task-specific rigor but enabling broader generalization assessment
**Failure Signatures**: Performance drops on implicit relations indicate reasoning limitations rather than surface pattern matching; arithmetic temporal success suggests rule-based reasoning capability
**3 First Experiments**: 1) Evaluate arithmetic vs contextual temporal reasoning performance gap, 2) Compare implicit vs explicit discourse relation recognition accuracy, 3) Assess document-level vs sentence-level reasoning capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, focusing instead on presenting empirical findings about current reasoning model limitations in discourse understanding.

## Limitations
- Results conflate task complexity with model capability without controlling for dataset-specific factors like annotation quality or domain specificity
- The unified evaluation pipeline may introduce biases from mixing datasets with different annotation schemas and domains
- Lack of systematic error analysis prevents determining whether failures stem from model reasoning limitations or data-specific issues

## Confidence
- **Medium**: The main finding that LLMs struggle with subtle semantic discourse tasks is supported by broad dataset coverage but lacks rigorous controls
- **Low**: The claim about arithmetic temporal reasoning superiority conflates task difficulty with model capability without deeper investigation
- **Medium**: BeDiscovER provides comprehensive evaluation but lacks validation against human performance or alternative benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a controlled experiment isolating task complexity from dataset effects to verify whether arithmetic temporal reasoning superiority is due to task simplicity rather than model capability
2. Perform a detailed error analysis categorizing model failures (e.g., annotation noise, domain mismatch, reasoning gaps) to determine root causes of performance differences across tasks
3. Compare BeDiscovER results with human performance baselines on the same datasets to assess whether current LLMs' discourse understanding truly lags behind human capabilities
