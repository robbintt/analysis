# Tourism Question Answer System in Indian Language using Domain-Adapted Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.23235
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23235
- Reference count: 9
- This study presents the first Hindi QA system for Varanasi tourism, addressing the lack of language-specific resources in this domain

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a Hindi question-answering system tailored for Varanasi tourism, addressing the critical gap in language-specific resources for Indian tourism applications. The research team constructed a dataset of 7,715 manually curated Hindi QA pairs, which was subsequently augmented to 27,455 pairs using Llama zero-shot prompting. The framework leverages BERT and RoBERTa models, fine-tuned using SFT and LoRA techniques to optimize parameter efficiency and task performance. The work establishes a foundational baseline for Hindi tourism QA systems while emphasizing the role of LoRA in low-resource settings.

## Method Summary
The methodology centers on developing a domain-specific Hindi QA dataset for Varanasi tourism, constructed through manual curation and augmented using zero-shot prompting with Llama models. The research employs two transformer-based architectures - BERT and RoBERTa - fine-tuned using both SFT and LoRA approaches. LoRA-based fine-tuning achieved competitive performance (85.3% F1) while reducing trainable parameters by 98% compared to SFT. The system was evaluated on its ability to handle culturally embedded terms and contextual nuances specific to Indian tourism contexts.

## Key Results
- Constructed first Hindi QA dataset for Varanasi tourism with 7,715 manually curated pairs
- Achieved 85.3% F1 score using LoRA-based fine-tuning with 98% reduction in trainable parameters
- RoBERTa with SFT outperformed BERT variants in capturing contextual nuances for culturally embedded terms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from domain adaptation of foundation models to Hindi tourism contexts, where cultural specificity and linguistic nuances play crucial roles. By leveraging LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, the model maintains high performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. The combination of carefully curated domain-specific data and transformer-based architectures enables effective handling of tourism-related queries in Hindi, particularly for culturally embedded terminology.

## Foundational Learning
- **Zero-shot prompting with Llama**: Used to augment the manually curated dataset from 7,715 to 27,455 QA pairs, enabling rapid scaling of training data without additional manual effort
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Critical for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, reducing trainable parameters by 98% while maintaining competitive performance (85.3% F1)
- **Transformer-based architectures (BERT/RoBERTa)**: Provide the foundational language understanding capabilities, with RoBERTa showing superior performance in capturing contextual nuances for culturally specific terms
- **Domain-specific dataset curation**: Essential for capturing the unique vocabulary and context of Varanasi tourism, addressing the lack of Hindi language resources in this domain
- **Parameter efficiency in low-resource settings**: LoRA enables effective model adaptation with limited computational resources, crucial for Indian language NLP applications
- **Cultural context modeling**: The system's ability to handle culturally embedded terms demonstrates the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning for tourism applications

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Dataset Construction -> Model Selection (BERT/RoBERTa) -> Fine-tuning (SFT/LoRA) -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The most critical pathway involves dataset quality → model fine-tuning → evaluation metrics, where each stage directly impacts the final performance outcomes.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice between SFT and LoRA represents a fundamental tradeoff between parameter count and performance efficiency. While SFT may offer slightly better performance, LoRA provides 98% parameter reduction, making it more suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include poor handling of code-switching (mixed Hindi-English queries), inability to generalize beyond Varanasi-specific contexts, and degradation when encountering out-of-domain tourism questions or adversarial queries with misspelled words.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Cross-domain evaluation on QA pairs from other Indian tourist destinations
2. Robustness testing with adversarial queries including misspellings and code-switching
3. Human evaluation benchmark comparing model-generated answers against ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset remains domain-specific to Varanasi and may not capture full diversity of Indian tourism contexts
- Manual curation of 7,715 QA pairs represents modest scale for deep learning applications
- Augmentation methodology relies on zero-shot prompting which may introduce quality inconsistencies
- Evaluation focuses primarily on F1-score metrics without exploring robustness to adversarial queries or out-of-domain questions

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The comparative performance advantage of LoRA over SFT in parameter efficiency (98% reduction) and competitive F1 scores (85.3%) is well-supported by the experimental results presented.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that RoBERTa with SFT outperforms BERT variants in capturing contextual nuances for culturally embedded terms is supported but would benefit from more granular analysis of specific failure cases.

**Medium confidence**: The assertion that this represents the "first" Hindi QA system for Varanasi tourism appears plausible given the cited lack of language-specific resources, though the literature review could be more exhaustive.

## Next Checks
1. **Domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate the trained models on QA pairs from other Indian tourist destinations (e.g., Taj Mahal, Kerala backwaters) to assess cross-domain performance and identify cultural/contextual limitations.

2. **Robustness Evaluation**: Design adversarial testing with intentionally misspelled Hindi words, mixed-language queries (code-switching), and questions requiring multi-hop reasoning to assess model resilience in realistic usage scenarios.

3. **Human Evaluation Benchmark**: Conduct blind human assessments comparing model-generated answers against ground truth across different question types (factual, opinion-based, culturally nuanced) to validate automated metric reliability and identify perceptual quality gaps.
