# Towards Efficient VLMs: Information-Theoretic Driven Compression via Adaptive Structural Pruning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.19518
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19518
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** Achieves up to 3.2x FLOP reduction and 1.8x acceleration on VLMs with minimal accuracy loss using information-theoretic pruning.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational inefficiency of vision-language models (VLMs) by introducing InfoPrune, a framework that combines information-theoretic principles with adaptive structural pruning. The method uses the Information Bottleneck principle to formulate pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies. It employs entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance to create a unified criterion for pruning attention heads and compressing feed-forward networks. Experiments on VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA demonstrate significant computational savings with negligible performance degradation.

## Method Summary
InfoPrune introduces an information-theoretic framework for adaptive structural pruning of VLMs. It formulates pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies, using the Information Bottleneck principle. The method employs an entropy-based effective rank (eRank) to quantify the contribution of each attention head and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance to measure the divergence between original and compressed structures. This yields a unified criterion that jointly considers structural sparsity and informational efficiency. Building on this foundation, InfoPrune designs two complementary schemes: (1) a training-based head pruning guided by the proposed information loss objective, and (2) a training-free FFN compression via adaptive low-rank approximation.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 3.2x FLOP reduction and 1.8x acceleration on VLMs
- Maintains accuracy within 1-2% of original models on VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA benchmarks
- Demonstrates superior efficiency compared to existing methods like YOPO while maintaining better latency-performance tradeoffs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Pruning attention heads via an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective forces the model to retain task-relevant semantics while discarding input redundancy.
- **Mechanism:** The method introduces learnable importance parameters (ζ) for each head. During training, these are optimized not just for task accuracy (L_task), but against a combined loss: minimizing eRank (to lower mutual information with the input X) and minimizing KS distance (to maximize mutual information with the target Y). This theoretically isolates the "information bottleneck" where the representation is maximally concise and predictive.
- **Core assumption:** The attention output Z is a deterministic function of input X, allowing mutual information differences I(X;Z_S) - I(X;Z) to be approximated by entropy differences (eRank).
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, we formulate pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies." [section 4.1] "The goal is to select the optimal combination of attention heads... such that... The meaningful information... remains unchanged: I(Y;Z_S) ≈ I(Y;Z)."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Reducing the entropy-based effective rank (eRank) of attention outputs serves as a proxy for removing redundant information channels.
- **Mechanism:** Standard matrix rank is brittle (integer-based). eRank calculates the exponential of the entropy of the singular value distribution. By minimizing the difference eRank(Z_S) - eRank(Z), the optimizer dampens minor singular values, effectively collapsing dimensions that contribute low-entropy (redundant) information flow.
- **Core assumption:** Lower entropy in the singular value spectrum of the attention output correlates directly to the removal of "nuisance" information from the input.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4.1.1] "It can be proved that the difference in mutual information... is equivalent to the difference in eRank... min eRank(Z_S) - eRank(Z)."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Training-free FFN compression via SVD adaptively preserves model fidelity by retaining singular values proportional to spectral energy.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of retraining, the method treats the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) as a locally linear map (via Taylor expansion). It composes weights W = W_2 W_1 and applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Using the Eckart–Young theorem, it calculates the minimal rank k required to keep the reconstruction error within a bound ε. This retains the "dominant subspace" without gradient updates.
- **Core assumption:** The non-linear activation in the FFN can be approximated by a linear scaling term diag(φ') around typical activations, validating the use of SVD on the weight product.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4.2] "We approximate the nonlinear mapping by its locally linear form... justifying the use of SVD... [to] retain the top-k singular components that satisfy a reconstruction error constraint."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Information Bottleneck (IB) Principle**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the theoretical engine of the paper. You cannot understand the loss function (L_eRank + L_KS) without grasping the IB trade-off: compressing the input representation Z until it retains only the information relevant to the target Y.
  - **Quick check question:** If I increase the Lagrange multiplier β in the IB objective (min I(X;Z) - β I(Y;Z)), should the model become more compressed or more accurate? (Answer: More accurate, as relevance is weighted higher).

- **Concept: Effective Rank (eRank)**
  - **Why needed here:** Used to quantify "redundancy." Unlike standard rank (count of non-zero singular values), eRank measures the "spread" or entropy of those values. This provides a differentiable signal for how "dense" the information is.
  - **Quick check question:** Does a diagonal matrix with values [10, 0.01, 0.01] have a lower or higher eRank than a matrix with [10, 10, 10]? (Answer: Lower. The energy is concentrated in one direction).

- **Concept: Eckart–Young–Mirsky Theorem**
  - **Why needed here:** This justifies the training-free FFN pruning. It mathematically guarantees that truncating the SVD provides the best possible low-rank approximation of a matrix under the Frobenius norm.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the paper use the sum of squared singular values (∑ σ²) to determine the cutoff rank? (Answer: Because the squared Frobenius norm of the error is the sum of the squared discarded singular values).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Visual Encoder (Vision Blocks) -> Attention Heads (Pruned via Training-based IB) -> Feed-Forward Networks (Pruned via Training-free SVD) -> LLM Backbone (Not pruned)
- **Critical path:** 1) Training Phase: Pass data through Vision Blocks -> Calculate Z -> Compute L_eRank (redundancy) and L_KS (fidelity) -> Backpropagate to learn head importance ζ. 2) Pruning Phase: Threshold ζ to remove heads. Calculate SVD of FFN weights -> Truncate based on ε. 3) Inference: Run inference using the narrowed visual encoder.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Head Pruning vs. FFN Pruning: The paper notes FFN pruning is more sensitive to aggressive ratios than head pruning. Loss Component Weights (β, γ): High γ (KS distance) preserves information but may hinder compression; high β (eRank) aids compression but risks dropping salient features if unbalanced. Efficiency vs. Accuracy: Table 1 shows YOPO achieves lower FLOPs (11.68T) but worse latency (730ms) compared to InfoPrune (48.02T, 328ms). Optimizing for FLOPs ≠ Optimizing for Latency.
- **Failure signatures:** Stagnant Gradients: If using L_eRank alone, gradients vanish; requires extremely high learning rates (noted in Section 5.3 ablation). Aggressive FFN Pruning: Setting ε too high (e.g., 0.01 vs 0.001) causes sharp accuracy drops on VQAv2 (Table 4: 59.38 -> 54.30), indicating critical non-linear features were linearized away.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Sanity Check (Ablation): Train the model with "Only KS" vs. "eRank + KS" loss on TextVQA (replicate Table 2). Verify that eRank stabilizes high pruning ratios. 2) FFN Sensitivity: Run the training-free SVD pruning on the FFN weights with varying ε (e.g., 0.001, 0.005, 0.01). Plot the retained dimension k vs. VQAv2 accuracy to find the "knee" of the curve. 3) Latency Benchmark: Compare the forward pass latency of the "InfoPrune" model against the "YOPO" baseline on an A800 GPU to verify that theoretical FLOP reduction translates to wall-clock speedup (Table 1).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can InfoPrune be effectively extended to the language decoder components of Vision-Language Models?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "In the future, we plan to extend InfoPrune to the language components of multimodal systems to further enhance compression consistency."
  - Why unresolved: The current study isolates the visual modules (Qwen2VL-7B vision encoder), and it is unclear if the Information Bottleneck principle applies similarly to the generative components of the LLM backbone.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results applying the eRank and KS distance criteria to the attention heads and FFNs of the language decoder, measuring performance degradation on standard benchmarks.

- **What are the synergistic effects of combining InfoPrune with quantization techniques?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion suggests, "Combining the proposed approach with complementary techniques such as quantization and knowledge distillation could yield additional gains in efficiency."
  - Why unresolved: Structural pruning reduces FLOPs and latency, while quantization reduces memory bandwidth; the interaction between information-theoretic structural removal and precision reduction remains unexplored.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A study benchmarking the accuracy and inference speed of a model simultaneously compressed using InfoPrune and 4-bit quantization compared to either method alone.

- **How robust is the training-free FFN compression to shifts in the input visual distribution?**
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.2 justifies the training-free SVD approach by approximating the non-linear FFN as a "locally linear map" around a "typical activation region" x_0.
  - Why unresolved: If the "typical activation" derived from calibration data does not generalize to out-of-distribution inputs (e.g., different image styles or domains), the low-rank approximation may fail to capture the necessary information.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the training-free FFN compression performance on domain-shifted datasets (e.g., sketches or medical imagery) without recalculating the SVD ranks.

## Limitations
- The theoretical foundation assumes the attention output is a deterministic function of the input, which may not hold in practice for stochastic attention mechanisms or when dropout is applied.
- The training-free FFN compression relies on a locally linear approximation of non-linear activations, which may fail to capture critical non-linear decision boundaries in the network.
- The effectiveness of the KS distance as a proxy for preserving information relevant to the target task is not fully validated across diverse datasets and model architectures.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The experimental results showing FLOP reduction and latency improvement are directly measurable and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence:** The information-theoretic framework (IB principle, eRank, KS distance) is sound in theory, but its practical implementation and optimization may be sensitive to hyperparameters and model specifics.
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that the method "establishes a theoretically grounded" approach is strong, given the approximations made in the derivations (e.g., deterministic assumption, linear FFN approximation).

## Next Checks
1. **Deterministic vs. Stochastic Attention:** Implement a variant of the InfoPrune head pruning that explicitly accounts for the stochasticity in attention (e.g., by sampling multiple attention outputs). Compare the pruning performance to the deterministic version to quantify the impact of the approximation.
2. **Non-linear FFN Behavior:** For a specific FFN layer, analyze the singular value spectrum of the weight matrix before and after SVD-based compression. Correlate the change in this spectrum with the degradation in a non-linearly demanding task (e.g., counting objects in an image) to isolate cases where the linear approximation fails.
3. **Cross-Architecture Generalization:** Apply the InfoPrune framework to a different VLM architecture (e.g., LLaVA-1.5 or MiniGPT-4). Evaluate whether the same hyperparameters (β, γ, z, ε) and the same patterns of head/FFN importance hold, or if the method requires significant re-tuning.
