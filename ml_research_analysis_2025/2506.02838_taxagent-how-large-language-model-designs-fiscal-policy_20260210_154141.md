# TaxAgent: How Large Language Model Designs Fiscal Policy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.02838
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02838
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLM-driven adaptive tax policy outperforms traditional systems in equity-efficiency trade-offs within agent-based simulation

## Executive Summary
TaxAgent is an LLM-driven framework for adaptive tax policy design that integrates agent-based modeling with large language models to simulate realistic taxpayer behavior and iteratively optimize tax rates. The system demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional rule-based optimal taxation models, achieving better equity-efficiency trade-offs in macroeconomic simulations. By eliminating rigid assumptions about welfare calculations and modeling irrational behavior, TaxAgent provides a scalable, data-driven approach for fiscal policy evaluation that prioritizes equality while maintaining productivity through dynamic flexibility.

## Method Summary
The framework combines N=50 heterogeneous LLM-based household agents (H-Agents) with a government LLM agent (TaxAgent) in a closed-loop macroeconomic simulation. H-Agents receive personas and economic conditions to output work/consumption propensities, with quarterly reflection updates to their behavior. TaxAgent observes aggregated metrics (productivity, equality, household distributions, historical tax rates) and outputs bracketed tax rate schedules. The macroeconomic environment updates wages, prices, inventory, and interest rates based on agent decisions. The system iterates over 120 months, with TaxAgent dynamically adjusting rates to optimize social outcomes measured by equality-productivity index.

## Key Results
- TaxAgent achieved superior equity-efficiency trade-offs, with equality scores stabilizing between 0.6-0.75 and maintaining unemployment rates of 2-5%
- The system demonstrated robustness across different LLM implementations, with qwen-turbo and GPT-4o showing comparable performance
- TaxAgent outperformed Saez Optimal Taxation, US federal income tax, and free-market scenarios in long-term social outcomes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LLM-based policy agents can navigate equity-efficiency trade-offs without explicit welfare functions. The TaxAgent receives aggregated economic metrics and outputs bracketed tax rate schedules that improve long-term social outcomes by internalizing a flexible preference for equality that adapts to production conditions. Core assumption: LLMs encode sufficient reasoning about trade-offs and fairness to produce economically coherent policy updates when conditioned on structured macroeconomic indicators.

### Mechanism 2
Simulating heterogeneous, boundedly rational households enables more realistic policy feedback than representative-agent models. Each H-Agent receives a persona and current conditions, outputting work and consumption propensities with quarterly reflection updates. Core assumption: LLM persona-conditioned decisions capture enough behavioral heterogeneity and irrationality to approximate real taxpayer adjustments.

### Mechanism 3
Iterative feedback between policy and behavior in closed simulation enables adaptive tax schedules that outperform static systems. Each simulation step involves H-Agents setting propensities, environment updating conditions, and TaxAgent adjusting rates, creating a dynamic loop that allows for context-sensitive policy changes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**: Why needed: Replaces representative-agent equilibrium models with heterogeneous, interacting agents whose aggregate behavior emerges from individual decisions. Quick check: Can you explain how ABM differs from equation-based macro models in representing heterogeneity and non-equilibrium dynamics?

- **Large Language Model Reasoning under Prompt Constraints**: Why needed: Both TaxAgent and H-Agents use LLMs prompted with structured JSON inputs/outputs; performance depends on prompt design and model consistency. Quick check: What failure modes arise when LLMs are constrained to numeric outputs in repeated decision loops?

- **Optimal Taxation Theory (Saez Framework)**: Why needed: The baseline comparison uses Saez's elasticity-based optimal tax formula; understanding its assumptions clarifies what TaxAgent relaxes. Quick check: How does the Saez formula balance efficiency losses against redistributive gains, and what does it assume about behavioral elasticities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: TaxAgent (Government) -> H-Agents Group -> Macroeconomic Simulation Environment -> TaxAgent (feedback loop)
- **Critical path**: 1. Initialize H-Agents with personas and starting conditions 2. Each period: H-Agents observe conditions → output work/consumption propensities 3. Environment computes aggregate supply/demand → updates wages, prices, inventory 4. TaxAgent observes updated metrics → outputs new tax rates 5. Loop for 120 months; log equality, productivity, inflation, unemployment
- **Design tradeoffs**: Simulation scale (N=50 households) vs computational cost and behavioral diversity; LLM choice (qwen-turbo vs GPT-4o) vs cost, consistency, and reasoning quality; bracket granularity (7 brackets) vs policy flexibility and LLM output complexity
- **Failure signatures**: Equality-productivity index stagnates or degrades long-term → prompt may not encode trade-off clearly; Inflation/unemployment spike → macroeconomic module parameters may be misconfigured; H-Agent outputs invalid JSON or values outside [0,1] → prompt constraints violated
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Reproduce baseline comparison: Run TaxAgent vs Saez, US federal, free-market over 120 months with N=50 2. Ablate LLM backbone: Swap qwen-turbo for GPT-4o and compare social outcome curves 3. Stress-test macro dynamics: Introduce exogenous shocks and observe whether TaxAgent's adjustments maintain stable trade-offs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the TaxAgent framework maintain its performance and computational efficiency when scaled from 50 households to populations reflecting real-world national economies? The authors claim scalability and cost-effectiveness, yet validation is restricted to N=50 households. What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks with N > 1,000 households or complexity analysis.

### Open Question 2
How accurately do LLM-driven H-Agents model actual human economic behavior compared to standard behavioral models? The paper claims to simulate "real-world taxpayer behaviors" but offers no validation against empirical data. What evidence would resolve it: Validation study comparing H-Agent decisions against historical behavioral data or controlled experiments.

### Open Question 3
Can tax policies generated by TaxAgent generalize effectively to real-world environments with exogenous shocks and political constraints? The simulation assumes a closed system, leaving the "sim-to-real" gap unexplored. What evidence would resolve it: Retrospective policy analysis using historical economic data to determine if recommendations would have improved outcomes during past crises.

## Limitations
- Behavioral fidelity of LLM personas unverified against empirical microdata
- Fixed productivity assumption (set to 1) may oversimplify real-world production dynamics
- Closed-loop simulation omits real-world constraints like political feasibility, international capital flows, and informal economic sectors

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Iterative LLM-driven policy adjustments respond to simulated economic metrics (observed trade-offs in simulation)
- **Medium Confidence**: TaxAgent outperforms traditional systems, limited by artificial simulation environment
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability of simulated policies to real-world economies and behavioral realism of LLM personas

## Next Checks

1. **Behavioral Validation**: Compare H-Agent labor/consumption responses to tax changes against empirical elasticity estimates from tax policy literature
2. **Policy Transferability Test**: Implement TaxAgent's optimized tax schedule in larger ABM with N=1000+ households and additional real-world constraints
3. **Cross-Model Robustness**: Replace LLM backbone with simpler rule-based agents using empirically-calibrated response functions to isolate source of performance advantage
