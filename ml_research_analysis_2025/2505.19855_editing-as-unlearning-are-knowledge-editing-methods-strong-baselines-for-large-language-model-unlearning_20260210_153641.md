# Editing as Unlearning: Are Knowledge Editing Methods Strong Baselines for Large Language Model Unlearning?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.19855
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19855
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: Knowledge editing methods (particularly WISE and AlphaEdit) outperform specialized unlearning approaches for LLM unlearning tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a conceptual bridge between knowledge editing and unlearning in large language models by framing unlearning as a special case of editing where information is modified to refusal or empty responses. The authors evaluate five state-of-the-art editing methods (ROME, MEMIT, GRACE, WISE, AlphaEdit) against existing unlearning approaches on both pretrained and finetuned knowledge. Their results demonstrate that editing methods, especially WISE and AlphaEdit, serve as strong baselines for unlearning tasks, particularly excelling at generating human-aligned refusal answers. The paper also proposes two practical techniques—a self-improvement pipeline leveraging in-context learning and a query merging technique for handling longer sequences—to better adapt editing methods for unlearning applications.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates five knowledge editing methods (ROME, MEMIT, GRACE, WISE, AlphaEdit) on unlearning tasks by treating unlearning as a special case of editing where target information is modified to refusal or empty responses. The evaluation compares these editing methods against specialized unlearning approaches on both pretrained knowledge and finetuned knowledge scenarios. Two practical techniques are introduced: a self-improvement pipeline that uses the LLM's in-context learning capabilities to craft trustworthy refusal targets, and a query merging technique that enables ROME and MEMIT to handle longer unlearning sequences effectively.

## Key Results
- Editing methods, particularly WISE and AlphaEdit, outperform specialized unlearning approaches on unlearning benchmarks
- Editing methods excel at generating human-aligned refusal answers compared to traditional unlearning methods
- The proposed self-improvement pipeline and query merging techniques improve editing methods' effectiveness for unlearning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper establishes that unlearning can be reframed as a knowledge editing problem where specific information is modified to produce refusal or empty responses. This reframing leverages the mature techniques and optimizations developed in the knowledge editing community. The effectiveness stems from the ability of editing methods to precisely target and modify specific knowledge representations in the model, while specialized unlearning approaches often rely on less precise methods like fine-tuning or data manipulation. By treating unlearning as editing, the methods benefit from the sophisticated attention-based mechanisms and parameter-efficient updates developed for editing tasks.

## Foundational Learning

**Knowledge Editing**: Methods that modify specific information in LLMs without full fine-tuning. *Why needed*: Provides the technical foundation for treating unlearning as a specialized editing task. *Quick check*: Verify understanding of how editing methods identify and modify specific knowledge representations.

**Attention-based Modification**: Techniques that leverage attention mechanisms to precisely target and modify specific information. *Why needed*: Core mechanism enabling precise knowledge modification in editing methods. *Quick check*: Understand how attention weights influence knowledge retrieval and modification.

**In-context Learning**: LLM capability to learn from examples provided within the prompt. *Why needed*: Enables the self-improvement pipeline that generates trustworthy refusal targets. *Quick check*: Verify how in-context learning can be used to generate and refine refusal responses.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Editing methods (ROME/MEMIT/GRACE/WISE/AlphaEdit) -> Target knowledge identification -> Modification operation -> Unlearning verification

**Critical Path**: Knowledge identification → Modification → Verification. The most critical step is accurate knowledge identification, as errors here propagate through the entire unlearning process.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Precision vs. completeness (targeting specific knowledge while ensuring complete removal), efficiency vs. effectiveness (parameter-efficient updates vs. thorough unlearning), and general applicability vs. task-specific optimization.

**Failure Signatures**: Incomplete knowledge removal, collateral damage to related knowledge, generation of inconsistent responses, and failure to generalize across similar queries.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify knowledge identification accuracy by testing on controlled datasets with known facts
2. Test modification effectiveness by measuring response changes before and after editing
3. Evaluate collateral damage by testing performance on related but desired knowledge after unlearning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None specified in the provided materials.

## Limitations

- The conceptual framing of unlearning as editing may oversimplify nuanced unlearning requirements, particularly regarding verifiability of complete knowledge removal
- Evaluation focuses on constrained tasks (five facts per method) that may not represent real-world unlearning complexity
- Does not assess potential negative transfer effects where editing might degrade performance on related desired knowledge
- Proposed techniques lack comprehensive ablation studies to isolate individual contributions

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Empirical finding that editing methods demonstrate competitive or superior performance to specialized unlearning approaches on evaluated benchmarks for pretrained knowledge editing and refusal generation.

**Medium Confidence**: Generalizability of editing methods as strong unlearning baselines across diverse real-world scenarios, given limited scope of evaluated tasks and potential oversimplification of unlearning requirements.

**Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of proposed self-improvement pipeline and query merging techniques, pending more rigorous ablation studies and evaluation on complex unlearning scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Verifiability Assessment**: Conduct empirical tests to distinguish true knowledge removal versus suppression, including membership inference attacks and probing techniques to detect residual information.

2. **Scalability Testing**: Evaluate editing methods on larger-scale unlearning tasks involving multiple interconnected facts and longer sequences to assess performance degradation and scalability limitations.

3. **Negative Transfer Analysis**: Systematically measure impact of editing-based unlearning on related but desired knowledge to quantify potential negative transfer effects and assess precision of knowledge removal.
