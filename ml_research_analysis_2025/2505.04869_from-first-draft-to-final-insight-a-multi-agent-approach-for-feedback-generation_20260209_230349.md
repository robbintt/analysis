# From First Draft to Final Insight: A Multi-Agent Approach for Feedback Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.04869
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04869
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Multi-agent G-E-RG system significantly improves feedback quality metrics across evaluation accuracy, component inclusion, and simplicity

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of generating high-quality, timely feedback at scale for educational settings. It introduces a multi-agent system employing a "generation, evaluation, and regeneration" (G-E-RG) process, combining different feedback frameworks and prompt engineering techniques (zero-shot and RAG_CoT) in the initial generation phase. The system uses LLMs to generate feedback, evaluate its quality against a learner-centered rubric, and regenerate improved feedback iteratively. Results show that G-E-RG significantly improved feedback quality: evaluation accuracy increased by 3.36% to 12.98% (p<0.001), the proportion of feedback containing four effective components rose from 27.72% to 98.49% (p<0.001), and simplicity (word count) was enhanced for three methods (p<0.001). The method effectively reduced instability in LLM-generated feedback and aligned it with learner-centered principles, though some dimensions (e.g., strengthening teacher-student relationships) require further enhancement.

## Method Summary
The study introduces a multi-agent system that implements a generation, evaluation, and regeneration (G-E-RG) process for automated feedback generation. The system first generates feedback using different frameworks (three feedback frameworks and two prompt engineering techniques: zero-shot and RAG_CoT). It then evaluates the generated feedback against a learner-centered rubric using LLM-based assessment, and finally regenerates feedback iteratively to improve quality. The process combines various feedback generation approaches with systematic evaluation and refinement to produce more effective educational feedback that meets specific quality criteria.

## Key Results
- Evaluation accuracy increased by 3.36% to 12.98% (p<0.001) compared to baseline methods
- Proportion of feedback containing four effective components rose from 27.72% to 98.49% (p<0.001)
- Simplicity (word count) was enhanced for three methods (p<0.001), reducing complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-agent G-E-RG approach works by combining diverse feedback generation strategies with iterative refinement through automated evaluation. By using different frameworks and prompt engineering techniques in the generation phase, the system explores multiple solution spaces for feedback creation. The evaluation phase applies consistent rubric-based assessment to identify weaknesses, while regeneration allows targeted improvements. This systematic approach addresses the inherent variability and instability in LLM-generated outputs by establishing quality standards and providing mechanisms for correction. The learner-centered rubric ensures that improvements target educational effectiveness rather than just technical correctness.

## Foundational Learning

**Learner-centered rubric design**: Why needed - provides objective quality standards for automated feedback evaluation; Quick check - verify rubric items align with established educational best practices

**Prompt engineering techniques**: Why needed - different techniques elicit varied response qualities and perspectives from LLMs; Quick check - test multiple prompt variations to identify optimal formulations

**Automated feedback evaluation**: Why needed - enables scalable quality assessment without human raters; Quick check - validate automated scores against expert human judgments on sample data

**Multi-agent coordination**: Why needed - separates concerns between generation, evaluation, and refinement tasks; Quick check - monitor agent communication latency and decision accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Generation Agent (Zero-shot/RAG_CoT) -> Evaluation Agent (Rubric-based) -> Regeneration Agent (Iterative refinement)

**Critical path**: Input prompt → Generation framework selection → Feedback generation → Rubric evaluation → Quality assessment → Conditional regeneration loop → Final output

**Design tradeoffs**: Computational cost vs. quality improvement (iterative regeneration increases inference time but improves metrics), rubric complexity vs. evaluation reliability, framework diversity vs. system coherence

**Failure signatures**: Low evaluation scores persisting across regeneration cycles, agent coordination delays causing timeouts, rubric misalignment leading to irrelevant feedback modifications

**3 first experiments**: 1) Benchmark baseline generation methods against G-E-RG outputs on component inclusion metrics, 2) Stress-test regeneration limits by measuring quality gains across 1-5 iteration cycles, 3) Cross-validate automated evaluation scores with blinded human expert ratings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on automated metrics and LLM-based assessment rather than human expert judgment, creating uncertainty about real-world educational value
- Study focuses on specific feedback frameworks and a single rubric design, limiting generalizability to other educational contexts
- Iterative regeneration process may increase computational costs and inference time, potentially impacting scalability in resource-constrained settings

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The G-E-RG process significantly improves feedback quality metrics (evaluation accuracy, component inclusion, simplicity) as measured by the study's automated evaluation system
**Medium confidence**: The method reduces instability in LLM-generated feedback and aligns outputs with learner-centered principles, though this depends on the rubric design
**Low confidence**: Claims about educational effectiveness and practical utility in real classroom settings, as these weren't validated with human learners or educators

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies with educators and students to validate whether the improved feedback quality translates to perceived educational value and actionable guidance
2. Test the G-E-RG approach across diverse educational domains and subject areas to assess generalizability beyond the initial frameworks used
3. Perform cost-benefit analysis comparing computational overhead of iterative regeneration against quality gains, including real-time inference benchmarks for classroom deployment
