# JSPLIT: A Taxonomy-based Solution for Prompt Bloating in Model Context Protocol

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.14537
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14537
- Reference count: 40
- JSPLIT reduces token usage by over two orders of magnitude while maintaining or improving tool selection accuracy in MCP systems

## Executive Summary
JSPLIT addresses the challenge of prompt bloating in Model Context Protocol (MCP) systems, where large numbers of tools lead to excessive token costs and declining accuracy. The approach organizes MCP tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and uses query-driven classification to selectively include only relevant tools in prompts. This strategy significantly reduces input token costs while maintaining or improving tool selection accuracy. The method is particularly effective as the number of tools scales, achieving substantial accuracy gains over baseline approaches.

## Method Summary
JSPLIT introduces a taxonomy-based solution to mitigate prompt bloating in AI agents using large numbers of MCP tools. The system organizes tools hierarchically and employs query-driven classification to determine which tools are relevant to a given prompt. By selectively including only pertinent tools, JSPLIT reduces token usage and improves tool selection accuracy. The approach is validated through experiments demonstrating significant reductions in input token costs and improved accuracy, particularly as tool counts increase.

## Key Results
- Input token costs reduced by over two orders of magnitude compared to unfiltered baselines
- Tool selection accuracy improved, especially with larger tool sets (69% accuracy vs. less than 40% for baseline methods with hundreds of tools)
- Maintained or improved task accuracy while achieving significant cost savings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
JSPLIT leverages a hierarchical taxonomy to organize MCP tools, enabling query-driven classification that identifies only relevant tools for each prompt. This selective inclusion reduces the number of tokens sent to the model, addressing the computational burden and accuracy degradation associated with prompt bloating. By focusing on relevant tools, the system maintains or improves accuracy while significantly reducing costs, particularly as the number of tools scales.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hierarchical taxonomy**: Organizing tools in a tree structure allows for efficient categorization and retrieval; quick check: ensure the taxonomy reflects real-world tool relationships.
- **Query-driven classification**: Dynamically selecting tools based on prompt content reduces irrelevant tool inclusion; quick check: validate classification accuracy across diverse queries.
- **Token cost optimization**: Minimizing prompt size lowers computational costs and improves response times; quick check: measure token usage before and after JSPLIT implementation.
- **Scalability in tool management**: Efficient handling of large tool sets is critical for practical MCP deployment; quick check: test performance with incrementally larger tool inventories.
- **Accuracy preservation**: Maintaining or improving tool selection accuracy is essential for system reliability; quick check: compare accuracy metrics with and without taxonomy-based pruning.
- **MCP system architecture**: Understanding the context in which JSPLIT operates helps in integration and optimization; quick check: map JSPLIT components to existing MCP workflows.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User Query -> Taxonomy Classifier -> Relevant Tool Subset -> Prompt Generator -> AI Agent
- **Critical path**: Query classification and tool subset selection are the most time-sensitive components; optimize for low latency.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balancing taxonomy granularity (fine vs. coarse) affects both classification accuracy and computational overhead; overly fine taxonomies may increase maintenance burden.
- **Failure signatures**: Misclassification in the taxonomy can lead to missing relevant tools or including irrelevant ones, degrading accuracy; monitor classification precision and recall.
- **First experiment 1**: Benchmark token usage and accuracy with a small set of MCP tools (10-20) to establish baseline performance.
- **First experiment 2**: Gradually scale the tool set (50, 100, 200 tools) and measure accuracy and token cost improvements with JSPLIT.
- **First experiment 3**: Test JSPLIT with queries requiring cross-domain tool combinations to assess taxonomy coverage and classification robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Taxonomy construction and maintenance processes are not fully detailed, potentially limiting scalability and generalizability.
- Performance gains are primarily demonstrated in controlled experiments; real-world MCP deployments may introduce additional complexity.
- The impact of taxonomy structure and granularity on tool selection accuracy is not fully explored.
- Potential latency and computational overhead introduced by the classification step are not addressed.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Reported reduction in token costs and general effectiveness of taxonomy-based pruning in controlled experiments.
- **Medium confidence**: Scalability claims, as real-world MCP environments may present challenges not reflected in the experimental setup.
- **Low confidence**: Robustness of JSPLIT to varying taxonomy structures and potential for degraded performance if the taxonomy is not optimally constructed.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a longitudinal study to assess the impact of taxonomy maintenance overhead and the cost of updating the taxonomy as MCP tools evolve over time.
2. Evaluate JSPLIT in a real-world MCP deployment with dynamic, heterogeneous tool sets to measure practical performance, including latency and accuracy trade-offs.
3. Systematically test the sensitivity of JSPLIT's accuracy to variations in taxonomy granularity and structure, identifying thresholds where performance degrades.
