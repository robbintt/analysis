core_contribution: This paper introduces BuildEvo, a framework that uses large language
  models (LLMs) within an evolutionary algorithm to automatically design interpretable
  and accurate heuristics for building energy consumption forecasting. Traditional
  heuristics are often imprecise and struggle with generalization, while deep learning

# BuildEvo: Designing Building Energy Consumption Forecasting Heuristics via LLM-driven Evolution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.12207
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12207
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: LLM-driven evolutionary algorithm automatically designs interpretable and accurate heuristics for building energy consumption forecasting

## Executive Summary
BuildEvo is a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) within an evolutionary algorithm to automatically design interpretable heuristics for building energy consumption forecasting. Traditional heuristics often lack precision and generalizability, while deep learning models sacrifice transparency for accuracy. BuildEvo integrates physical building insights—such as weather, occupancy, and building type—into the evolutionary process, guiding LLMs to construct and refine forecasting heuristics. Evaluated on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset, BuildEvo achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy with high interpretability, bridging the gap between model accuracy and transparency.

## Method Summary
BuildEvo uses an evolutionary algorithm where LLMs generate and optimize candidate heuristics for building energy consumption forecasting. The process iteratively evolves heuristics by incorporating domain knowledge about physical building factors. LLMs guide the search by proposing modifications and refinements, ensuring that generated heuristics remain interpretable and grounded in building science. The framework balances forecasting accuracy with transparency, producing heuristics that are both effective and understandable to domain experts.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset.
- Generates highly interpretable heuristics by integrating physical building insights.
- Successfully bridges the trade-off between model accuracy and transparency in energy forecasting.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BuildEvo works by embedding domain-specific knowledge (e.g., weather, occupancy, building type) into the evolutionary process, allowing LLMs to generate heuristics that are both accurate and interpretable. The evolutionary framework ensures continuous improvement and refinement of heuristics, while the LLM provides the flexibility to explore a wide space of candidate solutions. This approach leverages the strengths of both evolutionary algorithms (global search, diversity) and LLMs (creativity, adaptability), resulting in heuristics that are both performant and explainable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Global optimization technique that iteratively improves solutions through selection, mutation, and crossover; needed for exploring the heuristic space efficiently.
- **LLM Prompt Engineering**: Crafting inputs to guide LLM behavior; needed to direct heuristic generation toward domain-relevant solutions.
- **Interpretability in Forecasting**: Making model decisions understandable; needed to ensure heuristics are actionable for building managers.
- **Building Energy Dynamics**: Understanding how factors like weather and occupancy affect consumption; needed to ground heuristics in physical reality.
- **Heuristic Design**: Creating simple, rule-based models; needed as the target form of the forecasting solution.
- **Dataset Diversity**: Importance of testing on multiple, diverse datasets; needed to ensure generalizability of the approach.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Input -> Feature Extraction -> LLM-driven Heuristic Generation -> Evolutionary Refinement -> Interpretability Validation -> Forecasting Output

**Critical Path**: Data Input → Feature Extraction → LLM-driven Heuristic Generation → Evolutionary Refinement → Forecasting Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs. interpretability, computational cost vs. heuristic complexity, and LLM generalization vs. domain specificity.

**Failure Signatures**: Overfitting to single datasets, poor generalization across climates, excessive computational overhead, and heuristics that lack actionable insights for domain experts.

**First Experiments**:
1. Run BuildEvo on a single building dataset with known characteristics to validate baseline performance.
2. Test heuristic interpretability by having domain experts evaluate generated rules for clarity and practicality.
3. Evaluate computational cost and scalability by increasing dataset size and diversity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to a single dataset, raising questions about generalizability.
- Computational overhead of using LLMs in the evolutionary process is not fully characterized.
- Interpretability claims require more rigorous human evaluation to confirm practical utility.

| Novelty and technical soundness of LLM-guided evolutionary design | High |
| Robustness and practical deployment readiness | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments on multiple, geographically and climatically diverse building energy datasets to test generalizability and robustness.
2. Conduct a formal human factors study with building energy experts to validate the interpretability and practical utility of the generated heuristics.
3. Perform a comprehensive computational cost analysis, including wall-clock time and resource usage, to assess scalability and real-world applicability.
