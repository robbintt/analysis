# Deep Depth Estimation from Thermal Image: Dataset, Benchmark, and Challenges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.22060
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22060
- Authors: Ukcheol Shin; Jinsun Park
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces MS² dataset with multi-spectral data and benchmarks depth estimation, finding thermal images most robust under adverse conditions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive study on deep depth estimation using thermal imaging, introducing a novel Multi-Spectral Stereo (MS²) dataset and conducting extensive benchmarking across different modalities. The research demonstrates that thermal images provide superior depth estimation performance under challenging lighting and weather conditions compared to RGB and NIR modalities. The dataset includes stereo RGB, NIR, thermal images, LiDAR, and GNSS/IMU data collected across diverse urban environments and weather conditions. The benchmark results establish thermal imaging as a promising approach for robust 3D perception in autonomous navigation systems.

## Method Summary
The research introduces the MS² dataset containing synchronized multi-spectral data captured from urban environments under various weather and lighting conditions. The dataset includes stereo RGB, NIR, and thermal images alongside LiDAR point clouds and GNSS/IMU data. A comprehensive benchmark was conducted using both monocular and stereo depth estimation approaches across all modalities. The thermal camera specifications and data collection methodology were designed to capture reliable depth information across challenging conditions. The evaluation framework compares depth estimation accuracy across different environmental scenarios to identify the most robust modality for adverse conditions.

## Key Results
- Thermal images demonstrate the most robust depth estimation performance under adverse lighting and weather conditions
- The MS² dataset provides diverse urban scenes across multiple weather conditions with synchronized multi-spectral data
- Monocular and stereo approaches show varying performance across RGB, NIR, and thermal modalities
- Thermal imaging proves particularly effective for depth estimation in low-light and challenging environmental conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Thermal imaging captures temperature variations rather than visible light, making it inherently robust to lighting changes and capable of penetrating certain weather conditions like light fog or rain. The temperature-based contrast provides consistent depth cues regardless of ambient illumination, addressing the fundamental limitations of RGB-based depth estimation in low-light scenarios. This temperature-based sensing mechanism enables reliable depth estimation when traditional visual sensors fail, particularly in nighttime or challenging weather conditions where visible light-based approaches struggle with contrast and illumination consistency.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Multi-spectral sensing principles** - Understanding how different electromagnetic spectrum ranges interact with materials and environments; needed for selecting appropriate sensors for specific conditions; quick check: compare spectral responses of RGB vs thermal sensors

2. **Depth estimation algorithms** - Familiarity with both monocular and stereo depth estimation techniques; needed for proper benchmark design and interpretation; quick check: review epipolar geometry and disparity mapping fundamentals

3. **Sensor synchronization and calibration** - Knowledge of multi-sensor data alignment and calibration procedures; needed for creating reliable multi-modal datasets; quick check: verify temporal and spatial alignment of different sensor streams

4. **Weather and lighting impact on perception** - Understanding how environmental conditions affect different sensing modalities; needed for interpreting benchmark results across conditions; quick check: analyze sensor performance degradation curves under varying conditions

5. **Thermal imaging physics** - Knowledge of infrared radiation principles and thermal contrast mechanisms; needed for understanding thermal depth estimation advantages; quick check: study blackbody radiation and emissivity effects

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Thermal Camera -> Image Preprocessing -> Depth Network -> Post-processing -> Depth Map
                          ↘ LiDAR Calibration ↗
                          ↘ GNSS/IMU Synchronization ↗

**Critical Path:** Raw thermal images → Calibration → Neural network inference → Depth map generation → Evaluation metrics

**Design Tradeoffs:** Higher thermal resolution provides better depth accuracy but increases computational requirements; wider temperature range capture improves robustness but may require more sophisticated calibration; multi-modal fusion can improve accuracy but adds complexity and synchronization overhead.

**Failure Signatures:** Thermal depth estimation may fail in extreme temperature uniformity (no thermal contrast), rapid temperature changes causing sensor noise, or when objects have similar temperatures to background. RGB-based methods fail primarily in low-light conditions or high dynamic range scenes.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test thermal depth estimation on controlled temperature gradient scenes to verify basic functionality; 2) Compare thermal vs RGB depth accuracy across different lighting conditions using synthetic data; 3) Evaluate thermal depth estimation performance in light fog or rain conditions compared to RGB.
