# Can Competition Enhance the Proficiency of Agents Powered by Large Language Models in the Realm of News-driven Time Series Forecasting?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.10210
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10210
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** A competition mechanism embedded in a multi-agent framework significantly improves news-driven time series forecasting accuracy, with average improvements of 31.03% MAE, 36.31% MSE, 2.48% RMSE, and 18.14% MAPE.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether competition can enhance the innovative thinking and error detection capabilities of agents powered by large language models (LLMs) in news-driven time series forecasting. The authors propose a competition mechanism embedded within a multi-agent discussion framework, integrating information asymmetry, competitive awareness, and a survival-of-the-fittest component to stimulate novel thinking. A multi-stage reflection process, incorporating a fine-tuned small-scale LLM, is designed to improve agents' ability to identify misleading information. Experimental results demonstrate that the competition mechanism significantly improves prediction accuracy across multiple datasets compared to baseline models.

## Method Summary
The method employs a multi-agent competitive framework where 10 LLM agents (LLM_L = GPT-4o for logic/reasoning, LLMS = Llama 2 7B fine-tuned with LoRa for forecasting) iteratively select news, predict time series values, and compete over 3 epochs of 5 rounds each. A Multi-Indicator Evaluation (MIE) computes rank, gap to top, and gap to average for each agent, triggering Survival of the Fittest (SF) elimination (α=0.7 retention) every 5 rounds. Information Asymmetry (IA) enables selective or misleading logic disclosure, while Opponent-Oriented Self-Reflection (OOSR) with Multi-Stage Reflection (MSR) uses a small fine-tuned LLM to filter "bad" logic updates. Final predictions are aggregated via cumulative-score-weighted averaging.

## Key Results
- Competition mechanism significantly improves prediction accuracy across all datasets
- Average improvements of 31.03% MAE, 36.31% MSE, 2.48% RMSE, and 18.14% MAPE
- Agents exhibit more diverse and innovative logic under competitive conditions
- U-shaped relationship exists between competitive intensity and model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Information Asymmetry for Cognitive Diversity
Strategic withholding or fabrication of reasoning logic by agents maintains cognitive diversity and prevents premature consensus. Agents selectively disclose partial, authentic, or deliberately misleading logic to competitors, forcing each agent to independently evaluate validity rather than passively adopting claims, countering the Degeneration-of-Thought problem.

### Mechanism 2: Quantified Competition Feedback Loops
Providing agents with comparative performance metrics (rank, gap to top performer, gap to average) increases their motivation to revise strategies. The Multi-Indicator Evaluation component computes three signals that agents interpret as competitive pressure, stimulating strategic innovation.

### Mechanism 3: Quantitative Validation of Logic Updates via Small-Model Critics
A fine-tuned small LLM serves as a discriminative critic to filter "bad" logic updates. The Multi-Stage Reflection extracts logic deltas and evaluates each by measuring MAPE change on held-out samples, providing quantitative signals to override LLM self-reflection prone to confidence miscalibration.

## Foundational Learning

- **Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) in Multi-Agent Systems**: Why needed: The paper explicitly frames its contribution as solving DoT—where collaborative discussions converge prematurely on confident-but-wrong reasoning. Quick check: Can you explain why standard debate-style multi-agent frameworks tend to reduce rather than increase reasoning diversity over successive rounds?

- **News-Driven Time Series Forecasting as Token Prediction**: Why needed: The task formulation treats forecasting as next-token prediction conditioned on news-text context, not purely numerical extrapolation. Quick check: How does the news-filtering logic differ from feature engineering in traditional time series models?

- **U-Shaped Competition-Performance Curve (Social Science)**: Why needed: The paper reports a U-shaped relationship between competitive intensity and performance, citing social science literature. Quick check: At what competitive intensity (low, moderate, high) would you expect the best prediction accuracy, and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: News Filtering Stage -> Time Series Forecasting Stage -> Agent Performance Evaluation (MIE) -> Discussion & Reflection Stage -> Survival of the Fittest Elimination

- **Critical path**: Training: Initialize 10 agents → Run 5 competition rounds per epoch → Trigger SF elimination → Aggregate top performers' predictions → Repeat for 3 epochs. Inference: Use final aggregated prediction from surviving agents, weighted by cumulative score M_i.

- **Design tradeoffs**: More agents vs. computational cost (10 used due to 4× A800 GPUs); Higher α vs. selection pressure (α=0.7 optimal); Competition intensity CI=0.6 balanced innovation and stability.

- **Failure signatures**: Logic similarity not decreasing across epochs → IA not triggering diverse strategies; MAPE spiking after SF elimination → Over-pruning removed useful agents; High variance in Logic Update Degree → Inconsistent prompt interpretation.

- **First 3 experiments**: (1) Ablation of IA: Run with and without Information Asymmetry; measure logic similarity and MAPE. (2) Vary CI coefficient: Test CI ∈ {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8} on Electricity dataset; plot MAPE vs. CI. (3) Replace MSR with standard reflection: Compare MSR vs. 1-stage reflection; measure wrong-logic propagation rate.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the controllability of the competitive mechanism be enhanced through theoretical exploration, specifically by integrating distillation or chain-of-thought fine-tuning? The current study validates the effectiveness of the competition framework empirically but lacks a theoretical grounding for controlling the innovation process.

### Open Question 2
Does the explicit integration of mathematical time-series concepts (e.g., co-integration testing, stationarity analysis) into agent reasoning improve the accuracy of news-fluctuation correlation? The authors note the lack of mathematical knowledge integration as a limitation.

### Open Question 3
What specific optimizations are necessary to reduce the computational resources and operational latency of the multi-agent competitive framework for real-world application? The multi-agent competitive model demands high computational resources and long computation times.

## Limitations
- Mechanism validity without ablation studies isolating IA, OOSR, and MSR contributions
- Generalizability beyond four tested datasets to higher-dimensional or longer-horizon forecasting
- Hyperparameter sensitivity with optimal settings potentially dataset-specific

## Confidence

- **High**: Experimental results show consistent MAPE/MSE/MAE/RMSE improvements over baselines across all four datasets
- **Medium**: Theoretical framing of competition stimulating innovative thinking aligns with social science literature, but LLM-specific validation is limited
- **Low**: Claims about small-model critic effectiveness lack ablation against standard reflection baselines

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study**: Compare full model against variants without IA, OOSR, and MSR to isolate each mechanism's contribution
2. **Cross-domain transfer**: Test on non-financial/time-series domains (e.g., weather, sensor networks) to assess generalizability
3. **Competitive intensity sweep**: Systematically vary CI across [0.2, 0.8] on additional datasets to verify U-shaped relationship
