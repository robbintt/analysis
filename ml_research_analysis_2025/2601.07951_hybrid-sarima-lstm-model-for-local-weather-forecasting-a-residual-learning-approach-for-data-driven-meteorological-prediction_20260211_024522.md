# Hybrid SARIMA LSTM Model for Local Weather Forecasting: A Residual Learning Approach for Data Driven Meteorological Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.07951
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07951
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM achieves MAE of 2.41°C and RMSE of 3.33°C for 293-day NYC temperature forecasts, outperforming standalone models.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a hybrid SARIMA-LSTM model for long-term local weather forecasting that decomposes temperature prediction into a predictable seasonal climate component and a nonlinear residual component. By combining SARIMA's statistical strength in modeling seasonal trends with LSTM's ability to capture nonlinear weather variations, the model improves forecasting accuracy and stability. Fourier seasonal encoding and a stabilized recursive forecasting mechanism with decay factors are introduced to enhance performance. Evaluated on New York City temperature data, the hybrid model achieves an MAE of 2.41°C and RMSE of 3.33°C over a 293-day horizon, outperforming both standalone SARIMA and LSTM models, which diverge or underfit nonlinear changes.

## Method Summary
The hybrid model combines SARIMA for seasonal baseline forecasting with LSTM for residual correction. SARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1,12) is fitted to temperature data with Fourier seasonal encoding to capture annual cycles. Residuals (actual minus SARIMA predictions) are extracted and used to train a two-layer LSTM (64→32 units) that learns nonlinear deviations. During recursive forecasting, SARIMA provides the baseline while LSTM corrections are applied with a decay factor (0.92 from day 6 onward) to prevent error accumulation. The approach leverages residual learning decomposition, Fourier encoding for explicit seasonality, and decay-stabilized recursive forecasting to achieve superior long-horizon performance.

## Key Results
- Hybrid model achieves MAE of 2.41°C and RMSE of 3.33°C for 293-day NYC temperature forecasts
- Standalone LSTM diverges after ~80-100 days (MAE 8.01°C, RMSE 9.32°C), while SARIMA over-smooths short-term variations
- Hybrid outperforms both standalone models by combining stable seasonal baseline with adaptive residual corrections
- Decay-stabilized recursive forecasting prevents error accumulation while retaining short-term nonlinear adaptability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Residual Learning Decomposition
Decomposing temperature into a linear seasonal component and nonlinear residuals allows each sub-model to specialize, reducing learning burden and improving long-horizon stability. SARIMA captures the deterministic annual cycle via seasonal autoregression, while LSTM is trained exclusively on SARIMA's prediction errors (residuals), learning only the nonlinear deviations. At inference, final prediction = SARIMA forecast + LSTM residual correction.

### Mechanism 2: Fourier Seasonal Encoding
Explicit sinusoidal encoding of the annual cycle improves both SARIMA stability and LSTM temporal awareness without requiring long lag structures. Two Fourier terms (sine and cosine) derived from day-of-year encode Earth's orbital periodicity, giving SARIMA a clear seasonal reference and providing LSTM with continuous temporal position.

### Mechanism 3: Decay-Stabilized Recursive Forecasting
A decay factor applied to LSTM residual corrections in recursive forecasting prevents error accumulation while retaining short-term nonlinear adaptability. For the first 5 days, LSTM corrections are applied fully, but from day 6 onward, each residual prediction is multiplied by 0.92^n (where n increases with horizon).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: SARIMA** - Why needed: Provides stable, interpretable baseline for long-term seasonal temperature trends, anchoring the hybrid model's climate component. Quick check: Can you explain why SARIMA requires stationarity and how differencing (d and D parameters) addresses non-stationarity in seasonal time series?
- **Concept: LSTM Networks** - Why needed: Captures nonlinear, multivariate temporal dependencies in weather data that linear models cannot, particularly short-term atmospheric anomalies. Quick check: Describe how LSTM's forget, input, and output gates regulate information flow over long sequences, and why this matters for recursive multi-step forecasting.
- **Concept: Recursive Forecasting and Error Accumulation** - Why needed: The hybrid model forecasts 293 days by feeding predictions back as inputs; understanding error propagation is critical to appreciating why stabilization mechanisms are necessary. Quick check: In recursive multi-step forecasting, what happens when small prediction errors are repeatedly fed back into the model as inputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data preprocessing -> SARIMA module -> Residual generator -> LSTM module -> Forecast combiner
- **Critical path**: 1) Fit SARIMA on training temperature data → generate in-sample predictions 2) Compute residuals (actual - SARIMA prediction) → train LSTM on residual sequences 3) At inference: SARIMA forecasts recursively; LSTM predicts residuals; combine with decay weighting from day 6 onward
- **Design tradeoffs**: Simpler SARIMA seasonal lag (12 instead of 365) enabled by Fourier encoding vs. potential loss of fine-grained seasonal detail; aggressive decay (0.92) stabilizes long-term forecasts but may suppress valid mid-range nonlinear corrections; 14-day input window balances computational cost with sufficient context
- **Failure signatures**: Standalone LSTM diverges exponentially after ~80–100 days (MAE 8.01°C, RMSE 9.32°C); standalone SARIMA over-smooths, missing short-term spikes and dips; hybrid without decay would inherit LSTM's divergence tendency
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate SARIMA-only and LSTM-only baselines on the same NYC temperature split to confirm divergence and smoothing behaviors reported (MAE/RMSE benchmarks) 2) Ablate the decay factor: test hybrid with no decay, earlier decay onset (day 3), and different decay rates (0.90, 0.95) to quantify stabilization contribution 3) Replace Fourier encoding with alternative seasonal representations (e.g., learned embeddings, day-of-year one-hot) to assess encoding robustness and sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How sensitive is the model's long-term stability and accuracy to the specific choice of the decay factor (0.92) and the activation threshold (day 5) used in the recursive forecasting mechanism? The paper introduces a "stabilized recursive forecasting mechanism" where a decay factor of 0.92 is applied after the first five days to prevent divergence, but provides no ablation study or sensitivity analysis for these specific hyperparameters. An ablation study showing the impact of varying decay rates (e.g., 0.90–0.98) and activation windows on the RMSE and divergence rates over the 293-day horizon would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Can this hybrid residual-learning architecture maintain its performance advantages in tropical or polar climates where the SARIMA-defined "seasonal component" is less distinct or exhibits different periodicities than the temperate NYC data? The study validates the model exclusively on New York City data, which is characterized by strong, predictable seasonal cycles that favor the SARIMA component. Evaluation of the model on datasets from equatorial regions (low seasonality) or continental interiors (high volatility) to test the robustness of the decomposition strategy would address this.

### Open Question 3
Is the residual-learning strategy effective for non-Gaussian meteorological variables like precipitation or wind speed, which often exhibit discontinuous distributions unlike the continuous temperature data used here? The paper focuses solely on daily average temperature, a continuous variable, while acknowledging that the dataset includes other features like wind and pressure. Applying the same hybrid architecture to forecast rainfall or wind speed and comparing the relative improvement of the hybrid model over the standalone baselines would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Model validated exclusively on New York City data with strong seasonal cycles, limiting generalizability to tropical or polar climates
- No ablation study for critical hyperparameters (decay factor, activation threshold, Fourier encoding alternatives)
- Performance claims based on single dataset without comparison to modern deep learning baselines (Transformers, attention-based models)

## Confidence
- **High**: Decomposition approach (SARIMA + LSTM residuals) improves accuracy over standalone models
- **Medium**: Fourier seasonal encoding and decay-stabilized recursive forecasting meaningfully enhance performance
- **Low**: Claims about model robustness to climate regime shifts or extreme events

## Next Checks
1. Replicate SARIMA-only and LSTM-only baselines on the same NYC temperature split to confirm divergence and smoothing behaviors reported (MAE/RMSE benchmarks)
2. Ablate the decay factor: test hybrid with no decay, earlier decay onset (day 3), and different decay rates (0.90, 0.95) to quantify stabilization contribution
3. Replace Fourier encoding with alternative seasonal representations (e.g., learned embeddings, day-of-year one-hot) to assess encoding robustness and sensitivity
