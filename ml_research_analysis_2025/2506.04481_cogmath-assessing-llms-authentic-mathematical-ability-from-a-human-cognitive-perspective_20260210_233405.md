# CogMath: Assessing LLMs' Authentic Mathematical Ability from a Human Cognitive Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.04481
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04481
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: CogMath reveals that LLMs' authentic mathematical capabilities are overestimated by 30%-40%, with performance drops most pronounced in knowledge application and backward reasoning tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CogMath, a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses large language models' (LLMs) mathematical abilities by modeling human cognitive reasoning stages. The framework decomposes problem solving into three stages—problem comprehension, problem solving, and solution summarization—and further divides these into nine fine-grained dimensions covering computation, knowledge, and counterfactual reasoning. When applied to mainstream benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH) and a newly collected dataset (MExam), CogMath reveals that LLMs' authentic mathematical capabilities are overestimated by 30%-40%, with performance drops most pronounced in knowledge application and backward reasoning tasks. The evaluation also shows that prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning do not fundamentally enhance mathematical reasoning abilities.

## Method Summary
CogMath uses a multi-agent system (Inquiry-Judge-Reference) implemented with GPT-4 to generate and validate nine cognitive dimension inquiries for each mathematical problem. For each dimension, the Inquiry agent generates a modified version of the problem, the Judge validates the modification quality (up to 10 iterations), and the Reference agent provides ground truth answers. The target LLM is then evaluated on all nine dimensions, with "true mastery" requiring passing all dimensions. The framework measures both absolute pass rates and Relative Pass Rate (RPR), which compares dimension-specific performance to overall performance. The nine dimensions test paraphrasing, missing conditions, sentence disruption, computational complexity, step reduction, redundancy removal, knowledge redefinition, counterfactual conditions, and backward reasoning.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 successfully passes only 39.3% of MATH problems and 67.1% of GSM8K problems when evaluated across all nine dimensions
- LLMs' authentic mathematical capabilities are overestimated by 30%-40% compared to traditional accuracy metrics
- Performance drops are most pronounced in knowledge application (Dimension 7) and backward reasoning (Dimension 9) tasks
- Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning do not fundamentally enhance mathematical reasoning abilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decomposing mathematical reasoning into cognitive stages reveals hidden capability gaps that single-metric accuracy obscures.
- Mechanism: The framework partitions problem-solving into three stages (comprehension, solving, summarization), each with orthogonal dimensions. By requiring passage across all nine dimensions, the evaluation exposes whether correct final answers derive from genuine reasoning or superficial pattern completion.
- Core assumption: Human cognitive models provide a valid decomposition for assessing LLM reasoning authenticity.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "CogMath reveals that LLMs' authentic mathematical capabilities are overestimated by 30%-40%, with performance drops most pronounced in knowledge application and backward reasoning tasks."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Counterfactual inquiries (missing conditions, disrupted sentences) expose memorization vs. reasoning by testing whether models detect unsolvability.
- Mechanism: Dimensions 2 and 3 construct deliberately unsolvable problems. If an LLM produces the original correct answer despite missing/ scrambled information, this indicates pattern-matching on surface features rather than genuine comprehension. The "over-correction" behavior—automatically aligning invalid inputs toward training distribution patterns—reveals this failure mode.
- Core assumption: A model that genuinely understands a problem will recognize when conditions are insufficient or incoherent.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.4] "GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Gemini-1.5, and DeepSeek-V2.5 underperform in Dimensions 2 and 3... current LLMs may inherently 'over-correct' the problem into a solvable one."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Knowledge redefinition probes (Dimension 7) reveal whether models apply knowledge flexibly or rely on rigid memorized formulas.
- Mechanism: The inquiry modifies a mathematical definition within the problem (e.g., redefining triangle area formula). A model with flexible knowledge representation should adapt its solution to the new definition. Persistent use of standard formulas despite explicit redefinition indicates knowledge as rote association rather than composable abstraction.
- Core assumption: Flexible knowledge application requires representing concepts as manipulable structures, not just input-output mappings.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.4] "Dimension 7 accounts for the low pass rate discussed in Section 4.3... current LLMs treat knowledge more as rigid memorization and application, rather than integrating it organically and flexibly."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Multi-agent orchestration with judge-validated generation**
  - Why needed here: The Inquiry-Judge-Reference architecture requires understanding iterative quality control loops where one agent generates, another validates, and iteration continues until quality thresholds are met.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the Judge agent's approval is necessary rather than trusting the Inquiry agent's first output?

- Concept: **Counterfactual reasoning as diagnostic probe**
  - Why needed here: Dimensions 2, 3, and 7 rely on constructing impossible or modified scenarios to distinguish reasoning from retrieval.
  - Quick check question: Why does producing the correct answer on an unsolvable problem indicate a failure rather than success?

- Concept: **Relative Pass Rate (RPR) metric design**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses RPR = |Pass_i ∩ Pass| / |Pass| to measure consistency between dimension-specific and overall performance, which differs from absolute accuracy.
  - Quick check question: Why is a higher RPR more informative than raw accuracy for diagnosing specific capability gaps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Inquiry Agent (GPT-4) -> Judge Agent (GPT-4) -> Reference Agent (GPT-4) -> Target LLM
  - 9 Dimension Handlers: Each implements transformation logic (paraphrasing, disruption, condition modification, etc.)
  - Evaluation Engine: Compares LLM responses against Reference answers; computes Pass Rate and RPR

- Critical path:
  1. Load problem P with known answer
  2. For each dimension i: Inquiry agent generates qᵢ → Judge validates → (regenerate if failed) → Reference generates aᵢ
  3. Present qᵢ to target LLM, collect response
  4. Compare response to aᵢ; record pass/fail
  5. Aggregate: model "truly masters" problem only if passes all 9 dimensions
  6. Compute stage-level and dimension-level RPR statistics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Compute cost vs. coverage: Multi-agent system with up to 10 regeneration iterations per dimension is expensive; paper uses GPT-4 for all agents
  - Automated vs. human validation: Human verification (Table 4) shows 95%+ judge accuracy, but full automation risks cascading errors
  - Dimension granularity: 9 dimensions provide diagnostic resolution but may miss other failure modes; extensible framework but not exhaustive

- Failure signatures:
  - Over-correction: Model produces original answer for disrupted/missing condition problems (Dimensions 2-3)
  - Rigid knowledge: Model ignores redefined formulas and applies standard ones (Dimension 7)
  - Forward-only reasoning: Model cannot reverse-engineer conditions from solutions (Dimension 9)
  - Stage-specific weakness: Weaker models fail Stage 1 (comprehension); stronger models fail Stage 2 (solving, especially knowledge application)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate single-dimension pilot: Select 50 problems from GSM8K test set; implement Dimension 2 (Sentence Disruption) only; verify that target LLM's pass rate drops relative to vanilla accuracy.
  2. Agent quality baseline: Before full evaluation, run Inquiry-Judge loop on 100 problems for one dimension; measure iteration count distribution and human-verified quality rate.
  3. Stage-localization diagnostic: Run full CogMath on 200 problems for two models of differing capability (e.g., GPT-4 and Llama3-8B); verify that weaker model shows Stage 1 deficit while stronger model shows Stage 2 deficit.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can techniques like Program of Thoughts (PoT) or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fundamentally enhance LLM mathematical reasoning capabilities, unlike CoT and ICL?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Investigating whether these techniques can fundamentally enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs remains an important direction for future research."
- Why unresolved: The study explicitly limited its scope to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL), finding they failed to improve authentic ability. It is unknown if external tools (PoT) or knowledge retrieval (RAG) would suffer the same limitation or genuinely improve mastery of the 9 cognitive dimensions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the CogMath framework to evaluate models equipped with PoT and RAG to determine if they achieve higher Relative Pass Rates in the "Problem Solving" stage compared to vanilla or CoT-prompted models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the theoretical mechanisms that cause prompting techniques like CoT and ICL to yield inconsistent results (performance drops on hard datasets but gains on simple ones)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We believe that understanding the underlying mechanisms of these methods [CoT and ICL] from a theoretical perspective remains a critical research question."
- Why unresolved: The authors empirically observed that these methods serve as auxiliary tools rather than fundamental capability enhancers, but they did not provide a theoretical explanation for why these techniques fail on complex tasks (MATH) while succeeding on simpler ones (GSM8K).
- What evidence would resolve it: A mechanistic interpretability study or theoretical analysis that maps how CoT alters internal reasoning states, specifically distinguishing why it aids simple arithmetic but fails to stabilize "Knowledge Redefinition" or "Backward Reasoning" dimensions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the multi-agent "Inquiry-Judge-Reference" architecture be optimized to reduce computational costs and improve scalability for large benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "CogMath relies heavily on interactions among multiple LLM agents, which may limit the scalability due to the computational costs..."
- Why unresolved: The current framework requires multiple high-cost API calls to GPT-4 to generate and validate inquiries for every single problem across 9 dimensions, creating a bottleneck for widespread adoption.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a distilled or rule-based "Judge" agent that maintains inquiry quality (verified against the current 95%+ accuracy) while significantly reducing the number of LLM invocations per problem.

## Limitations

- Dataset construction concerns: The MExam dataset's methodology is underspecified - collection sources, annotation protocols, and quality control procedures are not detailed.
- Agent system reliability: The multi-agent framework relies entirely on GPT-4 for inquiry generation, validation, and reference creation, with unquantified cascading error potential.
- Cross-linguistic validity: The paper's experimental results are based on English mathematical problems, yet MExam contains Chinese content, requiring validation across languages and educational contexts.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The mechanism showing CogMath reveals 30%-40% overestimation of LLM capabilities is supported by concrete pass rate statistics across multiple models and benchmarks.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that prompting techniques don't fundamentally enhance mathematical reasoning is based on observed performance patterns, but the underlying architectural limitations require further validation through ablation studies.

**Low confidence**: The assertion that "over-correction" behavior is inherent to current LLMs rather than a training distribution artifact needs more rigorous investigation with systematically varied training data.

## Next Checks

1. **Agent iteration efficiency**: Measure Judge agent rejection rates and inquiry quality improvement across the 10 allowed iterations on a validation set to determine if the current δ=10 parameter is optimal or excessive.

2. **Training data contamination test**: Evaluate models trained on completely disjoint mathematical datasets (no GSM8K/MATH overlap) using CogMath to isolate whether performance gaps stem from reasoning limitations versus memorization.

3. **Human vs. agent benchmark**: Have human experts solve the same nine-dimensional evaluation for 100 problems to establish baseline pass rates and validate whether the framework's difficulty calibration appropriately challenges genuine mathematical reasoning.
