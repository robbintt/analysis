- This study investigates whether English-centric reasoning models can effectively generalize to other languages, revealing that parallel training with multiple languages significantly improves cross-lingual transfer through a power-law scaling relationship.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether English-centric reasoning models can effectively generalize to other languages. The authors propose a cross-linguistic perspective, systematically evaluating 13 open-source English-centric large reasoning models on multilingual benchmarks and introducing a Multilingual Transferability Index (MTI) to quantify cross-lingual transfer. Their interventional studies reveal that models with stronger initial English capabilities over-rely on English-specific patterns, diminishing cross-lingual generalization. Through parallel training studies using 1-7 parallel languages, they identify three key phenomena: a "First-Parallel Leap" when transitioning from monolingual to bilingual training, a "Parallel Scaling Law" showing cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of training parallel languages, and a "Monolingual Generalization Gap" indicating that English-centric LRMs fail to fully generalize across languages. The findings suggest that current English-centric LRMs do not mirror human reasoning cognition, providing insights for developing more language-agnostic models.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates 13 open-source English-centric LRMs using GRPO-based reinforcement post-training on mathematical reasoning tasks. Models are trained on 1,000 MATH samples with parallel data across 7 languages (es, ru, de, fr, bn, th, zh) and evaluated on 11 languages including challenging low-resource languages. The study introduces the Multilingual Transferability Index (MTI) to measure cross-lingual transfer effectiveness and establishes a Parallel Scaling Law showing transferability follows a power-law with the number of parallel training languages. Performance is measured using accuracy, off-target rates, and MTI across multiple reasoning benchmarks including MATH500, AIME24/25, and GPQA-Diamond.

## Key Results
- Models with stronger initial English capabilities show reduced cross-lingual transfer due to over-reliance on English-specific patterns
- Parallel training with just one additional language produces a substantial "First-Parallel Leap" in cross-lingual transfer performance
- Cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law scaling with the number of parallel training languages (exponent β=0.29), showing diminishing returns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: English Pattern Entrenchment
- **Claim:** Models with stronger initial English capabilities exhibit reduced cross-lingual transfer due to over-reliance on language-specific patterns.
- **Mechanism:** Instruction-tuned models develop stronger alignment to English linguistic patterns during fine-tuning. When subsequently trained on English reasoning data, they anchor on these surface patterns rather than abstracting reasoning procedures. This creates a transferability deficit compared to base models that retain more general pretrained representations.
- **Core assumption:** Cross-lingual transfer requires accessing language-agnostic reasoning circuits; English-specific pattern memorization competes with this access.
- **Evidence anchors:** Models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization. Base models achieve MTI of 1.95 vs Instruct models' 1.23 despite lower absolute accuracy. Limited direct corpus support; "From Unaligned to Aligned" notes unaligned multilingual data limits cross-lingual semantic capture—consistent with pattern entrenchment hypothesis.
- **Break condition:** If instruction tuning were performed on multilingual data rather than English-dominant data, the entrenchment effect should diminish.

### Mechanism 2: Parallel Semantic Anchoring
- **Claim:** Parallel training data creates explicit cross-lingual semantic equivalence signals that force the model to develop unified representations.
- **Mechanism:** When the same problem appears in multiple languages simultaneously, the model cannot solve it using language-specific heuristics alone. The parallel structure creates a contrastive learning signal: semantically equivalent content must map to similar internal representations despite surface form differences. This drives the "First-Parallel Leap."
- **Core assumption:** Models can and will abstract shared reasoning procedures when forced to process semantically equivalent inputs in different surface forms.
- **Evidence anchors:** First-Parallel Leap, a substantial leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single parallel language. MTI jumps from 1.16 to 2.50 (+1.34) with first parallel language; subsequent additions yield diminishing returns. "Parallel Tokenizers" paper argues semantically equivalent words should share representations—provides theoretical support for parallel signal importance.
- **Break condition:** If parallel data were shuffled such that semantically non-equivalent problems were paired across languages, the transfer benefit should disappear or reverse.

### Mechanism 3: Transferability vs Accuracy Scaling Separation
- **Claim:** Parallel training primarily teaches the model *how to generalize* across languages rather than improving raw reasoning accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** The power-law exponent for transferability (β=0.29) substantially exceeds that for accuracy (β=0.02). This indicates parallel training strengthens the cross-lingual mapping function while leaving task-specific reasoning largely unchanged. The model already possesses reasoning capabilities from pretraining; parallel exposure primarily improves access to these capabilities across language contexts.
- **Core assumption:** Reasoning capability and language-specific access are partially decoupled in model representations.
- **Evidence anchors:** f(X) = 2.00·X^0.29 for transferability vs f(X) = 56.98·X^0.02 for accuracy. The primary benefit of parallel training is not in boosting absolute performance but in teaching the model how to transfer reasoning. ATLAS paper on multilingual scaling laws—consistent finding that transfer mechanisms scale differently than raw performance.
- **Break condition:** If reasoning and language were fully coupled, both metrics should scale with similar exponents.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multilingual Transferability Index (MTI)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's central metric quantifies how well reasoning gains transfer to unseen languages. Understanding MTI is essential for interpreting all experimental results.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a base model accuracy of 30% on language L and a trained model accuracy of 45% on L, with average training gain of 10%, what is the MTI for L? (Answer: (45-30)/30 divided by (10/30) = 1.5 / 0.33 = 4.5)

- **Concept: Power-Law Scaling with Diminishing Returns**
  - **Why needed here:** The Parallel Scaling Law is expressed as f(X) = α·X^β where β<1 indicates diminishing marginal returns from adding parallel languages.
  - **Quick check question:** If β=0.29, approximately how much improvement do you gain going from 1 to 2 parallel languages vs from 6 to 7? (Answer: The ratio 2^0.29/1^0.29 ≈ 1.22 vs 7^0.29/6^0.29 ≈ 1.05—early gains are ~4x larger)

- **Concept: GRPO (Group Rollout Policy Optimization)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses GRPO for Reinforcement Post-Training. Understanding how rollout sampling and advantage estimation work clarifies why RL generalizes better than SFT for low-resource languages.
  - **Quick check question:** In GRPO, why does sampling G=16 rollouts per question improve over single-sample training? (Answer: Multiple samples enable relative advantage estimation via group normalization, reducing variance and rewarding consistent reasoning over lucky guesses)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Initial Model (Base/Instruct/Math-specific) → GRPO Training (with composite reward: accuracy + format + language consistency) → [Monolingual Path] [Parallel Path] → Lower MTI Higher MTI (power-law scaling) Monolingual Gap Better cross-lingual transfer

- **Critical path:**
  1. Select initial model—base models generalize better than instruct for equal training
  2. Prepare parallel dataset (1000 samples sufficient per paper's LIMO-inspired approach)
  3. Configure GRPO with λ₁=0.8 (accuracy), λ₂=0.1 (format), λ₃=0.1 (language consistency)
  4. Train with at least ONE parallel language to achieve First-Parallel Leap
  5. Evaluate on MTI using held-out languages

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Base vs Instruct initial model:** Base → higher MTI, lower absolute accuracy. Instruct → higher accuracy, lower transferability. Choose based on deployment needs.
  - **Number of parallel languages:** First parallel gives ~75% of total transfer benefit (diminishing returns). Adding 6 more languages only contributes remaining ~25%.
  - **Model size:** Smaller models (1.5B) show larger relative gains on in-domain tasks; larger models (7B) show more robust transfer to challenging OOD benchmarks.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - SFT on low-resource languages (bn, sw, te) causes *negative* transfer—performance degrades below baseline
  - Monolingual English training produces accuracy ~56.98% predicted by power-law, but actual performance is ~54.24%—the "Monolingual Generalization Gap" signals language-specific pattern reliance
  - High off-target rates indicate model failing to respond in user's language despite prompting

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Replicate First-Parallel Leap:** Train Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on English-only vs English+Russian parallel data on 1000 MATH samples. Verify MTI jump from ~1.1 to ~2.5.
  2. **Ablate parallel vs non-parallel multilingual data:** Compare training on English+Russian (parallel, same problems) vs English+Russian (non-parallel, different problems). Expect parallel to outperform by 2-4 accuracy points per Figure 5.
  3. **Test break condition for pattern entrenchment:** Fine-tune a base model with multilingual instruction tuning before GRPO. Compare cross-lingual transfer to English-only instruction-tuned baseline. Predict improved MTI if entrenchment mechanism holds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does the Parallel Scaling Law generalize to reasoning domains beyond mathematics, such as coding or agent planning?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state in the Limitations section: "A primary limitation of our work is its focus on the mathematical reasoning domain... generalizability to other domains, such as coding, agent planning, remains to be verified."
- **Why unresolved:** The experiments were restricted to mathematical benchmarks (MATH500, AIME, GPQA-Diamond), leaving the behavior of the scaling law in non-mathematical reasoning contexts unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Replicating the parallel training experiments on coding benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval) or planning tasks to see if the power-law scaling holds.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the mechanistic causes for RL's superiority over SFT in low-resource language transfer?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors note that "the precise reason for RL's advantage in low-resource languages... remain open questions" and suggest future work on "mechanistic interpretability."
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper empirically observes that SFT leads to degradation in low-resource languages while RL yields improvements, the internal causal mechanisms and specific linguistic patterns driving this divergence remain hypothetical.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis of internal model representations and failure modes for SFT vs. RL models specifically on low-resource languages (e.g., Swahili, Telugu).

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can parallel training strategies be refined to overcome the diminishing returns predicted by the Parallel Scaling Law?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors identify the diminishing returns (power-law exponents < 1) and explicitly call for "more sophisticated parallel training strategies that can better overcome the diminishing returns shown in the scaling law."
- **Why unresolved:** The current strategy shows high initial gains (First-Parallel Leap) but tapers off quickly as more languages are added.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of new training methodologies (e.g., dynamic language weighting, curriculum learning) that sustain high beta coefficients in the scaling law as the number of parallel languages increases.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How can these findings be applied to low-resource languages where high-quality parallel training data is scarce?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors list "investigating how to apply our findings to the challenge of low-resource languages" as a "critical next step."
- **Why unresolved:** The proposed solution ("Just Go Parallel") relies on carefully aligned parallel problem sets, which are difficult to construct for the low-resource languages that suffer most from negative transfer.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments utilizing synthetic data generation or zero-shot transfer techniques to bridge the gap for languages outside the parallel training set.

## Limitations

- **Model selection bias:** Experiments primarily use Qwen2.5-7B models; results may not generalize to other architectures or model families.
- **Data generation pipeline:** While GPT-4o-MINI was used for benchmark translation, the parallel training data generation process is underspecified, creating reproducibility concerns.
- **Generalization to non-mathematical domains:** All experiments focus on mathematical reasoning; transfer patterns may differ for code, scientific reasoning, or general knowledge tasks.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Parallel Scaling Law exponent β=0.29 for transferability (supported by direct curve fitting across 7 parallel languages); First-Parallel Leap effect (demonstrated with clear performance jumps); Monolingual Generalization Gap existence (confirmed by comparing predicted vs. actual monolingual performance).
- **Medium confidence:** Mechanism 1 (English Pattern Entrenchment) - supported by MTI differences between base and instruct models but lacks direct causal intervention; Mechanism 2 (Parallel Semantic Anchoring) - theoretically sound but requires additional ablation studies to confirm parallel data is the critical factor vs. simply multilingual exposure.
- **Low confidence:** Mechanism 3 (Transferability vs Accuracy Scaling Separation) - while the numerical difference in exponents is clear, the interpretation that parallel training "teaches how to transfer" vs. improving reasoning remains speculative without probing internal representations.

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture ablation study:** Repeat the Parallel Scaling Law experiments with Llama-3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeekMath-7B-Base to test if the β=0.29 transferability exponent holds across model families.

2. **Domain generalization test:** Apply the same parallel training protocol to a non-mathematical benchmark (e.g., multilingual code or commonsense reasoning) to verify the scaling law applies beyond mathematical reasoning.

3. **Direct mechanism validation:** Implement the break condition for Mechanism 1 by fine-tuning a base model with multilingual instruction tuning before GRPO, then measure MTI changes to confirm English pattern entrenchment as the limiting factor.
