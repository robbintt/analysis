# Enhancing Multi-Hop Fact Verification with Structured Knowledge-Augmented Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.08495
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08495
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Achieves up to 79.90% accuracy on 2-hop HOVER dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for multi-hop fact verification that leverages structured knowledge augmentation with large language models. The framework, called LLM-SKAN, addresses the challenge of verifying complex claims that require reasoning across multiple pieces of evidence by combining LLM-based relation extraction with graph neural networks. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets, particularly excelling at multi-hop reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The proposed method integrates large language models with structured knowledge graphs to enhance fact verification. The core approach uses an LLM to extract fine-grained entities and their relationships from claims and evidence, creating a structured knowledge representation. This extracted knowledge is then fused with graph neural networks to capture complex dependencies across multiple evidence pieces. The framework consists of three main components: an LLM-driven knowledge extractor that identifies entities and relations, a knowledge-augmented relation graph fusion module that integrates this information, and a fact verification classifier that makes the final determination. This combination enables the system to handle multi-hop reasoning by effectively connecting disparate pieces of evidence through the structured knowledge representation.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop fact verification tasks
- Reaches 79.90% accuracy on the 2-hop HOVER dataset
- Demonstrates consistent improvements across four benchmark datasets (FEVER, 2/3/4-hop HOVER)
- Ablation studies show each component contributes to overall performance, with relation graph fusion being particularly important

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by bridging the gap between unstructured textual evidence and structured relational knowledge. Traditional fact verification methods struggle with multi-hop reasoning because they either rely solely on textual matching or lack the ability to capture fine-grained entity relationships. By using LLMs as relation extractors, the method creates a rich structured representation of the evidence that preserves semantic relationships between entities. The graph neural network component then leverages this structure to perform reasoning across multiple hops, effectively modeling the dependencies between evidence pieces. This combination allows the system to verify claims that require synthesizing information from multiple sources, which is essential for complex fact-checking scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-hop reasoning**: The ability to connect information across multiple pieces of evidence is essential for verifying complex claims that cannot be resolved through direct matching. Quick check: Can the system connect evidence across at least 4 hops of reasoning?
- **Knowledge graph construction**: Structured representation of entities and their relationships provides a foundation for reasoning that raw text lacks. Quick check: Does the extracted knowledge graph preserve all relevant entity relationships from the evidence?
- **Graph neural networks**: GNNs excel at modeling relationships and dependencies in structured data, making them ideal for reasoning over knowledge graphs. Quick check: Does the GNN effectively propagate information across multiple hops in the knowledge graph?
- **Large language model integration**: LLMs provide powerful text understanding capabilities that can extract fine-grained relational information from unstructured text. Quick check: Is the LLM consistently extracting accurate and complete entity relationships across different types of claims?
- **Evidence fusion techniques**: Combining multiple pieces of evidence requires sophisticated methods to handle contradictions and varying reliability. Quick check: How does the system handle contradictory evidence when making verification decisions?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Claim -> LLM Knowledge Extractor -> Knowledge Graph Builder -> Graph Neural Network -> Fact Verification Classifier

**Critical Path**: The verification process follows a sequential flow from claim input through LLM extraction, graph construction, GNN reasoning, and final classification. The most critical components are the LLM knowledge extraction and the graph neural network fusion, as errors in either stage propagate through the system.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency for accuracy by using large language models for relation extraction. This approach provides rich, fine-grained knowledge but increases inference time and resource requirements. The graph neural network adds complexity but enables sophisticated multi-hop reasoning that simpler methods cannot achieve.

**Failure Signatures**: The system may fail when the LLM incorrectly extracts relationships, when the knowledge graph becomes too sparse to support multi-hop reasoning, or when contradictory evidence cannot be properly reconciled. Performance degradation is likely to occur on claims requiring very long reasoning chains or when dealing with ambiguous entity references.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test the LLM knowledge extraction component independently on a subset of claims to verify accurate relation extraction
2. Evaluate the graph neural network's ability to perform reasoning on synthetically constructed knowledge graphs with known ground truth paths
3. Measure the impact of varying the depth of the knowledge graph on verification accuracy for claims of different complexity levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational cost of LLM-driven knowledge extraction may limit deployment in resource-constrained environments
- Performance on extremely complex claims (beyond 4-hop reasoning) remains untested
- Limited analysis of how different knowledge graph structures affect overall performance
- Does not extensively address handling of contradictory evidence or robustness to adversarial examples

## Confidence
High: Core claims about performance improvements on benchmark datasets
Medium: Claims about scalability to more complex reasoning tasks
Medium: Claims about computational efficiency in real-world deployment

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments comparing LLM-SKAN's performance across different LLM sizes and types to assess the impact of model choice on extraction quality and overall accuracy
2. Test the framework's scalability and performance on claims requiring more than 4 hops of reasoning to evaluate its limits
3. Implement and evaluate the framework in a real-time fact-checking scenario to measure computational efficiency and practical utility in production environments
