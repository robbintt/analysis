# From Data-Centric to Sample-Centric: Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Progressive Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06573
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06573
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LPPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving pass@1 accuracy by 2-4 percentage points and demonstrating faster convergence across model scales.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LPPO (Learning-Progress and Prefix-guided Optimization), a sample-centric framework that enhances large language model reasoning through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Unlike traditional data-centric approaches that treat all training samples uniformly, LPPO dynamically optimizes each sample's influence based on its learning trajectory and provides partial solution guidance for challenging problems. The framework demonstrates significant improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on AIME24, AIME25, and Minerva while maintaining solution diversity.

## Method Summary
LPPO operates through two complementary strategies: Prefix-Guided Sampling uses partial expert solution prefixes to guide exploration on difficult problems, mimicking hint-based learning in humans, while Learning-Progress Weighting dynamically adjusts sample influence based on improvement trajectories. The framework integrates these strategies within a reinforcement learning framework with verifiable rewards, shifting from uniform data treatment to sample-level optimization. This approach enables more efficient learning from limited expert demonstrations and faster convergence to higher performance ceilings.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AIME24, AIME25, and Minerva benchmarks
- Demonstrates consistent 2-4 percentage point improvements in pass@1 accuracy over strong baselines
- Shows faster convergence and higher performance ceilings while maintaining solution diversity
- Proves effective across different model scales, architectures, and RL learners

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LPPO's effectiveness stems from addressing the limitations of uniform data treatment in traditional RL approaches. By providing partial solution guidance through prefix-guided sampling, the framework helps models explore more effectively around challenging problems. The learning-progress weighting mechanism ensures that samples contributing most to learning gains receive appropriate emphasis, preventing stagnation on samples that no longer provide value. This dynamic sample-level optimization mimics human learning patterns where difficult problems receive targeted support while easy problems require less attention.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards**: Needed for mathematical reasoning where correctness can be objectively verified. Quick check: Does the task have clear right/wrong answers?
- **Sample Weighting Mechanisms**: Required to differentiate sample importance based on learning progress. Quick check: Are some samples contributing more to model improvement than others?
- **Prefix-Based Exploration**: Essential for guiding model exploration on complex problems. Quick check: Can partial solutions help the model navigate difficult reasoning paths?
- **Learning Trajectory Analysis**: Necessary to track which samples improve over time. Quick check: Are samples showing consistent improvement or plateauing?
- **Diversity Maintenance in RL**: Important to avoid overfitting to specific solution patterns. Quick check: Does the model explore multiple solution strategies?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Samples -> Prefix-Guided Sampling -> Learning-Progress Tracking -> Weight Assignment -> RL Training

**Critical Path**: The framework's core pipeline processes samples through prefix-guided exploration to generate diverse solution attempts, tracks learning progress for each sample, dynamically assigns weights based on improvement trajectories, and feeds weighted samples into the RL training loop. The learning-progress tracking component is critical as it drives the adaptive weighting mechanism.

**Design Tradeoffs**: LPPO trades computational overhead for sample-level optimization precision. Maintaining learning-progress tracking requires additional memory and computation but enables more efficient learning from limited data. The prefix-guided approach may introduce bias toward expert solution patterns but significantly improves exploration efficiency on hard problems.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance indicates either ineffective prefix generation (solutions don't guide exploration), broken learning-progress tracking (weights don't reflect actual improvement), or inappropriate weight scaling (some samples dominate training). Training may stagnate if the framework cannot identify which samples provide learning value.

**First Experiments**: 1) Validate prefix-guided sampling improves exploration on challenging problems compared to uniform sampling. 2) Test learning-progress weighting effectiveness by comparing weighted vs unweighted training on the same dataset. 3) Measure solution diversity maintenance by tracking unique solution patterns across training iterations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Performance gains primarily validated on mathematical reasoning tasks, limiting generalization to other reasoning domains
- Framework assumes availability of verifiable rewards, constraining applicability to tasks with clear correctness metrics
- Computational overhead of maintaining learning-progress tracking across large-scale datasets remains unexplored
- Effectiveness depends on availability of high-quality expert demonstrations

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core empirical findings on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with 2-4 percentage point improvements and state-of-the-art results
- **Medium Confidence**: Sample efficiency and convergence speed claims supported by experimental evidence but need longer training horizon analysis
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability to non-mathematical reasoning domains and performance with severely limited or noisy expert demonstrations

## Next Checks
1. Test LPPO on non-mathematical reasoning tasks (code generation, commonsense reasoning, scientific reasoning) to evaluate domain transferability
2. Systematically evaluate performance degradation as expert demonstration quality decreases through controlled experiments with noisy labels and reduced dataset sizes
3. Measure computational overhead of learning-progress tracking and prefix-guided sampling mechanisms across different model scales and dataset sizes
