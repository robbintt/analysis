# A Conformal Prediction Framework for Uncertainty Quantification in Physics-Informed Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.13717
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13717
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Distribution-free conformal prediction framework for uncertainty quantification in PINNs with rigorous finite-sample coverage guarantees

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the critical need for rigorous uncertainty quantification in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by introducing a distribution-free conformal prediction framework. PINNs have emerged as powerful tools for solving partial differential equations, but existing uncertainty quantification methods lack statistical guarantees. The proposed framework calibrates prediction intervals using nonconformity scores on a calibration set, providing theoretically sound uncertainty estimates while maintaining computational efficiency.

The authors tackle the challenge of spatial heteroskedasticity in PDE solutions by developing a local conformal quantile estimation strategy. This approach enables spatially adaptive uncertainty bands that are sharper in regions of high certainty and wider where predictions are less reliable. Through extensive experiments on canonical PDEs including the damped harmonic oscillator, Poisson, Allen-Cahn, and Helmholtz equations, the framework demonstrates consistent achievement of reliable calibration and locally adaptive uncertainty intervals, outperforming heuristic UQ approaches.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs a calibration set from the PINN training data and computes nonconformity scores for each prediction. These scores measure the deviation between predicted and observed values, with larger scores indicating poorer fit. The empirical distribution of nonconformity scores from the calibration set is then used to determine prediction intervals that achieve the desired coverage level. To address spatial heteroskedasticity, the authors introduce a local conformal quantile estimation strategy that computes adaptive prediction intervals based on local neighborhoods of the input space. This local approach preserves theoretical guarantees while enabling sharper, more informative uncertainty estimates that vary spatially according to the underlying uncertainty patterns in the solution.

## Key Results
- The framework achieves empirical coverage close to the expected level of 0.95 across all tested PDE problems
- Average coverage deviation reduced from 0.29-0.41 to 0.03-0.09 after calibration
- Local CP variant identifies regions of elevated uncertainty while maintaining sharper intervals than standard CP
- Framework consistently outperforms heuristic UQ approaches in terms of calibration and interval sharpness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the fundamental property of conformal prediction: by using the empirical distribution of nonconformity scores from a calibration set, it can construct prediction intervals that achieve exact coverage in finite samples without distributional assumptions. The local conformal quantile estimation extends this principle by adapting the quantile computation to local regions of the input space, capturing spatial heteroskedasticity in the uncertainty. This combination of rigorous statistical foundations with spatial adaptation enables reliable uncertainty quantification that is both theoretically sound and practically informative.

## Foundational Learning

### Conformal Prediction
- Why needed: Provides distribution-free coverage guarantees without requiring parametric assumptions
- Quick check: Verify that nonconformity scores follow the exchangeability assumption in practice

### Nonconformity Scores
- Why needed: Quantify the deviation between predictions and observations to calibrate uncertainty
- Quick check: Ensure score construction captures relevant aspects of prediction quality

### Quantile Estimation
- Why needed: Translates nonconformity scores into prediction intervals at desired coverage levels
- Quick check: Validate local quantile estimates are stable and well-calibrated

### Spatial Heteroskedasticity
- Why needed: PDE solutions often exhibit varying uncertainty levels across the domain
- Quick check: Confirm local adaptation improves interval sharpness without sacrificing coverage

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Calibration set construction -> Nonconformity score computation -> Empirical distribution building -> Interval calibration -> Local quantile estimation (optional) -> Spatially adaptive prediction intervals

### Critical Path
The core pipeline flows from calibration set creation through nonconformity score computation to interval determination. The critical computational step is the local quantile estimation, which requires efficient neighborhood search and quantile computation for each prediction location.

### Design Tradeoffs
The framework balances theoretical rigor with practical utility by offering both standard and local variants. Standard conformal prediction provides strong guarantees but yields uniform intervals, while local conformal prediction offers spatial adaptation at the cost of additional computational overhead and potential instability in sparse regions.

### Failure Signatures
Coverage deviation from nominal level indicates calibration issues, often stemming from poor nonconformity score design or violation of exchangeability assumptions. Overly wide intervals suggest conservative calibration, while spatially inconsistent intervals may indicate problems with local quantile estimation.

### First Experiments
1. Test coverage guarantees on simple synthetic data with known uncertainty patterns
2. Evaluate interval sharpness versus standard UQ methods on benchmark PDEs
3. Assess computational overhead of local conformal quantile estimation across problem sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the conformal prediction framework be extended to inverse problems in PINNs where the goal is parameter estimation rather than solution field prediction?
- Basis in paper: Section 6 states that "Promising directions for future work include extensions to inverse and partially observed problems."
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses exclusively on forward problems (predicting solution fields $u$). Inverse problems involve inferring parameters $\theta$, which poses different statistical challenges regarding identifiability and the structure of the nonconformity scores.
- Evidence: Successful application of the framework to inverse benchmarks (e.g., recovering PDE coefficients from noisy data) demonstrating valid coverage intervals for the estimated parameters.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can this framework preserve finite-sample coverage guarantees when integrated with operator learning paradigms like DeepONets or Fourier Neural Operators?
- Basis in paper: Section 6 identifies "integration with operator-learning paradigms such as DeepONets and Fourier Neural Operators" as a future avenue.
- Why unresolved: The current method is validated on function approximation (PINNs). Operator learning maps functions to functions, potentially requiring adjustments to the nonconformity scoring mechanism to handle infinite-dimensional output spaces or varying input functions.
- Evidence: Experiments applying the Local CP calibration to operator networks, verifying that coverage guarantees hold across different input function distributions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the coverage guarantee in chaotic time-dependent systems where the exchangeability assumption may be violated due to distribution shift?
- Basis in paper: Theorem 3.1 requires data exchangeability. While the paper tests a damped harmonic oscillator (Section 5.2.1), it does not assess systems with chaotic dynamics or significant distribution shift over time, which are common in complex fluid dynamics (referenced in Section 1).
- Why unresolved: Standard conformal prediction relies on exchangeability; if future states diverge statistically from the calibration set (distribution shift), the finite-sample guarantees may theoretically fail.
- Evidence: Numerical experiments on chaotic PDEs (e.g., turbulent Navier-Stokes) evaluating empirical coverage over long time horizons relative to the calibration distribution.

## Limitations
- Scalability to high-dimensional problems and complex geometries has not been validated
- Computational overhead of calibration and local quantile estimation procedures is not thoroughly characterized
- Systematic guidelines for optimal nonconformity score selection across different PDE types are lacking

## Confidence
- Theoretical guarantees for standard conformal prediction: High
- Performance of local conformal quantile estimation: Medium
- Scalability to high-dimensional problems: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the framework on high-dimensional parametric PDEs (e.g., 10+ input dimensions) to assess scalability and computational overhead
2. Test performance on problems with complex geometries and irregular solution domains
3. Conduct systematic ablation studies varying the nonconformity score function across different PDE types to establish guidelines for score selection
