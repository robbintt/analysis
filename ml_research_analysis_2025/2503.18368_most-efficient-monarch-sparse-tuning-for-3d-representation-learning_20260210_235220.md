# MoST: Efficient Monarch Sparse Tuning for 3D Representation Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.18368
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18368
- Reference count: 40
- MoST achieves 97.5% accuracy on ScanObjectNN (PB_50_RS) with only 3.6% of parameters compared to full fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
MoST (Monarch Sparse Tuning) introduces the first reparameterization-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning method specifically designed for 3D representation learning on point clouds. The key innovation is Point Monarch, a structured matrix family that extends Monarch matrices to 3D point clouds by incorporating local geometric features through KNN-based linear transformations. MoST achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks while requiring significantly fewer parameters than full fine-tuning, with no inference overhead.

## Method Summary
MoST leverages reparameterization to replace dense weight matrices in 3D point cloud models with sparse Point Monarch matrices. These matrices are constructed using Kronecker products and local geometric information derived from KNN neighborhoods in point cloud data. The method reparameterizes the update matrices during fine-tuning, maintaining the original network architecture at inference time. Point Monarch matrices capture both local geometric features and sparse structures, enabling efficient adaptation while preserving essential 3D information. The approach is compatible with various backbone architectures including Transformers, Mamba, and hierarchical models.

## Key Results
- Achieves 97.5% accuracy on ScanObjectNN (PB_50_RS) while using only 3.6% of parameters compared to full fine-tuning
- Achieves 96.2% accuracy on ModelNet40 classification
- Demonstrates strong generalizability across various backbones including Transformers, Mamba, and hierarchical architectures
- Can be combined with other matrix decompositions for further parameter reduction
- Outperforms existing PEFT methods while preserving local features in point clouds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MoST works by leveraging the structured sparsity of Monarch matrices to reduce parameter count while maintaining expressive power for 3D point cloud data. The Point Monarch matrices incorporate local geometric features through KNN-based linear transformations, which capture the inherent structure of point clouds more effectively than generic sparse patterns. By reparameterizing only the update matrices during fine-tuning, MoST maintains the pre-trained knowledge while efficiently adapting to downstream tasks. The Kronecker product structure enables efficient computation and parameter sharing, while the geometric awareness ensures that local features crucial for 3D understanding are preserved.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input point cloud → Point Monarch transformation → Backbone (Transformer/Mamba/hierarchical) → Classification/Segmentation head
- **Critical path**: Point Monarch reparameterization → Sparse weight matrices → Local geometric feature preservation → Efficient fine-tuning
