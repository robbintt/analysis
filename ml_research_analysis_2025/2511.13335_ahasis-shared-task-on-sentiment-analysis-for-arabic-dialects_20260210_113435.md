# AHaSIS: Shared Task on Sentiment Analysis for Arabic Dialects

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.13335
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13335
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: 3-class sentiment classification F1 0.81 using ensemble of dialect-specific BERT models

## Executive Summary
The AHaSIS shared task addressed Arabic sentiment analysis in hospitality, focusing on Saudi and Moroccan Darija dialects. A manually curated dataset of 538 hotel reviews in these dialects was developed, with translations validated by native speakers for dialectal accuracy. Twelve teams participated in the evaluation, employing diverse approaches including fine-tuned transformer models (MARBERTv2, AraBERT, DarijaBERT), ensemble methods, and large language model prompting. The top-performing system, an ensemble of fine-tuned BERT variants, achieved an F1 score of 0.81, demonstrating strong performance in dialect-aware sentiment classification.

## Method Summary
The task involved 3-class sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative) of hotel reviews in Saudi and Moroccan Darija dialects. Teams employed various approaches including fine-tuning pre-trained Arabic transformers (MARBERTv2, SaudiBERT, DarijaBERT), ensemble methods combining multiple models, data augmentation strategies (paraphrasing, pattern-based generation), and large language model prompting. The winning system used an ensemble of three pre-trained models (MARBERTv2, SaudiBERT, DarijaBERT), each fine-tuned with stratified 5-fold cross-validation, with final predictions generated by averaging logits across models and folds.

## Key Results
- Top system achieved F1 score of 0.81 using ensemble of fine-tuned BERT variants
- Dialect-specific models (SaudiBERT, DarijaBERT) outperformed MSA-centric approaches
- Data augmentation strategies improved performance but risk introducing sentiment polarity drift

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Ensembling dialect-specialized transformer models improves sentiment classification robustness across Arabic dialect variations better than single-model approaches.
- **Mechanism:** Three models (MARBERTv2, SaudiBERT, DarijaBERT) pre-trained on different dialect corpora capture complementary linguistic patterns. Averaging logits across models and 5-fold cross-validation smooths individual model biases and reduces variance in predictions, particularly for dialect-specific idioms and sentiment expressions.
- **Core assumption:** Each model's pre-training corpus provides non-overlapping dialectal knowledge that generalizes to unseen hospitality reviews.
- **Evidence anchors:** Top system achieved F1 0.81 using ensemble approach; team LBY found MARBERTv2 performed best in their setup through dialect-specific experiments.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Dialect-specific BERT models outperform MSA-centric or general Arabic models for dialectal sentiment classification.
- **Mechanism:** Models like DarijaBERT and SaudiBERT are pre-trained on dialect corpora containing informal syntax, code-switching, and region-specific vocabulary absent from MSA data. Fine-tuning on domain-specific hospitality reviews aligns these representations with sentiment-bearing expressions.
- **Core assumption:** Sentiment polarity is expressed through dialect-specific lexical and syntactic patterns that MSA models fail to capture.
- **Evidence anchors:** MSA-trained models struggle to generalize across dialects; team LBY found MARBERTv2 performed best in their setup through dialect-specific experiments.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Data augmentation strategies partially compensate for limited annotated dialectal data in low-resource settings.
- **Mechanism:** Augmentation techniques—paraphrasing via FANAR API, pattern-based generation, and domain-specific word substitution—expand training distribution while preserving dialectal markers. This reduces overfitting on the small 860-example training set.
- **Core assumption:** Augmentation preserves sentiment polarity and dialect authenticity sufficiently to act as effective regularizer.
- **Evidence anchors:** MARSAD team combined three augmentation techniques achieving F1 0.75; MARSAD AI implemented two augmentation strategies outperforming AraBERT-only baseline.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Arabic Diglossia and Dialect Variation**
  - **Why needed here:** Arabic exhibits diglossia—MSA for formal writing, regional dialects (Saudi, Moroccan Darija) for daily communication. Models trained on one often fail on the other due to syntactic, morphological, and lexical differences.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why an MSA-trained model might misclassify "ما شاء الله" in a Moroccan hotel review?

- **Concept: BERT-style Fine-Tuning for Classification**
  - **Why needed here:** All top systems fine-tune transformer encoders by adding classification heads and updating weights on task data. Understanding tokenization, attention, and fine-tuning dynamics is prerequisite.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to a pre-trained Arabic BERT's hidden states during fine-tuning for 3-class sentiment classification?

- **Concept: Ensemble Logit Averaging**
  - **Why needed here:** The winning system averages logits (pre-softmax outputs) across multiple models and folds, not predictions. This preserves uncertainty information and produces smoother decision boundaries.
  - **Quick check question:** Why average logits instead of hard vote counts when ensembling three BERT models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Review Text → Dialect-Aware Preprocessing → Tokenizer (BERT-family) → Pre-trained Encoder (MARBERTv2 / SaudiBERT / DarijaBERT) → [CLS] Representation → Classification Head (3-way softmax) → (Optional) Ensemble Averaging → Final Prediction

- **Critical path:**
  1. Select dialect-appropriate pre-trained model (SaudiBERT for Saudi, DarijaBERT for Moroccan, MARBERTv2 for mixed)
  2. Apply minimal preprocessing—preserve dialectal orthography and expressions
  3. Fine-tune with stratified k-fold cross-validation, label smoothing, and early stopping
  4. If ensembling, train multiple models independently and average logits at inference

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Single dialect-specific model vs. ensemble:** Ensemble (F1 0.81) outperforms single models but requires 3× inference compute and memory
  - **LLM prompting vs. fine-tuning:** GPT-4o prompting (F1 0.69–0.76) is faster to prototype but underperforms fine-tuned transformers and costs more at scale
  - **Data augmentation vs. original data only:** Augmentation helps (MARSAD AI: AraBERT baseline → F1 0.74) but risks introducing noise if paraphrasing distorts sentiment

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Neutral class underperformance: LLM approaches struggle with neutral sentiment (MucAI noted this explicitly)
  - Dialect confusion: Models trained on one dialect misclassify the other; check per-dialect F1 if available
  - Overfitting on small data: Large models without regularization or augmentation show train-test gap >15%

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline:** Fine-tune MARBERTv2 on combined Saudi+Darija training data with default hyperparameters; report micro-F1 and per-class recall
  2. **Ablation:** Train separate models on Saudi-only and Darija-only subsets; compare to combined training to quantify cross-dialect transfer
  3. **Ensemble MVP:** Combine MARBERTv2 + DarijaBERT with logit averaging; measure F1 gain vs. single-model baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does sentiment classification performance vary when models are trained on naturally-occurring dialectal text versus dialectal text translated from MSA?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The dataset was constructed by translating MSA hotel reviews into Saudi and Moroccan Darija, with native speaker validation for accuracy. However, the paper does not compare performance on translated versus organically dialectal data.
- **Why unresolved:** No ablation or comparison was conducted between translated dialectal data and natively-written dialectal reviews. Translated text may lack idiomatic expressions, code-switching patterns, or informal structures found in authentic user-generated dialectal content.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study using both translated and natively-collected dialectal reviews from the same domain, evaluating whether models trained on translated data generalize to authentic dialectal text.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the dialect-specific error patterns across Saudi and Moroccan Darija, and which linguistic features drive misclassification?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The task description listed "Dialect-Specific Performance" and "Error Categorisation" as secondary analyses, but the results section reports only aggregate micro-F1 scores without dialect-level breakdowns or error analysis.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper reports overall system rankings but does not disaggregate performance by dialect or provide qualitative error analysis distinguishing sentiment misclassification from dialectal confusion.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Per-dialect performance metrics (Saudi vs. Darija F1 scores), confusion matrices, and annotated error categories showing whether failures stem from sentiment ambiguity, dialect-specific vocabulary, or cross-dialect interference.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How robust are fine-tuned dialectal transformers versus few-shot LLM prompting when scaled to additional Arabic dialects beyond Saudi and Moroccan?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Participating teams employed diverse approaches (ensemble fine-tuning, LLM prompting, hybrid methods), but the paper does not analyze which strategies generalize better to unseen dialects or low-resource conditions.
- **Why unresolved:** Only two dialects were evaluated, and no cross-dialect transfer experiments were conducted. It remains unclear whether dialect-specific models (DarijaBERT, SaudiBERT) outperform general Arabic models on held-out dialects.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic evaluation of top-performing systems on additional Arabic dialects (e.g., Egyptian, Levantine, Gulf) not seen during training, measuring performance degradation and identifying which modeling choices enable cross-dialect transfer.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Can aspect-based sentiment analysis improve upon the document-level classification in dialectal Arabic hospitality reviews?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion explicitly identifies "aspect-based sentiment analysis or emotion detection" as promising future task extensions, noting the current task focused only on document-level sentiment.
- **Why unresolved:** The shared task was limited to three-way sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative) without aspect extraction or fine-grained opinion targeting.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Extending the dataset with aspect-level annotations (e.g., service, cleanliness, location) and evaluating whether aspect-based models capture sentiment nuances missed by document-level classifiers.

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (860 training examples) may limit model robustness and generalization
- Evaluation restricted to only Saudi and Moroccan dialects in hospitality context
- No formal ablation studies to validate whether ensemble gains stem from complementary dialect knowledge versus variance reduction

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Dialect-specific models outperform MSA-centric approaches; ensemble logit averaging improves F1; fine-tuning pre-trained Arabic BERT variants is dominant successful strategy
- **Medium confidence**: Data augmentation meaningfully improves performance; LLM prompting underperforms fine-tuning due to neutral class difficulties
- **Low confidence**: Claims about complementary dialect knowledge in pre-training corpora driving ensemble gains; generalization to unseen dialects and domains

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate per-dialect F1 scores on the test set to quantify cross-dialect transfer and identify potential dialect confusion patterns
2. Conduct ablation experiments comparing dialect-specific fine-tuning versus MSA baseline to measure absolute dialect adaptation gains
3. Measure sentiment polarity preservation in augmented data through manual validation of a sample of paraphrased examples
