# SurvDiff: A Diffusion Model for Generating Synthetic Data in Survival Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.22352
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22352
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** SurvDiff is a novel diffusion model for generating synthetic survival data, addressing the challenge of preserving both the time-to-event distribution and censoring mechanism. Unlike existing methods, SurvDiff jointly generates mixed-type covariates, event times, and censoring indicators in an end-to-end manner, guided by a survival-tailored loss function. This loss encodes the time-to-event structure and optimizes for downstream survival tasks, ensuring realistic event-time distributions and preserved censoring mechanisms. Across multiple medical datasets, SurvDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in distributional fidelity and downstream survival analysis metrics. Notably, it achieves large improvements over the main baseline SurvivalGAN, especially on datasets with stronger censoring. Ablation studies confirm the benefit of the sparsity-aware weighting scheme and demonstrate robustness to parameter choices. Overall, SurvDiff is the first diffusion model explicitly designed for synthetic survival data, offering superior performance in preserving covariate fidelity and time-to-event dynamics.

## Executive Summary
SurvDiff is a novel diffusion model designed specifically for generating synthetic survival data that preserves both the time-to-event distribution and censoring mechanism. Unlike existing methods that rely on staged pipelines with different models for covariates and event-time mechanisms, SurvDiff jointly generates mixed-type covariates, event times, and censoring indicators in an end-to-end manner. The model is guided by a survival-tailored loss function that encodes the time-to-event structure and optimizes for downstream survival tasks. Across multiple medical datasets, SurvDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in distributional fidelity and downstream survival analysis metrics.

## Method Summary
SurvDiff combines Gaussian diffusion for continuous variables (X^cont, T) and masked diffusion for discrete variables (X^disc, E) in a unified framework. The model uses a Transformer+MLP denoiser with a survival head that computes risk scores. The total loss combines diffusion losses (L_cont, L_disc) with a survival loss (L_surv) based on the Cox partial likelihood with sparsity-aware weighting. The model is trained end-to-end to generate realistic survival data that preserves both the time-to-event distribution and censoring mechanism, optimized for downstream survival analysis tasks.

## Key Results
- Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines (SurvivalGAN, TabDiff) in distributional fidelity metrics (JS distance, Wasserstein distance)
- Achieves large improvements over SurvivalGAN especially on datasets with stronger censoring (AIDS with 91.7% censoring)
- Ablation studies confirm the benefit of the sparsity-aware weighting scheme for stabilizing training
- Demonstrates superior performance in preserving covariate fidelity and time-to-event dynamics across multiple medical datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: End-to-End Joint Generation
The diffusion process treats all variables (continuous covariates, discrete covariates, event time T, event indicator E) as a unified tuple that is corrupted and reconstructed together. The survival-tailored loss provides supervision on the reconstructed covariates to ensure they produce coherent survival outcomes. This avoids error propagation from staged pipelines where separate models generate covariates and event times independently.

### Mechanism 2: Sparsity-Aware Survival Loss
The survival loss extends Cox partial likelihood with importance weights w_i. For events occurring after a threshold τ (e.g., 80th percentile of observed times), weights decay exponentially as w_i = exp(-α(t_i - τ)). This reduces gradient instability from rare long-duration events while preserving the partial-likelihood structure.

### Mechanism 3: Dual Diffusion Processes for Mixed-Type Data
Separate noising schemes for continuous and discrete variables enable faithful reconstruction of heterogeneous clinical data. Continuous covariates and event time use Gaussian (variance-exploding) diffusion; discrete covariates and the binary event indicator use masked diffusion where values are progressively replaced with a mask token.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cox Proportional Hazards and Partial Likelihood**
  - **Why needed here:** The survival loss in SurvDiff is built on the Cox partial log-likelihood; understanding risk sets and hazard ratios is essential to interpret why the loss works.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why only uncensored events contribute to the numerator of the Cox partial likelihood, while censored observations appear only in the denominator's risk set?

- **Concept: Diffusion Models (Forward/Reverse Process)**
  - **Why needed here:** SurvDiff is fundamentally a diffusion model; understanding score matching, noise schedules, and the reverse denoising process is prerequisite to following the method.
  - **Quick check question:** In variance-exploding SDEs, what happens to the data distribution as the diffusion time u → 1, and how does the reverse process recover it?

- **Concept: Right-Censoring in Survival Data**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire motivation for SurvDiff hinges on preserving censoring mechanisms; understanding why censoring creates sparsity and biases estimation is critical.
  - **Quick check question:** If 90% of patients are censored before the event, what challenges does this create for learning event-time distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Forward diffusion: Corrupts (x_cont, t) via Gaussian SDE and (x_disc, e) via masking process
  - Denoising network: Transformer + MLP backbone predicts clean values from noisy inputs
  - Survival head: MLP that maps denoised covariates to scalar risk scores
  - Loss combiner: Aggregates L_cont, L_disc (diffusion) and L_surv (survival) with adaptive weighting λ_surv

- **Critical path:**
  1. Sample noise level u ~ U(0,1)
  2. Apply forward corruption to batch
  3. Pass noisy inputs through denoising network
  4. Compute diffusion losses L_cont, L_disc
  5. Pass denoised covariates through survival head
  6. Compute L_surv with sparsity-aware weights
  7. Combine losses with calibrated λ_surv (adaptive scaling during warmup)
  8. Backprop and update

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Higher α_surv (survival loss weight fraction): Stronger survival fidelity but risk of sacrificing covariate reconstruction
  - Larger τ threshold: More events get full weight; may increase gradient instability from late events
  - More sampling steps: Higher-quality samples but slower generation
  - Assumption: The paper uses adaptive λ_surv calibration (Eq. 11) rather than manual tuning

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Mode collapse in categorical variables: Check if discrete covariates collapse to majority class; suggests masking diffusion not learning properly
  - Degenerate event-time distribution: If all synthetic events cluster at a single time, survival loss may be dominating too strongly
  - C-Index near 0.5 on synthetic→real evaluation: Indicates covariate-event relationship not preserved; check survival head gradient flow
  - Training instability after warmup: May indicate λ_surv scaling is too aggressive

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce baseline comparison on GBSG2: Train SurvDiff and TabDiff on GBSG2, compute JS distance, Wasserstein distance, and C-Index. Verify that joint training outperforms naive tabular diffusion.
  2. Ablate sparsity weighting: Run SurvDiff with w=1 (uniform) vs. w* (sparsity-aware) on a dataset with high censoring (e.g., AIDS with 91.7% censoring). Compare C-Index and Brier Score.
  3. Visualize temporal fidelity: Generate synthetic samples and plot time-to-event and time-to-censoring distributions against real data. Check if censoring mechanism is preserved, not just event times.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can SurvDiff be extended to generate synthetic data for survival settings involving competing risks, rather than a single event type?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 3.1 states, "For simplicity, we assume that death is the event of interest," and defines the event indicator $E$ as binary $\{0, 1\}$.
- **Why unresolved:** The current model architecture and survival loss function (Eq. 8) are designed for a single event type, lacking the necessary output nodes or loss terms to model cause-specific hazards.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modification of the survival head and loss function to handle multi-class event types, evaluated on a competing risks dataset (e.g., SEER) using Cumulative Incidence Functions (CIF).

### Open Question 2
Does the reliance on a Cox proportional hazards-based loss function restrict the model's ability to reproduce data distributions that violate the proportional hazards assumption?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 4.3 notes, "Our survival loss extends the Cox partial negative log-likelihood... which models the event risk proportional to a baseline hazard."
- **Why unresolved:** Optimizing specifically for a Cox likelihood might bias the generator towards creating synthetic data that conform to PH assumptions, potentially failing to capture complex, time-varying effects present in the original data.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking SurvDiff on datasets with known non-proportional hazards (e.g., including time-varying coefficients) and measuring the recovery of those non-linearities using non-parametric metrics.

### Open Question 3
Can the SurvDiff framework be adapted to handle complex censoring mechanisms beyond right-censoring, such as interval censoring?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 1 defines the challenge as handling "right-censoring" and does not model the censoring time distribution separately from the event time.
- **Why unresolved:** The current formulation relies on a standard setup where $T$ is the minimum of event and censoring times, which is specific to right-censoring and does not account for uncertainty in the exact event time found in interval censoring.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Reformulating the diffusion objective to handle likelihoods over time intervals and testing on interval-censored datasets.

## Limitations
- The sparsity-aware weighting scheme's hyperparameters (τ threshold and decay rate α) may require dataset-specific tuning; while ablation shows benefit, optimal values across diverse censoring patterns remain unclear
- The joint diffusion framework assumes the covariate-survival relationship can be captured without explicit time-dependent effects; datasets with complex time-varying hazards may challenge this assumption
- Limited ablation on architectural choices (Transformer depth, sampling steps) means robustness across different survival task scales hasn't been fully characterized

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in core survival-tailored loss design and its benefit for downstream analysis metrics (C-index, Brier Score improvements are consistently reported across datasets)
- **Medium confidence** in joint generation mechanism's superiority over staged pipelines, as evidence is primarily comparative rather than mechanistic
- **Medium confidence** in dual diffusion process handling of mixed data types, as visualizations support fidelity claims but no quantitative mixed-type reconstruction metrics are provided

## Next Checks
1. Test SurvDiff on a dataset with strong time-varying effects (e.g., simulated data with non-proportional hazards) to evaluate whether joint diffusion can capture complex covariate-survival dynamics
2. Conduct systematic hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for the sparsity weighting parameters τ and α across datasets with varying censoring patterns
3. Implement and compare against a staged pipeline baseline where covariates and survival outcomes are generated separately to quantify error propagation benefits quantitatively
