# BoRP: Bootstrapped Regression Probing for Scalable and Human-Aligned LLM Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.18253
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18253
- Authors: Peng Sun; Xiangyu Zhang; Duan Wu
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves expert-level LLM satisfaction evaluation with 0.796 K-alpha and 0.806 Pearson correlation while reducing costs by 169× compared to GPT-4

## Executive Summary
BoRP introduces a geometry-aware regression probing framework that achieves expert-level fidelity in LLM satisfaction evaluation without human intervention. By reframing evaluation as a regression task within the latent space using Partial Least Squares (PLS) and automating rubric generation through polarization mining, BoRP achieves superior performance compared to generative baselines including GPT-4. The framework employs a polarization-index-based bootstrapping mechanism to extract extreme samples and map hidden states to continuous scores, enabling industrial-scale throughput of approximately 1.4M sessions/day.

The system demonstrates superior sensitivity in A/B testing via CUPED, effectively guiding rapid product iteration while maintaining expert-level alignment with human judgments. By leveraging suffix-only probing and KV-cache reuse, BoRP achieves dramatic cost reductions (169×) while maintaining high correlation with expert evaluations (Krippendorff's alpha 0.796, Pearson 0.806) on proprietary industrial datasets.

## Method Summary
BoRP reframes LLM evaluation from a classification problem to a regression task within the latent space of hidden representations. The framework uses Partial Least Squares regression to map decoder-only transformer hidden states to continuous satisfaction scores, addressing the limitations of traditional generative evaluation approaches. A key innovation is the polarization-index-based bootstrapping mechanism that automatically extracts extreme samples from the latent space to create evaluation rubrics without human intervention. The system employs suffix-only probing and KV-cache reuse for high-throughput inference, achieving industrial-scale evaluation capacity while maintaining expert-level alignment with human judgments through geometric mapping of hidden states to satisfaction scores.

## Key Results
- Achieves Krippendorff's alpha of 0.796 and Pearson correlation of 0.806 with expert evaluations
- Reduces evaluation costs by 169× compared to GPT-4 while maintaining expert-level fidelity
- Enables industrial-scale throughput of approximately 1.4M evaluation sessions per day
- Demonstrates superior sensitivity in A/B testing through CUPED methodology

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BoRP works by treating LLM evaluation as a regression problem in the latent space rather than a classification or generative task. The PLS regression approach captures linear relationships between decoder hidden states and satisfaction scores, while the polarization mining mechanism automatically identifies extreme cases that define evaluation boundaries. The suffix-only probing and KV-cache reuse optimize inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, and the CUPED integration enables more sensitive statistical comparisons between model variants.

## Foundational Learning

**Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression**
*Why needed:* Captures linear relationships between high-dimensional latent representations and continuous satisfaction scores
*Quick check:* Verify PLS assumptions hold by examining residual plots and cross-validation performance

**Polarization Mining and Bootstrapping**
*Why needed:* Automatically extracts extreme evaluation cases to define rubric boundaries without human intervention
*Quick check:* Confirm extracted samples represent true performance extremes through manual verification of top/bottom percentiles

**KV-Cache Reuse Optimization**
*Why needed:* Enables efficient inference by reusing computed key-value states across multiple evaluation queries
*Quick check:* Measure cache hit rates and compare inference times with and without cache reuse

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Collection -> Polarization Mining -> PLS Regression Training -> Suffix-Only Probing -> KV-Cache Optimization -> Evaluation Output

**Critical Path:** The evaluation pipeline flows from data collection through polarization mining to extract extreme cases, then trains PLS regression on these samples, and finally applies suffix-only probing with cache optimization for inference.

**Design Tradeoffs:** 
- Regression vs. classification: Regression captures nuance but requires more complex optimization
- PLS vs. other regression methods: PLS handles multicollinearity in high-dimensional spaces but assumes linear relationships
- Automated vs. human rubrics: Automation enables scale but may miss subtle evaluation criteria

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor correlation with human judgments indicates PLS model misalignment
- High variance in evaluations suggests insufficient extreme sample extraction
- Low throughput indicates cache optimization inefficiencies

**First Experiments:**
1. Measure baseline correlation between PLS predictions and human judgments on validation set
2. Compare inference latency with and without KV-cache reuse across different batch sizes
3. Evaluate sensitivity of A/B testing results using CUPED vs. traditional statistical methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on proprietary industrial datasets that cannot be independently verified
- Performance on highly subjective or nuanced evaluation criteria remains untested
- The framework assumes linear relationships between latent representations and satisfaction scores

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Industrial throughput claims (1.4M sessions/day), cost reduction calculations (169×), and CUPED-based A/B testing sensitivity improvements

**Medium Confidence:** Correlation metrics with expert evaluations, rubric mining effectiveness, and overall evaluation fidelity claims

**Low Confidence:** Generalization to non-industrial datasets, performance on subjective evaluation criteria, and long-term stability as LLM capabilities evolve

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain validation using publicly available datasets (e.g., HELM, Eleuther's evaluation suites) to assess generalizability beyond proprietary industrial data
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the impact of PLS regression vs. alternative approaches and the polarization mining mechanism vs. baseline rubric generation
3. Implement temporal validation tracking performance degradation or improvement over multiple LLM model updates and version changes
