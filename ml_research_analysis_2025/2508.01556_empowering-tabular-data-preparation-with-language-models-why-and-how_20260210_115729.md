# Empowering Tabular Data Preparation with Language Models: Why and How?
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.01556
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01556
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive survey of LLM applications in tabular data preparation across four phases: acquisition, integration, cleaning, and transformation

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a systematic survey of large language models (LLMs) for tabular data preparation tasks, addressing a critical gap in understanding how these models can be effectively applied across the data preparation workflow. The authors analyze why LLMs are suitable for different tabular data preparation tasks by matching their inherent capabilities to specific task demands, and examine how to use them effectively through two main strategy categories: LM-centric approaches (prompt engineering and fine-tuning) and LM-in-the-loop strategies (LM-as-encoder and LM-as-decoder). The survey comprehensively reviews existing approaches for each of the four core phases of tabular data preparation, highlights key advancements in the field, and outlines important future research directions.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a comprehensive survey methodology, systematically analyzing LLM applications in tabular data preparation by categorizing approaches into four distinct phases of the data preparation pipeline. The authors examine the fundamental capabilities of LLMs and match these to the specific demands of each task, providing theoretical justification for why LLMs are effective in certain contexts. They classify the utilization strategies into two broad categories - LM-centric approaches that use LLMs as standalone tools through prompt engineering or fine-tuning, and LM-in-the-loop strategies that integrate LLMs within broader data processing pipelines as either encoders or decoders. The survey methodology involves extensive review of existing literature and approaches, with careful categorization and analysis of the strengths and limitations of different implementation strategies.

## Key Results
- The survey identifies four core phases of tabular data preparation (acquisition, integration, cleaning, transformation) where LLMs can be applied
- Two main categories of LLM utilization strategies are identified: LM-centric (prompt engineering, fine-tuning) and LM-in-the-loop (LM-as-encoder, LM-as-decoder)
- The analysis reveals that LLMs' capabilities in pattern recognition, contextual understanding, and handling unstructured data make them particularly suitable for certain data preparation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LLMs work effectively for tabular data preparation because their fundamental capabilities align well with the core demands of data preparation tasks. Their pattern recognition abilities enable them to identify inconsistencies, outliers, and structural issues in tabular data. Their contextual understanding allows them to interpret relationships between columns, infer missing values based on surrounding data, and understand domain-specific semantics. Additionally, LLMs excel at handling unstructured data and can process natural language descriptions of data cleaning rules or transformation requirements. The flexibility of LLMs to be adapted through prompt engineering or fine-tuning allows them to be customized for specific tabular data domains and requirements.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tabular Data Preparation Phases**: Understanding the four-phase framework (acquisition, integration, cleaning, transformation) is essential for identifying where LLMs can provide value in the data pipeline. Why needed: Provides structured approach to analyzing LLM applications. Quick check: Map specific LLM approaches to each phase in existing literature.
- **Prompt Engineering**: The technique of crafting specific inputs to guide LLM outputs for tabular tasks. Why needed: Core LM-centric strategy for adapting LLMs without retraining. Quick check: Test different prompt structures on sample tabular data cleaning tasks.
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapting pre-trained LLMs to specific tabular data domains by continuing training on domain-specific datasets. Why needed: Enables specialized performance for particular data preparation tasks. Quick check: Compare fine-tuned vs. prompt-engineered approaches on same task.
- **LM-as-encoder Strategy**: Using LLMs to convert tabular data into meaningful representations for downstream processing. Why needed: Enables integration of LLMs into traditional data processing pipelines. Quick check: Evaluate representation quality against traditional encoding methods.
- **LM-as-decoder Strategy**: Employing LLMs to generate outputs or transformations based on tabular inputs. Why needed: Leverages LLMs' generation capabilities for data transformation tasks. Quick check: Test decoding accuracy on various tabular transformation scenarios.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data Acquisition -> LM Integration -> Data Integration -> Data Cleaning -> Data Transformation -> Processed Data Output
Critical path: The most critical path involves the LM-in-the-loop strategies where LLMs serve as either encoders or decoders within the data processing pipeline, enabling seamless integration with existing tools while leveraging LLM capabilities.
Design tradeoffs: LM-centric approaches offer simplicity and quick deployment but may lack domain-specific optimization, while LM-in-the-loop strategies provide deeper integration but require more complex implementation and potential performance overhead.
Failure signatures: Common failures include hallucination in generated data, difficulty handling extremely large tables, context window limitations, and performance degradation with highly specialized or domain-specific terminology.
First experiments:
1. Implement prompt engineering for a simple data cleaning task (e.g., identifying and correcting inconsistent date formats)
2. Test LM-as-encoder approach by converting tabular data to embeddings and comparing with traditional encoding methods
3. Evaluate LM-as-decoder for data transformation by having the LLM generate SQL queries from natural language descriptions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions including how to effectively scale LLM-based approaches to handle extremely large tabular datasets, what the optimal balance is between LM-centric and LM-in-the-loop strategies for different task types, how to mitigate hallucination risks in critical data preparation tasks, and what the long-term implications are of relying on black-box models for fundamental data preparation workflows. The authors also question how to best evaluate the performance of LLM-based approaches against traditional methods in real-world scenarios.

## Limitations
- The survey's comprehensiveness is limited by the rapid evolution of LLM applications in tabular data preparation, potentially missing recent developments
- The categorization of LM-centric versus LM-in-the-loop strategies may oversimplify the spectrum of hybrid approaches emerging in practice
- The analysis of why LLMs suit specific tasks relies on general capability assessments rather than empirical validation across diverse real-world datasets

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The four-phase framework for tabular data preparation is well-established and the categorization of LLM approaches into LM-centric and LM-in-the-loop strategies is methodologically sound
- **Medium confidence:** The analysis of LLM capabilities matching task demands is reasonable but may benefit from more systematic empirical evaluation across varied domains
- **Medium confidence:** The future research directions are well-grounded but some predictions may be influenced by current trends rather than long-term viability

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic benchmarking of the same tabular data preparation tasks using both traditional methods and LLM-based approaches across multiple domains and dataset sizes to quantify performance differences
2. Implement controlled experiments comparing different prompt engineering strategies and fine-tuning approaches for specific data preparation tasks to identify best practices
3. Survey practitioners using LLMs for tabular data preparation to validate the practical challenges and advantages identified in the theoretical analysis, particularly regarding implementation complexity and real-world constraints
