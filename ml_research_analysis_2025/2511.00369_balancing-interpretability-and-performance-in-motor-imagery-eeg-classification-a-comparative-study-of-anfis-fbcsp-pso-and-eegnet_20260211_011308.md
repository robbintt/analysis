# Balancing Interpretability and Performance in Motor Imagery EEG Classification: A Comparative Study of ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO and EEGNet

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.00369
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00369
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO achieves 68.58% ± 13.76% accuracy with superior interpretability for within-subject BCI classification

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the fundamental trade-off between interpretability and performance in motor imagery (MI) EEG classification for brain-computer interfaces. The authors compare a bio-inspired interpretable model (ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO) with a deep learning benchmark (EEGNet) on the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset. While both models achieve similar overall accuracy (~68%), ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO demonstrates superior within-subject performance and provides interpretable fuzzy inference rules, whereas EEGNet shows stronger cross-subject generalization. This work provides practical guidance for selecting BCI models based on whether personalized explainable systems or robust user-independent performance is prioritized.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates two distinct approaches for MI EEG classification. The ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO model combines filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) for feature extraction with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) optimized via particle swarm optimization (PSO). This approach produces interpretable fuzzy rules that describe the relationship between extracted features and motor imagery classes. The benchmark EEGNet model uses deep learning with depthwise and separable convolutions to automatically learn spatial-temporal patterns from raw EEG signals. Both models are evaluated using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset, with experiments conducted for both within-subject (training and testing on same subjects) and cross-subject (training on multiple subjects, testing on others) scenarios. Performance is measured using classification accuracy and Cohen's Kappa coefficient to account for class imbalance.

## Key Results
- ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO achieved 68.58% ± 13.76% accuracy and Cohen's Kappa of 58.04% ± 18.43 in within-subject experiments
- EEGNet demonstrated stronger cross-subject generalization with 68.20% ± 12.13% accuracy and Kappa of 57.33% ± 16.22
- Both models show comparable overall performance, but with different strengths: interpretability and personalization vs. generalization and automation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO model leverages the interpretability of fuzzy logic systems combined with optimized feature extraction. FBCSP identifies discriminative frequency bands and spatial filters that maximize class separability, while ANFIS creates interpretable if-then rules that map these features to motor imagery classes. PSO optimizes the fuzzy system parameters to improve classification performance. In contrast, EEGNet's deep learning architecture automatically learns hierarchical spatial-temporal features from raw EEG data without requiring manual feature engineering, enabling it to capture complex patterns that may not be easily interpretable but generalize well across subjects.

## Foundational Learning
- **Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP)**: Needed to extract discriminative spatial and spectral features from multi-channel EEG signals; quick check: verifies frequency band selection maximizes class separability
- **Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)**: Needed to create interpretable decision rules from extracted features; quick check: validates fuzzy rule structure represents meaningful neurophysiological patterns
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: Needed to optimize fuzzy system parameters for improved classification; quick check: confirms convergence to optimal parameter values within reasonable iterations
- **Cohen's Kappa Coefficient**: Needed to measure classification performance while accounting for class imbalance; quick check: values closer to 1 indicate better agreement beyond chance
- **Cross-subject generalization**: Needed to evaluate model robustness across different users; quick check: assesses whether model trained on one population performs well on new subjects
- **Within-subject personalization**: Needed to evaluate model performance for individual users; quick check: measures adaptation capability to individual neurophysiological patterns

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Raw EEG -> FBCSP (Feature Extraction) -> ANFIS-Fuzzy Rules -> Classification (ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO) OR Raw EEG -> Convolutional Layers -> Classification (EEGNet)

**Critical Path**: For ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO: EEG signal acquisition → FBCSP feature extraction → PSO-optimized ANFIS training → Fuzzy rule application for classification. For EEGNet: EEG signal acquisition → Convolutional feature learning → Classification through learned representations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO prioritizes interpretability and biological plausibility but requires careful feature engineering and parameter optimization; EEGNet automates feature learning but produces "black box" decisions that are difficult to interpret clinically.

**Failure Signatures**: ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO may fail when extracted features don't capture task-relevant information or when fuzzy rules become overly complex; EEGNet may fail due to overfitting on small datasets or poor generalization to subjects with different neurophysiological patterns.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO on additional MI datasets to verify feature extraction robustness; 2) Apply EEGNet to datasets with different channel configurations to assess architectural adaptability; 3) Compare inference times and computational requirements for both models on identical hardware platforms.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several limitations and open questions regarding the generalizability of findings beyond the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset, the lack of evaluation on real-time BCI applications, and the absence of empirical validation for the claimed interpretability benefits. The authors acknowledge that computational complexity differences between the models were not reported, which are critical factors for practical deployment.

## Limitations
- Results are limited to BCI Competition IV-2a dataset without validation on additional MI datasets
- No evaluation of real-time BCI performance or computational requirements
- Interpretability claims are asserted rather than empirically validated through user studies or expert evaluations
- Limited analysis of model robustness to noise and non-stationarity in EEG signals

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Within-subject experimental design and statistical significance testing methodology
- **Medium confidence**: Relative performance comparison between the two models on the tested dataset
- **Low confidence**: Claims about practical interpretability benefits and real-world applicability

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate both models on at least two additional publicly available MI EEG datasets to assess cross-dataset generalization
2. Conduct a user study with neuroscientists or BCI practitioners to validate the interpretability of ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO fuzzy rules
3. Measure and compare computational requirements (training time, inference latency, memory usage) for both approaches under identical hardware conditions
