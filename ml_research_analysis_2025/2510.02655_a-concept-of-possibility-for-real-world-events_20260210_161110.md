# A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Introduces an objective method for computing possibility degrees for real-world events using Łukasiewicz logic on prerequisite and constraint probabilities

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a new framework for computing possibility degrees for real-world events based on the probabilities of enabling prerequisites and impeding constraints. Unlike traditional Zadeh possibility theory which is subjective, this approach provides an objective method using statistical sampling where possible. The framework adopts Łukasiewicz logic, combining prerequisites with min (AND) and alternatives with max (OR) operators. The paper formalizes the theory, proves conditions for equivalent contexts, and demonstrates through a vehicle navigation example how possibility theory better captures real-world feasibility than probability theory.

## Method Summary
The method computes possibility degrees by first identifying prerequisites (enabling conditions) and constraints (impeding conditions) for target events. Each atomic contextual construct receives a probability value through statistical sampling or expert judgment. A complete contextual construct combines these using Łukasiewicz logic operators: min for conjunction (AND), max for disjunction (OR), and 1− for negation. The possibility of an event equals the valuation of its complete contextual construct. The framework also addresses complex events through logical inference rather than causal conditioning, using possibilistic Modus Ponens operators.

## Key Results
- Provides an objective alternative to subjective Zadeh possibility theory using statistical probabilities
- Demonstrates that logically equivalent contexts in classical propositional calculus may yield different possibility degrees unless they are "strongly equivalent"
- Shows through vehicle navigation example that possibility theory better models real-world feasibility than probability multiplication
- Establishes that possibility theory measures "ease of occurrence" while probability theory measures "likelihood of occurrence"

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Possibility degrees can be computed objectively from prerequisite and constraint probabilities using Łukasiewicz logic operators
- Mechanism: Event E has prerequisites (enablers) and constraints (impediments). Prerequisites combine with AND (min), alternatives with OR (max), and negation uses 1−. The complete contextual construct C evaluates to Poss(E) = v(C).
- Core assumption: Atomic contextual constructs are statistically independent
- Evidence: Formalization in Section 3 uses min/max/1− for ∧/∨/¬; assumes independence

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Logically equivalent contexts may evaluate differently; only "strongly equivalent" contexts guarantee identical results
- Mechanism: Two contexts are strongly equivalent if their disjunctive normal forms can be converted using only Commutative and Associative laws
- Core assumption: The conv algorithm correctly produces DNFs; Łukasiewicz logic validates Distributive, Commutative, and Associative laws
- Evidence: Kreinovich and Scott examples show p∨¬p and q∨¬q evaluate differently despite both being classical tautologies

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Complex events propagate possibility through logical inference rather than causal conditioning
- Mechanism: If E depends on Boolean combination E' of precursors, compute Poss(E') using min/max on Poss(Eᵢ), then apply possibilistic Modus Ponens operator
- Core assumption: The inference E'→E is true (implication value = 1)
- Evidence: Nine Modus Ponens variants cited from Dubois & Prade; choice affects whether possibility degrades along inference chains

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Łukasiewicz infinite-valued logic (ℵ₁)
  - Why needed: Mathematical foundation for combining multivalent reasoning with min/max/1− operators
  - Quick check: Given v(p)=0.4 and v(q)=0.8, compute v(p∧q), v(p∨q), v(¬p), and explain why v(p∨¬p)≠1

- Concept: Possibility vs. probability (Zadeh's distinction)
  - Why needed: Framework's entire motivation rests on this distinction—possibility measures "ease" while probability measures "likelihood"
  - Quick check: In vehicle navigation, why does multiplying all leg probabilities produce unrealistically low values while taking min does not?

- Concept: Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) conversion
  - Why needed: Determining strong equivalence requires converting to DNF; implementing conv algorithm is necessary for automated context comparison
  - Quick check: Convert (p∧q)∨(p∧r) to DNF and explain why this differs from p∧(q∨r) in Łukasiewicz logic

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input Layer -> Probability Estimation Module -> Context Builder -> Possibility Valuation Engine -> Equivalence Checker -> Decision Layer

- Critical path:
  1. Identify all prerequisites and constraints for target event
  2. Obtain or estimate probabilities for each atomic construct
  3. Build complete contextual construct(s) representing domain logic
  4. Verify all comparison contexts are strongly equivalent (same DNF structure)
  5. Evaluate Poss(E) = v(C) for each alternative
  6. Select alternative with maximum Poss value

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Objective vs. subjective probabilities: Statistical sampling requires data; subjective estimates are faster
  - Choice of implication operator: Łukasiewicz preserves values; alternatives may model degradation
  - Granularity of prerequisites/constraints: Finer decomposition enables precision but increases complexity
  - Independence assumption: Modeling correlations would improve accuracy but requires substantial additional data

- Failure signatures:
  - Impossibly low values: Check whether probability-style multiplication was used instead of min
  - Inconsistent comparisons: Contexts may not be strongly equivalent; check DNF conversion
  - Rapid degradation to 0.5: Implication operator may be inappropriate; consider Łukasiewicz implication
  - All alternatives identical: Check that constraints are properly negated (use 1−Prob(c))

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement vehicle waypoint navigation example exactly as specified; verify min-based combination produces plausible path rankings vs. probability-style multiplication
  2. Test strong equivalence: Create two classically-equivalent but not strongly-equivalent contexts and confirm they evaluate differently; convert to DNF and verify only strong equivalence produces matching values
  3. Build simple planning scenario (robot task with 3-4 prerequisites, 2 constraints, 2 alternative paths); assign probabilities; verify system correctly identifies more feasible path and explain to domain expert for face validity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Does the proposed possibility model accurately capture natural human reasoning about planning better than standard probability theory?
  - Basis: Section 8 states it "may be conjectured that the version of possibility presented... provides a more intuitively compelling model" but requires cognitive science experiments
  - Why unresolved: Provides mathematical formalism but no empirical psychological data
  - What evidence would resolve it: Cognitive science experiments comparing human feasibility assessments against Łukasiewicz-based model versus probabilistic multiplication models

- How can the theory be generalized to accommodate statistically dependent prerequisites and constraints?
  - Basis: Section 3 explicitly states limitation: "it is assumed that the atomic contextual constructs are statistically independent"
  - Why unresolved: Real-world events often feature correlated factors that current formalism excludes
  - What evidence would resolve it: Extension of valuation function that incorporates covariance without collapsing back into standard probability theory

- Which inference operator (Modus Ponens variant) is optimal for maintaining valid possibility degrees in long chains of complex events?
  - Basis: Section 6 notes that while Łukasiewicz operator preserves values, other versions "may degrade... depends on preferences of the user"
  - Why unresolved: Acknowledges multiple operators but lacks framework for selecting correct one to prevent unintended value degradation
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of various t-norms and implication operators applied to complex planning networks

## Limitations
- Framework relies heavily on independence assumption for atomic contextual constructs; real-world prerequisites and constraints often exhibit correlations
- No empirical validation datasets provided; all examples are synthetic with arbitrary probability assignments
- Strong equivalence criterion lacks practical implementation details for automated DNF conversion and verification

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Theoretical foundation of Łukasiewicz logic operators is mathematically sound and well-established
- Medium Confidence: Vehicle navigation example demonstrates practical application but arbitrary probability assignments limit generalizability
- Low Confidence: Strong equivalence concept is theoretically valid but lacks practical validation and clear implementation guidance

## Next Checks
1. Implement the strong equivalence checker and verify that classically-equivalent but not strongly-equivalent contexts produce different possibility values using the Kreinovich examples
2. Develop a small-scale real-world planning scenario with actual data collection to estimate prerequisite and constraint probabilities, then compare possibility-based rankings against expert judgment
3. Test the framework's sensitivity to correlated prerequisites by constructing scenarios where min/max combination produces counterintuitive results compared to probability-based approaches
