# Enhanced Hybrid Transducer and Attention Encoder Decoder with Text Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.19159
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19159
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: J-TAED reduces WER by 5.8-12.8% on Librispeech and achieves 15.3-17.8% WER reduction on domain adaptation tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Joint Speech Text TAED (J-TAED), a method that integrates large text corpora into end-to-end automatic speech recognition models through joint optimization of text and speech input modalities. The approach employs a multimodality encoder to unify internal representations from different modalities, enabling text-based domain adaptation without requiring speech data. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in WER across standard and domain-specific datasets, addressing the challenge of leveraging abundant text resources in ASR training.

## Method Summary
The proposed J-TAED method jointly optimizes text and speech input modalities during training using a multimodality encoder that unifies internal representations from different sources. This architecture enables text-based domain adaptation for out-of-domain tasks without requiring speech data. The model integrates large text corpora with speech data to enhance ASR accuracy, with particular focus on reducing word error rates through multimodal learning.

## Key Results
- J-TAED reduces word error rate by 5.8-12.8% on the Librispeech dataset
- Text-based domain adaptation achieves 15.3% WER reduction on finance datasets
- Text-based domain adaptation achieves 17.8% WER reduction on named entity focused datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multimodality encoder serves as the core mechanism by unifying internal representations from speech and text modalities during joint training. This unified representation space allows the model to leverage abundant text data to improve speech recognition performance. The text-only domain adaptation capability works because the joint training creates a shared semantic space where text patterns learned from large corpora can be effectively applied to speech recognition tasks without requiring domain-specific speech data.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Multimodal representation learning** - Why needed: To effectively combine information from speech and text modalities; Quick check: Verify that the encoder produces meaningful joint representations
2. **Domain adaptation without target data** - Why needed: To apply knowledge from text corpora to speech tasks in new domains; Quick check: Confirm that text-only adaptation maintains general ASR performance
3. **Joint optimization of heterogeneous data** - Why needed: To leverage the complementary strengths of speech and text data sources; Quick check: Ensure balanced contribution from both modalities during training
4. **End-to-end ASR architecture** - Why needed: To enable seamless integration of text and speech processing; Quick check: Verify that the model maintains end-to-end differentiability

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Speech Encoder -> Multimodality Encoder -> Decoder -> Text Encoder (parallel path)

**Critical Path:** Speech input → Speech Encoder → Multimodality Encoder → Decoder → Output predictions

**Design Tradeoffs:** Joint training enables text-based adaptation but may create modality imbalance; Parallel text path increases parameter count but enables domain transfer without speech data

**Failure Signatures:** Overfitting to text modality when text data is abundant; Degraded performance on general speech tasks after text-only domain adaptation; Poor generalization to acoustic conditions not represented in training data

**First Experiments:** 1) Train on speech-only baseline to establish performance floor; 2) Add text-only pre-training to measure contribution of text knowledge; 3) Test text-only domain adaptation on held-out domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of ablation studies to isolate contributions of individual architectural components
- Insufficient analysis of modality imbalance when training with abundant text and limited speech data
- Limited experimental scope focused on Librispeech and two specific domain adaptation scenarios without cross-dataset validation

## Confidence
- WER improvements on Librispeech: Medium confidence due to limited ablation analysis
- Text-only domain adaptation capability: Low confidence due to lack of performance maintenance testing on general speech tasks
- Generalizability across languages and acoustic conditions: Low confidence due to narrow experimental validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the multimodality encoder versus other architectural changes to the claimed WER improvements
2. Test model performance degradation when fine-tuned exclusively on text data, particularly on non-domain-specific speech inputs
3. Evaluate model robustness across multiple datasets with varying acoustic conditions, speaker diversity, and noise levels to assess generalizability beyond the Librispeech domain
