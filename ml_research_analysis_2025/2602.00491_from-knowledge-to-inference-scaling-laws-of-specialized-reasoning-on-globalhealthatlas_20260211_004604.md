## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of building large-scale, domain-specific datasets for public health reasoning and developing reliable evaluation frameworks. It introduces GlobalHealthAtlas, a 280,210-instance multilingual dataset spanning 15 domains and 17 languages, constructed via an LLM-assisted pipeline with rigorous quality controls. A domain-specific evaluator is trained on six orthogonal dimensions (Accuracy, Reasoning, Completeness, etc.) to assess outputs. Experiments show that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly improves model performance, with the proposed Public-Model outperforming larger models. The approach advances LLM capabilities for safety-critical public health reasoning.

## Method Summary
The method involves three main components: (1) LLM-assisted dataset construction from WHO IRIS PDFs using a quality gate with weighted scoring (S = 0.45Q + 0.25A + 0.20R + 0.10C, threshold S≥4.5), (2) training a domain-specific evaluator (Public-Evaluator) via LoRA fine-tuning on qwen3-8b using multi-source consensus and six-dimensional scoring, and (3) fine-tuning the Public-Model on 247,599 instances with LoRA, achieving state-of-the-art performance on domain-specific benchmarks. The dataset covers 15 domains, 17 languages, and three difficulty levels (Academic 26.26%, General 69.33%, Popular Science 4.41%).

## Key Results
- GlobalHealthAtlas contains 280,210 instances across 15 domains and 17 languages, with 247,599 for training and 27,511 for testing
- Public-Model (8B) outperforms larger models (qwen3-32b, qwq-32b) on domain-specific benchmarks through fine-tuning
- Public-Evaluator achieves lowest MAE (1.4259) and highest ICC (0.9735) against human experts, with highest Identical Rate (0.5533) in stability tests

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Evidence-grounded data synthesis with threshold-based quality filtering reduces label noise and bounds generalization error.
- Mechanism: Raw PDFs are converted to structured Markdown, segmented into semantic chunks, then processed through a prompt-driven synthesis hub generating QA pairs with CoT reasoning. A quality gate scores candidates across four dimensions using weighted linear combination, retaining only instances with S ≥ 4.5.
- Core assumption: The weighted scoring formula correctly prioritizes structural integrity and factual accuracy as primary validity determinants, and the threshold value of 4.5 optimally balances quality vs. retention.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] describes "LLM-assisted construction and quality control pipeline with retrieval, duplication, evidence grounding checks, and label validation"; [section 3.2.2] specifies "Strict zero-tolerance rules assign a score of 0 for domain irrelevance... only candidates with S ≥ 4.5 are retained"
- Break condition: If validation data shows high label noise despite filtering, the scoring weights or threshold require recalibration.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-dimensional domain-specific evaluator provides more reliable assessment than generic LLM-as-judge approaches.
- Mechanism: A fine-tuned evaluator (Public-Evaluator) is trained on LoRA-adapted qwen3-8b using a three-tier consensus mechanism (cross-scoring between qwen3-Max and deepseek-V3, GPT-5 arbitration, human review for disagreements). Training data includes adversarial perturbations for robustness.
- Core assumption: The six dimensions (Accuracy, Reasoning, Completeness, Consensus Alignment, Terminology Norms, Insightfulness) are genuinely orthogonal and collectively sufficient for public health reasoning assessment.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] states "domain aligned evaluator distilled from high confidence judgments of diverse LLMs to assess outputs along six dimensions"; [section 3.4.4, Table 3] shows Public-Evaluator achieves lowest MAE (1.4259) and highest ICC (0.9735) against human experts
- Break condition: If evaluator scores show low correlation with downstream task performance or clinical expert validation, the dimensional decomposition may be incomplete or overlapping.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Domain-specific fine-tuning with high-quality CoT data enables smaller models to outperform larger general-purpose models on specialized reasoning.
- Mechanism: Supervised fine-tuning with LoRA on 247,599 instances enables the 8B-parameter Public-Model to achieve +0.685 improvement over baseline qwen3-8b, surpassing larger models including qwen3-32b and qwq-32b. The CoT supervision provides reasoning traces that transfer to related medical benchmarks.
- Core assumption: The performance gains derive from domain knowledge absorption rather than memorization, as verified by leakage detection showing <1% suspicious instances.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] notes "fine-tuning on this dataset significantly improves model performance, with the proposed Public-Model outperforming larger models"; [section 4.3, Table 6] shows SFT yields gains across 5/6 benchmarks, with particularly strong improvements for smaller models
- Break condition: If cross-domain transfer performance degrades significantly, the fine-tuning may be introducing harmful source-domain bias.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
  - Why needed here: Both Public-Evaluator and Public-Model use LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Understanding LoRA's rank selection, alpha scaling, and target modules is essential for reproducing results.
  - Quick check question: Given a base model with hidden dimension 4096, what LoRA rank would you select for a domain-specific task with ~250K training examples, and why?

- Concept: Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)
  - Why needed here: ICC is the primary metric for evaluator-human agreement (Table 3). Understanding ICC vs. Pearson correlation vs. Cohen's kappa is necessary to interpret the claim that Public-Evaluator "closely aligns with human experts."
  - Quick check question: Why might ICC be preferred over simple correlation for measuring evaluator agreement with human experts?

- Concept: N-gram Contamination Detection
  - Why needed here: The paper uses continuation-based n-gram matching for leakage detection. Understanding false positive rates in this method is critical for interpreting the claimed minimal memorization risk.
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of n-gram-based leakage detection for CoT reasoning data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: WHO IRIS PDFs → Markdown Parser → Semantic Chunker → Synthesis Hub (QA + CoT generation) → Quality Gate (S ≥ 4.5) → Train/Test Split
- Critical path: Quality Gate threshold calibration (S ≥ 4.5) directly impacts training data composition → Evaluator consensus mechanism determines ground truth labels for evaluator training → Evaluator reliability (ICC ≥ 0.95) is prerequisite for valid benchmark comparisons
- Design tradeoffs: Weighted scoring (0.45Q, 0.25A, 0.20R, 0.10C) prioritizes question structure over answer completeness—may filter valid instances with minor formatting issues; Three-tier consensus (Algorithm 1) requires 2-3 LLM API calls per instance—high cost but reduces human annotation burden; LoRA fine-tuning preserves base model capabilities but may limit domain knowledge absorption compared to full fine-tuning
- Failure signatures: Low ICC (< 0.90) on evaluator validation indicates dimensional scoring rubric misalignment with expert judgment; High variance across repeated inference runs (StdDev > 0.5) suggests evaluator instability; Negative transfer on cross-domain benchmarks (e.g., MMLU-pro degradation) indicates overfitting to source domain
- First 3 experiments: (1) Reproduce evaluator ICC on held-out human-annotated sample (n=100) to validate scoring rubric implementation; (2) Run ablation on quality gate threshold (4.0, 4.5, 5.0) with fixed model architecture to measure data quality vs. quantity tradeoff; (3) Conduct leakage detection (5-gram and 10-gram) on test set to verify <1% contamination rate before any benchmark comparisons

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the dataset be augmented to mitigate the bias toward international policy frameworks and better capture localized healthcare nuances in the Global South?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Impact Statement notes the dataset "inherently reflects the policy frameworks of international organizations" and risks overlooking "localized healthcare nuances or traditional medical practices."
- Why unresolved: The current data construction pipeline relies on WHO-sourced documents, which prioritize global consensus over regional or indigenous practices.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks and qualitative audits stratified by region, specifically measuring the model's capability on community-driven health data from underrepresented regions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What mechanisms drive the performance plateau or slight degradation observed when fine-tuning data volume exceeds 60% of the dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.4 reports that model performance "plateaus or slightly degrades beyond the 60% mark," suggesting diminishing returns that contradict typical scaling laws.
- Why unresolved: The paper observes the phenomenon but does not isolate the cause, leaving uncertainty about whether the issue stems from data noise, model capacity saturation, or suboptimal hyperparameters.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed ablation study analyzing loss curves and validation metrics at incremental data volumes, specifically filtering for label noise or redundancy in the latter 40% of the dataset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can domain-specific fine-tuning be adjusted to prevent the regression of general reasoning capabilities observed in larger models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Table 8 shows that while the 14B model improved on domain-specific tasks, its performance on MMLU-pro decreased, which the authors attribute to "stronger source-domain bias."
- Why unresolved: The trade-off between specializing in public health and maintaining general logic/reasoning skills is not resolved, particularly as model scale increases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments integrating regularization techniques (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) or mixture-of-experts approaches to preserve general knowledge while absorbing domain-specific reasoning.

## Limitations

- The quality gate mechanism (S ≥ 4.5 threshold) fundamentally shapes dataset composition but lacks extensive human validation to confirm optimal calibration
- The evaluator's six-dimensional decomposition, while theoretically sound, requires additional empirical validation to confirm orthogonality and sufficiency for public health reasoning assessment
- Cross-lingual performance analysis is limited, with insufficient data on whether the synthesis pipeline introduces systematic biases favoring certain language structures or domain conventions

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The fundamental approach of using LLM-assisted data synthesis with quality filtering is well-established in the literature. The correlation between training data size and model performance follows predictable scaling laws that have been extensively validated across multiple domains.

**Medium Confidence**: The specific quality gate threshold (S ≥ 4.5) and scoring weights appear reasonable based on the described methodology, but would benefit from more extensive human validation across diverse samples. The evaluator's six-dimensional scoring system is methodologically sound but requires additional empirical validation.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that the Public-Model outperforms larger general-purpose models may reflect dataset-specific optimization rather than generalizable domain adaptation capabilities. The cross-domain transfer results (MMLU-pro degradation) suggest potential overfitting that requires further investigation.

## Next Checks

1. **Quality Gate Calibration Validation**: Conduct blind human evaluation on 500 randomly sampled instances from the training set (S ≥ 4.5) and a comparable sample from the rejected pool (S < 4.5). Calculate precision/recall of the quality gate against expert judgment to quantify the optimal threshold and identify systematic filtering biases.

2. **Evaluator Dimensional Independence Test**: Select 200 instances with high variance across the six evaluation dimensions. Have three independent public health experts score these instances and compute inter-rater reliability for each dimension separately. Test whether the claimed orthogonality holds empirically or if certain dimensions (e.g., Accuracy vs. Reasoning) show significant correlation.

3. **Cross-Lingual Performance Analysis**: Stratify the test set by language and difficulty level (A/B/C). Evaluate the Public-Model on language-specific subsets and compute performance gaps. Identify whether certain languages consistently underperform and trace back to potential synthesis pipeline biases in the LLM-assisted construction phase.
