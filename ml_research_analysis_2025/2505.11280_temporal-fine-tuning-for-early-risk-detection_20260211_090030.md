core_contribution: This paper introduces a method called temporal fine-tuning for
  early risk detection (ERD) tasks. The main idea is to explicitly incorporate time
  into transformer-based models during training by adding a time token to the input

# Temporal fine-tuning for early risk detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.11280
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11280
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Primary result**: Temporal fine-tuning improves early risk detection performance on Spanish mental health datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces temporal fine-tuning, a method for early risk detection (ERD) that explicitly incorporates time into transformer-based models during training. The approach adds a time token to the input and uses a loss function that penalizes delayed risk detection decisions. By optimizing both precision and speed simultaneously, temporal fine-tuning addresses the critical challenge in ERD where early detection must balance accuracy with timeliness. The method was evaluated on depression and eating disorders detection in Spanish using the MentalRiskES 2023 datasets, demonstrating superior or matched performance across multiple metrics compared to competition baselines.

## Method Summary
Temporal fine-tuning works by integrating time as a first-class element in transformer model training. During training, a time token is added to the input sequence, allowing the model to explicitly reason about temporal progression. The loss function is modified to penalize not only incorrect classifications but also delayed correct predictions, encouraging the model to detect risks as early as possible without sacrificing accuracy. This dual optimization approach directly addresses the tension between early detection and precision that characterizes ERD tasks. The method is implemented as a training-time modification that can be applied to existing transformer architectures without requiring architectural changes.

## Key Results
- Temporal fine-tuning outperforms or matches best competition models on ERDE30 metric across depression and eating disorders detection tasks
- The approach achieves superior F-latency scores, demonstrating better balance between early detection and precision
- Performance improvements are consistent across multiple evaluation metrics in the MentalRiskES 2023 Spanish language datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Temporal fine-tuning succeeds by making time an explicit part of the learning process rather than treating it as an implicit signal the model must discover independently. By adding time tokens to the input, the model can directly attend to temporal progression and identify risk indicators as they emerge over time. The modified loss function creates a gradient that pushes the model toward earlier correct predictions while maintaining classification accuracy. This explicit temporal modeling is particularly effective for mental health conditions where symptoms often develop gradually and manifest differently at various stages.

## Foundational Learning
- **Transformer attention mechanisms** - Why needed: Core to understanding how temporal information can be integrated into sequence models. Quick check: Can attend to temporal relationships across input sequence.
- **Early risk detection metrics** - Why needed: ERDE30 and F-latency are specialized metrics that balance precision with early detection. Quick check: Understand tradeoff between early detection and accuracy.
- **Mental health symptom progression** - Why needed: Context for why temporal modeling is valuable in detecting depression and eating disorders. Quick check: Symptoms develop gradually over time in observable patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input sequence -> Time token embedding -> Transformer layers -> Classification head -> Dual loss (accuracy + timing penalty)

**Critical path**: Input → Time token injection → Attention computation → Temporal feature extraction → Risk prediction → Time-aware loss calculation

**Design tradeoffs**: Temporal fine-tuning trades computational overhead during training for improved early detection performance. The time token approach is simpler than architectural modifications but requires careful tuning of the temporal loss weight. This design favors accuracy and early detection over inference speed.

**Failure signatures**: Without temporal fine-tuning, models may delay risk detection until sufficient evidence accumulates, missing opportunities for early intervention. Models may also fail to generalize across different temporal patterns of symptom manifestation. Performance degradation occurs when temporal patterns in training data don't match deployment scenarios.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Baseline transformer without time tokens vs. temporal fine-tuning on validation set to measure performance improvement
2. Ablation study varying temporal loss weight to find optimal balance between early detection and accuracy
3. Comparison of different time token embedding strategies (fixed vs. learned position encodings)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to Spanish language mental health datasets, raising questions about cross-cultural generalizability
- Requires labeled data with precise timestamps for risk manifestation, which may not be available in many applications
- Computational overhead of temporal fine-tuning compared to standard training is not discussed

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core finding that temporal fine-tuning improves early risk detection performance when properly implemented
**Medium confidence**: Generalizability of results across different ERD domains and languages
**Low confidence**: Scalability and practical deployment considerations given limited discussion of computational requirements

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate temporal fine-tuning across multiple languages and mental health domains to assess cross-cultural and cross-condition generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing different time token implementations and loss function designs to identify optimal configurations for various ERD scenarios
3. Measure and report computational overhead (training time, inference latency) compared to standard transformer baselines to assess practical deployment feasibility
