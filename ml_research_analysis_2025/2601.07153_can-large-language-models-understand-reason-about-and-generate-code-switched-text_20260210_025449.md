# Can Large Language Models Understand, Reason About, and Generate Code-Switched Text?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.07153
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07153
- Reference count: 40
- Models show 11% average performance drop on code-switched text, with English-dominant structures yielding higher task performance but lower naturalness.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CODEMIXQA, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on code-switched text understanding, reasoning, and generation across 16 language pairs. The study reveals a fundamental tradeoff: while English matrix language structures achieve higher downstream task performance, they produce less natural outputs according to human raters. The research demonstrates that current LLMs exhibit English-centric reasoning traces even when processing non-English inputs, leading to misalignment errors. Higher code-mixing density correlates with improved model robustness, suggesting that forcing cross-lingual integration can enhance performance.

## Method Summary
The CODEMIXQA benchmark uses three synthetic code-switching generation strategies (Random, Selective, Grammar Force) applied to SimpleQA Verified facts. Models are evaluated on understanding (F1), generation quality (CMI/SPF), and reasoning errors (LLM-as-judge). The dataset includes 64k samples across 16 language pairs in both original scripts and transliterations. Generation uses GPT-5.2 with low reasoning level; evaluation uses QWEN3-30B-A3B as judge (κ=0.95 vs GPT-4.1). Human evaluation involves native speakers rating naturalness and semantic accuracy on 5-point Likert scales.

## Key Results
- Average 11% performance drop under code-switching conditions across all models tested
- English matrix language structures yield higher task performance but lower human-rated naturalness
- Higher code-mixing density correlates with better task robustness
- Reasoning traces remain English-centric even for non-English inputs, causing misalignment errors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: English Matrix Language Alignment Boosts Task Performance
LLMs achieve higher downstream task performance when code-switched text preserves English grammatical structure because their internal reasoning space is primarily structured around English semantic patterns. The English-centric inductive bias from English-dominated pre-training allows more efficient mapping of mixed-language inputs to internal embeddings.

### Mechanism 2: English-Centric Reasoning Traces Cause Misalignment
Forcing LLMs to reason over code-switched inputs triggers reasoning traces in English, leading to logical errors when the trace fails to capture nuances from non-English components. The model's translation of mixed input into English representations is lossy, causing "Unsupported Claims" or "Illogical Leaps" when cultural nuances or idioms are lost.

### Mechanism 3: Synthetic Density Controls Robustness
Higher code-mixing density correlates with improved task robustness by preventing models from relying on monolingual shortcuts. High-density code-switching forces continuous integration of information from both languages, potentially activating more robust cross-lingual representations and preventing the model from ignoring non-English components.

## Foundational Learning

**Matrix Language Frame (MLF)**: Essential for understanding the "Grammar Force" experimental conditions. The Matrix language provides the grammatical skeleton while the Embedded language supplies inserted words. This is the key variable in the tradeoff between English vs. Target grammar performance. *Quick check: In "What is the nama of the kibbutz...", which language is the Matrix?*

**Code-Mixing Index (CMI) & Switch Point Fraction (SPF)**: Primary quantitative metrics for validating dataset quality. Without these, you cannot objectively measure if "Grammar Force" produces more complex mixing than other methods. *Quick check: If CMI is low but SPF is high, what does that imply? (Many switches but dominant language still prevalent).*

**LLM-as-a-Judge Alignment**: Critical for interpreting error analysis results since the paper relies heavily on LLMs to evaluate reasoning traces. Understanding the judge's limitations (e.g., English bias) is essential. *Quick check: If the judge model is English-centric, will it penalize valid non-English reasoning patterns as "Illogical"?*

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: SimpleQA Verified -> Perturbation Engine (Random, Selective, GrammarForce) -> Tokenizer/Pre-processor -> Target LLMs -> Evaluator (LLM Judge/Human)

**Critical path**: English Query -> Perturbation (Grammar Force) -> Code-Switched Query -> Target LLM (Thinking) -> Internal English Trace -> Answer -> Evaluator (Judge/Human). The critical failure point is the transition from Code-Switched Query to Internal English Trace.

**Design tradeoffs**: Grammar Force (Src) vs. (Tgt) - choose (Src) for high machine performance/robustness evaluation; choose (Tgt) for human-preferred natural generation. You cannot optimize for both simultaneously with current models. Transliteration vs. Script - transliteration is more natural for some communities but adds orthographic ambiguity; script is formal but less representative of casual CS usage.

**Failure signatures**: Naturalness Gap (Grammar Force Src produces poor human ratings despite high F1), Reasoning Hallucination (high "Unsupported Claims" with high CMI), Transliteration Drift (models adapt "apple" to phonetic "apel" instead of keeping "apple").

**First 3 experiments**: 1) Validate Matrix Tradeoff - run GrammarForce(Src) and GrammarForce(Tgt) on Hindi-English, measure F1 vs. Human Naturalness. 2) Trace Misalignment - inspect reasoning traces on 5 failed questions, identify where English reasoning diverges from non-English context. 3) Stress Test Density - generate "Super-High Density" (switch every 2 words) and evaluate if robustness continues or collapses.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How can the tradeoff between high task performance (English-dominant) and high human-rated naturalness (non-English matrix language) be mitigated in LLM generation? The paper identifies this fundamental tradeoff but doesn't propose solutions.

**Open Question 2**: Does enforcing non-English reasoning traces in thinking-oriented models reduce the frequency of reasoning misalignment errors observed with code-switched inputs? The study identifies English-centric bias as a source of errors but doesn't explore aligned reasoning language.

**Open Question 3**: Does the preference for transliterated text over native scripts observed in generation tasks correlate with improved model robustness in understanding tasks? The discrepancy between understanding performance (mixed results) and generation naturalness (preference for transliteration) leaves the optimal input format undefined.

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on synthetic code-switching generation that may not capture natural patterns
- Reasoning error analysis depends on LLM-as-judge methodology that inherits English-centric biases
- Evaluation focuses primarily on factual question-answering, limiting insights into complex reasoning tasks
- Human evaluation inter-annotator agreement statistics not reported

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Performance degradation under code-switching, correlation between higher density and improved robustness, validity of CMI/SPF metrics

**Medium Confidence**: English matrix language structures yield higher performance, English-centric reasoning traces cause misalignment, tradeoff between naturalness and understanding

**Low Confidence**: Generalizability beyond SimpleQA domain, completeness of 9-category reasoning error framework, extent to which synthetic patterns reflect real-world usage

## Next Checks

1. **Natural vs. Synthetic Validation**: Collect naturally occurring code-switched examples from social media for 2-3 language pairs and compare model performance on synthetic vs. natural examples to measure quality gaps.

2. **Reasoning Judge Cross-Validation**: Run reasoning error analysis using two different LLM judges (QWEN3-30B and GPT-4.1) on the same inputs to assess whether English-centric bias is judge-specific or systematic.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Apply the evaluation framework to different task domains (e.g., commonsense reasoning from BIG-bench) to measure whether performance degradation patterns generalize beyond factual QA.
