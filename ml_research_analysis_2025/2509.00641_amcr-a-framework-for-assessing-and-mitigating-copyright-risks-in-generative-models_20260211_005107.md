# AMCR: A Framework for Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks in Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.00641
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00641
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** AMCR achieves accuracy of 0.735 and F1-score of 0.574 on the L-Rep dataset, and accuracy of 0.593 and F1-score of 0.682 on the LAION-5B dataset for copyright infringement mitigation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models through AMCR, a comprehensive framework that integrates prompt sanitization, partial infringement detection, and adaptive risk mitigation. The framework purifies user prompts to reduce explicit infringement risks, employs attention-based similarity analysis to detect subtle or localized copyright violations, and fine-tunes the diffusion process to steer outputs away from infringing content while preserving image quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AMCR significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving strong performance metrics on both the L-Rep and LAION-5B datasets. The approach offers a practical solution for safer AI deployment by balancing copyright protection with visual quality preservation.

## Method Summary
AMCR implements a three-stage framework for copyright risk mitigation in text-to-image diffusion models. The first stage uses an LLM-based prompt sanitizer that slots prompts into semantic components and replaces high-risk terms identified through CLIP similarity scoring against a curated risk corpus. The second stage employs a partial infringement detector that aligns generated and reference image trajectories through cross-attention analysis, extracting soft masks to identify localized infringement regions. The third stage applies a risk-aware mitigator that fine-tunes the diffusion process using a composite loss function combining noise prediction, risk minimization, and semantic alignment. The framework is trained using AdamW optimizer with cosine annealing scheduler over 50 epochs, achieving effective copyright protection while maintaining image quality.

## Key Results
- AMCR achieves accuracy of 0.735 and F1-score of 0.574 on the L-Rep dataset
- AMCR achieves accuracy of 0.593 and F1-score of 0.682 on the LAION-5B dataset
- The framework effectively mitigates copyright risks without compromising visual quality
- AMCR significantly outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and F1-score metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AMCR works by systematically addressing copyright risks at multiple stages of the generation process. The prompt sanitization stage reduces explicit infringement risks by identifying and replacing high-risk terms before generation begins. The partial infringement detection stage uses cross-attention analysis to identify subtle or localized copyright violations that may not be apparent in the full image. The risk-aware mitigation stage fine-tunes the diffusion process to steer outputs away from infringing content while preserving the user's intended semantic meaning. This multi-layered approach ensures comprehensive protection against both obvious and subtle copyright violations.

## Foundational Learning

**Prompt Sanitization with CLIP Embeddings** (why needed: to identify high-risk terms before generation; quick check: verify CLIP similarity scores correlate with human judgment of copyright risk)

**Cross-Attention Analysis** (why needed: to localize potential infringement regions in generated images; quick check: visualize attention masks to confirm they highlight relevant areas)

**Two-Trajectory Alignment** (why needed: to compare generated and reference images in latent space; quick check: verify that trajectory alignment preserves semantic content while reducing infringement)

**Diffusion Process Fine-Tuning** (why needed: to steer generation away from infringing content; quick check: measure changes in CLIP similarity scores between original and mitigated outputs)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Prompt → Prompt Sanitizer → Text-to-Image Model → Partial Infringement Detector → Risk-aware Mitigator → Output Image

**Critical Path:** The most critical sequence is: Prompt Sanitizer → Partial Infringement Detector → Risk-aware Mitigator, as this chain directly addresses copyright risks through multiple stages of analysis and correction.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework balances copyright protection with visual quality preservation, requiring careful tuning of risk thresholds and loss weights. The use of reference images enables precise infringement detection but requires access to protected content for training.

**Failure Signatures:** Over-sanitization may remove too much semantic content, resulting in outputs that no longer match user intent. Attention mask instability may produce noisy or ineffective localization of infringement regions. Trajectory misalignment may occur if latent spaces or noise schedules differ significantly between generated and reference images.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test prompt sanitizer with various risk corpus sizes to determine optimal balance between protection and recall
2. Visualize cross-attention masks on sample images to verify they correctly identify infringement regions
3. Implement simplified two-trajectory alignment with synthetic data to validate the steering mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can the framework effectively mitigate infringement risks when no specific reference image is available, relying solely on the Sanitized Prompt Generator? The framework's detection and mitigation modules appear reference-dependent, raising questions about effectiveness for general-purpose safety applications.

**Open Question 2:** Is the textual risk scorer vulnerable to adversarial prompts designed to lower the semantic similarity score while preserving infringing visual output? The CLIP-based scoring system may be susceptible to adversarial optimization that minimizes risk scores while maintaining visual copyright violations.

**Open Question 3:** What is the computational latency overhead introduced by the two-trajectory alignment and attention-based analysis during inference? The framework introduces significant operational steps, but efficiency benchmarks are not provided, making real-time application viability uncertain.

## Limitations

- Critical components including the risk corpus and training data pairing methodology are not specified, limiting exact reproduction
- The framework requires reference images for infringement detection, potentially limiting applicability in scenarios without available reference content
- Several key hyperparameters including loss weights and LoRA configuration parameters are not provided in the text

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The overall framework architecture and experimental methodology are clearly described and logically sound, with appropriate metrics for evaluating copyright protection effectiveness.

**Medium Confidence:** Implementation details for the two-trajectory alignment and attention-based similarity detection are described but lack sufficient specificity for exact reproduction, though the general approach is clear.

**Low Confidence:** Complete reproduction would require the undisclosed risk corpus and training data pairing methodology, which are critical components of the framework's effectiveness.

## Next Checks

1. **Risk Corpus Construction Validation:** Implement a prototype risk corpus using publicly available trademark and copyright databases to evaluate how corpus composition affects prompt sanitization effectiveness and recall.

2. **Attention Mask Aggregation Validation:** Test multiple attention mask aggregation strategies and visualize resulting masks on sample images to verify correct localization of potential infringing regions before full training.

3. **Two-Trajectory Alignment Validation:** Implement a simplified version using synthetic reference trajectories to verify that the diffusion process can be successfully steered toward the reference trajectory while maintaining original semantic content.
