# CAMETA: Conflict-Aware Multi-Agent Estimated Time of Arrival Prediction for Mobile Robots

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.00074
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00074
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Achieves 29.5% and 44% MAPE reduction compared to naive A* for IMS and DMS, respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CAMETA, a three-layer framework for predicting multi-agent arrival times in unstructured indoor environments without predefined infrastructure. The framework generates route suggestions through path planning, predicts arrival times using a heterogeneous graph neural network, and selects optimal paths based on accumulated costs. The approach demonstrates significant improvements over traditional path planning methods, particularly in handling conflicts and generalizing across different robot densities.

## Method Summary
CAMETA employs a heterogeneous graph representation where static map features (floor nodes) are connected to dynamic robot nodes via ETA edges that encode temporal information. The framework uses a HEAT-based GNN with 64-dimensional encoders to process this graph and predict arrival times. The system is trained on procedurally-generated warehouse environments with varying robot densities, using actual arrival times from WHCA* local planner simulations as labels. Two inference modes (IMS and DMS) allow the framework to either predict individual agent arrival times or solve the entire problem as a single optimization task.

## Key Results
- Achieves 29.5% MAPE reduction for IMS and 44% for DMS compared to naive A* path planning
- Demonstrates superior generalization across robot densities compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Shows enhanced robustness to noise and conflicts while determining more efficient routes
- Performance degrades less for DMS as robot count increases, unlike IMS which accumulates prediction errors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CAMETA's effectiveness stems from its conflict-aware heterogeneous graph representation that captures both static environment features and dynamic agent interactions. The HEAT operator with multiple attention heads enables the model to focus on relevant temporal patterns and spatial relationships. By incorporating both map structure and robot-specific information into the graph, the framework can anticipate conflicts and optimize routes accordingly, rather than treating path planning and conflict resolution as separate problems.

## Foundational Learning
- Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks: Combines different node and edge types to represent complex relationships; needed for modeling both static maps and dynamic agents
- HEAT Operator: Hierarchical edge attention mechanism; enables multi-head attention over graph neighborhoods
- Map Tiling for Graph Construction: Partitioning occupancy grids into patches for node creation; transforms continuous space into discrete graph representation
- Temporal Feature Encoding: Embedding arrival times and durations into edge features; captures dynamic aspects of multi-agent navigation
- WHCA* Local Planner: Windowed Hierarchical Cooperative A*; generates ground truth arrival times for training data
- Multi-Inference Modes: IMS vs DMS approaches; allows comparison of sequential vs joint optimization strategies

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Path Planning -> Multi-Agent ETA Prediction (GNN) -> Path Selection

**Critical Path:**
Map Generation → Graph Construction → GNN Training → Inference (IMS/DMS) → Path Optimization

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Discrete vs continuous space: Grid-based representation simplifies graph construction but may lose kinematic details
- Tile size selection: Balances graph complexity with spatial resolution
- Inference mode choice: IMS offers modularity while DMS provides better overall optimization

**Failure Signatures:**
- High VRAM usage during training indicates need for smaller batch sizes or shorter path truncation
- IMS underperformance at high density suggests accumulated prediction errors
- Poor generalization across map types indicates overfitting to specific warehouse layouts

**First Experiments:**
1. Test different tile sizes (3m×3m, 5m×5m, 7m×7m) to assess impact on MAPE and GPU memory usage
2. Implement multiple local planners (WHCA*, ECBS, random prioritization) to isolate planner contribution to ETA accuracy
3. Generate maps with varying obstacle densities to evaluate framework robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How does CAMETA perform when utilizing sophisticated robot motion models in continuous space simulations?
2. Can the framework be extended to effectively manage heterogeneous fleets where different robot types possess varying dynamics and physical constraints?
3. Does adding intra-tile path traversal data as a feature attribute improve the precision of ETA edges?

## Limitations
- Performance highly dependent on unspecified parameters including warehouse map generation procedure and exact tile size
- Current implementation relies on discrete timesteps and atomic actions, abstracting away complex kinematic constraints
- The framework treats agents as homogeneous nodes without distinct features for varying physical characteristics

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the general framework architecture (three-layer approach, heterogeneous GNN with HEAT operator, graph construction principles)
- **Medium confidence** in the methodology and implementation details (tile size, exact encoder/decoder architecture, WHCA* specifics)
- **Low confidence** in achieving exact performance numbers without the unspecified parameters

## Next Checks
1. Validate tile size impact: Systematically test different tile sizes to assess impact on MAPE and GPU memory usage
2. Compare local planner implementations: Implement multiple local planners to isolate the contribution of the planner to ETA prediction accuracy
3. Test generalization across map types: Generate maps with varying obstacle densities and corridor widths to evaluate framework robustness beyond the single warehouse environment type described
