# FAIRWELL: Fair Multimodal Self-Supervised Learning for Wellbeing Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.16748
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16748
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** FAIRWELL achieves state-of-the-art fairness performance (AGGF scores up to 0.95) on multimodal healthcare datasets while maintaining classification accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of fairness in multimodal machine learning for healthcare, where existing self-supervised learning methods struggle with variable-length, non-tabular data across different modalities. The authors propose FAIRWELL, a subject-aware extension of the VICReg method that incorporates three key mechanisms—variance, invariance, and covariance regularization—to learn fairer representations while maintaining performance. The method is evaluated on three heterogeneous healthcare datasets (D-Vlog, MIMIC, and MODMA) using multiple fairness metrics including Statistical Parity, Equal Opportunity, Equalized Odds, and Equal Accuracy. Results show that FAIRWELL variants consistently outperform existing multimodal and SSL methods, achieving the best fairness performance (AGGF scores up to 0.95) with minimal reduction in classification accuracy. The approach also improves the performance-fairness Pareto frontier, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world multimodal healthcare applications.

## Method Summary
FAIRWELL extends the VICReg self-supervised learning framework with subject-aware regularization mechanisms. The method processes variable-length multimodal data by segmenting inputs into fixed-length chunks, encoding each modality independently, and applying a modified VICReg loss that incorporates subject identity information. The core innovation is the subject-aware invariance term, which aligns representations across modalities either within the same subject (intra-subject) or between different subjects (inter-subject). The method uses segment-based pooling to handle variable-length modalities and applies variance regularization to prevent reliance on protected attributes, covariance regularization to decorrelate feature dimensions, and subject-aware invariance to ensure consistent predictions across demographic groups. The approach is trained in a self-supervised manner and then fine-tuned with a downstream classifier for the target prediction task.

## Key Results
- FAIRWELL-M2 variant achieves AGGF scores of 0.86 on D-Vlog, 0.79 on MIMIC, and 0.95 on MODMA, outperforming baseline methods
- The method maintains classification accuracy within 1-3% of state-of-the-art models while significantly improving fairness metrics
- FAIRWELL variants consistently outperform standard VICReg, multimodal SSL baselines, and modality-specific methods across all three datasets
- The performance-fairness Pareto frontier shows FAIRWELL achieves better tradeoffs than existing approaches, particularly on datasets with demographic imbalance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Variance Regularization for Protected Attribute Independence
- Claim: Enforcing minimum variance across representations reduces the model's reliance on protected attributes as trivial solutions for prediction tasks.
- Mechanism: The variance term (Eq. 2) penalizes embeddings that fall below a threshold γ, preventing feature collapse and forcing the model to learn discriminative features beyond demographic shortcuts. This is applied per-modality, allowing each to develop independent protective representations.
- Core assumption: Assumption: Protected attributes serve as "easy" predictive signals that models will default to unless regularized away.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the variance term, which reduces reliance on the protected attribute as a trivial solution"
  - [section 3.2] Variance regularization equation and its stated fairness purpose
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support for this specific mechanism in multimodal settings
- Break condition: If variance threshold γ is set too high, representations may become overly dispersed and lose task-relevant signal; if too low, collapse to protected attributes persists.

### Mechanism 2: Subject-Aware Invariance Regularization
- Claim: Aligning representations across modalities for the same subject (intra-subject, M1) or across subjects (inter-subject, M2) enforces consistency that transcends demographic identity.
- Mechanism: The modified invariance term (Eq. 6) uses segment-based pooling to align one modality's pooled representation against each segment of the other modality. This allows the model to identify which temporal segments drive predictions independent of who the subject is.
- Core assumption: Assumption: Task-relevant signals (e.g., depression indicators) are consistent across subjects within the same class, while bias signals vary by demographic group.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the invariance term, which ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals"
  - [section 4.1-4.2] Detailed description of segment-based pooling and intra/inter-subject variants
  - [corpus] FairContrast paper supports contrastive approaches for fairness but in tabular settings only
- Break condition: When modalities carry genuinely different information (e.g., EEG capturing neural activity vs. audio capturing vocal patterns), forcing invariance may eliminate modality-unique predictive signals.

### Mechanism 3: Covariance Regularization for Decorrelation
- Claim: Minimizing off-diagonal covariance matrix entries decorrelates representation dimensions, reducing implicit encoding of protected attributes.
- Mechanism: The covariance term (Eq. 4) penalizes correlations between different feature dimensions. Since protected attributes often correlate with multiple input features, decorrelation makes it harder for downstream classifiers to reconstruct demographic information from the representation.
- Core assumption: Assumption: Protected attribute information manifests as correlated feature dimensions; independent dimensions are less informative about demographics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the covariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected attribute"
  - [section 3.2] Original VICReg covariance formulation
  - [corpus] Fair-Eye Net (corpus) uses similar decorrelation principles for multimodal glaucoma detection
- Break condition: Some legitimate task-relevant features may be naturally correlated; aggressive decorrelation could remove predictive signal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **VICReg (Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization)**
  - Why needed here: FAIRWELL directly extends VICReg; understanding the original three-term loss is prerequisite to grasping the subject-aware modifications.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why VICReg avoids the need for negative samples unlike contrastive methods?

- Concept: **Fairness Metrics (Statistical Parity, Equal Opportunity, Equalized Odds, Equal Accuracy)**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates on AGGF (aggregated fairness); understanding individual metrics is required to interpret why certain FAIRWELL variants perform better on specific datasets.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Equal Opportunity and Equalized Odds in terms of what they condition on?

- Concept: **Multimodal Alignment Strategies**
  - Why needed here: Segment-based pooling is the key architectural innovation for handling variable-length modalities; understanding standard alignment approaches (cross-attention, concatenation) provides contrast.
  - Quick check question: Why might aligning EEG segments to pooled audio features be preferable to pooling both modalities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Segment Splitter: Divides variable-length inputs into fixed-length segments {x^m_i,s_j}
  - Modality Encoders (f_θ^m1, f_θ^m2): Process each segment independently
  - Pooling Layer: Averages segments from one modality (single-pooling) or both (double-pooling)
  - FAIRWELL Loss: Combines variance, invariance, covariance terms with subject-aware logic (M1-M4)
  - Downstream Classifier: Fine-tuned on SSL-pretrained representations

- Critical path: Input → Segmentation → Per-segment encoding → Pooling (m1 only) → FAIRWELL loss computation → Representation extraction → Classifier fine-tuning

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Single vs. Double Pooling**: Single-pooling preserves more segment-level information; double-pooling simplifies alignment but loses granularity (ablation shows single-pooling generally better for fairness)
  - **M1 vs. M2 vs. M3 vs. M4**: M1/M2 best for datasets with demographic imbalance (D-Vlog, MODMA); M4 provides stability when class-balanced batches are difficult

- Failure signatures:
  - **AGGF near 0.0 with high accuracy**: Model has learned to use protected attributes as shortcuts (seen in MultiDepr, Effnetv2s baselines on MODMA)
  - **Large disparity between SP and EOpp values**: Model is fair on one metric but not others; check which demographic group is being systematically disadvantaged
  - **VICReg baseline outperforming FAIRWELL variants**: Likely pooling configuration issue or batch composition preventing subject-aware regularization from activating

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Run VICReg (no pooling, no subject-awareness) on D-Vlog with provided splits; verify AGGF ≈ 0.04 as reported in Table 5
  2. **Ablation on pooling**: Compare single-pooling (M1-M4) vs. double-pooling vs. no pooling; confirm single-pooling M2 achieves AGGF ≈ 0.86
  3. **Cross-dataset transfer**: Train FAIRWELL-M2 on D-Vlog, extract representations, evaluate on MODMA without fine-tuning to test modality-agnostic fairness properties

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can FAIRWELL be adapted to settings where sensitive attribute labels are unavailable during training?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Limitations section states: "We assume the availability of sensitive attribute labels, which is a common setting in bias mitigation research. Future work should consider experimenting on more datasets..."
  - Why unresolved: The current method requires protected attribute information (e.g., gender) to compute subject-aware regularization. Real-world healthcare deployments may lack such annotations due to privacy regulations or collection practices.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of FAIRWELL variants achieving comparable fairness improvements on benchmark datasets when trained without access to sensitive attributes, potentially using proxy variables or unsupervised fairness regularization.

- **Open Question 2**: How does FAIRWELL generalize to modalities beyond audio, visual, EEG, and tabular data (e.g., genetic sequences, medical imaging, physiological signals)?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Limitations section explicitly calls for "adapting this approach to other modalities beyond audio, visual, EEG and tabular data sources."
  - Why unresolved: Each modality has unique characteristics (dimensionality, temporal structure, noise profiles). The segment-based encoding and pooling mechanisms may require modality-specific tuning that the current work does not explore.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on additional healthcare datasets with novel modalities (e.g., genomics, MRI, wearable sensor streams) showing consistent fairness-performance trade-offs without extensive architecture modifications.

- **Open Question 3**: What explains the differential effectiveness of FAIRWELL variants (M1–M4) across datasets with varying imbalance characteristics?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] Results show M1 and M2 perform best on D-Vlog and MODMA (gender-imbalanced), while M2 and M4 perform better on MIMIC (class-imbalanced tabular). The discussion hypothesizes this relates to intra-/inter-subject differences but does not systematically test this.
  - Why unresolved: The paper provides intuition but no ablation isolating the effect of dataset properties (imbalance ratio, modality heterogeneity, subject variability) on each variant's success.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying one dataset property at a time (e.g., synthetic data with known imbalance levels) while measuring which FAIRWELL variant achieves optimal AGGF scores.

- **Open Question 4**: Does single-pooling consistently outperform double-pooling across modalities, and what information is lost in the pooling process?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The ablation study (Table 8) shows double-pooling underperforms single-pooling on fairness metrics, which "suggests that double-pooling may have resulted in a slight loss in information learnt." The mechanism behind this loss remains unexplored.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not analyze what representations or correlations are discarded during pooling, nor whether the optimal pooling strategy depends on modality-specific temporal alignment properties.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Representation analysis (e.g., probing classifiers, mutual information metrics) quantifying what modality-unique information is preserved versus discarded under each pooling configuration across different modality pairs.

## Limitations

- The method relies on explicit subject identifiers, which may not be available in all healthcare settings where privacy constraints limit subject-level tracking.
- FAIRWELL assumes availability of protected attribute labels during training, limiting applicability to real-world scenarios where such demographic information may be missing or restricted.
- The generalizability of FAIRWELL to modality combinations beyond audio, visual, EEG, and tabular data remains untested, as the current evaluation is limited to three specific healthcare datasets.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Claims about VICReg extension validity, the mathematical formulation of variance/invariance/covariance regularization, and the computational feasibility of the method.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about fairness improvements across all three datasets, particularly the AGGF scores. While statistically significant within-dataset, cross-dataset generalization of fairness gains is less certain given the different data characteristics.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about Pareto frontier improvements (Section 4.4). The interpretation of "better fairness-accuracy tradeoff" depends on the weighting scheme for AGGF, which the paper doesn't fully justify.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Subject Identifier Availability**: Test FAIRWELL variants on MIMIC without explicit subject IDs (using only demographic and temporal information) to assess whether subject-aware regularization can be approximated from available signals.

2. **Cross-Dataset Fairness Transfer**: Train FAIRWELL-M2 on D-Vlog, extract representations, and evaluate fairness metrics on MODMA without fine-tuning to determine if the learned representations are genuinely modality-agnostic or dataset-specific.

3. **Protected Attribute Reconstruction Analysis**: After training, attempt to reconstruct protected attributes from the learned representations (e.g., using a simple classifier) to quantify the actual reduction in demographic information content beyond proxy fairness metrics.
