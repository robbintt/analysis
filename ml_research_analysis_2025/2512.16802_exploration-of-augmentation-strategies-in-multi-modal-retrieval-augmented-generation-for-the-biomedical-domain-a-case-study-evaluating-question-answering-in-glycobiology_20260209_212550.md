# Exploration of Augmentation Strategies in Multi-modal Retrieval-Augenged Generation for the Biomedical Domain: A Case Study Evaluating Question Answering in Glycobiology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.16802
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16802
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Capacity-dependent MM-RAG design: text/multi-modal conversion best for mid-size VLMs; OCR-free visual retrieval competitive with frontier models

## Executive Summary
This study compares text-centric and OCR-free visual retrieval strategies for multi-modal grounding on a glycobiology MCQ benchmark. The key finding is a clear capacity-dependent pattern: conversion-based pipelines (text and multi-modal summaries) are more reliable with mid-size VLMs (e.g., Gemma-3-27B-IT), whereas OCR-free late-interaction retrieval becomes competitive with frontier models (e.g., GPT-4o / GPT-5). Among visual retrievers, ColFlor matched ColPali under GPT-5 while offering a smaller footprint, suggesting an attractive efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Practically, these results argue for capacity-aware MM-RAG design: convert earlier when model visual reasoning is constrained; retrieve page images directly when model capacity allows.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates four augmentation strategies on a 120-question glycobiology MCQ benchmark: None, Text RAG (Docling + BGE-base), Multi-modal conversion (Docling + summarization + BGE-base), and OCR-free visual retrieval (ColPali/ColQwen/ColFlor). Documents are indexed in Qdrant using HierarchicalChunker with a 16K token budget; images capped at 1300px. Models include Gemma-3-27B-IT (local), GPT-4o family, and GPT-5 family (API). Evaluation measures accuracy with Agresti-Coull 95% CIs over 5 runs, plus P@5, latency, cost per run, and price-per-correct answer.

## Key Results
- Conversion pipelines (text/multi-modal) outperform OCR-free retrieval for mid-size VLMs (Gemma-3-27B-IT: 0.740 vs 0.510 accuracy)
- OCR-free visual retrieval becomes competitive under frontier models (GPT-4o/GPT-5)
- ColFlor (174M parameters) matches ColPali (2.92B) under GPT-5 with ~5× faster encoding
- GPT-5 family achieves highest accuracy (0.820-0.836) but at $5.6/run cost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Late-Interaction Visual Retrieval Bypasses OCR Fragility
- Claim: OCR-free visual retrievers can match or exceed conversion-based pipelines when the downstream generator has sufficient visual reasoning capacity.
- Mechanism: Models like ColPali encode entire page images as patch embeddings using Vision-Language backbones (e.g., PaliGemma-3B). Query tokens are matched to visual patches via MaxSim late-interaction scoring, preserving layout, figures, and tables without OCR-induced errors.
- Core assumption: The generator VLM can interpret page images with comparable fidelity to text-extracted content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "OCR-free visual retrieval becomes competitive under frontier models"
  - [section III.D] "ColPali encodes entire page images—including text, layout, figures, and tables—into patch embeddings, then matches queries to pages using late-interaction scoring"
  - [corpus] Related work "Lost in OCR Translation?" (arXiv:2505.05666) corroborates that OCR errors degrade retrieval; vision-based approaches improve robustness
- Break condition: If generator visual reasoning is weak (e.g., Gemma-3-27B-IT), ColPali underperforms text conversion by ~23 percentage points (0.510 vs 0.740 accuracy).

### Mechanism 2: Modality Conversion Reduces Generator Cognitive Load
- Claim: Converting figures/tables to textual summaries shifts interpretation burden from generator to preprocessing, improving reliability for mid-size models.
- Mechanism: Docling parses PDFs, extracts structural elements, and summarizes visual content into text. Standard text embeddings (BGE-base) index this converted content. The generator receives pre-interpreted summaries rather than raw visuals.
- Core assumption: Summarization preserves task-relevant information with minimal loss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "converting visuals to text lowers the reader burden and is more reliable for mid-size models"
  - [section V] "conversion to text lowers the burden on the generator; OCR-free pipelines lean on LLM visual reasoning"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence on conversion quality; assumption remains unvalidated at scale
- Break condition: If summaries omit critical numeric values or spatial relationships (e.g., glycobiology pathway diagrams), accuracy degrades on "hard" cross-evidence questions.

### Mechanism 3: Retriever Scale Decouples from Generator Scale Under Strong Generators
- Claim: When paired with frontier generators, lightweight visual retrievers achieve parity with heavier models, enabling cost-efficient deployment.
- Mechanism: ColFlor (174M parameters, Florence-2 + BART backbone) produces 128-dimensional latent embeddings. Under GPT-5, ColFlor matches ColPali (2.92B parameters) at 0.828 accuracy with ~5× faster encoding.
- Core assumption: Generator compensates for retriever's reduced fine-grained visual detail.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ColFlor matched ColPali under GPT-5 while offering a smaller footprint"
  - [section IV, Table IV] ColPali, ColQwen, ColFlor statistically indistinguishable across GPT-5 family (overlapping CIs)
  - [corpus] HPC-ColPali work (arXiv:2506.21601) addresses storage costs but does not directly validate small-retriever equivalence
- Break condition: With weaker generators (GPT-5-nano), ColFlor trails ColPali by ~2.2 percentage points (0.728 vs 0.750), suggesting retriever quality matters more under constrained generation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Late-interaction retrieval (ColBERT-style MaxSim)
  - Why needed here: Core to understanding how ColPali/ColFlor match queries to visual patches rather than single vectors.
  - Quick check question: Given a query with 20 tokens and a page with 100 patches, how many similarity scores does MaxSim compute? (Answer: 20 × 100 = 2,000; take max per query token, sum)

- Concept: Vision-Language Model capacity scaling
  - Why needed here: Explains why Gemma-3-27B-IT fails on ColPali retrieval while GPT-4o succeeds—visual reasoning scales non-linearly with parameter count.
  - Quick check question: If a 27B model achieves 0.51 accuracy on visual retrieval and 0.74 on converted text, what does this suggest about its visual vs. textual reasoning? (Answer: Visual reasoning is the bottleneck, not retrieval)

- Concept: Multi-modal RAG grounding vs. generation decoupling
  - Why needed here: MM-RAG shifts knowledge from weights to retrieved evidence; the paper tests *when* visual interpretation happens (preprocessing vs. generation).
  - Quick check question: In a conversion pipeline, where does visual interpretation occur? In OCR-free pipelines? (Answer: Conversion = preprocessing; OCR-free = generator inference)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Docling parser → text chunks OR page images → BGE-base embeddings OR ColPali/ColQwen/ColFlor embeddings → Qdrant vector store → Late-interaction MaxSim OR cosine similarity → VLM generator

- Critical path:
  1. Assess generator capacity (frontier vs. mid-size)
  2. If mid-size → use text/multi-modal conversion pipeline
  3. If frontier → use OCR-free visual retrieval with ColFlor (default) or ColPali (maximum quality)
  4. Index with appropriate chunking (HierarchicalChunker, 16K token budget)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pipeline simplicity vs. model dependency: OCR-free eliminates OCR/layout parsing but requires strong VLM; conversion adds preprocessing steps but generalizes to weaker models
  - Retriever size vs. speed: ColPali (2.9B) vs. ColFlor (174M)—5× encoding speed difference, ~1.8% accuracy drop on text-rich documents
  - Cost vs. accuracy: GPT-5 ($5.6/run) vs. GPT-5-nano ($0.48/run) with ~8-10% accuracy gap

- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy + high retrieval confidence → generator visual reasoning failure (switch to conversion)
  - High variance across runs → benchmark contamination or temperature too high
  - ColPali underperforms text with frontier model → check image resolution cap (1,300px) or token budget

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline capacity test: Run same benchmark with Text vs. ColPali augmentation on your target VLM; if Text > ColPali by >15 points, use conversion pipeline
  2. Retriever efficiency sweep: Compare ColFlor vs. ColPali latency and accuracy under your strongest generator; if accuracy within 2% and latency matters, prefer ColFlor
  3. Difficulty stratification: Measure performance on easy/medium/hard questions separately; if "hard" cross-evidence accuracy <60%, consider multi-hop retrieval or evidence aggregation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the observed capacity-dependent MM-RAG design principles generalize to other visually dense biomedical domains like radiology or genomics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that "broader validation in other biomedical subfields (e.g., radiology, genomics) is needed" because the current benchmark is small and focused solely on glycobiology.
- Why unresolved: The study is confined to a single domain (glycobiology), and it is unclear if the trade-off between text conversion and OCR-free retrieval holds true for different types of visual data (e.g., medical imaging vs. molecular diagrams).
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the experimental pipeline on benchmarks from other biomedical subfields to verify if mid-size models still require text conversion to maintain reliability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does retrieval granularity (page-level vs. patch-level vs. token-level) and index compression impact the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in biomedical MM-RAG?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In the "Future Research Directions," the authors propose to "systematically compare modern visual retrievers... to see how retrieval detail (page-, patch-, or token-level) and index compression affect accuracy, speed, and storage."
- Why unresolved: The current study evaluated different retriever models (ColPali vs. ColFlor) but did not isolate the effects of retrieval granularity or compression techniques on the visually rich biomedical articles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies on document-centric benchmarks measuring accuracy and latency across different granularity settings and compressed indexes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent do VLMs actually utilize retrieved visual evidence versus relying on textual artifacts, and does this correlate with hallucination rates?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Limitations section notes that the study only reported multiple-choice accuracy, and adding "factual consistency and evidence-use metrics would give a fuller behavioral picture." The Future Work section also mentions a need to "stress-test how reliably models use retrieved evidence."
- Why unresolved: High accuracy scores (e.g., with GPT-5) do not guarantee that the model "read" the image; it may have solved the problem using residual knowledge or text extracted during the retrieval process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation using metrics that strictly measure visual attribution or perturbation tests where retrieved text is masked to force visual reasoning.

## Limitations

- The 120 MCQs and their exact difficulty stratification (text/tables-figures/cross-evidence) are not publicly available, limiting independent validation of the benchmark.
- No ablation on summarization quality for the multi-modal conversion pipeline; it is unclear how much information loss affects hard questions.
- Retrieval hyperparameters (top-k, context budget) are only partially specified, and no analysis of retrieval recall is provided.

## Confidence

- **High**: The capacity-dependent performance pattern (text/multi-modal > OCR-free for mid-size models; OCR-free competitive for frontier models) is directly supported by within-study comparisons and statistically significant accuracy differences.
- **Medium**: ColFlor's equivalence to ColPali under GPT-5 and its efficiency advantage are well-supported, but ColFlor's visual detail is not quantified against ColPali.
- **Low**: The assumption that multi-modal conversion reliably preserves figure/table semantics for mid-size models is plausible but not empirically validated at scale.

## Next Checks

1. **Difficulty-stratified accuracy audit**: Run the same pipeline on an independent multi-modal MCQ benchmark (e.g., FigureQA or DocVQA) and measure accuracy by difficulty to confirm the cross-evidence failure mode.
2. **Summarization quality analysis**: Extract and evaluate the textual summaries from the multi-modal conversion pipeline on a held-out set of glycobiology figures/tables to measure information preservation (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, or schema-based metrics).
3. **Retrieval recall benchmarking**: For each retrieval strategy, compute recall@10 on the 120 MCQs to isolate generation from retrieval performance, identifying whether OCR-free underperforms due to retrieval or generation failures.
