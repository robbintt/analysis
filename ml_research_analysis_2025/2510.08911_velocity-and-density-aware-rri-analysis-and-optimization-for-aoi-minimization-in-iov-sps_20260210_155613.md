# Velocity and Density-Aware RRI Analysis and Optimization for AoI Minimization in IoV SPS

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.08911
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08911
- **Reference count**: 22
- **Primary result**: Joint optimization of vehicle speed, density, and Resource Reservation Interval (RRI) can significantly reduce Age of Information (AoI) in IoV SPS systems, with LLM approaches showing rapid convergence while DDPG provides stable performance after training.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses Age of Information (AoI) deterioration in Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for Internet of Vehicles (IoV) caused by packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties. The authors establish an AoI calculation model influenced by vehicle speed, density, and Resource Reservation Interval (RRI), then propose a dual-path optimization approach combining Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). The core method leverages LLM's contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations without requiring model training, while DDPG provides stable performance after training. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training, whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a dual-path optimization approach for minimizing AoI in IoV SPS systems. The first path uses Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with an Actor-Critic architecture to learn optimal RRI and speed parameters through experience replay and a shaped piecewise reward function. The second path employs Large Language Models (LLM) with in-context learning, using prompts containing task background, constraints, and historical decision sets to generate optimal parameter configurations without model training. The system models AoI as a composite of queuing delay (driven by packet collisions) and transmission delay (driven by channel state), with collision probability and channel degradation both dependent on vehicle density and speed. The optimization navigates the trade-off where low RRI reduces latency but may increase collision risk in dense scenarios.

## Key Results
- LLM approach achieves rapid AoI reduction after accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training
- DDPG method demonstrates more stable performance after training, providing deterministic policy suitable for real-time deployment
- Joint optimization of vehicle speed, density, and RRI significantly reduces AoI compared to baseline approaches
- LLMs equipped with prior knowledge provide better initial solutions and faster convergence compared to DDPG
- The proposed optimization engine effectively balances collision probability against physical-layer channel degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Jointly optimizing vehicle speed, density, and Resource Reservation Interval (RRI) minimizes Age of Information (AoI) by balancing collision probability against physical-layer channel degradation.
- **Mechanism:** The system models AoI as a composite of queuing delay (driven by packet collisions) and transmission delay (driven by channel state). High density increases the collision probability ($P_{coll}$) during SPS resource selection, while high speed increases Doppler shifts, degrading the channel state and increasing packet loss probability ($p_d$). By adjusting RRI and accounting for the speed-density relationship (Greenshields model), the optimization navigates the trade-off where low RRI reduces latency but may increase collision risk in dense scenarios.
- **Core assumption:** The traffic flow follows a linear speed-density relationship, and the wireless channel state transitions follow a Markov process determined by Doppler frequency and SNR.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "AoI deterioration... caused by packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties."
  - [section II] Eq. (4) defines collision probability based on density/resource availability; Eq. (9) defines channel state transition based on Doppler/speed.
  - [corpus] "Enhanced SPS Velocity-adaptive Scheme" supports the relevance of velocity-adaptive scheduling in 5G NR V2I.
- **Break condition:** If vehicle mobility patterns deviate significantly from the Greenshields linear model (e.g., stop-and-go shockwaves), the density-speed coupling may invalidate the calculated optimal RRI.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform rapid parameter optimization for AoI minimization using in-context learning without weight updates, provided they are seeded with high-quality exemplars.
- **Mechanism:** The LLM acts as a heuristic optimizer. It receives a prompt containing task background, constraints, and a "historical decision set" (exemplars of parameters and resulting AoI). It infers optimal parameters (RRI, speed) by pattern-matching against these exemplars. The system filters duplicate experiences and iteratively refines the input context, allowing the model to converge on a solution via semantic reasoning rather than gradient descent.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-trained LLM possesses sufficient reasoning capability to map qualitative task descriptions and quantitative history to valid continuous control actions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations... without requiring model training."
  - [section III-B] "The LLM only needs to collect examples... prompt contains five components... historical decision set supplies past parameters."
  - [corpus] "FRSICL: LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning..." validates the mechanism of using LLMs for resource allocation without training in UAV contexts.
- **Break condition:** If the "historical decision set" contains noisy or contradictory exemplars, the LLM may hallucinate invalid parameter ranges or fail to converge, as it lacks the error-correction gradients present in DRL.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) provides stable, long-horizon optimization in the continuous space of RRI and speed, contingent upon a shaped reward function.
- **Mechanism:** DDPG utilizes an Actor-Critic architecture with experience replay to learn a deterministic policy. The agent explores the continuous action space (speed, RRI) using Ornstein–Uhlenbeck noise. The specific piecewise reward function (Eq. 18) guides the agent by scaling penalties based on AoI thresholds, preventing the sparse reward problem and encouraging precise convergence toward lower AoI values.
- **Core assumption:** The environment dynamics (state transitions $P(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$) are sufficiently stationary for the Critic to estimate value functions accurately over training episodes.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training."
  - [section III-A] Eq. (18) defines the piecewise reward structure; Eq. (19)-(22) detail the Actor-Critic updates.
  - [corpus] "AoI-Aware Resource Allocation with Deep Reinforcement Learning" confirms DRL efficacy in related V2X resource allocation tasks.
- **Break condition:** If the reward scaling factors ($N_1, N_2$) or thresholds ($A_1, A_2$) are misaligned with the magnitude of the AoI, the gradients may vanish or explode, leading to training instability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Age of Information (AoI)
  - **Why needed here:** AoI is the target metric. Unlike latency or throughput, AoI measures the "freshness" of the data at the receiver, which is critical for safety messages (BSMs) in IoV. Understanding how queuing and transmission delays accumulate to define AoI is essential for interpreting the optimization goal.
  - **Quick check question:** If a packet is transmitted instantly but arrives late due to queuing, does the AoI metric capture this degradation?

- **Concept:** Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) & Resource Reservation Interval (RRI)
  - **Why needed here:** SPS is the specific 5G NR mechanism being optimized. RRI is the primary control knob. You must understand that SPS reserves resources periodically to reduce signaling overhead, but fixed RRIs cause collisions in dense or high-speed environments.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does a fixed RRI cause higher collision probabilities as vehicle density increases?

- **Concept:** In-Context Learning (for LLMs)
  - **Why needed here:** This explains how the LLM path works without "training." The model relies on the context window (prompt + history) to infer the next action. Understanding this distinguishes the LLM approach (meta-heuristic/search) from the DDPG approach (function approximation).
  - **Quick check question:** How does the system "teach" the LLM to improve its RRI selection without updating the model's weights?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Environment Simulator -> DDPG Agent (Actor + Critic + Replay Buffer) / LLM Agent (Prompt Constructor + LLM Interface) -> Experience Filter -> AoI Update

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Initialization:** Define traffic flow $Q$ and initial state ranges.
  2. **Prompting/Encoding:** Convert the physical state (Speed, Density) into the LLM prompt or DDPG state vector.
  3. **Action Generation:** DDPG adds noise to policy output; LLM generates text outputs parsed into parameters.
  4. **AoI Update:** Execute action in the mathematical model (Eq. 4-14) to compute new AoI.
  5. **Feedback Loop:** DDPG backpropagates loss; LLM appends result to "historical decision set."

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **LLM vs. DDPG:** The LLM offers rapid convergence and better "cold start" performance due to prior knowledge (exemplars) but suffers from high inference latency and variable stability. DDPG requires long training times and careful reward tuning but yields a deterministic, stable policy suitable for real-time deployment after training.
  - **Reward Shaping:** Designing the reward (Eq. 18) involves trading off aggressive exploration (large penalties) vs. fine-grained convergence (small slopes near optimum).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **DDPG divergence:** If the AoI does not decrease over 50 epochs, check the magnitude of the reward values against the learning rate; the piecewise function may require scaling.
  - **LLM Hallucination:** If the LLM outputs RRIs outside the [10-100] ms range or fails to respect density constraints, the prompt constraints likely require reinforcement or formatting as strict "rules."
  - **Model Mismatch:** If AoI remains high despite low collision probability, verify the channel model parameters (fading margin $F$, Doppler calculations) against the simulation scenario.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Validation:** Run exhaustive search over the RRI/Speed grid to find the global AoI minimum. Compare this "Optimal" curve against random selection to quantify the optimization potential.
  2. **Convergence Speed Test:** Run 50 epochs for both LLM and DDPG. Plot AoI vs. Epoch. Verify the claim that LLM drops AoI in the first few epochs while DDPG shows a gradual decline.
  3. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Fix traffic density at "High" and "Low" settings. Compare the optimal RRI found by the LLM in both cases to validate that the model correctly shifts strategy (longer RRI for high density to avoid collisions vs. shorter RRI for low density).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states future research includes "designing lightweight fine-tuning schemes for LLMs to reduce dependency on exemplars."
- **Why unresolved:** The current approach relies on in-context learning driven by representative and historical decision sets, requiring manual prompt engineering or accumulation of examples.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study showing successful parameter optimization using fine-tuned smaller models with fewer exemplars compared to the current zero-shot/few-shot method.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the optimization engine be effectively integrated into C-V2X roadside units to achieve real-time dynamic RRI configuration?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion identifies "integrating the optimization engine into C-V2X roadside units to realize dynamic RRI configuration" as a future direction.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper notes that LLMs have high response latency and are difficult to deploy, explicitly stating the current problem is treated as offline.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A prototype implementation on a Roadside Unit (RSU) demonstrating dynamic RRI adjustment within acceptable latency bounds for high-speed vehicular environments.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the proposed optimization method perform in multi-base station scenarios specifically regarding AoI spikes caused by signal handovers?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion suggests "considering multi-base station scenarios to address AoI spikes caused by signal handovers."
- **Why unresolved:** The current system model (Section II) is restricted to a finite highway segment with V2V communication and does not incorporate base station handover dynamics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Simulation results extending the model to include multi-base station topologies, demonstrating mitigation of AoI degradation during handover events.

## Limitations
- **Reward function specification**: The piecewise reward constants (N₁, N₂, A₁, A₂) in Eq. 18 are not provided, making faithful DDPG reproduction difficult.
- **LLM prompt fidelity**: While the prompt structure is described, exemplar construction methods and specific model versions are unspecified.
- **Environment assumptions**: The collision and channel models rely on specific assumptions (linear speed-density relationship, Markov channel states) that may not hold in real-world scenarios.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The theoretical framework connecting AoI, SPS, vehicle density, and speed is well-grounded in 5G NR literature.
- **Medium confidence**: The dual-path approach combining LLM and DDPG is innovative, but performance comparisons lack complete hyperparameter details.
- **Low confidence**: Specific numerical results and hyperparameter values needed for exact reproduction are missing.

## Next Checks
1. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary N₁, N₂, A₁, A₂ in the reward function and observe DDPG convergence behavior to identify robust configurations.
2. **LLM exemplar impact study**: Generate multiple sets of exemplars with varying quality/representativeness and measure the resulting LLM optimization performance to quantify the dependence on historical decision set quality.
3. **Real-world scenario testing**: Implement the optimization in a simulation with non-linear traffic flow (e.g., stop-and-go shockwaves) to validate the Greenshields model assumption and identify failure modes.
