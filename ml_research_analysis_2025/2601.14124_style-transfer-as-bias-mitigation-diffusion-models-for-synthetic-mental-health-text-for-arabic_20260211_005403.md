# Style Transfer as Bias Mitigation: Diffusion Models for Synthetic Mental Health Text for Arabic

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.14124
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14124
- **Reference count**: 3
- **Primary result**: Diffusion models trained on gender-specific style transfer datasets generate female-styled Arabic mental health text while preserving semantic meaning, achieving BERTScore F1 0.93-0.95 and ROUGE < 0.07.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses gender imbalance in Arabic mental health text data by using diffusion models for style transfer. The approach frames synthetic data generation as a conditional text-to-text style transfer task, aiming to convert male-authored posts into female-authored ones while preserving semantic content. Five datasets were constructed to capture varying aspects of gender expression, including pronoun switching, lexical preference shifts, self-expression framing, politeness adjustments, and emotion intensity changes. Diffusion models were trained on these datasets, conditioned on male-authored posts from the CARMA corpus. Evaluation showed consistently high semantic similarity (BERTScore F1 0.93–0.95) between source and generated text, alongside low lexical overlap (ROUGE < 0.07) and variable BLEU scores, indicating successful preservation of meaning with meaningful stylistic changes. This demonstrates that diffusion-based style transfer can generate high-entropy, semantically faithful synthetic data without relying on pretrained large language models, providing an effective method for mitigating gender bias in sensitive, low-resource domains.

## Method Summary
The method employs DiffuSeq diffusion models to perform conditional style transfer on Arabic mental health text. Five separate models are trained on GPT-4o-generated datasets (D1–D5) that capture different aspects of gendered language: pronoun switching, adjectival shifts, self-expression framing, politeness/hedging, and emotion amplification. Each model conditions generation on male-authored posts from the CARMA corpus, iteratively denoising noisy embeddings while preserving semantic content. Tokenization uses an Arabic-compatible tokenizer, and outputs are decoded via nearest-neighbor mapping to token embeddings. The approach avoids pretrained LLMs, instead learning stylistic transformations directly from curated datasets.

## Key Results
- All five models achieved high semantic preservation with BERTScore F1 between 0.93 and 0.95
- Generated text showed low lexical overlap with source (ROUGE-1,2,L < 0.07), indicating successful stylistic divergence
- BLEU scores varied widely (9-57), reflecting the trade-off between semantic preservation and stylistic transformation
- The pretraining-free approach successfully generated synthetic female-styled text without relying on potentially biased LLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Conditioning generation on source text preserves semantic content while enabling stylistic transformation.
- **Mechanism:** The diffusion model receives concatenated embeddings of the source (male-authored) text and noisy target embeddings. During iterative denoising, the source conditioning constrains the output space, anchoring semantic meaning while allowing surface-level lexical and syntactic changes. This separates content preservation from style modification.
- **Core assumption:** The source dataset contains sufficient diversity that conditioning on it maintains entropy in generated outputs.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "generation is conditioned on samples drawn from real data"
  - [section 4.1] "noisy target embeddings are concatenated with the source embeddings ZS and passed through a diffusion transformer"
  - [corpus] Related work on diffusion models for text (DiffuSeq) shows comparable performance to fine-tuned GPT-2, but corpus lacks direct evidence for semantic preservation mechanism in Arabic.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Pretraining-free architecture reduces propagation of external demographic biases.
- **Mechanism:** Unlike LLMs trained on internet-scale corpora containing documented gender and cultural biases, the diffusion models learn only from the five curated style-transfer datasets. This limits the model's exposure to stereotypical associations that might otherwise emerge from pretraining data.
- **Core assumption:** The GPT-4o-generated training data does not itself introduce significant biases, and the curated transformation categories authentically represent gendered linguistic patterns.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "without reliance on pretrained LLMs, providing an effective and flexible framework for mitigating gender bias"
  - [section 2.1] LLMs "often reflect inherited biases present in their pretraining data"
  - [corpus] FairGen (arXiv:2503.01872) addresses bias in diffusion models but focuses on image generation; corpus lacks direct comparison of pretraining-free vs. pretrained text diffusion for bias.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Decomposing gender style into five linguistic dimensions enables controllable, interpretable transformations.
- **Mechanism:** Separate models trained on D1–D5 learn distinct aspects of gendered expression (pronouns, adjectives, self-reference, politeness, emotion). This modular design allows practitioners to select or combine transformation types based on domain requirements, rather than applying an opaque "female style" transformation.
- **Core assumption:** These five categories meaningfully capture gender expression in Arabic mental health contexts, and native-speaker consultation correctly identified them.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.2] "datasets were developed in consultation with two native Arabic speakers with expertise in language use and expression"
  - [table 3] Examples show distinct transformation types (e.g., D1: pronoun only, D5: emotion intensification)
  - [corpus] No corpus papers validate this decomposition scheme for Arabic; it remains a design choice requiring empirical validation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Diffusion models for discrete text**
  - Why needed here: Unlike continuous image data, text requires token-level discrete outputs. Understanding how Gaussian diffusion processes map to token embeddings via nearest-neighbor decoding is essential for debugging generation quality.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the model denoises continuous embeddings but must map back to discrete tokens at inference?

- **Concept: BERTScore vs. n-gram metrics (BLEU, ROUGE)**
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on high BERTScore (semantic similarity) alongside low ROUGE (lexical divergence) to claim successful style transfer. Without understanding this distinction, you might misinterpret low BLEU scores as failure.
  - Quick check question: Why would a successful style transfer show BERTScore ~0.94 but ROUGE <0.07?

- **Concept: Arabic morphosyntactic gender**
  - Why needed here: Arabic verbs, adjectives, and pronouns carry grammatical gender markers. Style transfer must handle morphological inflection (e.g., muttawatir → muttawatirah), not just word substitution.
  - Quick check question: In D1 (pronoun switching), what other word classes must change to maintain grammatical agreement?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Male-authored posts from CARMA corpus -> tokenized with AraBERT -> five separate DiffuSeq models -> Gaussian noise initialized -> iteratively denoised while conditioning on source embeddings -> nearest token embedding mapping -> female-styled outputs

- **Critical path:**
  1. Dataset construction (GPT-4o prompting with temperature 0)
  2. Tokenization with Arabic-compatible vocab
  3. Embedding concatenation (source + noisy target)
  4. Diffusion transformer training (ℓ2 reconstruction loss)
  5. Iterative denoising at inference (T timesteps)
  6. Token decoding via embedding similarity

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Five separate models vs. single multi-style model: Separate models offer interpretability and control but require 5× training resources
  - 90/5/5 split: Prioritizes training data size (limited corpus) at cost of small test/validation sets—may affect evaluation reliability
  - GPT-4o for dataset creation: Ensures consistent, reproducible transformations but introduces dependency on an LLM whose biases the paper otherwise critiques

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low BERTScore (<0.85): Semantic drift; model failing to condition properly on source
  - High ROUGE (>0.3): Model copying source without style transformation
  - Generated text with mixed gender markers: Morphological agreement failures in Arabic
  - Incoherent outputs: Denoising steps insufficient or embedding-to-token mapping failing

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce D1 model (pronoun switching only) as a minimal test case—this should yield highest BLEU and most predictable outputs
  2. Ablate denoising timesteps to identify minimum steps for coherent output; baseline uses T steps, test T/2, T/4
  3. Validate gender classification of outputs using the LLM gender annotator to confirm generated text is perceived as female-authored; compare across all five models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can this pretraining-free diffusion framework effectively perform style transfer for synthetic data generation in non-gendered languages like English, where morphological gender markers are absent? While the authors explicitly state the methodology is not language-specific and encourage future work to extend it to English and other languages, the current work relies heavily on Arabic's specific morphological features. Application to English would require measuring semantic similarity and stylistic divergence in the absence of grammatical gender.

- Does this style transfer method yield measurable improvements in fairness and performance when the synthetic data is used to train downstream mental health classification models? Although the paper demonstrates high semantic similarity and stylistic divergence through intrinsic evaluation, it does not present extrinsic results showing that these synthetic samples actually improve classifier accuracy or reduce demographic bias in downstream tasks. High semantic fidelity does not guarantee the generated samples are useful training signals for diagnostic models.

- Can the proposed framework be adapted to mitigate other forms of demographic bias in mental health data, such as dialectal variation or social status? The authors note that the approach can be readily applied to other forms of bias, but this specific application remains untested. Different demographic factors may require fundamentally different linguistic feature sets than the gender-focused categories (pronoun switching, politeness) used in this work.

## Limitations

- The five linguistic categories were identified through consultation with two native Arabic speakers but lack external validation, raising questions about whether they authentically capture gender expression in Arabic mental health discourse
- The quality of GPT-4o-generated training data introduces a potential source of bias that the paper critiques in LLMs generally, creating a dependency on the very technology the approach aims to avoid
- The small test set (5% split) may limit statistical reliability of evaluation metrics, making it difficult to assess the robustness of the style transfer performance

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Semantic preservation (BERTScore 0.93–0.95) and low lexical overlap (ROUGE < 0.07) across all five models, demonstrating consistent performance in separating style from content
- **Medium confidence**: Pretraining-free architecture successfully reduces external bias, though the paper does not directly compare against pretrained LLM-based style transfer approaches
- **Low confidence**: The five-category decomposition meaningfully captures gender expression in Arabic mental health contexts; this remains a design choice requiring empirical validation beyond native-speaker consultation

## Next Checks

1. **Native speaker naturalness evaluation**: Have Arabic speakers blind to the source gender rate the naturalness and authenticity of generated female-styled text across all five transformation types, comparing against ground truth targets
2. **External bias audit**: Evaluate generated text for stereotypical gender associations using established bias detection tools (e.g., StereoSet) to verify the pretraining-free approach actually reduces bias rather than introducing new patterns
3. **Cross-domain robustness test**: Apply the five trained models to male-authored posts from different Arabic corpora (e.g., general social media) to assess whether the style transfer generalizes beyond the CARMA mental health domain
