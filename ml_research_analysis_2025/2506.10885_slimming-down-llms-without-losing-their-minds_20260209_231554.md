# Slimming Down LLMs Without Losing Their Minds

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.10885
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10885
- **Authors**: Qingda; Mai
- **Reference count**: 18
- **Primary result**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning improves task-specific performance but causes severe capability loss in untrained domains.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the trade-offs of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) for large language models, focusing on capability retention versus task specialization. The study finds that while LoRA-based methods effectively improve task-specific performance with computational efficiency, they can cause catastrophic forgetting of general capabilities, particularly mathematical reasoning and domain knowledge. Performance gains depend strongly on alignment between fine-tuning datasets and target benchmarks, with misalignment leading to capability degradation rather than transfer.

## Method Summary
The study uses QLoRA (4-bit quantization + LoRA) to fine-tune Llama 3.2 1B and TinyLlama 1.1B models on the Alpaca dataset with 2,000 and 50,000 samples respectively. Training is performed using the Unsloth framework on Google Colab with Tesla T4 GPU. Models are evaluated on HellaSwag (commonsense reasoning), GSM8K (mathematical reasoning), and MMLU-CS (domain knowledge) using lm-evaluation-harness. Key metrics include normalized accuracy, flexible accuracy, forgetting rate (FR), and knowledge loss (ΔK).

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B achieves 61.20% accuracy on HellaSwag (+0.43% vs baseline)
- TinyLlama 1.1B with 50k samples achieves 59.26% on HellaSwag vs 34% on MMLU-CS
- Mathematical reasoning degrades severely with FR exceeding 88% on GSM8K
- Domain knowledge decreases by 13 percentage points on MMLU-CS

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LoRA enables efficient fine-tuning by decomposing weight updates into low-rank matrices, reducing trainable parameters by ~98% while maintaining task-specific performance gains.
- Mechanism: Instead of updating the full weight matrix W ∈ R^(d×d), LoRA introduces two low-rank matrices A ∈ R^(d×r) and B ∈ R^(r×d) where r ≪ d (typically r=8). The forward pass computes y = (W + AB)x, where only A and B are trained while W remains frozen. For a 1000×1000 weight matrix, this reduces trainable parameters from 1,000,000 to 20,000.
- Core assumption: Weight updates for downstream tasks have low intrinsic dimensionality—meaning the effective parameter space needed for adaptation is much smaller than the full model dimension.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LoRA-based methods effectively improve task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency"
  - [section 1.2.1, p.3]: Equation 1.2 showing parameter reduction from 1,000,000 to 20,000
  - [corpus]: SparseLoRA paper (arxiv:2506.16500) confirms PEFT methods reduce trainable parameters but notes they may not decrease computational cost; LowRA (arxiv:2502.08141) demonstrates LoRA below 2 bits remains viable, supporting low-rank hypothesis
- Break condition: Tasks requiring high-rank updates (complex multi-domain reasoning) may exceed LoRA's representational capacity, causing performance collapse on untrained capabilities.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning on domain-specific data causes catastrophic forgetting in unrelated capabilities through representational competition, with forgetting rates exceeding 88% for mathematical reasoning.
- Mechanism: When parameters are optimized for instruction-following (Alpaca dataset), representations supporting mathematical reasoning are overwritten or degraded. The paper operationalizes this as Forgetting Rate (FR) = (1 - A^FT_flex / A^Base_flex) × 100%.
- Core assumption: Neural networks have finite representational capacity; improving one capability necessarily degrades others when training data doesn't cover all original capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "mathematical reasoning capability degrades severely, with forgetting rates exceeding 88%"
  - [section 3, p.9]: GSM8K Flexible Accuracy drops from 33.51% to 3.71% (FR=88.92%); MMLU-CS drops 13 percentage points
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus validation on forgetting specifically; related papers focus on efficiency rather than capability retention
- Break condition: Assumption—mixed-domain fine-tuning datasets that include mathematical examples could preserve reasoning capabilities, though this was not tested in the study.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dataset-benchmark alignment strongly predicts fine-tuning success; misalignment causes capability degradation rather than transfer.
- Mechanism: The Alpaca dataset (instruction-following) aligns with HellaSwag (commonsense reasoning), yielding +0.43% improvement. It misaligns with GSM8K (mathematical reasoning), causing 88.92% forgetting. Performance gains occur only when fine-tuning data shares representational patterns with evaluation tasks.
- Core assumption: Transfer learning requires overlap between source task (fine-tuning data) and target task (benchmark); without overlap, parameter updates provide no benefit and may cause interference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and benchmark tasks"
  - [section 3, p.9-10]: HellaSwag shows +0.43% augmentation (aligned); GSM8K shows 88.92% FR (misaligned); MMLU-CS shows 13% loss (misaligned)
  - [corpus]: Adaptive Minds (arxiv:2510.15416) proposes dynamic LoRA selection based on query analysis, implicitly acknowledging single fine-tuning cannot cover all domains
- Break condition: Tasks with partial overlap may show unpredictable results; the threshold of alignment needed for positive transfer remains undefined.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Precision and Quantization**
  - Why needed here: QLoRA combines 4-bit quantization with LoRA; understanding precision trade-offs is essential for memory-constrained deployment.
  - Quick check question: If a model has 1.24B parameters, what's the memory difference between float32 (4 bytes) and 4-bit (0.5 bytes) representation? (Answer: ~4.96GB vs ~0.62GB)

- Concept: **Low-Rank Matrix Decomposition**
  - Why needed here: LoRA's core assumption is that weight updates can be approximated by low-rank matrices; understanding rank constraints helps diagnose adaptation failures.
  - Quick check question: For a 512×512 weight matrix with rank r=8, how many parameters does LoRA train versus full fine-tuning? (Answer: 8,192 vs 262,144)

- Concept: **Catastrophic Forgetting**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central finding is that fine-tuning destroys untrained capabilities; practitioners must understand this risk before deploying PEFT.
  - Quick check question: If base model achieves 40% on Task A and you fine-tune on Task B data only, what range of Task A performance should you expect post-fine-tuning? (Answer: Unknown without testing; paper shows 3%-89% retention depending on task relationship)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
Pre-trained Model (frozen weights W)
    ↓
Quantization Layer (4-bit compression)
    ↓
LoRA Adapters (trainable A, B matrices)
    ↓ [applied to Q/K/V projections in attention]
Forward Pass: y = (W + AB)x
    ↓
Merge Process: W_merged = W_base + ∆W_adapter
    ↓
Deployed Model (original size, new capabilities)

- Critical path:
  1. Select base model matching hardware constraints (T4 GPU → ~1B parameters)
  2. Choose rank r (paper uses default; lower = fewer parameters, higher = more capacity)
  3. Prepare fine-tuning data aligned with target task
  4. Train A, B matrices while W remains frozen
  5. Evaluate on ALL original capabilities before deployment (not just target task)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Rank (r)**: Higher r → more expressive but more parameters; lower r → faster training but may underfit complex tasks
  - **Dataset size vs. architectural quality**: TinyLlama with 50k samples underperformed Llama 3.2 with 2k samples (27% vs 34% MMLU-CS), suggesting architecture matters more than data volume for knowledge retention
  - **Specialization vs. retention**: Fine-tuning improves aligned tasks (+0.43% HellaSwag) but destroys misaligned capabilities (88.92% GSM8K forgetting)

- Failure signatures:
  - **Catastrophic forgetting**: >50% FR on any capability indicates over-specialization
  - **Knowledge loss**: >10% drop on MMLU subsets suggests factual knowledge degradation
  - **No improvement on target task**: If fine-tuning data doesn't align with benchmark, expect zero or negative gains

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline capability audit**: Before fine-tuning, evaluate base model on HellaSwag, GSM8K, and domain-relevant MMLU subsets to establish retention targets
  2. **Alignment validation**: Fine-tune on 500 samples, evaluate on target benchmark; if no improvement, dataset-benchmark alignment is insufficient
  3. **Forgetting threshold test**: Post fine-tuning, re-evaluate GSM8K; if FR > 50%, add mathematical examples to fine-tuning data or accept capability loss

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can mixed fine-tuning datasets mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of mathematical reasoning (88.92% loss) while preserving gains in commonsense tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion states "Future research should explore mixed fine-tuning datasets" to address the trade-off between new capabilities and knowledge preservation.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested the Alpaca dataset, which lacks mathematical data, failing to verify if simultaneous training on multiple domains prevents the observed capability loss.
- What evidence would resolve it: Fine-tuning with a hybrid dataset (e.g., Alpaca + GSM8K) and evaluating if GSM8K accuracy remains stable while commonsense performance improves.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is the severe degradation in mathematical reasoning an artifact of low training sample volume (2,000 samples) rather than the QLoRA method itself?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper limits Llama 3.2 fine-tuning to 2,000 samples due to hardware constraints, whereas TinyLlama used 50,000. It is unclear if the 88% forgetting rate is intrinsic to the method or a result of insufficient data alignment.
- Why unresolved: The experimental design confounds model architecture with training data volume, preventing causal attribution of the forgetting rate to the fine-tuning technique versus sample size.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled ablation study fine-tuning Llama 3.2 on 50,000 samples to compare the resulting forgetting rates against the 2,000-sample baseline.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What causes the asymmetry in knowledge retention where commonsense reasoning remains stable but domain-specific knowledge (MMLU-CS) degrades significantly?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Discussion mentions "representational competition," but the paper provides no mechanism for why HellaSwag scores improved (+0.43%) while MMLU-CS scores dropped by 13 percentage points.
- Why unresolved: The paper observes the divergent outcomes but does not investigate if this is due to overlapping parameter subspaces or the specific nature of the instruction-tuning data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of weight updates (∆W) to determine if the updated parameters overlap disproportionately with the circuits responsible for factual domain knowledge versus commonsense inference.

## Limitations

- **Dataset composition and alignment definitions remain unclear** - The paper claims fine-tuning success depends on alignment between datasets and benchmarks, but doesn't quantify what constitutes sufficient alignment.
- **Hardware constraints artificially limit model choices** - The exclusive use of Tesla T4 GPU (15GB VRAM) explains why only 1B parameter models were tested, potentially limiting generalizability.
- **Single fine-tuning dataset limits generalizability** - Using only the Alpaca dataset means results reflect one specific alignment strategy and may not apply to other fine-tuning approaches.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning works for task-specific performance - The mechanism (LoRA decomposition) is well-established, and the paper's results showing 61.20% HellaSwag accuracy align with known PEFT capabilities.
- **Medium Confidence**: Fine-tuning causes catastrophic forgetting - While the 88.92% forgetting rate on GSM8K is dramatic, it's based on a single dataset pair without systematic testing.
- **Low Confidence**: Dataset-benchmark alignment predicts success - This claim is supported by contrasting results but lacks systematic testing across multiple dataset pairs and threshold definition.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset alignment experiment**: Fine-tune on three datasets with varying similarity to HellaSwag and measure how forgetting rates and target task performance vary to establish the alignment threshold for positive transfer.

2. **Multi-domain fine-tuning validation**: Fine-tune on a mixed dataset containing both instruction-following and mathematical reasoning examples, then measure if GSM8K forgetting can be reduced while maintaining HellaSwag gains.

3. **Larger model capability retention**: Repeat experiments with 7B or 13B parameter models on comparable hardware to determine if capability retention scales with model size or if forgetting patterns remain consistent across scales.
