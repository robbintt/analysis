# Datasets and Recipes for Video Temporal Grounding via Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.18100
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18100

- One-line primary result: Two-stage SFT + RL framework improves video temporal grounding performance across three benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of video temporal grounding by proposing a two-stage training framework that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL). The approach leverages high-quality curated data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to improve temporal localization and reasoning. Experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain scenarios. The authors release all datasets, models, and code to support further research.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a two-stage training pipeline for video temporal grounding. First, large vision-language models undergo supervised fine-tuning on high-quality curated datasets to establish a strong baseline. Second, reinforcement learning is applied with difficulty-controlled training schedules to progressively enhance temporal localization accuracy and reasoning capabilities. The RL stage uses carefully designed reward functions that balance temporal precision with semantic alignment. The framework addresses limitations of existing approaches by combining the stability of supervised learning with the adaptability of reinforcement learning, while maintaining computational efficiency through targeted difficulty progression.

## Key Results
- Two-stage SFT + RL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across ActivityNet Captions, Charades-STA, and DiDeMo benchmarks
- Difficulty-controlled RL training shows significant improvements in temporal localization precision compared to standard RL approaches
- Performance gains are particularly pronounced in open-domain scenarios and challenging temporal reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-stage approach works by first establishing a strong foundation through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data, which provides stable initial parameters and reduces the exploration space for subsequent RL training. The difficulty-controlled RL stage then incrementally challenges the model with progressively harder temporal localization tasks, allowing it to develop sophisticated reasoning capabilities without becoming overwhelmed. This staged progression mimics curriculum learning principles, where the model builds competence on simpler tasks before tackling more complex temporal reasoning scenarios. The combination leverages the complementary strengths of both training paradigms: SFT provides reliable initial guidance while RL enables fine-grained adaptation to temporal nuances.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal grounding**: The task of identifying specific time intervals in videos that correspond to natural language queries; needed to understand the core problem being solved, quick check: can you describe the input/output format?
- **Reinforcement learning for localization**: Using RL to optimize spatial/temporal prediction tasks through reward-based feedback; needed to grasp why RL is chosen over pure supervised learning, quick check: what reward signals are used?
- **Difficulty-controlled training**: Progressive curriculum learning where training examples increase in complexity; needed to understand the staged learning approach, quick check: how does difficulty scaling work?
- **Large vision-language models**: Multimodal models that process both visual and textual information; needed to contextualize the SFT stage, quick check: what LVLM architectures are used?
- **Supervised fine-tuning**: Adapting pre-trained models on task-specific labeled data; needed to understand the cold-start phase, quick check: what data quality criteria are used?
- **Temporal reasoning**: Understanding and processing time-based relationships in video content; needed to appreciate the complexity of the task, quick check: what types of temporal reasoning are required?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
SFT Dataset -> LVLM Encoder-Decoder -> Reward Function -> RL Agent -> Temporal Localization Head

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from the curated SFT dataset through the LVLM backbone, where the model learns to map text queries to temporal regions. The RL agent then receives rewards based on temporal accuracy and semantic alignment, updating the model parameters through policy gradient methods. The temporal localization head provides the final output, predicting start and end timestamps for each query.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The primary tradeoff involves balancing supervised learning stability with RL's adaptability. SFT provides reliable initial performance but may overfit to training patterns, while RL enables fine-grained adaptation but risks instability and reward hacking. The difficulty-controlled approach mitigates RL instability but adds complexity to hyperparameter tuning. The choice of LVLM architecture affects both computational cost and temporal reasoning capacity, with larger models offering better performance at higher resource costs.

**Failure Signatures**
Common failure modes include temporal drift (predictions consistently offset from ground truth), semantic misalignment (correct timing but wrong content), and reward exploitation (model optimizing for reward metrics rather than actual grounding quality). These often manifest as degraded performance on out-of-distribution queries or when temporal references become ambiguous.

**First Experiments**
1. **SFT ablation**: Compare performance with and without the supervised fine-tuning stage to quantify its contribution to final accuracy
2. **Difficulty scaling sensitivity**: Test different progression schedules in the RL stage to identify optimal difficulty ramping
3. **Reward function ablation**: Evaluate alternative reward formulations to understand which components most influence temporal localization quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation on diverse real-world datasets beyond the three benchmark datasets used
- Lack of detailed analysis on the quality and representativeness of the curated SFT dataset
- Potential hyperparameter sensitivity in the RL training pipeline not extensively explored

## Confidence

- **Two-stage SFT + RL framework effectiveness**: High confidence
- **Superior performance across all benchmarks**: Medium confidence
- **Importance of difficulty-controlled RL**: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Evaluate the trained models on temporally grounded video understanding tasks from different domains (e.g., surveillance footage, educational videos) to assess real-world applicability beyond curated benchmarks
2. **Dataset quality analysis**: Conduct a systematic evaluation of the curated SFT dataset focusing on coverage, bias, and temporal localization accuracy to understand its role in the overall performance gains
3. **RL hyperparameter sensitivity**: Perform a comprehensive ablation study varying key RL parameters (reward scaling, difficulty progression rate, exploration strategies) to identify the most critical factors for stable training and optimal performance
