# Mitigating Data Scarcity in Time Series Analysis: A Foundation Model with Series-Symbol Data Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.15466
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15466
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Pre-trained SymTime foundation model on synthetic series-symbol data achieves competitive performance on 5 major TSA tasks without real-world pre-training

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses data scarcity and imbalance in time series analysis by introducing a series-symbol (S2) dual-modality data generation mechanism. The approach generates synthetic time series paired with symbolic expressions that describe their underlying mathematical structure. Using this synthetic S2 dataset, the authors pre-train SymTime, a foundation model for time series analysis, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection tasks when fine-tuned on downstream benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The method involves generating synthetic time series through sampling symbolic expressions (binary trees with mathematical operators) and random inputs, then propagating these through the expressions to create paired series-symbol data. The SymTime model uses a dual-encoder architecture with masked time series modeling, masked language modeling, and contrastive learning to align time series with their symbolic representations. The model is pre-trained entirely on synthetic data and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks using task-specific heads.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art long-term forecasting with average MSE of 0.339 and MAE of 0.351
- Outperforms existing foundation models in short-term forecasting (SMAPE 11.785%, MASE 1.584)
- Demonstrates strong classification accuracy (74.5%) and anomaly detection (F1-score 85.39%)
- Successfully performs zero-shot imputation on real-world data
- Uses smaller model parameters and memory capacity than existing foundation models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Grounding via Series-Symbol Alignment
The architecture uses contrastive learning to align time series embeddings with their corresponding symbolic expression embeddings, forcing the model to learn underlying system mechanics rather than just statistical patterns. This semantic grounding enables transfer from synthetic to real-world data.

### Mechanism 2: Momentum Distillation for Masked Representation
Momentum distillation uses slow-updating momentum encoders to generate stable targets for the main model, mitigating information loss from aggressive masking (40% for series). This improves contrastive learning stability and representation quality.

### Mechanism 3: Synthetic Data Diversity via Functional Sampling
The approach generates diverse time series by sampling random mathematical functions and inputs, creating a dataset that covers the statistical representation space more uniformly than limited real-world datasets. This enables comprehensive pre-training without data privacy concerns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Masked Time Series Modeling (MTM)**: Forces the model to learn local temporal dependencies and feature extraction; quick check: can the model reconstruct a heavily masked patch of a sine wave using only surrounding context?
- **Contrastive Learning (CLIP-style alignment)**: Creates semantic capability by linking numeric series to symbolic concepts; quick check: do embeddings of a time series and its equation cluster closer together than with random equations?
- **Symbolic Regression / Expression Trees**: Understanding binary tree construction of symbolic expressions; quick check: can you manually construct and traverse a binary tree for y = sin(x) + 0.5 * x?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (Patched Series + Tokenized Symbol) -> Series Encoder (6-layer Transformer) || Symbol Encoder (6-layer DistilBert) -> Momentum Encoders -> Projection Heads -> Shared Embedding Space -> Loss Computation
- **Critical path**: Load Series-Symbol pair → Apply random masking → Pass through main encoders → Compute Reconstruction Losses → Pass through Momentum Encoders → Compute Contrastive Loss → Backpropagate weighted sum of losses
- **Design tradeoffs**: Synthetic vs. Real (avoids data privacy issues but risks sim-to-real gap), Efficiency (lightweight 6-layer Transformer vs. LLM baselines), Momentum Update (stable training but adds memory overhead)
- **Failure signatures**: Representation Collapse (all inputs map to single point), Memorization (perfect synthetic reconstruction but poor real data performance), Symbol-Text Disconnect (encoder fails to differentiate between operators)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Dataset Sanity Check: Compare S2 dataset statistical metrics vs. Monash benchmark, 2) Pre-training Ablation: Compare MTM only, Contrastive only, and Full SymTime on forecasting, 3) Zero-Shot Probe: Test pre-trained SymTime on real-world dataset without fine-tuning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided text.

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetic data may not fully capture real-world noise characteristics, seasonality, and structural breaks found in domains like finance or healthcare
- Performance claims on standard benchmarks don't address high-dimensional multivariate series or irregularly sampled data
- The parameter efficiency claim lacks concrete benchmarks for inference latency and memory usage compared to baselines

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Architectural design and training procedure are clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Zero-shot imputation performance is supported but modest and may not generalize
- **Low Confidence**: Coverage of S2 dataset compared to real-world data relies on internal plots without external validation

## Next Checks
1. Fine-tune SymTime on medical time series from MIMIC-IV and compare to a model pre-trained on real-world data to test semantic transfer
2. Scale SymTime to match baseline parameter counts and benchmark inference latency and memory usage
3. Analyze symbolic expression complexity distribution in S2 dataset compared to functional forms in real-world data to quantify sim-to-real gap
