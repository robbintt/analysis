- Primary result: Fully self-supervised section-based augmentation matches or surpasses citation- and IPC-supervised baselines in patent retrieval and classification without relying on metadata.

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies over-dispersion as a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE-style dropout augmentation, where embeddings spread without semantic anchors. The authors propose section-based augmentation, using different patent sections (abstract, claims, background, summary, figure description, detailed description) as complementary views for contrastive learning. This approach introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion while maintaining semantic cohesion. On large-scale benchmarks, their fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation- and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval (R@100: 71.22 with claims augmentation vs. 56.21 with dropout) and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Different sections specialize for different tasks—claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification—highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning.

## Method Summary
The method trains BERT-for-Patents using contrastive learning with section-based augmentation. Positive pairs are constructed either by applying independent dropout masks to Title+Abstract (TA) or by pairing TA with a randomly sampled patent section. The model uses InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives, temperature τ=0.05, and a linear+tanh projector head. Training uses AdamW (lr=1e-5, cosine decay, 10% warmup) on the HUPD dataset (2.78M patents, 2010–2018). Sections are extracted with special tokens, filtered for length (>15 words), and concatenated with titles. The approach avoids metadata supervision, relying solely on patent discourse structure for augmentation.

## Key Results
- Section-based augmentation achieves R@100=71.22 on prior-art retrieval, significantly outperforming dropout-only (56.21) and matching citation-supervised baselines.
- Different sections specialize for tasks: claims/summaries benefit retrieval, while background aids classification (P@1/3/5 improvements).
- The method achieves balanced embedding geometry (low alignment, moderate uniformity) compared to dropout-only (low alignment, high uniformity) and citation-supervised (high alignment, low uniformity) models.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Section-based augmentation mitigates over-dispersion by introducing genuine discourse-level diversity
- Mechanism: Dropout-only augmentation provides near-identical views for long patent documents (feature-level perturbations leave discourse content unchanged), causing the model to learn invariance to random noise rather than semantic structure. Patent sections naturally encode the same invention with distinct styles—abstract summarizes, claims legally delimit, background contextualizes—creating semantically aligned but structurally diverse positive pairs that anchor embeddings to invention-level semantics while expanding representational spread.
- Core assumption: Patents' inherent discourse structure provides sufficiently diverse yet semantically consistent views of the same underlying invention.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "dropout performs only feature-level perturbations that leave lexical, syntactic, and discourse content unchanged, yielding views that are nearly identical—especially problematic for long, complex documents"; [section 4.2] "dropout provides too little semantic variation, so the model learns invariance to random noise rather than meaningful linguistic diversity, resulting in dispersion without semantic anchors"
- Break condition: If patent sections become formulaic or boilerplate-heavy (reducing genuine diversity), the augmentation advantage degrades toward dropout-only performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different sections specialize for different downstream tasks based on their semantic function
- Mechanism: Claims and summaries provide concise, invention-focused descriptions aligned with prior-art matching; background sections explicitly situate inventions within technical domains, encoding field-level context that maps to classification boundaries. The contrastive objective preserves these functional differences in the embedding geometry.
- Core assumption: Section-specific semantic properties transfer predictably to task requirements (retrieval needs invention similarity; classification needs domain similarity).
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification—highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure"; [section 6.2] "Background section contributes more to classification, as it explicitly situates the invention within a broader technical field and emphasizes domain-level context"
- Break condition: If retrieval tasks require domain context rather than invention similarity, or classification requires fine-grained technical detail, section specialization may reverse.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Balancing alignment and uniformity through structural augmentation yields embeddings with both local cohesion and global organization
- Mechanism: Pure dropout over-optimizes uniformity (low SSD) at the cost of alignment—embeddings spread evenly but lose neighborhood structure. Citation-supervised models optimize alignment but suffer high SSD (compact clusters, poor isotropy). Section-based augmentation interpolates: cross-section positives enforce document-level invariance while section-internal diversity maintains semantic spread.
- Core assumption: Optimal embedding geometry requires trading off between local semantic continuity and global isotropy.
- Evidence anchors: [section 6.3] "Section-based augmentation strikes a balance. Models using claims, summaries, or their combinations achieve both low alignment (good local cohesion) and improved uniformity/SSD compared to citation-trained baselines"; [figure 3] Shows dropout-only has lowest alignment (worst), section-based methods cluster in the favorable low-alignment, moderate-uniformity region
- Break condition: If section diversity becomes too extreme (sections describing different aspects rather than same invention), alignment degrades; if too similar, uniformity suffers.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning with in-batch negatives (InfoNCE loss)
  - Why needed here: Core training objective; understanding positive pair construction and temperature scaling is essential for debugging why dropout fails and section-augmentation succeeds.
  - Quick check question: Given a batch of N patent pairs, can you compute the InfoNCE loss for one anchor and explain how temperature τ affects hard vs. soft negatives?

- Concept: Embedding geometry metrics (alignment, uniformity, singular spectrum divergence)
  - Why needed here: The paper diagnoses failure modes through these metrics; without understanding them, you cannot validate that over-dispersion is actually being mitigated.
  - Quick check question: If alignment decreases but uniformity increases dramatically, what does this imply about retrieval performance? What if SSD approaches log(d)?

- Concept: Patent document structure (claims, abstract, background, summary, description)
  - Why needed here: Section-based augmentation exploits functional differences between sections; selecting the wrong section for a task will degrade results.
  - Quick check question: For a prior-art search system targeting novelty destruction, which section should serve as the positive view for query claims? Why not background?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BERT-for-Patents (1024-dim) -> [CLS] pooling -> Linear+tanh projector (discarded at inference) -> Contrastive loss with in-batch negatives

- Critical path:
  1. Extract and validate sections (filter <15 words, remove boilerplate)
  2. Construct positive pairs per policy (TA as anchor, section sample as positive)
  3. Forward pass with separate dropout masks for dropout-positives
  4. Compute InfoNCE over batch
  5. Log alignment/uniformity/SSD every 250 steps to detect over-dispersion early

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Single vs. multi-section positives**: Paper uses one section per example; multi-section could enrich signals but increases compute and may dilute task-specific specialization
  - **Fixed vs. adaptive section sampling**: Current uniform sampling; informed selection based on semantic complementarity could improve but requires additional scoring
  - **TA anchor vs. symmetric views**: 50% swap prevents anchoring bias; full symmetry may better balance section contributions

- Failure signatures:
  - **Over-dispersion detected by**: SSD↓ but retrieval R@100↓ and classification P@1↓ simultaneously
  - **Section collapse**: All sections produce near-identical embeddings (check intra-document alignment ratio)
  - **Negative contamination**: Patent family members appear as in-batch negatives (mild label noise, underestimates performance)
  - **Length truncation bias**: Long sections (claims ~975 words, description ~1582 words) truncated to 512 tokens may lose critical information

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce over-dispersion**: Train with dropout-only augmentation on 10k patent subset; plot SSD vs. retrieval R@100 every 250 steps. Verify that SSD decreases while R@100 stagnates or declines (confirming the failure mode).
  2. **Section ablation**: Compare +claim, +summary, +background, +description individually on held-out retrieval set. Measure R@20/50/100 and KNN P@1 to validate task specialization claims.
  3. **Geometry validation**: For each section-augmented checkpoint, compute alignment (on citing-cited pairs), uniformity, and normalized SSD. Confirm section-based models occupy the "balanced" region of alignment-uniformity space compared to dropout-only (low alignment, high uniformity) and citation-supervised (high alignment, low uniformity).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: Would an adaptive mechanism that dynamically selects section pairs based on semantic complementarity improve performance over fixed, randomly sampled combinations?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they "rely on a fixed set of section pairs (at most two per example), treating all combinations equally without dynamically selecting views based on their semantic complementarity or informativeness."
  - Why unresolved: The current method uniformly samples sections as positive pairs, but not all section combinations may provide equally useful training signal for all documents.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing fixed section sampling vs. a learned or heuristic selection policy (e.g., based on section length, vocabulary overlap, or embedding distance) across retrieval and classification tasks.

- **Question**: Can leveraging multiple section pairs simultaneously per training instance (multi-positive contrastive learning) better exploit the multi-view structure of patents?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note they "use only a single positive pair per training instance, which may underexploit the rich multi-view structure of patent documents."
  - Why unresolved: Patents contain multiple semantically aligned sections; using only one pair per iteration may leave signal unused compared to methods that aggregate multiple views.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with multi-positive contrastive objectives (e.g., SupCon-style losses) that incorporate all available section pairs per document, compared to the current single-pair approach.

- **Question**: Do hybrid strategies combining self-supervised section-based positives with small fractions of metadata-supervised positives (citations, IPC codes) yield better trade-offs between global structure and local semantic continuity?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] In the analysis, the authors suggest "hybrid strategies worth exploring, e.g., injecting a small fraction of cross-section positives into IPC-MATCH or using section-aware temperatures/weights."
  - Why unresolved: Purely self-supervised section-based methods approach IPC-supervised baselines on classification but may still underutilize available metadata that could strengthen global domain organization.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments with mixed positive pools (e.g., 90% section-based, 10% citation-based) and evaluation of both retrieval (local continuity) and classification (global structure) performance.

## Limitations

- The patent-specificity of over-dispersion is not established—dropout-only augmentation may cause similar issues in other long-document domains.
- Section-task specialization claims lack direct causal validation through controlled swapping experiments.
- The method doesn't test whether semantic divergence between sections is necessary versus sufficient for good representations.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The geometric failure mode diagnosis (over-dispersion from dropout-only augmentation) and the overall effectiveness of section-based augmentation for improving R@100 and classification metrics.
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism explaining why patent sections provide beneficial augmentation diversity, and the task-specialization claim for different sections.
- **Low confidence**: The patent-specificity of the over-dispersion problem and the claim that this is a fundamental limitation of SimCSE-style dropout for long documents in general.

## Next Checks

1. **Establish patent-specificity**: Train the same dropout-only and section-based models on arXiv long documents (abstract + full text) with similar length characteristics. Compare SSD trajectories and downstream performance to determine if over-dispersion is unique to patents or a general long-document issue.

2. **Test section diversity necessity**: For the same document pairs, compute sentence-level semantic similarity between abstract and each section. Correlate this similarity distribution with downstream task performance to quantify whether semantic divergence between sections is predictive of representation quality.

3. **Validate task specialization causality**: Conduct section-swapping experiments where claims are used for classification and background for retrieval. Measure performance degradation to establish whether the observed task specialization is functional or coincidental.
