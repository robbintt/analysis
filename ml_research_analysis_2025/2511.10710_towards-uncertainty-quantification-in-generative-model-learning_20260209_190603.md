# Towards Uncertainty Quantification in Generative Model Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10710
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10710
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: Introduces ensemble-based precision-recall curves for quantifying model uncertainty in generative models, showing intermediate model complexities achieve lower uncertainty than under/over-parameterized models

## Executive Summary
This position paper addresses a fundamental gap in generative model evaluation: the lack of uncertainty quantification regarding the closeness between learned and target distributions. While existing approaches focus on sample-level uncertainty, the authors formalize the problem of measuring confidence in distribution approximation capabilities. The core method introduces ensemble-based precision-recall curves as a diagnostic tool, training multiple models with different initializations and aggregating their PR curves to capture model uncertainty through variability in precision values.

The work establishes a foundation for systematic uncertainty-aware evaluation of generative models, enabling more reliable comparisons between architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics rather than point estimates alone. Preliminary experiments on synthetic truncated Gaussian ring datasets demonstrate that intermediate model complexities (C=2,4) exhibit lower uncertainty than both underparameterized (C=1) and overparameterized (C=8) models, with statistical hypothesis testing showing significant performance differences.

## Method Summary
The approach trains M=30 DDPM models with different random initializations for each architecture configuration (C∈{1,2,4,8}). For each model, precision-recall curves are computed using kNN-based methods (N_Φ=500 slope values) on a synthetic truncated Gaussian ring dataset (20,000 samples in 2D). All PR curves are interpolated onto a common recall grid, and uncertainty is quantified using 10th-90th percentile intervals of precision values at each recall level. Statistical hypothesis testing (paired t-tests) compares model configurations, while AUPRC provides overall performance rankings. The method specifically targets model uncertainty from initialization differences rather than data or epistemic uncertainty.

## Key Results
- Intermediate model complexities (C=2,4) exhibit lower uncertainty than both underparameterized (C=1) and overparameterized (C=8) models
- Statistical hypothesis testing shows C=4 significantly outperforms C=2 in 44.2% of the curve
- Smaller datasets increase epistemic uncertainty, with wider confidence intervals and reduced performance metrics
- Percentile-based intervals (10th-90th) provide more robust uncertainty bounds than symmetric standard deviation intervals

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Training multiple generative models with different random initializations captures model uncertainty through variability of their PR curves
- Mechanism: Each initialization produces different learned parameters and generated distributions. By computing PR curves for each model and analyzing spread at common recall levels, variance in precision values quantifies sensitivity to training stochasticity
- Core assumption: Variability across initializations is representative of model uncertainty, not optimization failure
- Evidence anchors: [Section 2] defines model-induced evaluation uncertainty as variance under initialization distribution; [Section 3] proposes ensembles of PR curves for uncertainty estimation

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Percentile-based intervals (10th-90th) provide more robust bounds than symmetric standard deviation intervals for skewed precision distributions
- Mechanism: Precision values are bounded in [0,1] and often non-normally distributed. Standard deviation intervals can produce invalid bounds (>1) and are sensitive to outliers. The 80% percentile range captures central spread while excluding extremes
- Core assumption: Central tendency of precision distribution is meaningful and outliers can obscure it
- Evidence anchors: [Section 3] notes symmetric intervals may be misleading for skewed distributions and push bounds beyond valid range

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Intermediate model complexity (C=4) achieves lower uncertainty than under/over-parameterized models due to favorable loss landscape geometry
- Mechanism: Underparameterized models have fragmented loss landscapes increasing convergence to suboptimal local minima (high variance). Overparameterized models may overfit, making learned distributions sensitive to initialization. Intermediate capacity balances expressiveness with stable convergence
- Core assumption: Synthetic truncated Gaussian ring task is representative of general distribution learning challenges
- Evidence anchors: [Section 4] shows intermediate complexities exhibit lower uncertainty; statistical tests demonstrate C=4 significantly outperforms C=2

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Precision-Recall curves for generative models**
  - Why needed here: Core evaluation metric being aggregated. Precision measures fidelity (quality of generated samples), recall measures coverage (diversity of generated distribution)
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a generative model might have high precision but low recall?

- Concept: **Aleatoric vs. Epistemic vs. Model Uncertainty**
  - Why needed here: Paper distinguishes model uncertainty (initialization, architecture choice) from data-related uncertainty. Essential for interpreting results correctly
  - Quick check question: If you increase training data size, which uncertainty type should decrease?

- Concept: **Percentile-based confidence intervals**
  - Why needed here: Core statistical tool used. Understanding why percentiles are preferred to mean±std for bounded, skewed distributions
  - Quick check question: Why might a 10th-90th percentile interval be preferred over mean±2σ for bounded metrics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - DDPM trainer -> PR curve estimator -> Common recall grid interpolator -> Uncertainty aggregator

- Critical path:
  1. Define architecture configurations (depth C ∈ {1,2,4,8})
  2. For each config: train 30 models with different seeds
  3. Generate samples and compute PR curves per model
  4. Interpolate all curves onto common recall grid
  5. Compute percentile intervals and perform hypothesis testing

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Ensemble size (M=30) vs. computational cost
  - N_Φ=500 provides smooth curves; lower values may introduce interpolation error
  - Paired t-tests assume normality; permutation tests are safer for small ensembles

- Failure signatures:
  - Extremely wide percentile bands (near 1.0) indicate unreliable model family
  - Mean precision near 0 at high recall indicates mode collapse
  - Percentile bounds exceeding [0,1] suggest bug in interpolation or insufficient ensemble size

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate synthetic ring experiment with C ∈ {1,2,4,8}, M=30 each; verify U-shaped uncertainty pattern
  2. Vary dataset size (N ∈ {5000, 10000, 15000, 20000}) with fixed C=4; confirm increased uncertainty with less data
  3. Apply to different generative architecture (e.g., VAE or GAN) to test method agnosticism; document any feature space dependencies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can single-model approaches, such as Bayesian hypernetworks, effectively estimate model uncertainty without the computational cost of training ensembles?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify reducing computational overhead as a key goal, suggesting hypernetworks as a future alternative to ensembles
- Why unresolved: Current work relies exclusively on ensemble-based diagnostics, which are computationally expensive
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating that single-model uncertainty estimates correlate strongly with empirical variability observed in ensembles

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of feature space interact with measured uncertainty when applying ensemble PR curves to high-dimensional data like images?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that applying this methodology to images might introduce challenges regarding feature choice interactions
- Why unresolved: Experiments were limited to a 2D synthetic dataset where feature extraction was trivial or unnecessary
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluations on image datasets using different pretrained feature extractors to analyze variance in uncertainty bands

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do evaluation uncertainty characteristics differ significantly across various model families (e.g., GANs, VAEs) compared to the diffusion models tested?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that uncertainty magnitude might differ across model families due to distinct learning dynamics and failure modes
- Why unresolved: Preliminary experiments restricted validation to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
- What evidence would resolve it: A benchmark study comparing uncertainty profiles of GANs, VAEs, and flow-based models on identical target distributions

## Limitations
- Uncertainty quantification relies on ensemble variability, capturing only model uncertainty from initialization, not epistemic uncertainty from architectural choices or aleatoric uncertainty from data noise
- Results demonstrated only on synthetic 2D truncated Gaussian ring dataset, limiting generalizability to real-world high-dimensional data
- 80% percentile interval (10th-90th) may not capture full distribution of precision values, potentially underestimating extreme cases

## Confidence
- High confidence: Ensemble-based PR curve aggregation methodology is sound and well-implemented
- Medium confidence: Superiority of percentile intervals over standard deviation for bounded metrics is theoretically justified but lacks direct empirical validation
- Medium confidence: U-shaped uncertainty curve across model complexities is observed but may be dataset-specific rather than universal

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on real-world datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10) to verify that the U-shaped uncertainty pattern holds across different data distributions and dimensionalities
2. Compare percentile-based intervals with alternative uncertainty quantification methods (bootstrap, Bayesian approaches) on the same ensemble to validate robustness claims
3. Analyze the sensitivity of results to ensemble size (M=10, 20, 30, 50) to determine the minimum required size for stable percentile estimates
