# Mixture of Autoencoder Experts Guidance using Unlabeled and Incomplete Data for Exploration in Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.15287
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15287
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: MoE-GUIDE achieves final mean rewards of 5282.29 on Ant and 4776.34 on Walker2d when combined with expert demonstrations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MoE-GUIDE, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages expert demonstrations to guide exploration. The method employs a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts to reconstruct expert states and generate an intrinsic reward based on reconstruction loss. This intrinsic reward is mapped through a learned function to guide the agent towards expert-like behavior, even with incomplete or imperfect demonstrations. Experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate consistent outperformance over baselines in both sparse and dense reward environments.

The key innovation lies in combining unsupervised reconstruction with expert guidance to create a robust exploration signal that remains effective even with limited or imperfect demonstration data. By using a mixture of experts rather than a single autoencoder, the method can better capture the diverse state distributions encountered during exploration while maintaining focus on expert-relevant regions of the state space.

## Method Summary
MoE-GUIDE is a reinforcement learning framework that uses expert demonstrations to guide exploration through a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts architecture. The system first trains a mixture of autoencoder experts on expert state data to learn representations of desirable states. During exploration, the agent's states are passed through these autoencoders, and the reconstruction loss serves as an intrinsic reward signal. This intrinsic reward is then mapped through a learned function to create a guidance signal that encourages the agent to explore states similar to those demonstrated by experts. The approach is designed to work with incomplete and imperfect demonstrations, making it more practical for real-world applications where perfect expert data may be unavailable.

## Key Results
- MoE-GUIDE consistently outperforms baseline methods on MuJoCo benchmarks
- Achieves final mean rewards of 5282.29 on Ant and 4776.34 on Walker2d when combined with expert demonstrations
- Demonstrates robustness to demonstration sparsity and imperfection
- Effective in both sparse and dense reward environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MoE-GUIDE works by creating a structured exploration signal that combines unsupervised learning with expert guidance. The Mixture of Autoencoder Experts learns to reconstruct expert states, and the reconstruction error serves as an intrinsic reward that indicates how "expert-like" a given state is. This creates a dense reward signal even in sparse reward environments, guiding exploration toward regions of the state space that are more likely to contain solutions. The mixture approach allows the system to handle the diversity of states encountered during exploration while maintaining sensitivity to expert-relevant regions. By mapping the intrinsic reward through a learned function, the method can adapt the strength of the guidance signal based on the specific characteristics of the task and demonstrations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Agent -> State Encoder -> Mixture of Autoencoder Experts -> Reconstruction Loss -> Intrinsic Reward Mapping -> Combined Reward -> Policy Update

**Critical Path**: The agent interacts with the environment, generating states that are encoded and passed through the mixture of autoencoders. The reconstruction losses are computed, mapped to intrinsic rewards, and combined with extrinsic rewards to update the policy. This loop drives the learning process.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity (multiple autoencoders) for improved exploration efficiency. Using a mixture of experts rather than a single autoencoder allows better handling of state space diversity but increases training time and memory requirements. The approach also assumes availability of some expert demonstrations, trading data requirements for improved guidance.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate: 1) Inadequate expert demonstrations leading to ineffective guidance, 2) Mismatch between expert states and the agent's exploration capabilities, 3) Overly strong or weak intrinsic reward scaling, 4) Insufficient capacity in the autoencoder mixture to capture relevant state distributions.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test the autoencoder mixture's ability to reconstruct expert states across different environment complexities
2. Evaluate the intrinsic reward signal quality by visualizing reconstruction losses across state space regions
3. Perform ablation studies removing the mixture component to assess its contribution to performance
