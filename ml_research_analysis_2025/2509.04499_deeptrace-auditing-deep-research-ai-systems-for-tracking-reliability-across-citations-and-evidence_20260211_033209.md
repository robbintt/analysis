# DeepTRACE: Auditing Deep Research AI Systems for Tracking Reliability Across Citations and Evidence

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.04499
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04499
- **Reference count**: 19
- **Primary result**: Automated audit framework measuring eight reliability dimensions across nine popular generative search engines and deep research agents, revealing high rates of one-sided, overconfident responses and unsupported statements.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DeepTRACE, an automated sociotechnical audit framework for evaluating generative search engines (GSEs) and deep research agents (DRs). DeepTRACE measures eight reliability dimensions: answer balance (one-sidedness), confidence calibration, relevance, source citation practices, factual support, and citation accuracy. Using LLM-judge validation against human raters, the authors evaluated nine popular models on 303 queries, finding high rates of one-sided, overconfident responses in GSEs and large fractions of unsupported statements across all models. Citation accuracy ranged from 40-80%, and listing more sources did not improve grounding. While DRs reduced overconfidence, they still produced one-sided answers and verbose, low-relevance text. The results highlight that more sources and longer answers do not guarantee reliability, and call for sociotechnically grounded evaluation to guide the development of trustworthy, transparent AI research tools.

## Method Summary
DeepTRACE is an automated framework that audits generative search engines and deep research agents across eight reliability dimensions. The system takes user queries, model responses, and source URLs as input, then uses an LLM-judge (GPT-5) to decompose answers into statements, classify stance (Pro/Con), and build a Factual Support Matrix determining if sources support each statement. It computes metrics including one-sidedness, confidence calibration, relevance, uncited sources, unsupported statements, source necessity (via bipartite graph analysis and Hopcroft-Karp algorithm), citation accuracy, and citation thoroughness. The framework was validated against human annotators with 0.72 Pearson correlation for confidence scoring and 0.62 for factual support.

## Key Results
- GSEs produced highly one-sided, overconfident responses with up to 78.7% one-sided answers and 70% overconfident statements
- Listing more sources did not improve grounding - systems with many sources often had low Source Necessity scores
- Citation accuracy ranged from 40-80% across models, with no clear correlation between source count and accuracy
- Deep Research Agents reduced overconfidence but remained one-sided (e.g., GPT-5(DR) 54.7% one-sided on debate queries)
- Unsupported statements were common across all models, with some systems producing up to 40% unsupported content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Decomposing generated answers into atomic statements allows for the detection of factual hallucinations that holistic evaluation misses.
- **Mechanism**: The framework segments answer text into discrete statements and scrapes the full text of cited URLs. It then constructs a Factual Support Matrix where an LLM-judge determines if specific source content supports each statement, flagging "Unsupported Statements."
- **Core assumption**: An LLM-judge can reliably approximate human judgment on factual entailment, even though the paper notes only "moderate agreement" (Pearson 0.62) for this specific task.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section 3.1.1]: "Decomposing the answer into statements allows to study the factual backing... at a granular level... common in fact-checking literature." [section 3.1.4]: Defines *Unsupported Statements* as those where the factual support matrix has no checked cells for a relevant statement.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Bipartite graph analysis distinguishes "source stuffing" (listing unnecessary references) from evidential necessity.
- **Mechanism**: The framework models the relationship between sources and statements as a bipartite graph. It uses the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm to find a minimum vertex cover, identifying the minimum set of sources required to support all verifiable claims.
- **Core assumption**: A source is "necessary" only if it provides unique factual coverage not found in other sources, ignoring potential benefits of redundant corroboration for readers.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section 3.1.4]: "Finding which source is necessary is equivalent to determining the minimum vertex cover... We use the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm." [results]: Noted that BingChat lists many sources but "only about half are necessary," exposing a "quantity without quality" trade-off.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Sociotechnical metric design (mapping user-identified failures to code) enables the detection of "echo chambers" and "sycophancy" in debate contexts.
- **Mechanism**: The framework categorizes statements as "Pro," "Con," or "Neutral" relative to the query's implied bias. A binary "One-Sided Answer" flag is triggered if opposing viewpoints are absent, specifically identifying systems that blindly align with a user's potentially biased prompt.
- **Core assumption**: A lack of explicit "Pro/Con" statements equates to a lack of balanced perspective, whereas some answers might neutrally synthesize a consensus.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract]: "turns prior community-identified failure cases into eight measurable dimensions." [results]: "Deep-research configurations... remain highly one-sided on debate queries (e.g., GPT-5(DR) 54.7%)."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & Deep Research Agents
  - **Why needed here**: You must distinguish between simple "Generative Search Engines" (summarize top results) and "Deep Research Agents" (multi-step reasoning, planning, and tool use) to understand why the evaluation criteria for "One-Sidedness" and "Source Necessity" differ between them.
  - **Quick check question**: Does the system just summarize search results (GSE) or does it plan a research itinerary and synthesize a long-form report (DR)?

- **Concept**: Bipartite Graphs & Minimum Vertex Cover
  - **Why needed here**: This is the mathematical logic behind the "Source Necessity" metric. You need to understand how to map two sets (Statements vs. Sources) to a graph to determine the smallest subset of sources required to validate the text.
  - **Quick check question**: If Source A and Source B both support Statement 1, but only Source B supports Statement 2, which source is the "minimum vertex cover"?

- **Concept**: LLM-as-a-Judge & Validation
  - **Why needed here**: DeepTRACE relies on an LLM (GPT-5) to score confidence and factual support. You need to understand the validation step (Pearson correlation vs. human annotators) to know which metrics are reliable (Confidence = 0.72) and which are limited (Factual Support = 0.62).
  - **Quick check question**: Why is the Pearson correlation for "Factual Support" (0.62) lower than "Answer Confidence" (0.72), and how does that affect our trust in the "Unsupported Statements" metric?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (Query + Response + URLs) -> Scraper (Jina.ai) -> Processor (LLM) -> Analyzer (Bipartite Graph + Metrics) -> Output (Scorecard)
- **Critical path**: The Factual Support Matrix generation is the bottleneck. The paper mentions running ~80,000 evaluations. The reliability of the entire audit depends on the accuracy of this specific LLM-judge step.
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Scalability vs. Accuracy: The authors use an LLM judge for factual support because manual annotation of 80,000 pairs is cost-prohibitive, accepting a drop in precision (0.62 correlation).
  - Source Access: Reliance on a scraping tool (Jina.ai) means ~15% of sources are lost to paywalls or errors, potentially biasing the "Unsupported Statements" metric upward.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - "Search Fatigue": High number of listed sources but low Source Necessity and high Uncited Sources (e.g., BingChat).
  - "Echo Chamber": High confidence score (5/5) combined with One-Sided Answer = 1.
  - "Verbose Hallucination": High statement count with high % of Unsupported Statements (e.g., YouChat(DR)).
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run a baseline audit: Execute the pipeline on a set of debate queries using a standard RAG model (GPT-4.5) to establish a baseline for "One-Sided Answer" rates.
  2. Judge Validation: Manually annotate a small batch (e.g., 20 query-response pairs) to verify the LLM-judge's Factual Support Matrix against human perception in your specific domain.
  3. Source Ablation: Intentionally remove low-necessity sources from a prompt to see if the "Relevant Statements" score improves, testing the paper's claim that "more sources do not guarantee better grounding."

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: How can automated auditing frameworks evaluate the factual correctness of an answer (the "right answer") rather than just its reliability dimensions (format, citation, confidence)?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section: "We do not evaluate for whether the answer to the question is the right answer but rather focus on the answer format, sources retrieved and citations used."
- **Why unresolved**: Establishing ground truth for open-ended, complex research queries is significantly more difficult than verifying citation links or stylistic confidence.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An extension of the DeepTRACE dataset including expert-validated "gold standard" answers for the expertise queries, allowing for semantic similarity or factual overlap scoring.

- **Question**: To what extent do multimodal elements and user interface (UI) designs in deep research tools influence user trust compared to the textual reliability metrics?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper notes: "Future work should extend this evaluation to multimodal and interface-level factors... [current work] excluding multimodal or UI-level interactions that also shape user trust."
- **Why unresolved**: DeepTRACE relies on automated browser scripts to extract text and URLs, ignoring how the visual presentation of confidence or sources impacts the user's sociotechnical experience.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A study incorporating computer-vision-based auditing of UI layouts alongside the current text-based metrics to correlate visual design patterns with user trust calibration.

## Limitations
- Does not evaluate whether answers are factually correct, only their reliability dimensions (format, citation, confidence)
- Relies heavily on LLM-judge with moderate human agreement (0.62 Pearson) for factual support and source classification
- Approximately 15% of source URLs fail to be scraped due to paywalls or 404 errors, potentially biasing results

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The finding that more sources and longer answers do not guarantee better reliability is well-supported across multiple metrics (Source Necessity, Relevance, Unsupported Statements).
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that Deep Research Agents reduce overconfidence but remain one-sided has good supporting data, but the moderate agreement rates for stance classification (0.62 Pearson) introduce uncertainty.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of results beyond the 303 queries in the DeepTRACE corpus is limited.

## Next Checks
1. Validate Factual Support Matrix: Manually annotate 50-100 statement-source pairs from your domain to verify GPT-5's factual support judgments match human perception before full deployment.
2. Test Source Necessity Sensitivity: Systematically remove low-necessity sources from model responses and measure whether relevant statements scores improve, confirming the "quantity without quality" finding holds in your context.
3. Cross-Validate Stance Classification: Test the Pro/Con classification mechanism on non-debate technical queries to identify where the binary stance framework fails, then develop domain-specific classification strategies.
