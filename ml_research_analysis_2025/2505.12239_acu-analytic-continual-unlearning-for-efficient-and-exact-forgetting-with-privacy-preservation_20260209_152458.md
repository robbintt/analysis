## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ACU, a gradient-free method for Continual Unlearning that achieves exact forgetting without requiring access to retained data. The key insight is that gradient-based updates make unlearning difficult due to entangled parameter dependencies, so ACU instead uses an analytical closed-form solution via least squares estimation. The method employs a frozen pre-trained feature extractor and recursively updates a Knowledge Tracking Matrix to efficiently compute exact unlearning requests. Theoretical analysis proves ACU achieves identical results to re-training on the retained dataset.

## Method Summary
ACU uses a frozen pre-trained backbone to extract features, then applies a linear classifier trained via closed-form least squares regression. During the Continual Learning (CL) phase, it builds a Knowledge Tracking Matrix T that summarizes the influence of all historical data. When unlearning requests arrive, ACU uses the Woodbury matrix identity to recursively update T and the model parameters without accessing retained data. The MSE loss with L2 regularization enables the analytical solution, while the frozen backbone ensures the unlearning scope is limited to CL-phase knowledge only.

## Key Results
- Achieves zero deviation from optimal models across all metrics (parameter differences, retained/forgetting/test accuracy gaps, and MIA indicators)
- 50-125× faster than baseline unlearning methods
- Maintains stability under frequent unlearning requests (1.43× runtime increase for 2× requests)
- Demonstrates exact forgetting while preserving data privacy through compressed Knowledge Tracking Matrix

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Replacing gradient-based updates with closed-form least squares solutions enables exact, provable forgetting without accessing retained data. The optimization objective uses MSE with L2 regularization, yielding analytical solution W = (F^T F + γI)^(-1) F^T Y. The Woodbury matrix identity enables recursive updates to both Knowledge Tracking Matrix T and model W without recomputing from scratch. This assumes frozen backbone features are sufficiently discriminative for linear classification.

### Mechanism 2
The Knowledge Tracking Matrix T serves as a compressed, privacy-preserving summary of all historical data influence, enabling exact recursive unlearning. T = (Σ f^T f + γI)^(-1) has rank R ≤ d_F << N, cannot be inverted to recover original data, yet captures sufficient information to compute what the retrained model would be. This assumes regularization parameter γ > 0 ensures positive-definiteness and numerical stability.

### Mechanism 3
Freezing the pre-trained backbone limits unlearning scope to the CL phase only, avoiding entangled parameter dependencies that make gradient-based unlearning intractable. The backbone Θ is frozen; only the analytic classifier W is updated. This decouples feature learning from classification, enabling the closed-form solution. This assumes the pre-trained backbone is trustworthy and free from privacy-sensitive knowledge requiring unlearning.

## Foundational Learning

- **Woodbury Matrix Identity**: Enables O(d_F^2 |D̃_i|) updates instead of O(d_F^3) full inversions; core to recursive efficiency. Quick check: Given (A + BCD)^(-1), can you derive the equivalent expression avoiding direct inversion of the augmented matrix?

- **Ridge Regression (L2-Regularized Least Squares)**: The MSE + γ||W||² objective is standard ridge regression; understanding the bias-variance tradeoff informs γ selection. Quick check: What happens to the closed-form solution as γ → 0 or γ → ∞?

- **Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning**: CU is the inverse problem—removing knowledge without collateral damage to retained knowledge. Both stem from parameter interference. Quick check: Why does gradient descent on sequential data cause forgetting, and how does a closed-form solution avoid this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Frozen backbone Θ -> Feature extraction G(·) -> Knowledge Tracking Matrix T -> Analytic classifier W

- **Critical path**: 
  1. CL Phase: Initialize T_{-M} = (γI)^(-1); for each learning batch, update T via Eq. 45; compute final W_0 via Eq. 3
  2. CU Phase: For each unlearning request i, extract features F̃_i from D̃_i; update T_i via Eq. 5; update W_i via Eq. 6
  3. Output: Final model W_K after K requests

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Exactness vs. Scope: Exact unlearning guaranteed for CL knowledge; pre-training knowledge is immutable
  - Efficiency vs. Feature Quality: Frozen backbone limits adaptability but enables O(d_F^3) complexity per request instead of O(N) re-training
  - MSE vs. Cross-Entropy: MSE enables closed-form solution but may underperform CE for some classification tasks

- **Failure signatures**: 
  - Numerical instability: If γ is too small, T may become ill-conditioned; monitor condition number
  - Feature collapse: If G(·) is poorly designed, linear separability fails; check classifier accuracy on validation set
  - Memory blowup: If d_F > ~10,000, T storage exceeds GPU memory; apply dimensionality reduction

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline verification**: Implement ACU on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 backbone; verify ∆Params = 0 against re-trained model after 5 unlearning requests
  2. **Scalability test**: Measure cumulative runtime for K=25 vs K=50 requests; confirm near-linear scaling (paper reports 1.43× increase for 2× requests)
  3. **Privacy stress test**: Apply Membership Inference Attack (MIA) on forgotten samples; confirm ∆MIA = 0 indicating distributional indistinguishability from re-trained model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can ACU be extended to unlearn knowledge within the pre-trained backbone, rather than limiting unlearning to the analytic classifier?
- Does ACU's efficiency hold when scaling to the high-dimensional embeddings typical of modern foundation models?
- Can the analytical closed-form solution be adapted for Cross-Entropy loss to align with standard classification training pipelines?

## Limitations
- Cannot unlearn knowledge acquired during pre-training due to frozen backbone constraint
- Critical hyperparameters (G(·) function, γ value, feature dimension d_F) remain unspecified
- MSE loss prioritizes analytical tractability over potentially superior classification performance from CE loss

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core mathematical framework is sound and provably exact for CL-phase unlearning
- **Medium Confidence**: Efficiency claims and scalability results appear robust for tested configurations
- **Low Confidence**: Privacy guarantees lack formal cryptographic analysis beyond empirical MIA evaluations

## Next Checks
1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary γ, d_F, and G(·) implementation to identify optimal configurations and determine robustness boundaries

2. **Pre-training Privacy Gap Evaluation**: Design experiments where pre-training data contains known forgettable content to measure privacy violations from immutable pre-training knowledge

3. **Cryptographic Privacy Formalization**: Collaborate with privacy researchers to formally prove that Knowledge Tracking Matrix T provides differential privacy guarantees
