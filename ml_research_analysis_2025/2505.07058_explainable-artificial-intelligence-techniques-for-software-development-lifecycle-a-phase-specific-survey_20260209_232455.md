# Explainable Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Software Development Lifecycle: A Phase-specific Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.07058
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07058
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** First comprehensive survey mapping XAI techniques to all SDLC phases, revealing 68% of XAI research focuses on maintenance while only 8% addresses requirements and management phases.

## Executive Summary
This survey addresses the critical gap in explainable AI (XAI) research for software development lifecycle (SDLC) phases by systematically categorizing techniques according to their applicability in requirements elicitation, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The authors found a significant imbalance in existing research, with 68% of studies focusing on maintenance phases while early-stage phases remain underrepresented. By presenting phase-specific XAI methods including LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, rule extraction, attention mechanisms, and concept-based explanations, the survey provides a roadmap for integrating explainable AI throughout the software engineering process. The work emphasizes the need for standardized evaluation metrics and deeper integration of XAI into earlier development stages to build trust and ensure responsible AI deployment in software engineering contexts.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a mixed-methods systematic literature review using peer-reviewed articles from IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct, Wiley, Google Scholar, and Scopus published within the last 6 years. Using keywords like "XAI", "Explainable Artificial Intelligence", "Software Engineering", "AI-aided development", "trust", "transparency", and "ethical AI", they performed both systematic and narrative reviews to identify XAI techniques and map them to specific SDLC phases. Papers were classified by phase (requirements elicitation, design, development, testing, deployment/monitoring, maintenance/evolution) and by XAI technique type, enabling the calculation of distribution statistics and synthesis of phase-specific recommendations.

## Key Results
- 68% of existing XAI research in software engineering focuses on maintenance phases, while only 8% addresses requirements and management phases
- The survey presents the first comprehensive mapping of XAI techniques (LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, rule extraction, attention mechanisms, concept-based explanations) to all six SDLC phases
- SHAP and LIME are recommended for requirements elicitation to reveal influential features in user satisfaction, while counterfactual explanations can clarify trade-offs
- The work identifies a critical research gap and calls for standardized evaluation metrics and deeper integration of XAI into earlier development stages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Feature Attribution via Local Approximation (LIME/SHAP)
- **Claim:** Feature attribution techniques reveal which input factors most influence AI predictions in SDLC tasks, enabling stakeholders to validate or challenge recommendations.
- **Mechanism:** LIME perturbs input features and trains weighted linear models to approximate complex model behavior locally. SHAP calculates Shapley values representing average marginal contribution of each feature across all combinations.
- **Core assumption:** Local approximations sufficiently represent decision boundaries for practical explanation purposes in software engineering contexts.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "SHAP can reveal influential features in user satisfaction"; corpus shows weak evidence as related papers discuss XAI generally without SDLC-specific validation.
- **Break condition:** When decision boundaries are highly non-linear or stakeholders lack domain knowledge to interpret importance scores meaningfully.

### Mechanism 2: Counterfactual Reasoning for Trade-off Clarification
- **Claim:** Counterfactual explanations help stakeholders understand system sensitivity and trade-offs by showing minimal input changes that would alter outputs.
- **Mechanism:** Identifies least modification to input features adequate to change model prediction to specified alternative, providing "what-if" scenarios.
- **Core assumption:** Stakeholders can effectively reason about "what-if" scenarios to understand system behavior and make informed decisions.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "counterfactual explanations can clarify trade-offs"; corpus shows limited validation as related papers mention counterfactuals without SDLC trade-off analysis.
- **Break condition:** When multiple equally valid counterfactuals exist without clear prioritization or suggested changes violate hard constraints.

### Mechanism 3: Rule Extraction and Concept-Based Explanation for Global Interpretability
- **Claim:** Rule extraction and concept-based explanations provide global interpretability by surfacing decision logic as human-readable rules or abstract concepts.
- **Mechanism:** Rule extraction generates "if-then" logic approximating model decisions; concept-based explanations discover higher-level abstractions driving model decisions.
- **Core assumption:** Complex model decisions can be adequately approximated by simplified rules or abstract concepts without losing critical information.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract lists "rule extraction" and "concept-based explanations" among key methods; corpus shows weak evidence as related papers discuss techniques broadly without SDLC validation.
- **Break condition:** When models operate on high-dimensional data where extracted rules become too numerous or discovered concepts are too abstract to be actionable.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Black-box vs. White-box Models**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames XAI as addressing the "black-box problem" where AI outputs lack understandable explanations. Distinguishing inherently interpretable models from opaque models determines whether post-hoc XAI is required.
  - Quick check question: Given a random forest model recommending code refactoring, would you need post-hoc XAI techniques, and if so, which category?

- **Concept: Local vs. Global Explanation Scope**
  - Why needed here: The paper classifies XAI techniques by scope. Local explanations suit debugging specific test failures or code suggestions. Global explanations suit validating overall model behavior for requirements or design decisions.
  - Quick check question: To verify that a bug prediction model aligns with your team's understanding of defect-prone patterns across the codebase, would you prioritize local or global explanations?

- **Concept: Post-hoc vs. Ante-hoc Explainability**
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes ante-hoc (explainability built into model design) from post-hoc (explanations generated after training). This affects architecture decisions—ante-hoc may constrain model choice, while post-hoc adds computational overhead.
  - Quick check question: If you must use a specific pre-trained LLM for requirements analysis, are you limited to ante-hoc or post-hoc XAI approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Requirements Elicitation -> SHAP/LIME for influential features, Counterfactuals for trade-offs; Design -> Counterfactuals for trade-off justification, Rule extraction for pattern selection, Concept-based for design rationale; Development -> LIME/SHAP for debugging, Example-based for validation, Counterfactuals for sensitivity; Testing -> LIME/SHAP for root cause, Counterfactuals for test sensitivity; Deployment/Monitoring -> LIME/SHAP for anomaly source, Counterfactuals for resource decisions; Maintenance -> LIME/SHAP for localization, Attention for summarization, Counterfactuals for change impact

- **Critical path:** 1) Identify SDLC phase and specific AI application requiring explainability; 2) Determine explanation scope needed (local/global); 3) Assess whether model-agnostic techniques are required; 4) Select technique matching phase-specific challenges; 5) Validate explanation quality with domain stakeholders before production deployment

- **Design tradeoffs:** LIME is computationally faster but less theoretically grounded than SHAP; counterfactuals are intuitive but may produce unrealistic suggestions; rule extraction provides auditability but may oversimplify; attention mechanisms require Transformer architectures but provide built-in explanations

- **Failure signatures:** Explanations that don't match stakeholder mental models; feature importance scores contradicting domain expertise; counterfactuals suggesting impossible changes; rules too numerous or complex for practical use; XAI computation significantly degrading inference latency

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Apply SHAP to existing bug prediction model; survey developers on feature importance alignment with mental models; 2) Generate counterfactual explanations for design recommendations in controlled setting; measure confidence improvement; 3) Extract rules from test prioritization model; compare against team's documented heuristics for alignment assessment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarking structures are necessary to enable fair comparison of XAI effectiveness across different software engineering phases?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Discussion states that the "lack of standardized evaluation metrics for XAI methods in software engineering makes it challenging to compare and assess the effectiveness of different methods," and the Conclusion explicitly calls for formulating benchmarking structures.
- **Why unresolved:** Current evaluation methods are inconsistent and phase-specific, preventing researchers and practitioners from uniformly assessing explanation quality or comparing tools across the SDLC.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The establishment of a unified benchmark suite or a set of accepted quantitative criteria that can measure XAI utility in requirements elicitation as effectively as in maintenance.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can XAI approaches be optimally adapted and integrated into agile and DevOps-focused development paradigms?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion explicitly states that "Future research needs to explore the optimal application of the tested and realized XAI approaches in agile and DevOps focused development paradigms."
- **Why unresolved:** Most existing research focuses on distinct SDLC phases in isolation, failing to account for the continuous, iterative, and rapid integration cycles that define modern agile and DevOps workflows.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies demonstrating how specific XAI tools function within Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines without introducing latency or disrupting development velocity.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can deep neural networks be explained effectively enough to satisfy the specific correctness and safety requirements of software engineering tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Discussion notes that "XAI methods are often ineffective in explaining the behavior of advanced AI models, such as deep neural networks," and the Introduction highlights the need for reliability in AI-aided software engineering.
- **Why unresolved:** The "black-box" nature of high-performing deep learning models limits the ability of software engineers to verify the reasoning behind code generation or design recommendations, hindering trust and safety.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The development of model-specific XAI techniques that provide rigorous, formal guarantees or logical proofs of correctness for AI-generated software artifacts, rather than just feature importance scores.

## Limitations
- The survey's findings are constrained by literature search parameters and database coverage, potentially missing relevant XAI applications in software engineering
- Classification of papers into SDLC phases relies on author interpretation, which may introduce categorization inconsistencies
- The 68% concentration in maintenance suggests publication bias toward downstream phases rather than balanced representation across the lifecycle

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The documented distribution of XAI research across SDLC phases (68% maintenance, 8% requirements) based on systematic literature review methodology
- **Medium Confidence:** The mapping of specific XAI techniques to phase-specific challenges, as this relies on logical inference from technique properties rather than empirical validation
- **Medium Confidence:** The identified research gap regarding limited XAI attention to early SDLC phases, given the literature coverage limitations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a targeted search for XAI applications in requirements and design phases to verify the claimed 8% distribution represents actual scarcity versus literature discovery limitations
2. Implement a controlled experiment applying SHAP to an existing requirements prioritization model and assess whether stakeholders find the explanations actionable for decision-making
3. Compare the survey's phase-specific XAI recommendations against real-world implementations in industry software development projects to identify practical gaps between theory and practice
