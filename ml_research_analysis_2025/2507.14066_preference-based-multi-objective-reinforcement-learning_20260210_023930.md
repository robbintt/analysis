# Preference-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.14066
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14066

- Primary result: Pb-MORL eliminates complex reward engineering by using human preferences to guide policy optimization, achieving competitive performance with EQL on benchmark tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Pb-MORL, a preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that eliminates the need for complex reward engineering by using human preferences to guide policy optimization. The authors theoretically prove that preferences can derive policies across the entire Pareto frontier, and propose a method to construct a multi-objective reward model aligned with given preferences. The framework combines a Bradley-Terry model for preference prediction with cross-entropy loss optimization, then applies Envelope Q-Learning (EQL) for policy optimization.

Extensive experiments on benchmark multi-objective tasks, a multi-energy management system, and an autonomous driving task demonstrate that Pb-MORL performs competitively, matching or surpassing the oracle method that uses ground truth reward functions. Notably, Pb-MORL achieved comparable expected utility to EQL on Deep Sea Treasure and Resource Gathering tasks, surpassed EQL on Fruit Tree task in both expected utility and hypervolume metrics, and showed superior performance on energy management and highway driving tasks. The method's ability to handle complex, real-world scenarios with conflicting objectives makes it promising for practical applications where reward function design is challenging.

## Method Summary
Pb-MORL combines preference learning with multi-objective reinforcement learning to eliminate complex reward engineering. The framework uses a Bradley-Terry model to predict human preferences between state-action pairs, then optimizes a multi-objective reward model using cross-entropy loss. This learned reward model guides policy optimization through Envelope Q-Learning (EQL), which handles multiple objectives by constructing an envelope of value functions. The theoretical foundation proves that preference-based learning can derive policies across the entire Pareto frontier, making it a viable alternative to traditional reward function design in multi-objective settings.

## Key Results
- Pb-MORL achieved comparable expected utility to EQL on Deep Sea Treasure and Resource Gathering tasks
- Surpassed EQL on Fruit Tree task in both expected utility and hypervolume metrics
- Showed superior performance on energy management and highway driving tasks compared to methods using ground truth rewards

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging human preferences as a proxy for complex reward functions, which are often difficult to specify correctly in multi-objective scenarios. By using the Bradley-Terry model to predict preferences between state-action pairs, the framework can learn a reward function that captures the implicit trade-offs humans make. The cross-entropy loss optimization ensures the learned reward model aligns with these preferences, while EQL provides an efficient way to optimize policies across multiple objectives simultaneously. This approach effectively bypasses the need for explicit reward engineering while maintaining strong performance across diverse tasks.

## Foundational Learning

Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning: Why needed - Most real-world problems involve multiple conflicting objectives; Quick check - Can the agent balance trade-offs between objectives effectively?

Preference Learning: Why needed - Humans can easily express preferences but struggle to specify exact reward functions; Quick check - Does the learned reward model accurately reflect provided preferences?

Pareto Optimality: Why needed - In multi-objective settings, no single solution dominates all others; Quick check - Does the algorithm explore diverse solutions along the Pareto frontier?

Bradley-Terry Model: Why needed - Provides probabilistic framework for pairwise comparison modeling; Quick check - Does the model accurately predict preference rankings?

Envelope Q-Learning: Why needed - Handles multiple objectives by maintaining envelope of value functions; Quick check - Does the algorithm converge to optimal policies across all objectives?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Human preferences -> Bradley-Terry model -> Cross-entropy optimization -> Multi-objective reward model -> EQL policy optimization -> Pareto optimal policies

Critical Path: Preference input → Reward model learning → Policy optimization → Performance evaluation

Design Tradeoffs: Preference-based learning reduces reward engineering complexity but requires sufficient preference data; EQL provides efficient multi-objective optimization but may struggle with very high-dimensional objective spaces

Failure Signatures: Poor preference data quality leads to suboptimal reward models; Inconsistent preferences cause model confusion; Insufficient preference samples limit Pareto frontier coverage

First Experiments:
1. Validate Bradley-Terry preference prediction accuracy on synthetic preference data
2. Test reward model learning with controlled preference distributions
3. Verify EQL optimization performance on simple two-objective benchmark tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance heavily depends on quality and quantity of preference data provided
- Bradley-Terry model may struggle with inconsistent or noisy human preferences
- Framework scalability to high-dimensional action spaces and complex state representations remains unproven

## Confidence

Theoretical foundation for Pareto frontier coverage: Medium
Empirical performance claims: High
Real-world applicability: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Test Pb-MORL on environments with sparse or delayed rewards to assess preference learning robustness
2. Evaluate performance degradation with noisy or contradictory preference inputs
3. Scale experiments to problems with 10+ objectives to test framework scalability
