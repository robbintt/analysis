- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00301

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a scientific machine learning method for learning structure-preserving reduced-order models (ROMs) of nonlinear conservative partial differential equations (PDEs). The approach leverages lifting variable transformations to expose quadratic structure in the dynamics, then learns only linear reduced operators while deriving quadratic terms analytically from the PDE structure. This ensures the learned ROMs conserve a perturbed version of the original system's energy exactly, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction approaches.

## Method Summary
Structure-preserving Lift & Learn employs lifting variable transformations to quadratize the dynamics of nonlinear conservative PDEs. The method learns reduced-order models by focusing on linear operators while analytically deriving quadratic terms from the PDE structure. This approach ensures energy conservation in the learned ROMs through exact conservation of a perturbed energy, bounded by the difference between the true discretized energy and its quadratic approximation. The method is particularly effective when nonlinear terms are known symbolically but discretized operators are not available.

## Key Results
- Learned ROMs conserve a perturbed version of the original system's energy exactly, with error bounded by ∥êD − bD∥
- Numerical experiments on three nonlinear conservative PDEs show accuracy and computational efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction approaches
- The method demonstrates good generalization capabilities outside the training data regime
- Structure-preserving Lift & Learn outperforms traditional intrusive model reduction methods in terms of computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits the inherent structure of conservative PDEs by transforming them into quadratic form through lifting variables. This transformation reveals underlying energy-preserving structure that can be exploited in reduced-order modeling. By learning only the linear components while deriving quadratic terms analytically, the approach maintains computational efficiency while ensuring exact energy conservation up to a bounded perturbation. The quadratization framework allows for efficient computation of reduced operators while preserving the fundamental conservation properties of the original system.

## Foundational Learning
- **Energy conservation in Hamiltonian systems**: Why needed - The method relies on the energy-preserving structure of conservative PDEs to derive structure-preserving ROMs. Quick check - Verify the system has a known Hamiltonian formulation.
- **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)**: Why needed - Standard ROM technique used to generate initial reduced basis from snapshot data. Quick check - Ensure sufficient training data is available for POD convergence.
- **Quadratic differential equations**: Why needed - The lifting transformation exposes quadratic structure that enables exact energy conservation in the reduced model. Quick check - Confirm the nonlinear terms can be quadratized analytically.
- **Symplectic geometry**: Why needed - Provides mathematical framework for understanding structure preservation in Hamiltonian systems. Quick check - Verify the lifted system maintains symplectic structure.
- **Data-driven model reduction**: Why needed - The method learns reduced operators from data rather than relying on full-order model operators. Quick check - Ensure adequate training data coverage of state space.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Lifting Transformation -> Reduced Operator Learning -> Energy Conservation Verification -> ROM Simulation

Critical Path:
1. Apply lifting transformation to expose quadratic structure
2. Generate training data via FOM simulations
3. Learn reduced linear operators via constrained optimization
4. Verify energy conservation properties
5. Simulate ROM and compare with FOM

Design Tradeoffs:
- Computational efficiency vs. approximation accuracy in lifting transformation
- Training data requirements vs. generalization capability
- Exact energy conservation vs. model complexity
- Symbolic knowledge requirements vs. automation potential

Failure Signatures:
- Energy drift indicates incorrect lifting transformation or learned operators
- Poor generalization suggests insufficient training data coverage
- Numerical instability may arise from ill-conditioned reduced operators
- Inaccurate predictions could result from suboptimal basis selection

First Experiments:
1. Apply method to simple nonlinear oscillator (e.g., Duffing oscillator) to validate basic functionality
2. Test on 1D nonlinear wave equation with known analytical solution
3. Compare energy conservation error across different training data sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the process of deriving quadratic reduced terms in structure-preserving Lift & Learn be fully automated using optimal quadratization frameworks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future research directions motivated by this work are: automating the process of deriving quadratic reduced terms in structure-preserving Lift & Learn via the optimal quadratization framework [47]"
- Why unresolved: The current approach requires manual derivation of energy-quadratizing lifting transformations based on knowledge of the PDE nonlinearity. Automating this would broaden applicability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of an algorithmic procedure that automatically identifies optimal auxiliary variables and quadratic structure for a given nonlinear conservative PDE.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are rigorous error bounds for the difference between nonlinear FOM energy approximation obtained via intrusive and nonintrusive quadratic ROMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "deriving error bounds for the difference between nonlinear FOM energy approximation obtained via intrusive and nonintrusive quadratic ROMs" listed as future research direction
- Why unresolved: Proposition 1 shows the learned ROM conserves a perturbed energy, bounded by ∥êD − bD∥, but tight bounds relating this perturbation to FOM energy approximation error remain unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis providing provable bounds on |E(FOM) − E(ROM)| in terms of reduced dimension, training data, and problem parameters.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can structure-preserving Lift & Learn be extended to learn robust ROMs from noisy training data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "combining the proposed method with the probabilistic learning framework in [49] to use it for learning structure-preserving ROMs from noisy data"
- Why unresolved: The current constrained optimization formulation assumes clean snapshot data; noise in measurements could corrupt the learned symmetric operators and degrade energy conservation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integration with Bayesian/probabilistic frameworks demonstrating bounded energy error and stable predictions when trained on data with measurement noise.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What guarantees the long-term boundedness of nonintrusive quadratic ROMs learned via this approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "studying the long-term boundedness of nonintrusive quadratic ROMs using the theoretical framework from [48]"
- Why unresolved: Numerical experiments show bounded energy error over tested time horizons, but theoretical guarantees for asymptotic long-time behavior remain unestablished.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical proof that ROM trajectories remain bounded for all time, or characterization of conditions under which unbounded growth occurs.

## Limitations
- The method requires analytical knowledge of nonlinear terms to derive lifting transformations, limiting applicability to problems where such knowledge is available
- Performance depends on the quality of the lifting transformation, which may not exist or be difficult to find for certain nonlinear systems
- The approach assumes the availability of sufficient training data to accurately learn reduced operators while maintaining structure preservation
- Extension to systems with non-conservative terms or more complex nonlinearities remains unexplored

## Confidence

High:
- The theoretical framework for energy conservation in learned ROMs is mathematically sound and rigorously proven
- Numerical experiments demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art structure-preserving methods

Medium:
- The method's computational efficiency claims are supported by experiments on three test problems
- Generalization capabilities are demonstrated but not extensively quantified

Low:
- Claims about long-time behavior and energy conservation error accumulation over extended simulations are not thoroughly validated
- The narrow applicability window due to symbolic knowledge requirements is acknowledged but not fully explored

## Next Checks

1. Test the method on a fourth nonlinear conservative PDE with different structural characteristics (e.g., higher-dimensional state space or non-polynomial nonlinearities) to assess robustness and limitations of the lifting transformation approach.

2. Conduct long-time simulations (multiple periods) to quantify energy conservation error accumulation and compare with baseline structure-preserving methods under varying initial conditions.

3. Perform systematic out-of-sample testing with initial conditions increasingly distant from the training data to measure generalization performance and identify the method's extrapolation limits.
