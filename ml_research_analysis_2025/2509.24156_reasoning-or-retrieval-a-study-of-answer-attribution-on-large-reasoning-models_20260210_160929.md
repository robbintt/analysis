# Reasoning or Retrieval? A Study of Answer Attribution on Large Reasoning Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.24156
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24156
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** FARL framework achieves up to 47.8% improvement in CoT robustness, 22.8% accuracy improvement on in-domain tasks, and 5.8% accuracy improvement on out-of-domain tasks compared to base models.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates a critical limitation in Large Reasoning Models: their final answers often disconnect from their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning traces, suggesting competing mechanisms of reasoning and memory retrieval operate simultaneously. Through systematic perturbation experiments, the authors demonstrate that both mechanisms contribute to answer generation, with their relative dominance influenced by problem domains, model scales, and training approaches. To address this, they introduce FARL (Fine-Tuning with Answer Attribution and Robust Learning), a novel framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning to suppress retrieval shortcuts and strengthen reasoning dominance.

## Method Summary
The study employs joint perturbation experiments where either reasoning traces or retrieval memories are deliberately altered, then measures whether final answers shift accordingly. The FARL framework alternates between GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) updates and NPO (Neural Process Occam) unlearning steps, where unlearning targets correct answers to suppress retrieval shortcuts. The approach uses attention head probing to identify mid-layer arbitration circuits that determine reasoning vs. retrieval dominance. Models are evaluated across multiple-choice QA datasets including MMLU, ARC, and GPQA, with perturbation success rates (T-PSR and R-PSR) as primary metrics alongside accuracy and reasoning robustness.

## Key Results
- Both reasoning and retrieval mechanisms independently contribute to final answers across all tested settings
- RL-trained models exhibit stronger reasoning dominance than distilled ones
- Larger models resist retrieval-based shortcuts more effectively
- FARL achieves 47.8% improvement in CoT robustness, 22.8% accuracy improvement on in-domain tasks, and 5.8% accuracy improvement on out-of-domain tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual-Pathway Answer Generation
Final answers emerge from two competing mechanisms—Chain-of-Thought reasoning and direct memory retrieval—operating simultaneously rather than sequentially. Reasoning generates answers through explicit step-by-step computation (x → z → y), while retrieval bypasses this process by directly accessing memorized associations (x → y). The final output reflects whichever pathway dominates given context, model scale, and domain.

### Mechanism 2: Retrieval-Based Reward Hacking
During RL training, models can exploit retrieval shortcuts to achieve high rewards without developing genuine reasoning, diluting the learning signal. In GRPO, advantage is computed from answer correctness. If models retrieve correct answers from memory regardless of CoT quality, they receive positive rewards even with fabricated reasoning.

### Mechanism 3: Mid-Layer Arbitration Circuit
Attention heads in middle network layers (12-16 in tested architectures) serve as the control locus where reasoning vs. retrieval dominance is determined. Mid-layer attention heads exhibit activation patterns highly predictive (AUC > 0.8) of whether the final answer follows reasoning or retrieval.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The entire paper analyzes whether final answers actually derive from CoT traces or bypass them via retrieval. Understanding what faithful CoT looks like is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why adding explicit reasoning steps before an answer might improve complex problem-solving?

- **Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)**
  - Why needed here: The paper compares RL-trained vs. distilled models and proposes FARL built on GRPO. Understanding how reward signals shape behavior is essential.
  - Quick check question: In RL training for LLMs, what makes a reward "verifiable" and why does that matter for reasoning tasks?

- **Concept: Causal Intervention via Perturbation**
  - Why needed here: The core methodology involves controlled perturbations to isolate mechanism contributions. Without understanding causal inference logic, the experimental design is opaque.
  - Quick check question: If perturbing variable A changes outcome Y while perturbing B does not, what can you conclude about A's causal role?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input prompt x → CoT generator z (reasoning pathway) and memory lookup (retrieval pathway) → Mid-layer arbitration (layers 12-18) → Final answer y; FARL adds: Unlearning module (NPO loss) interleaved with RL updates (GRPO)
- **Critical path:** 1) Collect original CoT z and answer y from unperturbed model 2) Inject misleading cue c into reasoning OR poison memory via SFT 3) Measure whether final answer shifts toward perturbed target 4) For FARL: Alternate GRPO advantage computation with NPO unlearning on correct answers
- **Design tradeoffs:** RL vs. distillation: RL produces stronger reasoning dominance but requires more compute; distillation is faster but prone to post-hoc explanation; Model scale: Larger models resist both perturbation types better but cost more to train and serve
- **Failure signatures:** High Post-hoc Explanation Rate (PER): CoT justifies a predetermined answer rather than deriving it; High T-PSR on math/logic domains: Model is memorizing rather than computing; In-domain accuracy gains without out-of-domain gains: Likely retrieval overfitting, not reasoning
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Run baseline perturbation experiment on your model: compute R-PSR and T-PSR on MMLU Math&Logic to establish dual-pathway presence 2) Train probe classifiers on attention head activations during perturbation runs to identify your model's arbitration layer range 3) Implement FARL on a small model (1-7B) with math training data; compare in-domain vs. out-of-domain accuracy to verify reasoning generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** Can reasoning pathways be condensed to reduce inference costs without sacrificing the robustness gains achieved by unlearning-augmented RL?
- **Open Question 2:** Do the observed competition dynamics between reasoning and retrieval persist in very large reasoning models (e.g., 70B+ parameters)?
- **Open Question 3:** Does the reasoning-retrieval competition mechanism manifest similarly in open-ended tasks like code generation or long-form writing?

## Limitations
- The perturbation methodology cannot definitively prove that reasoning and retrieval operate as completely separate mechanisms rather than as integrated processes
- The study focuses primarily on math and logic domains, leaving open questions about whether similar dynamics apply to other reasoning types
- FARL framework's long-term stability remains uncertain, particularly regarding potential degradation of other capabilities

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The empirical observation that perturbation at either reasoning or retrieval levels can independently change final answers
- **Medium confidence:** The interpretation that these effects reveal competing mechanisms rather than integrated processes
- **Medium confidence:** The effectiveness of FARL in improving reasoning robustness

## Next Checks
1. Test whether reasoning vs. retrieval dominance patterns observed in math/logic domains hold for scientific reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and multi-step planning tasks
2. Monitor FARL-trained models over extended periods to verify that suppression of retrieval shortcuts doesn't lead to catastrophic forgetting of factual knowledge or emergence of new failure modes
3. Design ablation studies where either reasoning or retrieval pathways are selectively disabled (rather than perturbed) to test whether they truly operate as independent mechanisms or as coupled processes
