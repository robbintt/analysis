core_contribution: This paper analyzes why split conformal prediction, which assumes
  exchangeable data, performs well on time series data despite temporal dependence
  violating this assumption. The authors introduce a "switch coefficient" to measure

# Predictive Inference for Time Series: Why is Split Conformal Effective Despite Temporal Dependence?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.02471
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02471
- **Reference Count:** 40
- **Primary Result:** Split conformal prediction's coverage loss on time series can be bounded by a "switch coefficient" measuring temporal dependence, yielding improved theoretical guarantees over previous √n rates.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides theoretical justification for why split conformal prediction works well on time series data despite violating the exchangeability assumption. The authors introduce a novel "switch coefficient" that quantifies how temporal dependence causes violations of exchangeability when comparing subvectors of time series data. They prove that the coverage loss of split conformal prediction can be bounded by this coefficient, yielding improved theoretical guarantees compared to previous work. For β-mixing processes, this results in a coverage loss that scales linearly with the mixing lag and inversely with sample size, improving upon previous √n rates. The analysis applies to both pretrained and split conformal prediction, accommodating predictors with memory.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a theoretical framework to analyze split conformal prediction on time series data by introducing the concept of a "switch coefficient" that measures the degree to which temporal dependence violates exchangeability. They prove that the coverage loss of split conformal prediction can be bounded by this coefficient, showing that the method remains effective even when exchangeability is violated. The analysis covers both pretrained conformal prediction (where a model is trained on all data) and split conformal prediction (where data is split into training and calibration sets). The authors prove their bounds are tight and provide upper bounds on coverage to show the method is not overly conservative. The theoretical framework accommodates predictors with memory and provides insights into when split conformal prediction is likely to succeed on dependent data.

## Key Results
- The coverage loss of split conformal prediction can be bounded by a "switch coefficient" measuring temporal dependence violations of exchangeability
- For β-mixing processes, the coverage loss scales linearly with mixing lag and inversely with sample size, improving upon previous √n rates
- The theoretical bounds are proven to be tight under idealized conditions
- Both pretrained and split conformal prediction achieve similar coverage bounds when predictors have memory

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Split conformal prediction works effectively on time series data because the temporal dependence structure, while violating exchangeability, does not necessarily lead to severe coverage violations. The key insight is that the "switch coefficient" captures how much temporal dependence affects the exchangeability assumption when comparing subvectors. When this coefficient is small, the coverage loss remains bounded, explaining the empirical success of split conformal prediction on time series despite the theoretical violation of its assumptions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Exchangeability**: Why needed - fundamental assumption of conformal prediction; Quick check - verify if permutation of data points doesn't affect joint distribution
- **β-mixing processes**: Why needed - mathematical framework for modeling temporal dependence; Quick check - compute mixing coefficients for test time series
- **Conformal prediction coverage**: Why needed - quantifies prediction interval reliability; Quick check - verify empirical coverage matches theoretical guarantees
- **Switch coefficient**: Why needed - novel metric for quantifying exchangeability violations; Quick check - compute for various time series to assess suitability for split conformal
- **Subvector exchangeability**: Why needed - extends exchangeability concept to time series subsequences; Quick check - verify if subvectors maintain exchangeability properties
- **Prediction interval calibration**: Why needed - ensures intervals capture true values at desired frequency; Quick check - compute interval width vs. coverage trade-off

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Time series data → Split conformal prediction → Switch coefficient → Coverage bound
- **Critical path**: Compute switch coefficient → Apply theoretical bound → Assess coverage guarantees
- **Design tradeoffs**: Exchangeability assumption vs. practical effectiveness, theoretical tightness vs. computational feasibility
- **Failure signatures**: Large switch coefficients indicate poor performance; high mixing coefficients suggest need for alternative methods
- **3 first experiments**: 
  1. Compute switch coefficients for various synthetic time series with known dependence structures
  2. Compare theoretical bounds with empirical coverage on β-mixing processes
  3. Test sensitivity of coverage bounds to predictor memory length

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions beyond the general need for further empirical validation and extension to other dependence structures.

## Limitations
- Relies on β-mixing framework which may not capture all time series processes
- Theoretical bounds depend on mixing coefficients that can be difficult to estimate in practice
- Tightness of bounds demonstrated under idealized conditions may not translate to real-world data
- Analysis focuses on subvector exchangeability violations without fully exploring practical prediction interval quality

## Confidence
- **High** confidence in theoretical claims about coverage bounds based on rigorous mathematical proofs
- **Medium** confidence in claims about improved rates compared to previous work due to specific assumptions about mixing processes
- **Medium** confidence in practical effectiveness claims due to limited empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Empirical testing of theoretical bounds on diverse time series datasets with known mixing properties to verify practical tightness of bounds
2. Extension of analysis to non-β-mixing processes, particularly long-range dependent or heavy-tailed time series
3. Development of practical estimators for switch coefficient and mixing coefficients to assess when split conformal prediction is likely to perform well
