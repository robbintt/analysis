- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21587
- Reference count: 40
- This survey comprehensively reviews current trends and recent advances in text anonymization techniques.

## Executive Summary
This survey consolidates current knowledge on text anonymization, covering foundational Named Entity Recognition (NER)-based approaches and the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs). It examines domain-specific challenges in healthcare, law, finance, and education, alongside advanced methodologies incorporating formal privacy models like Differential Privacy and risk-aware frameworks. The paper also addresses authorship anonymization, evaluation frameworks, metrics, benchmarks, and practical toolkits for real-world deployment. It identifies emerging trends and persistent challenges, such as the evolving privacy-utility trade-off, handling quasi-identifiers, and implications of LLM capabilities, aiming to guide future research directions for both academics and practitioners.

## Method Summary
The survey methodology involved using Google Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o to screen, filter, summarize candidate papers, and refine the text. It references 82 papers and mentions TAB (Text Anonymization Benchmark) and CoNLL-2003 as evaluation datasets. The survey covers privacy-utility trade-offs, recall/precision for PII detection, re-identification risk metrics, and downstream task performance preservation.

## Key Results
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) remains the foundational mechanism for detecting explicit personally identifiable information (PII) in text anonymization.
- Large Language Models (LLMs) serve dual roles as sophisticated anonymizers and potent de-anonymization threats, leveraging contextual understanding.
- Risk-aware anonymization frameworks integrate privacy risk quantification and optimization under user-defined thresholds to balance protection and utility.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Named Entity Recognition (NER) provides the foundational signal for detecting explicit personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, locations, and organizations.
- **Mechanism:** NER models (BiLSTM-CRF, transformer-based) assign entity labels to text spans, which are then masked, redacted, or pseudonymized. Augmentation with rule-based systems and gazetteers improves recall for edge cases like nicknames and spelling errors.
- **Core assumption:** Sensitive information maps to recognizable named entity types that can be labeled consistently.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "foundational approaches, primarily centered on Named Entity Recognition"
  - [Section 2] "NER has long been a cornerstone of automated text anonymization, serving as the primary mechanism for identifying explicit mentions of PII"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; neighbor paper "Tau-Eval" addresses evaluation frameworks but not NER mechanisms specifically.
- **Break condition:** NER-only pipelines fail when implicit identifiers, quasi-identifiers, or contextual inference can re-identify individuals without explicit named entities.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Large Language Models (LLMs) function dually as sophisticated anonymizers and potent de-anonymization adversaries.
- **Mechanism:** As anonymizers, LLMs use contextual understanding to replace or generalize sensitive spans while preserving fluency (zero-shot/few-shot prompting). As adversaries, LLMs infer identities from residual contextual information remaining after standard anonymization.
- **Core assumption:** LLMs possess sufficient world knowledge and reasoning to both detect subtle PII and exploit contextual clues for re-identification.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "detailing their dual role as sophisticated anonymizers and potent de-anonymization threats"
  - [Section 3] "LLMs like GPT-3.5 can act as effective 'de-anonymizers,' inferring identities from contextual information remaining after standard anonymization"
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "How do we measure privacy in text?" surveys anonymization metrics but does not address LLM dual-role mechanisms directly.
- **Break condition:** LLM anonymization fails when consistency and completeness degrade across complex documents; de-anonymization succeeds when quasi-identifiers remain unaddressed.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Integrating explicit privacy risk measures into anonymization pipelines enables configurable trade-offs between protection and semantic utility.
- **Mechanism:** Three-step approaches combine (1) privacy-enhanced entity recognition, (2) risk assessment via BERT-based classifiers, web search, or inference simulation, and (3) optimization under risk thresholds (e.g., k-anonymity levels) to minimize semantic loss while meeting privacy constraints.
- **Core assumption:** Disclosure risk can be quantified reliably and optimized against measurable utility metrics.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 5] "a three-step approach involving a privacy-enhanced entity recognizer, privacy-risk assessment measures... and linear optimization to mask entities while minimizing semantic loss under a risk threshold"
  - [Section 5] "iteratively detect and mask terms posing the greatest re-identification risk until a user-defined k-anonymity level is reached"
  - [corpus] Weak; corpus neighbors focus on evaluation frameworks rather than risk-quantified mechanisms.
- **Break condition:** Risk estimation becomes unreliable when attack models are mis-specified or when semantic similarity metrics fail to capture utility loss.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
  - Why needed here: NER is the default first-pass detection layer for explicit PII; understanding its capabilities and limitations is prerequisite to designing any anonymization pipeline.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why NER alone is insufficient for comprehensive anonymization?

- **Concept: Privacy-Utility Trade-off**
  - Why needed here: Every anonymization decision involves balancing protection against downstream task performance; this trade-off is central to system design and evaluation.
  - Quick check question: What happens to data utility if anonymization is overly aggressive?

- **Concept: Differential Privacy (DP)**
  - Why needed here: DP provides formal, quantifiable privacy guarantees for text rewriting and model training; understanding its parameters (privacy budget, epsilon) is essential for advanced implementations.
  - Quick check question: How does increasing the privacy budget (epsilon) affect protection and utility?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input text → PII detection (NER + rules + gazetteers) → Risk assessment (classifier/web search) → Transformation (mask/pseudonymize/generalize) → Utility evaluation → Output anonymized text; Optional LLM-in-the-loop for refinement or adversarial evaluation

- **Critical path:**
  1. Detect explicit PII via NER
  2. Assess re-identification risk for detected and residual spans
  3. Apply transformations under risk threshold constraints
  4. Validate privacy (simulated attacks) and utility (downstream task metrics)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - NER-only vs. LLM-based detection (resource cost vs. contextual nuance)
  - Redaction vs. pseudonymization vs. generalization (utility loss vs. privacy strength)
  - Formal DP guarantees vs. practical fluency (rigor vs. readability)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High recall but low utility (over-redaction)
  - Low recall with residual quasi-identifiers (under-protection)
  - Inconsistent pseudonym replacement across document (coreference failures)
  - LLM adversary successfully re-identifies from context

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Benchmark NER-only pipeline on TAB corpus; measure precision/recall and simulated re-identification accuracy.
  2. Compare GPT-4 zero-shot anonymization vs. fine-tuned encoder model (distilled from LLM) on privacy and utility metrics.
  3. Implement risk-aware optimization with k-anonymity threshold; evaluate trade-off curves across different risk levels.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can anonymization systems be developed to dynamically adapt the level and type of protection based on specific data contexts, user permissions, and evolving threat models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 9.8 that "Current anonymization is often static," and they identify the development of "Dynamic and Adaptive Anonymization" systems as an explicit "open area."
- Why unresolved: Existing pipelines typically apply fixed rules or models regardless of changing context or adversary capabilities.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework capable of real-time risk assessment that adjusts anonymization intensity in response to simulated adversarial attacks or sensitivity scores.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What methods can effectively explain the decisions of complex Large Language Models regarding why specific information was masked or retained?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 9.8 explicitly calls for research into "Explainability and Trustworthiness," noting that understanding why information "was (or was not) anonymized is important for trust and debugging."
- Why unresolved: The "black box" nature of LLMs makes it difficult to audit specific anonymization choices, yet current literature lacks established explainability methods for this task.
- What evidence would resolve it: Algorithms that generate human-interpretable rationales for masking decisions which align with expert privacy assessments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can formal privacy models, such as Differential Privacy, be applied to text generation without compromising semantic integrity and fluency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 9.8 identifies the "Tension between Formal Privacy and Textual Quality" as a critical challenge, noting that formal guarantees often result in unnatural text.
- Why unresolved: Current Differential Privacy rewriting techniques often degrade utility and readability, creating a "gap between theoretically sound privacy models and practical, high-utility text anonymization."
- What evidence would resolve it: A text rewriting mechanism that strictly satisfies a defined privacy budget (e.g., epsilon) while preserving high semantic similarity and fluency scores on standard benchmarks.

## Limitations
- Empirical validation of LLM-based anonymization dual-role claims is limited, with insufficient direct evidence of de-anonymization success rates across diverse datasets.
- Effectiveness of privacy risk quantification frameworks under real-world attack models is unclear, as the survey aggregates design proposals without extensive adversarial validation.
- Confidence in LLM-driven approaches is Medium due to evolving threat landscapes and lack of standardized benchmarks.

## Confidence
- **High:** Foundational NER mechanisms, given established research and tooling.
- **Medium:** LLM-driven approaches, due to evolving threat landscapes and lack of standardized benchmarks.
- **Medium:** Risk-aware optimization frameworks, pending broader empirical studies on risk metric reliability and utility preservation.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate and measure the success rate of LLM-based de-anonymization attacks on standard corpora under controlled conditions.
2. Benchmark risk-aware anonymization against baseline NER and LLM methods using both privacy and downstream utility metrics.
3. Test robustness of pseudonymization and generalization strategies across diverse text domains to quantify consistency and re-identification resistance.
