# Beyond Shortest Path: Agentic Vehicular Routing with Semantic Context

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.04464
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04464
- **Reference count:** 32
- **Primary result:** Hybrid LLM-classical routing system achieves 88.24% accuracy in context-aware route selection

## Executive Summary
PA Ve introduces a hybrid agentic routing system that combines classical multi-objective pathfinding algorithms with LLM-based semantic reasoning to handle complex, context-aware vehicular routing tasks. The system translates natural language user requests into structured routing decisions by classifying task urgency, generating candidate routes using a time-CO2 optimized Dijkstra algorithm, enriching routes with geospatial POI context, and evaluating them using hierarchical LLM reasoning. In realistic urban scenarios with four distinct task types, the local Qwen 3-4B model outperformed a larger API-based model in accuracy and stability.

## Method Summary
The method employs a ReAct agent pattern with three specialized tools: a Routing Engine Tool for multi-objective Dijkstra pathfinding, a Geospatial Context Tool for OpenStreetMap POI extraction and enrichment, and a Contextual Route Assessment Tool for temporal factors. The pipeline consists of five steps: Task Classification Prompt (urgency + OSM tags), Candidate Route Generation (top-k time/CO2 optimized routes), Contextual Enrichment (POI attachment), Agent Evaluation (route selection + optional ADD_WAYPOINT), and Feedback Loop (single waypoint recalculation). The system uses Chain-of-Thought prompting and requires JSON schema enforcement for all LLM outputs.

## Key Results
- Achieved 88.24% accuracy in route selection with local Qwen 3-4B model
- Outperformed API GPT-o3 (76.27% accuracy) despite smaller model size
- Peak performance at k=3 candidates; accuracy degrades significantly with more options
- Completeness metric limited by single-waypoint feedback loop constraint

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Hybrid architecture separating path generation from semantic evaluation yields better personalization
- **Mechanism:** Classical Dijkstra generates bounded candidate set; LLM performs semantic reasoning over candidates rather than direct path generation
- **Core assumption:** Optimal route exists within top-k classical solutions
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] LLM operates on candidate set from multi-objective Dijkstra; [Section 2] hybrid approach leverages classical optimality for pathfinding
- **Break condition:** User constraints requiring routes outside top-k candidates

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Hierarchical prioritization with urgency classification improves safety-critical routing
- **Mechanism:** Chain-of-Thought classifies tasks as URGENT/NORMAL, extracts OSM tags, triggers time-to-nearest-POI calculation for urgent tasks
- **Core assumption:** LLM reliably distinguishes urgency from natural language cues
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 2.1] URGENT tasks trigger additional time-to-POI metric; [Table 1] Urgency scenario achieved 91.66% accuracy
- **Break condition:** Misclassification of urgency or tag extraction errors

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Pre-processed geospatial POI cache provides grounding for context-aware comparison
- **Mechanism:** POIs pre-linked to SUMO nodes, stored in GeoPackage cache; spatial queries attach nearby POIs to candidate routes
- **Core assumption:** Pre-linking POIs to graph nodes is sufficiently accurate
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 2] Persistent link between POIs and graph nodes; [Section 3.1] Each POI pre-linked to nearest SUMO node
- **Break condition:** Sparse or outdated POI data; inaccurate nearest-node linkage

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-objective shortest path (Dijkstra with weighted objectives)**
  - **Why needed here:** Essential for understanding how edge weights combine time and CO2 optimization
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how the algorithm balances a 10-minute faster route against 20% higher CO2 emissions?

- **Concept: Structured LLM output (JSON schema enforcement)**
  - **Why needed here:** All prompts require JSON responses for machine-parsable pipeline integration
  - **Quick check question:** What happens if the Task Classification Prompt returns malformed JSON or missing "priority" keys?

- **Concept: ReAct agent pattern (Reason + Act loop)**
  - **Why needed here:** Critical for understanding the iterative refinement process
  - **Quick check question:** If the feedback loop only supports one waypoint, how would you handle a request like "stop for gas, then coffee, then groceries"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User Request → Task Classification Prompt → RET (Dijkstra) → GCT (POI enrichment) → Route Evaluation Prompt → ADD_WAYPOINT → Feedback Loop

- **Critical path:** 1) User request → Task Classification (urgency + tags) 2) RET generates top-k candidates with metrics 3) GCT enriches with nearby POIs 4) Route Evaluation selects route + optional waypoint 5) If waypoint added → recalculate

- **Design tradeoffs:** Local Qwen 3-4B achieved higher accuracy (88.24% vs 76.27%) but degraded with more candidates; peak at k=3; single-waypoint limit affects completeness

- **Failure signatures:** Low completeness with high accuracy (schema generation issues); avoidance scenario failures (API dropped to 25%); k-sensitivity collapse (accuracy drops sharply with more candidates)

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Reproduce baseline on Luxembourg SUMO with k=3, verify accuracy 2) Stress-test urgency classification with edge cases 3) POI coverage audit for target city, validate nearest-node linkage accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the system's feedback loop be evolved to handle multi-stop route planning with TSP solver?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors identify single-waypoint limitation as functional limitation and propose multi-stop planner with TSP variant
- **Why unresolved:** Current architecture only supports single ADD_WAYPOINT action
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Implementation where LLM outputs structured list of stops, successfully optimized by TSP algorithm

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does dynamic k or pre-filtering mitigate performance degradation in local models?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Appendix notes accuracy drops sharply with higher k; suggests dynamic k adapted to POI count
- **Why unresolved:** Study evaluated fixed k values (1,3,5,10,20) without adaptive solutions
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing fixed vs dynamic k strategies showing stable accuracy for local models

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can Distributed Learning user profile module learn preferences while preserving privacy?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Roadmap includes user profile module using Distributed Learning to preserve privacy
- **Why unresolved:** Current system is stateless regarding user history
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Longitudinal simulation showing improved personalization without centralizing user trajectory data

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Does fine-tuning local model on (context, action) pairs improve action schema reliability?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors attribute lower completeness to inconsistent action schema generation and propose fine-tuning
- **Why unresolved:** Prompt engineering alone resulted in stability issues and hallucinated schemas
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparison of base vs fine-tuned Qwen model measuring error rate in JSON schema generation

## Limitations
- Ground truth labeling ambiguity: Unclear methodology for determining "best route" selections
- POI data quality dependency: Performance heavily relies on OpenStreetMap coverage quality
- Single-waypoint constraint: Feedback loop only supports one waypoint addition, limiting complex scenarios

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Hybrid architecture combining classical routing with LLM-based semantic reasoning is well-supported by methodology and results
- **Medium confidence:** Urgency classification mechanism reliability across diverse inputs is supported but lacks extensive edge case testing
- **Low confidence:** Generalizability to different urban environments and POI pre-linking robustness are not thoroughly validated

## Next Checks

1. **Ground truth validation audit:** Reproduce evaluation using LuST scenario, examine 20 random cases to verify consistent labeling criteria
2. **Multi-scenario robustness test:** Run PAVe on two additional SUMO scenarios (different cities, varying POI densities) with same evaluation protocol
3. **Edge case urgency classification:** Create test suite of 50 ambiguous urgency statements and measure classification accuracy and tag extraction reliability
