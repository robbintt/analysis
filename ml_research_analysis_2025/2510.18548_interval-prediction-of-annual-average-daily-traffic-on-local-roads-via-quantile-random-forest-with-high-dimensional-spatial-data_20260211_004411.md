# Interval Prediction of Annual Average Daily Traffic on Local Roads via Quantile Random Forest with High-Dimensional Spatial Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18548
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18548
- Reference count: 40
- This study develops a Quantile Random Forest (QRF) framework to generate prediction intervals for Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) on minor roads, explicitly quantifying uncertainty.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) on minor roads by developing a Quantile Random Forest (QRF) framework that explicitly quantifies prediction uncertainty. The model handles 888 high-dimensional spatial features through Principal Component Analysis, reducing them to 595 components while retaining 99.5% of variance. Optimized via Bayesian search, the final model achieves an interval coverage probability of 88.22%, a normalized average width of 0.23, and a Winkler Score of 7,468.47. The approach demonstrates that prediction intervals widen with distance from cities, reflecting greater variability in low-traffic rural links.

## Method Summary
The study develops a Quantile Random Forest framework for interval prediction of AADT on minor roads. The method involves log-transforming the AADT target, applying Principal Component Analysis to 888 high-dimensional spatial features (grouped into 51 categories) while retaining 99.5% variance, and training a QRF model. The model is optimized using Bayesian search with 5-fold cross-validation over 150 iterations, targeting a Risk Assessment Index. Key hyperparameters include 193 trees, maximum depth of 48, and 8 minimum samples per leaf. The final model achieves a Prediction Interval Coverage Probability of 88.22%, indicating reliable uncertainty quantification.

## Key Results
- Achieved an interval coverage probability (PICP) of 88.22% on test data
- Maintained a normalized average width (NAW) of 0.23 while achieving coverage
- Obtained a Winkler Score of 7,468.47, balancing coverage and interval sharpness
- Spatial analysis shows intervals widen with distance from cities, reflecting greater variability in low-traffic rural links
- Most predictions fall within intervals, confirming model reliability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) likely stabilizes the model by condensing high-dimensional spatial attributes into informative components without substantial information loss.
- Mechanism: By grouping 888 features into 51 categories and retaining 99.5% of variance, PCA reduces multicollinearity among geographic and demographic variables. This allows the Quantile Random Forest (QRF) to split on orthogonal principal components rather than redundant raw features, potentially improving generalization.
- Core assumption: The linear combinations of features captured by the top principal components contain the signal necessary for predicting non-linear traffic patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Principal Component Analysis reduces 888 features to 595 informative components while retaining 99.5% of variance."
  - [section 6.1] "A major contributor to these favorable outcomes is the effective dimensionality reduction achieved through PCA... enhanced both the predictive accuracy and computational efficiency."
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence in corpus for PCA specifically in AADT, though related work like "Embedding spatial context" (arXiv:2503.14980) emphasizes handling spatial feature complexity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Quantile Random Forest (QRF) architecture enables the estimation of uncertainty bounds by preserving the distribution of training observations in leaf nodes rather than just their mean.
- Mechanism: Unlike standard Random Forests that aggregate mean values, QRF calculates conditional quantiles (e.g., 5th and 95th percentiles) from the distribution of target values (AADT) in the leaf nodes. This non-parametric approach allows the model to generate prediction intervals that widen naturally in areas of high data variability (e.g., rural roads) without assuming a Gaussian error distribution.
- Core assumption: The local leaf-node distribution of observations accurately reflects the conditional distribution of the target variable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This study develops a Quantile Random Forest (QRF) framework to generate prediction intervals... explicitly quantifying uncertainty."
  - [section 3.4] "QRF accommodates complex nonlinearities... providing estimates of lower and upper bounds for AADT without making strong distributional assumptions."
  - [corpus] The paper "CONTINA" (arXiv:2504.13961) supports the broader value of confidence intervals for traffic demand, validating the utility of this mechanism.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prediction intervals vary spatially based on traffic generation potential, widening in areas with lower accessibility or data density.
- Mechanism: The model utilizes gravity-based and exponential accessibility metrics alongside spatial lags to capture "traffic potential." In high-traffic, accessible areas (e.g., near cities), the model finds more consistent patterns, leading to narrower intervals. Conversely, in rural links with low mass/distance ratios, heterogeneity increases, causing the quantiles to spread and the prediction interval to widen.
- Core assumption: The variability of traffic flow is inversely correlated with the stability implied by high accessibility and population density features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Spatial analysis reveals intervals widen with distance from cities, reflecting greater variability in low-traffic rural links."
  - [section 4] "Figure 4(a) shows that interval width is strongly decreasing with the size of the point estimate... links with wider intervals tend to have lower level of traffic."
  - [corpus] "Learning Multimodal Embeddings" (arXiv:2512.02920) notes the importance of environmental/structural context in accident prediction, analogous to how spatial context informs volume uncertainty here.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Quantile Regression**
  - Why needed here: Standard regression minimizes squared error to find the mean. This paper requires estimating the range (min/max) to quantify risk, necessitating the prediction of specific percentiles (e.g., 0.05, 0.95).
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts the 90th percentile of traffic volume, what percentage of actual observations should exceed this prediction?

- Concept: **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**
  - Why needed here: With 888 correlated variables (buffers, land use, demographics), the model risks overfitting and computational inefficiency. PCA transforms these into a smaller set of uncorrelated components.
  - Quick check question: Why is retaining 99.5% of variance generally preferred over retaining 95% when dealing with sparse traffic data on local roads?

- Concept: **Winkler Score & PICP**
  - Why needed here: Accuracy is not just about hitting the target (point prediction) but about the reliability of the range. PICP measures reliability (coverage), while Winkler Score penalizes wide intervals or missed coverage, balancing precision and safety.
  - Quick check question: Does a Winkler Score of 0 indicate a perfect or failed prediction interval?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Prep -> PCA Module -> QRF Core -> Evaluator
- Critical path: The interaction between PCA grouping and QRF hyperparameters (min_samples_leaf, max_depth). If PCA components are too abstract, the QRF cannot capture spatial nuance; if QRF trees are too shallow, the quantile estimates will be coarse.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Coverage vs. Sharpness**: Increasing coverage (PICP) typically widens intervals (higher NAW), reducing utility. The paper optimizes for the Risk Assessment Index (RAI) to balance this.
  - **Accessibility Metrics**: The paper selects an exponential accessibility metric (α=1.5) over gravity-based, trading off theoretical fit for empirical performance (lower Winkler Score).
- Failure signatures:
  - **Undercoverage**: PICP < 85% indicates the model is overconfident; intervals are too narrow.
  - **Inflated Width**: High NAW with high Coverage implies the model is "guessing" wide ranges to be safe, lacking predictive power.
  - **Spatial Bias**: Consistent underestimation of uncertainty in rural areas (observed in residual plots).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce the Baseline PCA**: Run PCA on the 888 features to verify that 595 components indeed capture ~99.5% variance across the 51 groups.
  2. **Interval Validation**: Train a QRF with the paper's hyperparameters (193 trees, depth 48) and check if the PICP on the test set approximates the reported 88.22%.
  3. **Spatial Error Analysis**: Plot the interval widths against the "distance to city" feature to confirm the mechanism that uncertainty increases with rurality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Model trained on English/Welsh minor roads may not generalize to other regions or road classes without recalibration
- Exact methodology for calculating "transport accessibility" and buffer-based statistics is described but not provided in executable form
- Conflicting parameter values reported in different sections create uncertainty about the true final model configuration

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of using QRF for interval prediction and PCA for dimensionality reduction is sound and well-supported by the results (PICP=88.22%, NAW=0.23)
- **Medium confidence**: The spatial analysis showing intervals widen with distance from cities is compelling but could benefit from more rigorous statistical testing of the relationship
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that PCA "stabilizes" the model is logical given the variance retention, but direct evidence linking this to improved QRF performance is limited

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce PCA reduction**: Apply PCA to the 888 features grouped into 51 categories and verify that 595 components indeed capture approximately 99.5% of the variance.

2. **Interval coverage validation**: Train a QRF with the reported hyperparameters (n_estimators=193, max_depth=48) on the same 80/20 split and verify the PICP is approximately 88.22%.

3. **Spatial uncertainty analysis**: Plot prediction interval widths against "distance to city" or similar accessibility metrics to confirm the mechanism that uncertainty increases with rurality.
