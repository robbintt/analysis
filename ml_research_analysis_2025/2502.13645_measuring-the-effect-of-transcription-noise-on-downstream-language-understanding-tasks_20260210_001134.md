# Measuring the Effect of Transcription Noise on Downstream Language Understanding Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.13645
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13645
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: ENDOW framework systematically measures transcription noise impact on SLU tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ENDOW, a configurable framework for evaluating how transcription noise affects downstream language understanding tasks. The framework systematically varies noise levels and types in speech transcripts, applies multiple cleaning techniques, and measures task model performance across summarization, question-answering, and dialog-act classification. Using seven noise levels and seven cleaning techniques targeting different word types, the study reveals that task models tolerate specific noise thresholds, with named entities and nouns being most critical for performance.

The research demonstrates that targeted cleaning of content words yields better results than general noise reduction, providing a systematic approach to analyzing SLU pipelines and supporting the development of more robust speech processing systems. The framework introduces a cleaning-effectiveness score that quantifies trade-offs between noise reduction and task improvement.

## Method Summary
The ENDOW framework implements a systematic approach to measuring transcription noise impact through three main components: noise injection, cleaning techniques, and evaluation metrics. Noise is injected at seven different levels across word types (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, named entities, numbers, stop words) using a configurable noise matrix. Seven cleaning techniques are evaluated, including general noise reduction, word-type specific cleaning, and combined approaches. Task performance is measured using four large language models across three SLU tasks, with the cleaning-effectiveness score quantifying the relationship between noise reduction and task improvement.

## Key Results
- Task models tolerate specific noise thresholds before performance degrades significantly
- Named entities and nouns are most critical for maintaining SLU task performance
- Targeted cleaning of content words (nouns, named entities) yields better results than general noise reduction
- The cleaning-effectiveness score quantifies trade-offs between noise reduction and task improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its systematic variation of noise levels and types, allowing researchers to identify specific vulnerabilities in SLU pipelines. By isolating different word categories and measuring their individual impact, the framework reveals which linguistic elements are most crucial for task performance. The use of multiple cleaning techniques and large language models provides robust validation of findings across different approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Noise injection methodology**: Systematic noise generation across word types and levels (why needed: controls for noise variation; quick check: verify noise distribution matches real ASR errors)
- **Cleaning-effectiveness score**: Metric quantifying noise reduction vs. task improvement trade-offs (why needed: evaluates cleaning strategy value; quick check: ensure score correlates with task performance)
- **Word-type categorization**: Classification of words into content vs. function categories (why needed: identifies critical linguistic elements; quick check: validate categorization with linguistic experts)
- **Large language model evaluation**: Using multiple LLMs as task models (why needed: ensures findings generalize across architectures; quick check: test with smaller models for scalability)
- **Controlled experimental design**: Varying one parameter at a time (why needed: isolates causal relationships; quick check: verify experimental parameters are independent)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Noise Injection -> Cleaning Techniques -> Task Models -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path:**
Noise Generation → Word Classification → Cleaning Application → Task Performance Measurement → Effectiveness Scoring

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework prioritizes systematic control over real-world complexity, sacrificing some ecological validity for experimental rigor. Using simulated noise instead of actual ASR output enables precise parameter control but may miss real-world error patterns.

**Failure Signatures:**
Performance degradation when noise exceeds identified thresholds, particularly for named entities and nouns. Cleaning strategies that reduce noise without improving task performance indicate misalignment between noise types and cleaning approaches.

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate noise injection methodology by comparing simulated noise patterns to actual ASR output
2. Test cleaning-effectiveness score correlation with human evaluation of transcript quality
3. Evaluate framework performance with smaller language models to assess scalability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focuses exclusively on English language tasks, limiting cross-lingual applicability
- Uses simulated noise rather than actual ASR output, potentially missing real-world error patterns
- Evaluates a narrow set of SLU applications, which may not generalize to all language understanding tasks

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Systematic framework design and controlled noise injection methodology
- **Medium Confidence**: Comparative effectiveness of targeted cleaning techniques versus general noise reduction
- **Medium Confidence**: Identified noise thresholds and critical word type findings

## Next Checks
1. Apply ENDOW to actual ASR output from multiple speech recognition systems across diverse acoustic conditions to validate noise injection realism
2. Extend the framework to evaluate multilingual SLU tasks and assess whether identified critical word types transfer across languages
3. Test noise tolerance findings with smaller language models and task-specific architectures to determine if large model patterns hold across different model scales
