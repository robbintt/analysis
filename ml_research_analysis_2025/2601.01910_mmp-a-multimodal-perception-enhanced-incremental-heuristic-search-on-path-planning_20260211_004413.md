core_contribution: MMP-A integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with large language
  models (LLMs) and adaptive heuristic decay to overcome scalability and spatial reasoning
  limitations in autonomous path planning. Unlike LLM-A, which relies solely on text-based
  reasoning and often generates geometrically invalid waypoints, MMP-A employs VLMs
  to visually prune infeasible checkpoints, ensuring geometric validity before the

# MMP-A*: Multimodal Perception Enhanced Incremental Heuristic Search on Path Planning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01910
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01910
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: MMP-A* integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with large language models (LLMs) and adaptive heuristic decay to overcome scalability and spatial reasoning limitations in autonomous path planning

## Executive Summary
MMP-A* addresses critical limitations in autonomous path planning by combining LLM-based symbolic reasoning with VLM-based visual validation and adaptive heuristic decay. The framework overcomes LLM-A*'s tendency to generate geometrically invalid waypoints by using VLMs to visually prune infeasible checkpoints before A* search begins. An exponential decay mechanism dynamically attenuates waypoint influence during search, preventing bias toward unreliable guidance while maintaining search efficiency. Evaluated on 200 high-complexity 100×60 maps with dense obstacles, MMP-A* achieves 100% valid path ratio and outperforms vanilla A* with operation ratios of 81.0% and storage ratios of 76.0%.

## Method Summary
MMP-A* employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) LLM generates coarse waypoints from text-encoded obstacle representations, (2) VLM receives paired images (raw grid + waypoint overlay) and prunes invalid/redundant waypoints through visual verification, and (3) A* executes with adaptive decay-weighted heuristic where waypoint influence exponentially diminishes with search depth. The framework uses 8-connected Moore neighborhood, Euclidean costs, and configures LLM (GPT-4o-mini) with Few-Shot prompts while setting VLM (Qwen2.5-VL) with JSON output formatting and decay factor α=0.7.

## Key Results
- 100% valid path ratio on 200 high-complexity 100×60 maps
- Operation ratios of 81.0% and storage ratios of 76.0% versus vanilla A*
- Path lengths within 2% of optimal solutions
- Robust performance across increasing environmental complexity and scale

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: VLM-Based Visual Pruning of Infeasible Waypoints
Visual verification removes geometrically invalid waypoints before search begins, preventing costly detours. VLM receives paired images and evaluates each candidate against visible barriers, discarding waypoints in blocked regions, dead-ends, or wall-adjacent positions.

### Mechanism 2: Adaptive Heuristic Decay
Exponentially decaying waypoint influence prevents persistent bias from unreliable guidance while preserving early search efficiency. The heuristic multiplies waypoint cost by α^k where k increments at each waypoint transition, with influence vanishing as k→∞.

### Mechanism 3: Hierarchical LLM→VLM→A* Pipeline
Decomposing planning into linguistic reasoning, visual grounding, and deterministic search isolates modality-specific strengths. LLM generates coarse waypoints from symbolic obstacle encoding; VLM validates against raw imagery; A* executes guaranteed-complete search with refined waypoints as heuristics.

## Foundational Learning

- **A* Search and Admissible Heuristics**: MMP-A* builds on A*; understanding f(n) = g(n) + h(n) and admissibility is essential to grasp how waypoint injection affects optimality guarantees.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why an overestimating heuristic breaks A* optimality?

- **LLM Spatial Reasoning Limitations**: The paper's core motivation stems from LLMs lacking spatial grounding; understanding token-based vs. visual representations clarifies why text-only waypoints fail.
  - Quick check: Why would an LLM struggle to distinguish a 3-cell corridor from a 5-cell corridor given only coordinate lists?

- **Vision-Language Model Grounding**: VLMs provide geometric validation; understanding how visual embeddings differ from text embeddings explains their complementary role.
  - Quick check: What type of spatial information can a VLM extract from an occupancy grid image that an LLM cannot infer from text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Symbolic Encoder → LLM Module → VLM Module → Adaptive Heuristic Engine → A* Core
- **Critical path**: LLM waypoint generation → VLM visual filtering → Decay-weighted heuristic computation → A* expansion loop
- **Design tradeoffs**: Higher α → faster convergence but longer paths; more waypoints → finer guidance but higher VLM filtering cost
- **Failure signatures**: Operation ratio > 100% suggests misleading waypoints; valid path ratio < 100% indicates VLM failed to catch infeasible waypoints
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline comparison: Run MMP-A* vs. A* vs. LLM-A* on 10 maps; record operation/storage ratios and valid path ratio
  2. Ablate VLM: Disable VLM filtering; measure degradation in valid path ratio and operation cost
  3. Sweep α: Test α ∈ {0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9}; plot efficiency vs. path length tradeoff curve

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- VLM reliability claims lack per-instance error analysis and systematic validation across ambiguous geometric regions
- Adaptive decay parameter α=0.7 is presented as optimal without demonstrating context-dependence across map complexities
- Framework's dependence on commercial LLM/VLM APIs raises reproducibility and deployment cost concerns

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Operation and storage ratio improvements (81.0% and 76.0% vs vanilla A*) are empirically demonstrated across 200 test cases
- **Medium confidence**: 100% valid path ratio claim is supported but lacks per-instance failure analysis to rule out systematic blind spots
- **Low confidence**: Optimality bound (within 2% of optimal) assumes perfect VLM/LLM performance without quantifying error propagation

## Next Checks
1. **VLM Reliability Audit**: Run MMP-A* on validation set with ground-truth waypoint feasibility labels; compute precision/recall of VLM pruning and identify failure modes in geometrically ambiguous regions
2. **Decayed Heuristic Sensitivity**: Perform grid search over α ∈ {0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9} on 50 maps spanning all complexity levels; measure efficiency-path length Pareto frontier
3. **End-to-End Error Propagation**: Instrument each pipeline stage to track waypoint deviations from ground-truth optimal paths; quantify how multimodal errors compound versus vanilla A* performance degradation
