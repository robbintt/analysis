## Executive Summary
This paper presents a two-stage framework for dynamic topic analysis in academic journals that addresses the challenge of maintaining topic consistency and interpretability over time. The method combines a two-layer NMF model for initial topic extraction with a convex NMF refinement stage to enhance stability and structure. Applied to IEEE journal abstracts (2004-2022), the approach successfully identifies emerging research trends while demonstrating superior stability compared to traditional NMF methods, achieving a topic coherence score of 0.5622 and significant improvements in topic ranking stability across varying sparsity levels.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a two-stage approach: Stage 1 uses a two-layer NMF model where each time period's corpus is decomposed into window topics and features, then reconstructed into a unified topic space across all periods. Stage 2 applies convex NMF refinement to the initial results, using multiplicative updates to improve stability and reduce sensitivity to noise. The method incorporates sparsity regularization and provides interpretable topic keywords for each time period, enabling tracking of knowledge evolution in large-scale academic corpora.

## Key Results
- Achieves topic coherence score (TC-W2V) of 0.5622 on IEEE T-ASE corpus
- Improves topic ranking stability by 24.51%, 56.60%, and 36.93% at sparsity levels 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 respectively
- Successfully identifies emerging research trends including COVID-19 and digital twins
- Demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional NMF with faster training times (0.7s vs 4.5s vs LDA)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The two-layer NMF structure enables temporal topic alignment by reconstructing window feature matrices into a shared feature space.
- Mechanism: Stage 1 decomposes each time-period corpus Z^t into window topic matrix X^t and window feature matrix Y^t (Eq. 1). These Y^t matrices are aggregated into reconstructed matrix V, then a second NMF layer produces dynamic feature matrix H that serves as the unified topic space across all periods (Eq. 2-3).
- Core assumption: Topics in different time windows share a common latent feature basis that can be recovered through matrix reconstruction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In Stage 1, a two-layer non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model is employed to extract annual topics and identify key terms."
  - [section III.A] "The modeling process in the second layer is different from that of the first layer as it reconstructs the window feature matrices H^t for documents across different time periods."
  - [corpus] Related work on NMF for COVID-19 topic trends (arXiv:2503.18182) confirms NMF's effectiveness for temporal topic extraction, though without the two-layer structure.
- Break condition: If window topics have highly dissimilar vocabularies across periods, the reconstruction V may introduce noise that prevents meaningful alignment in the second layer.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Convex NMF refinement stabilizes topic rankings by representing topic vectors as convex combinations of the original feature space.
- Mechanism: Stage 2 initializes matrices G and H~ from Stage 1 results, then iteratively updates them using multiplicative rules that decompose the reconstructed topic matrix W as V·G (Eq. 4-6). The convex constraint limits W to the convex hull of V, reducing sensitivity to perturbations.
- Core assumption: The optimal topic representation lies within the convex hull of the original window features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In Stage 2, a convex optimization algorithm refines the dynamic topic structure using the convex NMF (cNMF) model, further enhancing topic integration and stability."
  - [section III.B] "The convex NMF model extends traditional non-negative matrix factorization, providing robust solutions for handling noise and outliers."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence for convex NMF specifically in dynamic topic modeling; related constrained NMF work (arXiv:2505.16493) addresses minority topic guidance but not temporal stability.
- Break condition: If initialization from Stage 1 is poor (e.g., highly inconsistent window topics), the convex refinement may converge to a suboptimal local minimum rather than improving stability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sparsity regularization in the window topic model propagates reduced ranking variability through the cNMF refinement stage.
- Mechanism: The sparse NMF (sNMF) model adds L1/L2 penalties (Eq. 9) to the first layer. When sparsity increases, cNMF shows smaller topic ranking changes compared to standard NMF-NMF (24.51%-56.60% reduction at sparsity 0.4-0.9), indicating that convex constraints buffer against feature-space perturbations.
- Core assumption: Topic ranking stability under sparsity perturbation indicates robustness to real-world data noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "At sparsity levels of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9, the proposed approach improves topic ranking stability by 24.51%, 56.60%, and 36.93%, respectively."
  - [section IV.E] "It can be seen that when the sparsity of the first layer sNMF model is gradually increased... the degree of topic ranking variation of cNMF compared to NMF decreases significantly."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus comparison for sparsity-stability relationship in dynamic topic models; this appears to be a novel contribution.
- Break condition: Excessive sparsity (approaching 1.0) may over-constrain the feature space, causing both NMF-NMF and cNMF to lose meaningful topic structure.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
  - Why needed here: The entire framework builds on NMF's additive parts-based representation, which naturally decomposes documents into interpretable topic-word distributions.
  - Quick check question: Given a document-term matrix V (1000×500), what are the dimensions of factors W and H if K=20 topics?

- Concept: Convex Optimization Constraints
  - Why needed here: Stage 2 relies on representing topics as convex combinations (V·G) to achieve stability; understanding why this bounds the solution space is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why does constraining W to be a convex combination of V columns limit solution variability compared to unconstrained factorization?

- Concept: Topic Coherence Metrics (TC-W2V, CV, CUMass)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses TC-W2V for topic number selection and CV/CUMass for model comparison; interpreting these scores determines hyperparameter choices.
  - Quick check question: If TC-W2V peaks at K=18 but CV is higher for K=6, which would you prioritize for interpretability vs. coverage?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Time-sliced document corpora Z^t → Window NMF (Eq. 1) → Feature aggregation → Dynamic NMF (Eq. 2) → Convex refinement (Algorithm 1) → Topic ranking and interpretation

- Critical path: Data preprocessing → window NMF (Eq. 1) → feature aggregation → dynamic NMF (Eq. 2) → convex refinement (Algorithm 1) → topic ranking and interpretation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - NMF vs. LDA: NMF chosen for faster training (0.7s vs. 4.5s) and better reconstruction on short texts; LDA provides probabilistic interpretation but underperforms on abstracts
  - Topic number K: Higher K captures diversity but risks overfitting; paper finds K=18 optimal via TC-W2V for IEEE T-ASE corpus
  - Sparsity level: Higher sparsity improves interpretability but may drop emerging topics; paper tests 0.1-0.9 range

- Failure signatures:
  - Topic fragmentation: Same concept split across multiple topics (e.g., "robot" and "human-robot interaction" separate when should merge)
  - Ranking instability: Topic order changes significantly with small sparsity perturbations (indicates need for cNMF refinement)
  - Emerging topic suppression: New topics like COVID-19 absent in dynamic results (check if window models captured them first)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce Stage 1 on IEEE abstracts: Run two-layer NMF with K=18, verify TC-W2V ~0.558 as reported in Table VI.
  2. Ablation test: Compare NMF-NMF vs. NMF-cNMF on 2020-2022 data; confirm cNMF improves robot topic ranking from 9th to 1st as in Table V.
  3. Sparsity sensitivity: Apply sNMF with l=0.4, 0.6, 0.9 to first layer; verify ranking stability improvements match reported percentages (24.51%, 56.60%, 36.93%).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The convex NMF refinement mechanism has limited direct corpus evidence for convex constraints specifically addressing temporal stability
- The two-layer reconstruction approach may fail if vocabulary drift is substantial between windows
- Excessive sparsity (approaching 1.0) may over-constrain the feature space, causing loss of meaningful topic structure

## Confidence
- Convex NMF refinement mechanism: Low confidence (limited direct corpus evidence)
- Sparsity-stability relationship: Medium confidence (internal validation, novel contribution)
- Two-layer reconstruction approach: Medium confidence (based on related NMF work)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-validation stability test**: Apply the complete pipeline to a different journal corpus (e.g., Nature or ACM) with overlapping time periods to verify the 24.51-56.60% stability improvements hold across domains.

2. **Extreme sparsity boundary analysis**: Systematically test sparsity levels approaching 0.95-0.99 to identify the break condition where both NMF-NMF and cNMF fail to maintain meaningful topic structure.

3. **Topic drift quantification**: Measure vocabulary overlap between consecutive window topics (Jaccard similarity of top-20 terms) to empirically validate whether the two-layer reconstruction successfully mitigates topic fragmentation.
