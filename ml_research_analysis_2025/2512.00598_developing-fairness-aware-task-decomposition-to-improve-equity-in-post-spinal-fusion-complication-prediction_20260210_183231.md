core_contribution: The study addresses algorithmic bias in predicting postoperative
  complications after spinal fusion surgery, proposing a fairness-aware multitask
  learning framework (FAIR-MTL) that uses subgroup inference to route patients into
  task-specific heads based on demographic clusters. This approach achieves an AUC
  of 0.86 and accuracy of 75% while reducing demographic parity and equalized odds
  differences compared to baseline models, with subgroup accuracy differences as low
  as 0.055 for gender and 0.056 for age.

# Developing Fairness-Aware Task Decomposition to Improve Equity in Post-Spinal Fusion Complication Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00598
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00598
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: FAIR-MTL achieves AUC 0.86 and accuracy 75% while reducing demographic disparities in spinal fusion complication prediction

## Executive Summary
This study addresses algorithmic bias in predicting postoperative complications after spinal fusion surgery by developing a fairness-aware multitask learning framework (FAIR-MTL). The framework uses subgroup inference to route patients into task-specific heads based on demographic clusters, achieving both high predictive performance and improved fairness metrics. The approach demonstrates that task decomposition can reduce demographic parity and equalized odds differences while maintaining clinical utility, with subgroup accuracy differences as low as 0.055 for gender and 0.056 for age.

## Method Summary
The FAIR-MTL framework employs subgroup inference to dynamically route patients to specialized task heads based on demographic clustering. The model integrates SHAP and Gini importance analyses to identify key clinical predictors while maintaining fairness across demographic groups. The architecture consists of shared feature extraction layers feeding into subgroup-specific heads, with routing determined by demographic cluster membership. The framework was validated on both internal and external datasets, with performance measured across multiple fairness metrics including demographic parity difference, equalized odds difference, and subgroup accuracy differences.

## Key Results
- Achieved AUC of 0.86 and accuracy of 75% in complication prediction
- Reduced demographic parity difference from 0.094 to 0.039 and equalized odds difference from 0.094 to 0.036
- Subgroup accuracy differences: 0.055 for gender, 0.056 for age
- Identified key clinical predictors including hematocrit and hemoglobin using SHAP and Gini importance analyses
- Demonstrated robust fairness and performance in external validation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from its ability to learn task-specific representations for different demographic subgroups while maintaining shared feature extraction. By routing patients based on demographic clusters, the model can capture subgroup-specific patterns in complication risk while preventing majority-group bias from dominating the learning process. The integration of interpretability tools (SHAP and Gini) ensures clinical relevance while the multitask architecture enables efficient learning across multiple prediction targets.

## Foundational Learning
- Multitask learning: Enables simultaneous prediction of multiple outcomes while sharing relevant features
  - Why needed: Reduces computational overhead and improves learning efficiency
  - Quick check: Model achieves comparable performance across all tasks
- Subgroup inference routing: Dynamically assigns patients to task-specific heads based on demographic clusters
  - Why needed: Prevents majority-group bias from dominating predictions
  - Quick check: Subgroup accuracy differences remain below 0.06
- Fairness metrics calculation: Quantifies demographic parity and equalized odds differences
  - Why needed: Provides objective measures of algorithmic bias
  - Quick check: Improvements in fairness metrics are statistically significant
- SHAP importance analysis: Interprets feature contributions to predictions
  - Why needed: Ensures clinical relevance and enables physician trust
  - Quick check: Key predictors align with medical expertise
- Gini importance: Ranks feature importance for decision-making
  - Why needed: Identifies most influential clinical variables
  - Quick check: Top features correspond to known risk factors

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Shared feature extraction -> Demographic clustering -> Subgroup routing -> Task-specific heads
- Critical path: Patient data -> Shared encoder -> Demographic cluster assignment -> Appropriate task head -> Prediction output
- Design tradeoffs: Fairness vs. performance optimization, model complexity vs. interpretability
- Failure signatures: Performance degradation when demographic clusters are poorly defined, overfitting to subgroup-specific patterns
- First experiments:
  1. Test routing accuracy by comparing predicted vs. actual demographic clusters
  2. Validate fairness improvements across additional demographic variables
  3. Assess performance stability when training data is imbalanced across subgroups

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- External validation conducted on single dataset, limiting generalizability
- Performance metrics show gaps compared to established surgical prediction benchmarks
- Analysis limited to age and gender demographics, excluding other potential bias factors
- Fairness improvements may not translate to clinically meaningful outcome differences

## Confidence
- High: Technical implementation of FAIR-MTL framework and subgroup inference routing
- Medium: Fairness improvements and subgroup accuracy differences
- Medium: Interpretability findings using SHAP and Gini analyses

## Next Checks
1. Conduct multi-site external validation across diverse healthcare systems and geographic regions to assess generalizability
2. Perform subgroup analysis incorporating additional demographic and clinical variables (race, insurance status, comorbidities)
3. Implement prospective clinical trial to evaluate real-world impact on surgical outcomes and healthcare equity
