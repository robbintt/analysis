core_contribution: The paper questions the assumption that all training samples are
  equally important in telecom model training, given that telecom data is often noisy,
  high-dimensional, and costly to store and process. It proposes a gradient-based
  sample importance framework that dynamically scores samples during training using
  gradient norms as a proxy for influence, and selectively prioritizes the most impactful
  data for training.

# Through the telecom lens: Are all training samples important?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21668
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21668
- Reference count: 21
- All training samples may not be equally important for telecom model training

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the conventional assumption that all training samples contribute equally to model performance in telecommunications applications. The authors propose a gradient-based sample importance framework that dynamically scores training data during model training, identifying which samples are most influential for learning. By selectively prioritizing high-impact samples, the framework enables more efficient training while maintaining comparable model performance. Experiments across three real-world telecom datasets demonstrate that models trained on only 65-90% of the most important samples achieve similar accuracy to those trained on full datasets, while reducing computational costs and carbon emissions by up to 38%.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework employs gradient-based sample importance scoring to identify and prioritize influential training samples. During training, the model computes gradient norms for each sample, using these as proxies for sample influence on the loss function. Samples are dynamically ranked and scored based on their gradient contributions, allowing the training process to focus on the most impactful data. The framework adaptively selects high-importance samples for training while deprioritizing or excluding low-contribution samples. This selective training approach maintains model performance while reducing the effective training dataset size, computational overhead, and training duration.

## Key Results
- Models trained on 65-90% of highest-importance samples achieved comparable performance to full-data models
- Up to 38% reduction in training time, computational overhead, and carbon emissions
- Significant portions of training data contributed minimally to loss reduction or generalization
- Framework validated across Telecom Italia, proprietary base station data, and 5G beam selection datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the principle that gradient magnitudes during backpropagation serve as reliable indicators of sample importance. Samples producing larger gradient norms have stronger influence on parameter updates and loss reduction, while those with smaller gradients contribute less to model learning. By dynamically scoring samples based on their gradient contributions, the framework identifies which data points drive model improvement versus those that provide diminishing returns. This selective focus on high-impact samples enables more efficient learning by concentrating computational resources where they yield the greatest performance gains.

## Foundational Learning

**Gradient-based importance scoring** - Uses gradient norms as proxies for sample influence on model parameters
- Why needed: Traditional uniform sampling wastes resources on redundant or low-impact data
- Quick check: Verify gradient norms correlate with sample influence on validation loss

**Selective training prioritization** - Dynamically ranks and selects high-importance samples during training
- Why needed: Telecom datasets often contain noisy, redundant, or irrelevant samples
- Quick check: Confirm performance retention when excluding bottom 10-30% of scored samples

**Carbon-efficient ML optimization** - Reduces computational overhead through data efficiency
- Why needed: Telecom ML applications require sustainable training approaches for large-scale deployment
- Quick check: Measure actual power consumption differences between full and selective training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Data preprocessing -> Gradient computation -> Sample scoring -> Selective training -> Model evaluation

**Critical path:** Gradient computation and sample scoring must occur in real-time during each training iteration to enable dynamic sample selection

**Design tradeoffs:** 
- Memory vs. computation: Storing gradient norms requires additional memory but enables more informed sampling
- Real-time scoring overhead vs. training efficiency gains
- Potential bias introduction from systematic exclusion of low-gradient samples

**Failure signatures:**
- Degraded performance when important but subtle patterns produce small gradients
- Overfitting if too many high-gradient samples are noisy outliers
- Underfitting if importance scoring fails to capture domain-specific relevance

**First experiments:**
1. Compare gradient-based importance scoring against uniform random sampling baseline
2. Test performance sensitivity to different importance score thresholds (65%, 75%, 85% of data)
3. Evaluate framework across multiple telecom task types (classification, regression, sequence modeling)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper identifies several open questions regarding the generalizability of gradient-based importance scoring across different telecom scenarios, particularly for regression and sequence modeling tasks. Questions remain about the framework's effectiveness when critical patterns produce smaller gradients, and whether the approach maintains performance under concept drift conditions. The authors also note the need for more detailed carbon emission calculation methodologies and validation across additional telecom domains beyond the three datasets studied.

## Limitations

The methodology's reliance on gradient norms as importance proxies may not capture all relevant sample characteristics, particularly for subtle but important patterns. Results are based on specific telecom datasets that may not generalize to other domains or non-telecom applications. The framework focuses primarily on classification tasks, leaving open questions about effectiveness for regression or sequence modeling common in telecom. Carbon emission calculations lack detailed methodology and verification.

## Confidence

- High confidence: Selective training on 65-90% of data can achieve comparable performance to full-data models
- Medium confidence: Up to 38% reductions in training time and computational overhead are achievable
- Low confidence: Broader applicability of gradient-based importance scoring across all telecom ML scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Cross-domain validation: Test framework on network anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and traffic prediction to verify generalizability
2. Gradient proxy validation: Conduct ablation studies comparing gradient-based scoring against influence functions and Shapley values
3. Long-term stability analysis: Evaluate model performance over extended periods and under concept drift conditions
