# Optimizing Health Coverage in Ethiopia: A Learning-augmented Approach and Persistent Proportionality Under an Online Budget

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.00135
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00135
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Learning-augmented algorithms improve expert advice for healthcare facility location while guaranteeing (1-1/e) worst-case coverage under sequential budget uncertainty and fairness constraints.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing health facility placement in Ethiopia under sequential budget uncertainty and fairness constraints. The authors propose HARP (Health Access Resource Planner), a framework that maximizes population coverage while ensuring persistent proportionality across districts. The approach combines submodular optimization with online partition matroids and learning-augmented algorithms that integrate expert advice with provable worst-case guarantees. Experiments across three Ethiopian regions demonstrate that enforcing proportionality constraints incurs only modest efficiency loss while improving equity, and the learning-augmented approach outperforms both expert and greedy baselines in 25 districts.

## Method Summary
The method solves a submodular maximization problem under online partition matroid constraints (MOPGP) with global proportional fairness requirements. Algorithm 1 generates b+1 candidate solutions by combining subsets of expert advice with greedy selections, returning the best candidate with unconditional guarantees f(U) ≥ max(f(greedy), f(advice)). Algorithm 2 enforces type-feasibility through per-type quotas computed using min-ratio type sequences, maintaining proportional balance across time steps. The coverage function f(S) = Σt Σc∈covered(S(1:t)) w_c^(t) satisfies diminishing returns properties enabling greedy approximation. Experiments run over 5 years with annual budgets across Afar, Benishangul Gumuz, Somali, and Sidama regions using WorldPop population forecasts and walking friction surfaces.

## Key Results
- Learning-augmented approach improves expert advice in 25 districts while maintaining (1-1/e) worst-case guarantees
- Enforcing proportionality constraints incurs only 1.0-1.8× relative efficiency loss compared to unconstrained greedy
- District-level equity improves with α_min satisfaction ratios reaching 0.75-0.85 under proportional planning
- Theoretical worst-case ratios: 1/2 for budget uncertainty and k/(k+1) for ordering effects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Submodular structure enables tractable approximation despite NP-hardness.
- Mechanism: Coverage objective f(S) = Σt Σc∈covered(S(1:t)) w_c^(t) satisfies diminishing returns: adding facilities helps less when many already exist. This property guarantees greedy selection achieves at least (1-1/e) ≈ 0.63 of optimal for single-constraint problems.
- Core assumption: Population coverage has geographic overlap—facilities serve overlapping catchments so marginal gains decrease.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3] "It is known that a greedy selection gives a 1 − 1/e approximation for maximizing non-decreasing submodular functions under a cardinality constraint [NWF78]."
  - [Appendix B.1] Proposition 13 formally proves f is non-decreasing and submodular.
  - [corpus] Related work on submodular maximization under matroid constraints [FNW78, CCPV11] supports generalization to multiple constraints.
- Break condition: If coverage were linear (no overlap between facility catchments), submodularity would not hold and approximation guarantees would degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Learning-augmented algorithms improve expert advice while maintaining worst-case safety.
- Mechanism: Algorithm 1 generates b+1 candidate solutions by combining i elements from expert advice A with greedy selections for remaining slots. Returns best candidate. This yields f(U) ≥ max(f(greedy), f(advice)) unconditionally, with stronger bounds when advice overlaps optimal.
- Core assumption: Expert advice encodes domain knowledge about local priorities, infrastructure constraints, or political considerations not captured in the objective function.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.1] "f(Ui∗) ≥ max{f(U0), f(A)} and thus the output Ui∗ ⊆ V of our learning-augmented algorithm is at least (1 − 1/e)-robust and 1-consistent."
  - [Section 5.4] "we found 25 districts within these regions in which our learning-augmented selection U outperforms both, i.e., f(U) > f(G) > f(A)."
  - [corpus] Learning-augmented online fair division [arxiv:2501.07022] provides theoretical grounding for advice integration with regret bounds.
- Break condition: If expert advice is adversarial (specifically designed to mislead), the algorithm still achieves (1-1/e) approximation but no improvement over greedy.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Type-feasibility constraint enforces persistent proportionality without requiring future budget knowledge.
- Mechanism: Algorithm 2 computes per-type quotas x_q^(t) using min-ratio type sequences, ensuring cumulative selections maintain proportional balance. Minimizing |Q(S)| (types with minimum satisfaction ratio) hedges against uncertainty by keeping multiple type options available for future rounds.
- Core assumption: Proportionality targets p_1,...,p_r reflect legitimate policy priorities (e.g., targeting underserved districts) that should be satisfied incrementally.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Definition 1] Type feasible selection requires α_min(S^(1:t)) = β(b^(1:t)) at every time step t.
  - [Theorem 9] "If |OPTσ ∩ V(t) ∩ Tq| ≥ k for all t ∈ [h] and q ∈ [r], then f(OPT) ≤ (k+1)/k · f(OPTσ)."
  - [Section 5.2, Fig. 5] Empirically, MP(DP1) and MP(DP2) achieve higher α_min than unconstrained greedy across three regions.
  - [corpus] Approximate proportionality in online fair division [arxiv:2508.03253] addresses similar fairness guarantees under sequential allocation.
- Break condition: If per-round budgets are too small (e.g., b(t) = 1 with r > 1 types), exact proportionality becomes infeasible and satisfaction ratios β(b) < 1.

## Foundational Learning

- **Submodular functions and greedy approximation**
  - Why needed here: Core theoretical framework enabling polynomial-time algorithms with provable guarantees for NP-hard coverage problems.
  - Quick check question: Given sets A ⊂ B and element e ∉ B, can you explain why f(A∪{e}) - f(A) ≥ f(B∪{e}) - f(B) implies diminishing returns?

- **Partition matroids and independence constraints**
  - Why needed here: Formalizes budget constraints (|S∩V(t)| ≤ b(t)) and type quotas (|S∩T_q| ≤ x_q) as matroid intersections, enabling greedy approximation.
  - Quick check question: For a partition matroid with parts V_1,...,V_r and bounds x_1,...,x_r, what is the independence set I?

- **Online optimization with revealed constraints**
  - Why needed here: Budgets b(t) arrive sequentially; decisions are irrevocable. Standard offline submodular maximization cannot be directly applied.
  - Quick check question: Why does uncertainty in future budgets require maintaining multiple "options" (minimizing |Q(S)|) rather than greedily optimizing for current budget only?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Data layer: WorldPop population forecasts (1km gridded), friction surfaces for walking time, existing facility locations, administrative boundaries
  - Computation layer: Coverage function evaluation (Eq. 1), marginal gain computation g(S, {e}), min-ratio type sequence generation (Definition 22)
  - Optimization layer: Algorithm 1 (single-step learning-augmented), Algorithm 2 (multi-step planning with proportionality)
  - Output layer: Facility selections S^(t), coverage maps, satisfaction ratio dashboards

- **Critical path:**
  1. Load region data (population grid, terrain, existing facilities)
  2. Compute pairwise walking distances between candidate cells
  3. For each time step t: compute type quotas x_q^(t) via min-ratio sequence
  4. Execute greedy selection under partition matroid constraint
  5. If expert advice available: run Algorithm 1 as post-processing refinement
  6. Aggregate coverage statistics and satisfaction ratios

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Efficiency vs. equity: DP0 (unconstrained) achieves highest coverage; DP1/DP2 improve α_min at 1.0-1.8× efficiency loss (Fig. 4)
  - Advice dependency vs. robustness: Algorithm 1 improves on expert advice when good, degrades gracefully to (1-1/e)-approximation when poor
  - Computational cost vs. solution quality: Algorithm 1 requires O(b) greedy runs per time step vs. single run for pure greedy

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Zero coverage improvement: Existing facilities already provide >2-hour access to target population (observed in Sidama region, Appendix F)
  - Infeasible proportionality: Per-round budget b(t) < number of active types in Q(S); satisfaction ratio cannot improve
  - Numerical instability: Population forecast errors of ε multiplicative factor degrade approximation by factor (1-ε)/(1+ε) (Theorem 14)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline coverage sweep: Run MP(DP0) with varying annual budgets b ∈ {6, 12, 18, 24} on single region; plot f(S_existing) vs. f(S_new). Validates coverage function implementation.
  2. Proportionality enforcement test: Compare α_min(MP(DP0)) vs. α_min(MP(DP1)) on region with known district disparities (e.g., Afar). Confirms constraint mechanism.
  3. Learning-augmented retrospective: On district with existing expert selections A, compare f(A) vs. f(greedy) vs. f(Algorithm 1 output). Quantifies advice integration value.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can tighter, interpretable theoretical guarantees be established for the multi-step learning-augmented algorithm (Algorithm 5)?
- Basis: The authors state in Appendix C that while theoretical guarantees are possible, they are "unwieldly and do not provide any intuition," leading them to present the algorithm as a heuristic without formal claims.
- Why unresolved: The combinatorial complexity of integrating advice over multiple time steps under evolving matroid constraints makes deriving clean bounds difficult.
- What evidence would resolve it: A derivation of a closed-form approximation ratio for Algorithm 5 that is competitive with the single-step guarantees.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the approximation guarantees be improved for the learning-augmented approach without assuming the objective function is type-decomposable?
- Basis: In Appendix C, the analysis relies on the assumption that the objective function decomposes additively across types to simplify the analysis, noting that this is a proxy used because facilities primarily serve their own district.
- Why unresolved: Analyzing the interaction between general submodular functions and partition matroids with advice introduces coupling terms that are difficult to bound tightly.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof of approximation bounds that holds for general non-decreasing submodular functions without the decomposability requirement.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the HARP framework to systematic biases or unbounded errors in population forecasts?
- Basis: The paper notes population forecasts are "inherently uncertain" and assumes a bounded multiplicative error in Theorem 14 (Appendix B.2) to derive guarantees.
- Why unresolved: Real-world demographic data may violate the bounded error assumption, potentially degrading performance more than the theoretical analysis suggests.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis or empirical simulations showing performance stability under adversarial or unbounded noise models.

## Limitations
- Data access limitations: Core input data (existing facilities, district-level home birth rates) obtained via direct request from Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health and are not publicly available.
- Approximate submodularity: Theoretical guarantees depend critically on diminishing returns assumption that may not hold for all real-world facility catchments.
- Proportionality feasibility: Type-feasibility constraint can become infeasible when per-round budgets are very small relative to number of types requiring service.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Submodular coverage function properties and greedy approximation guarantees (Theorem 6, Appendix B.1); Learning-augmented algorithm safety f(U) ≥ max(f(greedy), f(advice)) unconditionally (Section 4.1); Proportionality constraint enforcement mechanism via type-feasibility (Algorithm 2, Theorem 9)
- **Medium confidence**: Efficiency-equity tradeoff quantification (1.0-1.8× relative efficiency loss) across Ethiopian regions; Learning-augmented improvement over expert advice in 25 districts (Experiment 3 results); Worst-case bounds under budget uncertainty and ordering effects (Theorem 9, Corollary 10)
- **Low confidence**: Performance under adversarial expert advice; Scalability to larger regions or longer planning horizons; Robustness to systematic errors in population forecasts or terrain data

## Next Checks
1. Stress test proportionality feasibility: Systematically evaluate MP(DP1) and MP(DP2) performance as annual budgets b(t) vary from 1 to 24 facilities. Identify the minimum budget threshold where type-feasibility becomes infeasible (α_min < β(b)) and quantify the proportion of time steps affected.

2. Expert advice sensitivity analysis: Generate synthetic expert advice sets with controlled overlap with optimal solutions (0% to 100% overlap). Measure learning-augmented algorithm performance across this spectrum to empirically validate the theoretical worst-case bounds and identify conditions where advice integration provides maximum benefit.

3. Data sensitivity validation: Perturb WorldPop population forecasts by ±20% uniformly across districts and re-run the planning algorithms. Compare changes in coverage (f(S)) and minimum satisfaction ratio (α_min) to quantify real-world robustness to forecasting errors.
