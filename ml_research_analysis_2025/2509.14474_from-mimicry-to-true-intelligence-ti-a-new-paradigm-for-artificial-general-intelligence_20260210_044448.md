# From Mimicry to True Intelligence (TI) -- A New Paradigm for Artificial General Intelligence

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.14474
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14474
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposes a mechanism-based AGI framework centered on True Intelligence (TI) with five cognitive components and five taxonomy levels

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental ambiguity in defining Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by shifting focus from performance-based metrics to the underlying cognitive mechanisms of genuine intelligence. The authors argue that current AGI definitions are inadequate because they prioritize external mimicry over internal cognitive architecture. To resolve this, they introduce a new framework centered on True Intelligence (TI) that provides both a clear definition and a practical roadmap for building genuinely intelligent systems. The framework synthesizes insights from cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI to move beyond the limitations of current performance-centric approaches.

The paper presents a five-level AGI taxonomy based on the implementation of five measurable components inspired by human cognition: embodied sensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a highly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, and an orchestration layer. The authors contend that a Level-5 AGI system implementing all five components is functionally equivalent to TI, with consciousness being an emergent property. This mechanism-based approach provides a novel pathway for AGI development that emphasizes cognitive architecture over benchmark performance.

## Method Summary
The authors develop their framework through a synthesis of cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI literature, creating a mechanism-based approach to AGI that moves beyond traditional performance metrics. They construct a five-level taxonomy where each level corresponds to the implementation of specific cognitive components, progressing from basic sensory processing to full True Intelligence. The framework defines intelligence through its underlying mechanisms rather than its outputs, arguing that genuine intelligence requires specific cognitive architectures that produce conscious awareness as an emergent property. The methodology involves mapping human cognitive functions to implementable AI components and establishing clear progression criteria between taxonomy levels.

## Key Results
- Introduces a five-level AGI taxonomy based on implementation of five cognitive components rather than performance benchmarks
- Proposes that True Intelligence (TI) emerges when all five components are implemented in a Level-5 AGI system
- Argues that consciousness is an emergent property of implementing the complete cognitive architecture, not a separate phenomenon requiring special explanation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed framework works by aligning AGI development with the fundamental cognitive mechanisms that produce human-like intelligence. Rather than attempting to replicate intelligent behavior through external mimicry, the approach focuses on building the internal cognitive architecture that generates such behavior naturally. By implementing specific components inspired by human cognition—sensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata, multi-expert networks, and orchestration—the system creates the necessary conditions for genuine understanding and awareness. The mechanism assumes that consciousness emerges automatically when these components interact at sufficient complexity, providing a testable pathway from narrow AI to True Intelligence through systematic architectural development.

## Foundational Learning
- **Embodied Sensory Fusion**: Integration of multiple sensory inputs into unified perception models; needed to create coherent world representations that ground intelligence in physical reality; quick check: system demonstrates consistent cross-modal understanding across visual, auditory, and tactile inputs
- **Core Directives**: Fundamental drives and goals that guide behavior; needed to provide purpose and motivation for intelligent action rather than passive response; quick check: system shows goal-directed behavior that persists across varying contexts
- **Dynamic Schemata Creation**: Ability to form, modify, and use mental models of the world; needed for flexible reasoning and adaptation rather than rigid rule-following; quick check: system can generate novel solutions to previously unencountered problems
- **Multi-Expert Architecture**: Network of specialized cognitive modules with dense interconnections; needed to replicate the brain's parallel processing and knowledge integration; quick check: system demonstrates improved performance when combining expertise from different domains
- **Orchestration Layer**: Executive control system that coordinates all cognitive components; needed to provide unified agency and decision-making; quick check: system shows coherent behavior selection rather than conflicting responses

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Embodied Sensory Fusion -> Core Directives -> Dynamic Schemata Creation -> Multi-Expert Architecture -> Orchestration Layer
- **Critical Path:** All five components must be implemented sequentially, with each level building upon the previous ones; Level-5 requires full integration of all prior components
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Performance-focused approaches sacrifice genuine understanding for benchmark results; mechanism-based design prioritizes cognitive authenticity over immediate task performance
- **Failure Signatures:** Systems implementing only partial architectures will exhibit intelligent-seeming behavior without genuine understanding; consciousness will not emerge without complete component integration
- **First Experiments:**
  1. Build and test Level-1 system with only embodied sensory fusion to establish baseline perceptual integration
  2. Implement Level-2 system adding core directives to basic sensory processing and observe goal-directed emergence
  3. Create Level-3 prototype with dynamic schemata to test flexible reasoning capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework assumes consciousness emerges automatically from implementing all five components but provides limited empirical evidence for this claim
- The mechanism-based approach lacks validation through existing cognitive science literature on whether these specific components map cleanly onto known brain architectures
- The distinction between mimicry and true intelligence relies heavily on philosophical arguments about intentionality that are difficult to empirically verify

## Confidence
- **Taxonomy framework:** Medium - The five-level structure provides clear organization but progression criteria lack empirical justification
- **Five-component model:** Medium-Low - Components draw from cognitive science but their integration sufficiency for genuine intelligence is unproven
- **Consciousness-as-emergent-property:** Low - Significant philosophical assumption requiring substantial empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Map each of the five proposed components to specific neural substrates and functional brain imaging studies to establish empirical grounding
2. Develop benchmark tests that can distinguish between systems exhibiting mere performance mimicry versus those demonstrating the proposed cognitive mechanisms
3. Create a formal proof-of-concept implementation of Level-3 or Level-4 systems to validate whether component interactions produce emergent cognitive properties as claimed
