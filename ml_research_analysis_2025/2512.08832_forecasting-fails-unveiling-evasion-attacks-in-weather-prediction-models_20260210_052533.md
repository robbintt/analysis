# Forecasting Fails: Unveiling Evasion Attacks in Weather Prediction Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.08832
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08832
- **Reference count:** 36
- **Primary result:** WAAPO generates stealthy adversarial perturbations in weather models, achieving PMRG of 0.105-0.565 vs. Gaussian noise baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Weather Adaptive Adversarial Perturbation Optimization (WAAPO), a framework for generating stealthy adversarial perturbations in weather forecasting models like FourCastNet. The method enforces constraints for channel sparsity, spatial localization, and smoothness to ensure perturbations remain physically realistic and imperceptible. Experiments using ERA5 data demonstrate that WAAPO can manipulate forecasts to align with adversarial targets, even with small perturbations. Results show that while FourCastNet is robust to random Gaussian noise, targeted attacks can cause significant forecast deviations.

## Method Summary
WAAPO is a gradient-based optimization framework that generates adversarial perturbations for weather forecasting models. It combines a primary attack objective with penalty terms for field bounds and smoothness, then projects perturbations onto constrained subspaces using spatial and channel masks. The framework iteratively updates perturbations through gradient descent while maintaining physical realism through total variation regularization and bound constraints.

## Key Results
- WAAPO achieves Perturbation Magnitude Ratio relative to Gaussian (PMRG) of 0.105 for patch-based attacks and 0.565 for channel-based attacks
- Small perturbations to initial conditions can cause significant forecast deviations at longer horizons
- FourCastNet shows robustness to random Gaussian noise but remains vulnerable to targeted adversarial attacks
- Smoothness constraints produce more diffused perturbations that are less detectable than spiky alternatives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Gradient-based optimization with constrained projection produces effective, stealthy adversarial perturbations.
- **Mechanism:** WAAPO iteratively computes gradients of a composite loss function, performs gradient descent, then projects onto constrained subspaces via spatial masks M and channel masks C.
- **Core assumption:** White-box access to model ϕ and its gradients is available.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions constraints for channel sparsity, spatial localization, and smoothness; Algorithm 1 describes gradient computation and projection; FABLE paper confirms localized targeted attacks are feasible.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Balancing attack effectiveness with smoothness and boundedness constraints yields physically realistic perturbations that evade detection.
- **Mechanism:** The loss combines squared error to target t_adv with penalties for exceeding field bounds and violating smoothness thresholds.
- **Core assumption:** Penalty weights can be tuned to balance effectiveness and stealth.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section on localized attacks discusses smooth transitions; Figure 4 shows smoothness constraint produces diffused perturbations; vision transformer papers confirm smoothness affects detectability.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Small perturbations to initial conditions amplify through autoregressive forecasting, causing significant trajectory deviations.
- **Mechanism:** Weather models autoregressively generate forecasts from initial conditions, with compounded effects at longer horizons.
- **Core assumption:** The model exhibits chaotic sensitivity to initial conditions.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions significant deviations from small perturbations; Problem Statement defines objective to manipulate forecast via initial condition perturbations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gradient-based adversarial optimization (FGSM, C&W)**
  - Why needed here: WAAPO builds on standard adversarial attack formulations
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between untargeted and targeted adversarial attacks?

- **Total Variation (TV) regularization**
  - Why needed here: The L_TV penalty uses TV to enforce spatial smoothness
  - Quick check question: Why does minimizing total variation produce smoother images/fields?

- **Autoregressive sequence models**
  - Why needed here: FourCastNet generates forecasts autoregressively
  - Quick check question: How does error propagate in an autoregressive model over T steps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Z_0 -> Perturbation generator -> Projection module -> FourCastNet -> Output Z_1:T

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize δ^(0) = 0
  2. Forward pass through ϕ to compute Z_T
  3. Compute L(δ) = L_primary + L_∞ + L_TV
  4. Backward pass to obtain ∇_δ L
  5. Gradient descent update: δ^(k+1) = δ^(k) - α∇_δ L
  6. Project: Apply masks, zero out non-target channels
  7. Repeat until convergence or K iterations

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Higher λ_∞, λ_TV → more stealth, less attack effectiveness
  - Larger spatial mask M → broader impact, easier detection
  - More channels in C → stronger attack, reduced stealth
  - PMRG metric quantifies magnitude vs. Gaussian baseline

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Gradient explosion: Loss trajectory becomes spiky, optimizer diverges
  - Non-convergence: Penalty terms dominate, δ → 0
  - Poor localization: Spatial mixing dilutes patch-based attacks

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce unconstrained attack on temperature field to verify basic vulnerability
  2. Apply channel-only WAAPO to assess single-variable manipulation
  3. Apply patch-based WAAPO with spatial mask over South America; measure PMRG

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can WAAPO be refined to ensure localized patch-based perturbations result in the exact desired target profile?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper notes that patch-based attacks don't fully match the adversarial target due to spatial mixing.
- **Why unresolved:** The authors identify this limitation but don't propose a method to counteract diffusion.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified algorithm where forecasted field matches adversarial target t_adv with high fidelity in localized regions.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Do alternative weather models like GraphCast, ClimaX, and PanguWeather exhibit similar vulnerabilities to WAAPO?
- **Basis in paper:** The conclusion states evaluating adversarial robustness in these models represents a crucial research direction.
- **Why unresolved:** The experimental scope is limited exclusively to FourCastNet.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative study applying WAAPO to GraphCast, ClimaX, and PanguWeather with PMRG results.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can expanding the attack space beyond temperature to variables like surface pressure allow manipulation of severe weather scenarios?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state expanding attack space to surface pressure is essential for investigating hurricane forecasts.
- **Why unresolved:** The study focuses mainly on temperature and doesn't validate attacks on hurricane-specific variables.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments demonstrating successful adversarial steering of hurricane paths by perturbing surface pressure.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Can formal verification methods effectively mitigate adversarial exploitation risks without degrading forecast performance?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper concludes verification will be vital in mitigating adversarial risks.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper focuses on attack methodology and doesn't implement defense strategies.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Integration of verification technique that successfully detects WAAPO perturbations while maintaining forecast skill scores.

## Limitations

- **Model Generalization:** Experiments primarily focus on FourCastNet; effectiveness against other architectures is unclear
- **Real-World Applicability:** ERA5 dataset may not translate directly to operational forecasting systems with data assimilation
- **Physical Plausibility:** Physical realism of perturbations across different meteorological variables needs thorough validation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core mechanism of gradient-based optimization with constrained projection
- **Medium Confidence:** Effectiveness of combining attack objectives with smoothness and boundedness constraints
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim about autoregressive amplification

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Model Validation:** Test WAAPO against at least two additional weather forecasting architectures to assess generalization and compare attack success rates.

2. **Ensemble Robustness Test:** Apply WAAPO perturbations to initial conditions in an ensemble forecasting system to measure whether ensemble averaging reduces impact.

3. **Physical Consistency Audit:** Conduct meteorological expert review of generated perturbations to evaluate physical consistency across correlated variables and atmospheric dynamics principles.
