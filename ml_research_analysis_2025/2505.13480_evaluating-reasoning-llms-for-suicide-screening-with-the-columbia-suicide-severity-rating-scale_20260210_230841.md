# Evaluating Reasoning LLMs for Suicide Screening with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.13480
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13480
- Authors: Avinash Patil; Siru Tao; Amardeep Gedhu
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Initial evaluation of reasoning LLMs for suicide screening using C-SSRS

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates the performance of reasoning large language models (LLMs) for suicide screening using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The research benchmarks LLM capabilities in assessing suicide risk through standardized clinical criteria. The work represents an early exploration of applying advanced AI reasoning systems to mental health screening applications.

## Method Summary
The study appears to focus on benchmarking LLM performance rather than validating clinical applicability. The evaluation methodology is not fully detailed in the available information, with no reported clinical trial data or real-world deployment outcomes. The research likely involved testing LLM reasoning capabilities against C-SSRS criteria without specifying the exact model architectures used.

## Key Results
- Initial benchmarking of reasoning LLMs for suicide screening applications
- Application of C-SSRS criteria to assess LLM performance
- Focus on technical capabilities rather than clinical validation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of reasoning LLMs for suicide screening relies on their ability to process complex clinical criteria and identify risk patterns. These models can analyze multiple dimensions of suicidal ideation and behavior as defined by standardized assessment tools like C-SSRS.

## Foundational Learning
- **C-SSRS Framework**: Understanding of suicide risk assessment criteria - why needed: to evaluate LLM performance against clinical standards - quick check: familiarity with C-SSRS scoring methodology
- **Reasoning LLM Architecture**: Knowledge of how advanced LLMs process complex decision-making - why needed: to understand model capabilities and limitations - quick check: understanding of chain-of-thought reasoning
- **Clinical Screening Protocols**: Familiarity with mental health assessment procedures - why needed: to contextualize AI applications in healthcare - quick check: knowledge of standard suicide risk assessment practices

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data Input -> LLM Reasoning Engine -> C-SSRS Scoring Output
Critical path: Patient symptom description → Model processing → Risk assessment classification
Design tradeoffs: Model accuracy vs. computational efficiency vs. clinical safety
Failure signatures: False negatives in high-risk cases, misinterpretation of ambiguous symptoms, lack of contextual understanding
First experiments: 1) Benchmark against standard C-SSRS scoring accuracy, 2) Test on diverse demographic scenarios, 3) Evaluate edge cases in symptom presentation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No reported clinical trial data or real-world deployment outcomes
- Insufficient methodological transparency regarding evaluation procedures
- Lack of information about specific LLM architectures tested

## Confidence
The confidence level for the core claims about LLM reasoning capabilities for suicide screening should be rated as **Low** due to insufficient methodological transparency and validation data. The broader claims about clinical utility would be rated as **Very Low** confidence without evidence of clinical validation or safety assessment.

## Next Checks
1. Independent replication of the C-SSRS scoring accuracy using a held-out dataset
2. Evaluation of false negative rates and their clinical implications in high-risk scenarios
3. Assessment of model calibration and calibration stability across different demographic groups and clinical presentations
