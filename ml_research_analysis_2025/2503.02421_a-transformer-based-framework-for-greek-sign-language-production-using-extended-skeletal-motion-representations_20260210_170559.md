# A Transformer-Based Framework for Greek Sign Language Production using Extended Skeletal Motion Representations

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02421
- Reference count: 18
- First Greek Sign Language production system using transformer-based architecture with 2D skeletal pose representations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first Sign Language Production (SLP) system for Greek Sign Language, leveraging transformer architectures to convert text into sign language video sequences. The method utilizes extended skeletal motion representations through MediaPipe Holistic pose extraction, combined with innovative training strategies including hybrid teacher forcing and auto-regressive decoding, as well as pose-to-text translation loss for enhanced pose quality. Evaluated on the Elementary23 Greek SL dataset, the approach demonstrates significant improvements over baselines, achieving BLEU-4 scores up to 5.69 on the Math subset and 4.67 on the Greek subset.

## Method Summary
The system converts Greek text into sign language video sequences using a transformer-based architecture that operates on 2D skeletal pose representations. The pipeline begins with MediaPipe Holistic pose extraction to obtain 191 landmarks per frame (8 body + 141 face + 42 hands + frame counter). An optional LLM-based gloss generation step reduces vocabulary complexity. The core text-to-pose transformer uses 2-layer architecture with 4 attention heads and 512-dim embeddings, trained with hybrid teacher forcing (first half) and auto-regressive decoding (second half). A pose-to-text translation loss using CTC-based supervision from a pre-trained sign-to-text model prevents mean-pose regression and improves expressivity.

## Key Results
- Achieved BLEU-4 scores of 5.69 on Math subset and 4.67 on Greek subset, significantly outperforming baselines
- DTW alignment scores demonstrate superior sequence quality compared to teacher forcing only and auto-regressive only approaches
- Hybrid training strategy and gloss generation effectively reduce vocabulary complexity and improve pose accuracy
- Qualitative results show more natural and expressive sign sequences compared to previous methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hybrid teacher forcing followed by auto-regressive decoding improves sequence quality over either method alone. Teacher forcing stabilizes early training by providing ground-truth previous frames, enabling parallel training and strong input-output alignment. Auto-regressive decoding then forces the model to condition on its own predictions, learning error recovery. The scheduling algorithm alternates between these modes (first half TF, second half AD). Evidence shows TF+AD achieves BLEU-4 of 5.69 (Math) vs 1.69 (TF only) and 5.4 (AD only), with DTW alignment also improving significantly.

### Mechanism 2
Pose-to-text translation loss reduces mean-pose regression and improves pose expressivity. A pre-trained sign-to-text model provides auxiliary supervision during text2pose training. The CTC-based translation loss encourages generated poses to be discriminative enough to recover the original text, penalizing collapse to average poses that lose semantic content. Evidence shows pose-to-text loss improves BLEU-4 from 4.17 to 4.42 (dev) and 4.15 to 4.55 (test), with visual comparisons showing greater movement variability.

### Mechanism 3
LLM-generated gloss annotations reduce vocabulary complexity, improving learning on high-diversity datasets. GPT-4o transforms full sentences into gloss sequences, removing articles and connective phrases while preserving semantic content. This reduces lexical diversity (e.g., 14,345 words → smaller gloss vocabulary), making the mapping problem more tractable. Evidence shows gloss alone reduces BLEU-4 (3.56 vs 4.17), but combined with pose-to-text loss achieves 4.32 (test improvement over baseline).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Encoder-Decoder Transformers with Auto-regressive Decoding**
  - Why needed here: The core architecture requires understanding how cross-attention connects text encoder outputs to pose decoder inputs, and how auto-regressive generation conditions on previous predictions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why teacher forcing enables parallel training while auto-regressive decoding requires sequential frame generation?

- **Concept: CTC Loss for Sequence Alignment**
  - Why needed here: The pose-to-text translation module uses CTC to handle variable-length alignments between pose frames and text tokens without explicit frame-level annotations.
  - Quick check question: How does CTC handle the many-to-one mapping from continuous pose frames to discrete text tokens?

- **Concept: MediaPipe Holistic Pose Representation**
  - Why needed here: Understanding the 191-landmark subset (8 pose + 141 face + 42 hands) is critical for debugging pose quality and extending to new datasets.
  - Quick check question: Why were 8 pose landmarks selected instead of the full 33, and what tradeoffs does this introduce?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Text input → (optional gloss transformation) → Text encoder → Pose decoder (auto-regressive) → 191-landmark sequence → Visualization/rendering

- **Critical path:** Text input → (optional gloss transformation) → Text encoder → Pose decoder (auto-regressive) → 191-landmark sequence → Visualization/rendering

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Landmark reduction (543→191) speeds training but may lose subtle non-manual markers
  - TF+AD scheduling improves quality but doubles effective training time (5s/epoch TF + 30s/epoch AD)
  - Gloss preprocessing helps large-vocabulary datasets but adds LLM dependency and potential semantic drift

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Mean-pose regression: All generated poses cluster near average → pose-to-text loss likely disabled
  - Cross-signer failure: Model trained on Signer A produces near-zero BLEU on Signer B test set → insufficient signer diversity in training
  - Positional drift: Frames lose temporal coherence → check frame counter encoding ($c_f$ in Equation 1)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate baseline: Train text2pose with teacher forcing only on Math subset, measure BLEU-4 and DTW. Expected: ~1.69 BLEU-4, high DTW.
  2. Ablate pose-to-text loss: Enable TF+AD scheduling without pose-to-text loss. Compare pose variability qualitatively against Figure 7.
  3. Cross-signer generalization: Train on combined signers, evaluate BLEU-4 per-signer test sets to quantify signer dependency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework be extended to generate photorealistic sign language videos rather than solely skeletal motion sequences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion: "In the future, we aim to expand our work so that it also incorporates a generative module for photorealistic SL video synthesis."
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses exclusively on generating 2D keypoint coordinates (pose) and does not implement a rendering mechanism to map these poses to realistic human textures and lighting.
- What evidence would resolve it: The successful integration of a generative model (e.g., GAN or diffusion model) conditioned on the skeletal output, validated by user studies assessing the realism of the resulting videos.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What architectural or training modifications are necessary to achieve robust signer independence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note in Section 4.3 that the model "struggles to generalize across signers," evidenced by a BLEU-4 score of 0.00 when testing on Signer B after training solely on Signer A.
- Why unresolved: The current transformer architecture appears to overfit to the specific idiosyncrasies, styles, or vocabulary distributions of individual signers within the Elementary23 dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating stable performance (consistent BLEU/DTW scores) when the model is trained on a subset of signers and evaluated on a completely held-out signer.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why does the combination of data-driven gloss generation and pose-to-text loss yield mixed or negative results on development sets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Table 6 shows that while pose-to-text loss improves Dev BLEU-4 (4.42), combining it with glosses lowers this score (4.06), suggesting a potential conflict between the two optimization constraints.
- Why unresolved: The paper notes glosses can limit adaptability, but it does not explain the specific interaction degradation when the model is simultaneously constrained by CTC-based translation loss.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of gradient interference or attention conflicts between the gloss and translation loss objectives during training.

## Limitations

- The Elementary23 dataset is relatively small compared to other SLP benchmarks, potentially limiting generalization and model robustness
- Reliance on MediaPipe Holistic pose extraction introduces domain-specific assumptions about landmark availability and quality, particularly for rapid or small-motion signs
- The hybrid training strategy (TF+AD) requires careful scheduling and may not generalize across different dataset sizes or vocabularies without hyperparameter tuning

## Confidence

- **High** for architectural innovations (hybrid TF+AD training and pose-to-text loss) due to clear quantitative improvements (BLEU-4 gains of 4+ points, DTW improvements) and qualitative pose variability increases
- **Medium** for gloss generation benefits because while vocabulary reduction is demonstrated, the semantic fidelity of LLM-generated glosses for Greek Sign Language remains unverified
- **High** for overall SLP pipeline performance claims (up to 5.69 BLEU-4) given the ablation studies and cross-method comparisons

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-signer generalization test**: Train a single model on all signers in the Math subset, then evaluate per-signer BLEU-4 scores to quantify signer-specific adaptation versus generalization limits.

2. **Pose-to-text loss ablation with Greek subset**: Replicate the main experiment but disable the pose-to-text loss component; compare pose sequence variability visually and via DTW to verify its contribution beyond BLEU-4 metrics.

3. **Vocabulary size sensitivity**: Systematically vary gloss preprocessing strength (full sentences vs partial vs full gloss) on the Greek subset to establish the relationship between lexical diversity and SLP performance, identifying optimal preprocessing for different dataset sizes.
