# Direct Profit Estimation Using Uplift Modeling under Clustered Network Interference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.01558
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01558
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Proposed AddIPW-IPC adaptation achieves 2-3x better incremental profit per conversion than naive methods in clustered network interference settings

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of learning uplift models in the presence of clustered network interference, where treating one item affects the outcomes of others. The core method idea involves adapting the Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) estimator into a differentiable learning objective suitable for gradient-based optimization, enabling the direct optimization of economic outcomes like incremental profit. The methodology integrates AddIPW with response transformation techniques, using cluster-level outcomes instead of individual outcomes to account for interference effects. Through simulations, the proposed approach significantly outperforms interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow. Specifically, the AddIPW-Incremental Profit per Conversion (IPC) adaptation demonstrates superior profit generation at lower treatment fractions, yielding 2-3x better incremental profit per incremental conversion compared to naive methods when targeting the highest-impact interventions.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach for direct profit estimation using uplift modeling under clustered network interference. The method adapts the AddIPW estimator into a differentiable learning objective by combining it with response transformation techniques. Instead of using individual-level outcomes, the approach operates at the cluster level to account for interference effects. The key innovation is the AddIPW-Incremental Profit per Conversion (IPC) adaptation, which enables direct optimization of economic outcomes like incremental profit through gradient-based methods. The methodology leverages cluster-level outcomes to properly handle interference, where treatment of one item affects the outcomes of others in the same cluster. This framework allows for the optimization of profit-generating interventions while accounting for the complex dependencies introduced by network interference.

## Key Results
- AddIPW-IPC adaptation demonstrates 2-3x better incremental profit per incremental conversion compared to naive methods
- Superior performance particularly pronounced at lower treatment fractions
- Method significantly outperforms interference-naive approaches, with advantage growing as interference effects increase

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed method works by properly accounting for clustered network interference through cluster-level outcome aggregation and using the AddIPW estimator adapted for differentiable optimization. By treating clusters rather than individuals and incorporating interference-aware weighting, the approach captures the spillover effects that naive methods miss. The response transformation techniques enable direct optimization of economic metrics like profit rather than proxy objectives. The differentiable formulation allows gradient-based optimization to find treatment policies that maximize incremental profit while respecting the interference structure inherent in clustered networks.

## Foundational Learning

Causal inference with network interference
- Why needed: Understanding how treatment of one unit affects others is crucial for valid causal estimates in networked settings
- Quick check: Can identify and model interference patterns in network data

Uplift modeling fundamentals
- Why needed: Traditional supervised learning doesn't capture treatment effect heterogeneity
- Quick check: Can distinguish between response and non-response groups

Propensity score weighting methods
- Why needed: Corrects for selection bias in observational and experimental data
- Quick check: Can compute and apply inverse probability weights

Cluster-level vs individual-level inference
- Why needed: Interference violates SUTVA, requiring aggregation to preserve independence
- Quick check: Can identify when cluster-level analysis is necessary

Differentiable causal objectives
- Why needed: Enables gradient-based optimization for causal parameters
- Quick check: Can formulate causal estimands as differentiable functions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Data generation -> Interference-aware weighting -> Differentiable objective -> Gradient optimization -> Treatment policy

Critical path:
The critical path flows from proper interference modeling through cluster aggregation to the differentiable profit objective. The AddIPW weighting must be correctly implemented before the objective can be formed, and the objective must be properly formulated before gradient optimization can proceed. Treatment policy extraction depends on successful optimization.

Design tradeoffs:
The method trades computational complexity for accuracy by using cluster-level outcomes rather than individual outcomes. This increases memory requirements and computational cost but is necessary to handle interference. The differentiable formulation enables gradient-based optimization but requires careful numerical stability considerations. The choice of response transformation affects both optimization stability and final performance.

Failure signatures:
Poor performance when interference patterns don't match the clustering assumption. Numerical instability in the gradient optimization if propensity scores are too small or response transformations are poorly conditioned. Suboptimal treatment policies if the profit function is misspecified or if the response transformation doesn't adequately capture the relationship between outcomes and profit.

First experiments:
1. Verify cluster-level outcome aggregation correctly captures interference effects
2. Test numerical stability of the differentiable objective under various propensity score ranges
3. Validate that gradient optimization converges to reasonable solutions on simple synthetic data
