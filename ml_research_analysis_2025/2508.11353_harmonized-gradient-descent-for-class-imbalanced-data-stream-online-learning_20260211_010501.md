- Addresses class imbalance in online learning by equalizing gradient norms across classes

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of learning from imbalanced data streams in online learning settings, where class imbalance leads to biased model performance. The proposed Harmonized Gradient Descent (HGD) algorithm tackles this issue by equalizing gradient norms across different classes, ensuring balanced contribution from each class during optimization. This approach mitigates under-fitting for minority classes without requiring data buffers, extra parameters, or prior knowledge. Theoretical analysis establishes a sub-linear regret bound of O(√T) for HGD under standard assumptions.

## Method Summary
The Harmonized Gradient Descent (HGD) algorithm introduces a novel approach to handling class imbalance in online learning by harmonizing gradient norms across different classes. Unlike existing methods that rely on data buffering, synthetic oversampling, or specialized loss functions, HGD directly equalizes the gradient norms from different classes during the update step. The algorithm maintains computational efficiency by avoiding buffering mechanisms while ensuring minority classes contribute proportionally to the model updates. This gradient normalization approach enables balanced learning across classes without requiring prior knowledge of imbalance ratios or additional model parameters.

## Key Results
- Achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics (AUC, GMEANS, F1-score) and base learners
- Demonstrates strong performance on 72 datasets with varying imbalance ratios
- Maintains consistent performance in both static and dynamic imbalance scenarios while being computationally efficient

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HGD works by equalizing gradient norms across different classes during the optimization process. By normalizing the contribution of each class to the gradient update, the algorithm prevents majority classes from dominating the learning process. This gradient harmonization ensures that minority classes receive adequate representation in model updates, addressing the under-fitting problem that typically occurs in imbalanced scenarios. The approach is particularly effective for online learning because it operates on a per-sample basis without requiring knowledge of future data or maintaining large buffers of historical samples.

## Foundational Learning
- Online Learning: Sequential learning from streaming data without retraining - needed for real-time applications, quick check: model updates after each sample
- Class Imbalance: Unequal distribution of classes in training data - causes biased models, quick check: calculate imbalance ratio
- Gradient Descent: Iterative optimization algorithm using gradient information - fundamental to neural network training, quick check: verify gradient computation
- Regret Bounds: Theoretical performance guarantees in online learning - measures cumulative loss vs optimal model, quick check: compute O(√T) bound
- Convex Optimization: Optimization over convex functions with guaranteed convergence - enables theoretical analysis, quick check: verify convexity of loss functions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Data Stream -> HGD Algorithm -> Model Parameters -> Prediction Output

Critical Path:
Each incoming sample passes through HGD, which computes class-specific gradients, normalizes them to equal norms, aggregates the harmonized gradients, and updates model parameters accordingly. This ensures balanced learning across classes in real-time.

Design Tradeoffs:
HGD trades off perfect gradient matching (which would require buffering) for computational efficiency by using per-sample normalization. This design choice maintains streaming capability while achieving reasonable class balance. The algorithm avoids the memory overhead of buffering but may sacrifice some precision in gradient harmonization compared to batch-based approaches.

Failure Signatures:
Performance degradation occurs when class imbalance ratios become extreme (e.g., 1:100 or higher), as gradient normalization becomes less effective. The algorithm may also struggle with noisy data streams where gradient estimates are unreliable, leading to unstable updates. Concept drift scenarios where minority class distributions change rapidly may require additional adaptation mechanisms.

First Experiments:
1. Test HGD on a synthetic binary classification stream with known imbalance ratios to verify gradient normalization behavior
2. Compare HGD against naive OGD on moderately imbalanced datasets to establish baseline performance gains
3. Evaluate HGD's sensitivity to different imbalance ratios by systematically varying class distributions in controlled experiments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical regret bound assumes standard convex loss functions and may not extend to non-convex deep learning scenarios
- Performance metrics focus on AUC, GMEANS, and F1-score but may not capture all aspects of stream learning performance
- Computational efficiency claims are supported by avoiding buffering mechanisms but lack runtime comparisons with exact baselines

## Confidence

Theoretical regret bound: High
Empirical performance claims: Medium
Computational efficiency claims: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Test HGD on non-convex loss functions to verify theoretical guarantees extend beyond convex settings
2. Evaluate performance under concept drift scenarios to assess adaptivity in dynamic environments
3. Compare runtime performance with exact baseline methods to quantify computational efficiency gains
