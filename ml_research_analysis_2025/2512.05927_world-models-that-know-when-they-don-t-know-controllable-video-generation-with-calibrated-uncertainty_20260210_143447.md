- Key outcome: First uncertainty quantification method for controllable video models providing dense, interpretable subpatch-level confidence estimates

## Executive Summary
C3 introduces the first uncertainty quantification method for controllable video generation that provides dense, interpretable confidence estimates at the subpatch level. The method uses proper scoring rules to train video models for both accuracy and calibration, generating well-calibrated uncertainty estimates that identify untrustworthy regions including hallucinations, object interactions, and occlusions. By operating in latent space and decoding to pixel-level heatmaps, C3 avoids computational challenges while maintaining interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate effective out-of-distribution detection and strong negative correlations between predicted confidence and generation error across different robot embodiments.

## Method Summary
C3 operates on action-conditioned video diffusion models by adding an uncertainty quantification probe in latent space. The probe takes penultimate DiT features plus action/time embeddings and outputs per-subpatch confidence estimates via sigmoid/softmax. Training uses proper scoring rules (Brier score or BCE) with accuracy computed in velocity space to ensure calibration. Two variants exist: fixed-scale calibration (FSC) with single threshold and continuous-scale (CS-BC) with sampled thresholds for flexible inference. Latent confidence is decoded to RGB heatmaps via learned color map interpolation, enabling interpretable uncertainty visualization.

## Key Results
- Achieves low expected calibration errors (ECE) and maximum calibration errors (MCE) on robotics datasets
- Confidence heatmaps successfully identify hallucinations, object interactions, and occlusions
- Maintains calibrated uncertainty estimates even with out-of-distribution inputs and degraded video quality
- Works across different robot embodiments with strong negative correlations between confidence and generation error

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Proper Scoring Rules for Calibration
Proper scoring rules (Brier score, BCE) produce calibrated confidence estimates by penalizing mismatched probability predictions. The UQ probe outputs logits → sigmoid/softmax → confidence q̂. Training minimizes these strictly proper scoring rules, which theoretically guarantees convergence to true success rates (P[Y=1|Q=q̂] = q̂). This works when the probe converges and accuracy thresholds are well-specified.

### Mechanism 2: Latent-Space UQ for Computational Efficiency
Operating in latent space avoids pixel-space computational intractability while preserving spatial grounding. The VQ-VAE encodes frames to latent x ∈ U, where the UQ probe operates on penultimate DiT features z. This bypasses O(HWC) pixel-space training while maintaining spatial structure through learned color map interpolation for decoding to RGB heatmaps.

### Mechanism 3: Continuous-Scale Conditioning for Flexibility
Continuous-scale conditioning enables flexible accuracy thresholds at inference without retraining. CS-BC conditions the probe on threshold ε: q̂ = σ(fϕ(z, c, ε)). During training, ε is sampled uniformly from a discretized range. At inference, any ε in range yields calibrated confidence without architecture changes, though single-scale calibration may be slightly reduced.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Proper Scoring Rules
**Why needed here**: Guarantees that minimizing loss yields calibrated probabilities (q̂ = true success rate).
**Quick check**: If you train with MSE on binary targets, does it produce calibrated probabilities? (Hint: Only if targets are truly Bernoulli with p = target mean.)

### Concept: Latent Diffusion/Flow Models
**Why needed here**: C3's UQ probe operates on DiT latents; understanding VQ-VAE encoding and diffusion denoising is essential.
**Quick check**: Why does predicting velocity v instead of noise ϵ improve training stability? (Check Remark 1.)

### Concept: Calibration Metrics (ECE/MCE)
**Why needed here**: Primary evaluation for whether confidence estimates are trustworthy.
**Quick check**: If a model has ECE = 0.05, does that guarantee it won't be overconfident on any single prediction? (No—MCE captures worst-case.)

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
VQ-VAE encoder: RGB video → latent x → DiT backbone → penultimate features z → UQ probe fϕ → confidence q̂ → latent color map → RGB heatmap

### Critical path:
Training: (1) Sample video, encode → x; (2) Forward diffuse to xt; (3) DiT predicts v; (4) Extract z from penultimate layer; (5) Sample ε, compute ground-truth acc via velocity-space distance; (6) fϕ predicts q̂; (7) Compute proper score loss; (8) Stop-gradient on DiT, update both modules.

### Design tradeoffs:
- FSC vs. CS-BC: FSC is faster to train but single-scale; CS-BC is flexible but may sacrifice single-scale calibration
- BCE vs. Brier: Both proper; ablation shows negligible difference (~3e−4 ECE)
- With vs. without diffusion forcing: Ablation shows diffusion forcing increases underconfidence (ECE rises to 0.33)
- Stop-gradient vs. end-to-end: No calibration difference; stop-gradient saves compute

### Failure signatures:
- Green regions in heatmap where model is confident in inaccuracy (expected at low ε)
- Overconfident predictions on OOD inputs (should see higher uncertainty but calibration may degrade)
- Blurry wrist-camera outputs with high uncertainty (DROID observation)

### First 3 experiments:
1. **Calibration baseline**: Train FSC model on Bridge with ε=0.5, compute ECE/MCE and reliability diagram. Verify low ECE (<0.1) and diagonal tracking.
2. **Interpretability check**: Generate videos with known hallucination types, visualize confidence heatmaps, confirm high uncertainty localizes to hallucinated regions.
3. **OOD stress test**: Introduce novel background objects/lighting, measure calibration degradation vs. in-distribution. Expect ECE increase but remain <0.15 per paper.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1: History Conditioning Influence
How does the length of history conditioning inputs influence the accuracy and calibration of confidence predictions in video generation? The paper hypothesizes increasing history length can reduce uncertainty but conducted no systematic study. Evidence needed: empirical experiments measuring calibration error across varying history lengths.

### Open Question 2: Long-Duration Temporal Consistency
How can video models maintain long-duration temporal consistency of confidence estimates beyond conditioning input limits? The current architecture relies on finite history lengths, causing potential drift over extended video horizons. Evidence needed: demonstrations of stable calibration over significantly longer video sequences.

### Open Question 3: Diffusion Forcing Effects
Why does diffusion forcing degrade the calibration of uncertainty estimates, and can this be mitigated? Ablation revealed negative interaction between diffusion forcing and calibration, but the underlying mechanism remains unexplored. Evidence needed: analysis of theoretical impact of independent noise schedules on proper scoring rule convergence.

## Limitations

- Architecture transparency gaps limit reproducibility, particularly UQ probe specifications and action embedding MLP details
- Dataset specificity concerns regarding generalization beyond robotics applications
- Calibration at extreme thresholds shows underconfidence at low accuracy thresholds (ε ≤ 0.3), limiting high-precision scenarios
- Continuous-scale calibration may sacrifice single-scale calibration performance

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core claim that proper scoring rules enable calibrated uncertainty estimation is well-supported by theoretical foundations and extensive experimental validation.

**Medium confidence**: Claims about latent-space UQ avoiding computational challenges while preserving spatial grounding are supported by ablation studies but assume latent space preserves error structure.

**Low confidence**: Continuous-scale conditioning mechanism's flexibility claims have moderate support but acknowledge potential single-scale calibration reduction; OOD detection claims are demonstrated but limited to specific robotics contexts.

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture specification validation**: Implement UQ probe with varying transformer depths (2, 4, 6 layers) and hidden dimensions (256, 512, 1024) to empirically determine minimum viable architecture for achieving ECE < 0.1.

2. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Apply C3 to non-robotics video dataset (e.g., KITTI or UCF-101) and measure ECE/MCE degradation to validate latent-space UQ preservation assumptions beyond robotics.

3. **Extreme threshold calibration analysis**: Systematically evaluate C3's calibration performance at ε values spanning 0.01 to 0.5 to identify extrapolation limits and quantify underconfidence tradeoffs at safety-critical low thresholds.
