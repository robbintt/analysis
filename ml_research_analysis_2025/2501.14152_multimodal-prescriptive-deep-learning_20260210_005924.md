# Multimodal Prescriptive Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.14152
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14152
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: Prescriptive Neural Networks reduce estimated postoperative complication rates by 32% in TAVR procedures and mortality rates by over 40% in liver trauma injuries while maintaining interpretability through knowledge distillation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Prescriptive Neural Networks (PNNs), a multimodal deep learning framework that combines optimization and machine learning for prescriptive decision-making with multimodal data. PNNs are trained on embeddings to output outcome-optimizing prescriptions, demonstrating significant improvements in two real-world multimodal healthcare datasets. The authors address the interpretability challenge through knowledge distillation, fitting interpretable Optimal Classification Tree (OCT) models onto PNN prescriptions as classification targets, achieving performance nearly identical to their PNN counterparts.

## Method Summary
The Prescriptive Neural Network framework is a feedforward neural network that takes tabular and unstructured data as input, passes it through an embedding layer for unstructured data, concatenates with tabular features, and outputs a softmax probability distribution over treatments. The model is trained to maximize expected outcomes using a softened objective function with softmax approximation. The knowledge distillation approach fits OCT models onto PNN prescriptions, creating "Mirrored OCTs" that achieve comparable performance while providing interpretability for the tabular features.

## Key Results
- PNNs reduce estimated postoperative complication rates by 32% in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures
- PNNs reduce estimated mortality rates by over 40% in liver trauma injuries
- Mirrored OCTs achieve performance nearly identical to their PNN counterparts (average 1.38% decrease in improvement)
- PNNs outperform or perform comparably to state-of-the-art prescriptive models in four unimodal tabular datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PNNs work by learning optimal treatment policies through a combination of deep learning for multimodal data fusion and optimization-based training objectives. The framework handles multimodal data by embedding unstructured clinical notes and concatenating with tabular features, then training on estimated outcome rewards. The knowledge distillation through OCTs recovers interpretability by approximating the PNN's treatment decisions with interpretable decision rules, though this currently only explains tabular features while the embedding decisions remain opaque.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal embeddings**: Converting unstructured text data into vector representations that can be combined with structured features; needed to handle clinical notes alongside numerical measurements
- **Softmax approximation**: Using differentiable softmax functions to approximate discrete treatment selection; needed to enable gradient-based optimization for non-differentiable treatment outcomes
- **Knowledge distillation**: Training simpler interpretable models on complex model predictions; needed to recover interpretability while maintaining prescriptive performance
- **Counterfactual estimation**: Using methods like Doubly Robust to estimate potential outcomes for different treatments; needed to create training signals for prescriptive models
- **Optimal Classification Trees**: Decision tree models optimized for classification performance; needed to create interpretable approximations of complex PNN policies

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Clinical notes -> Embedding layer -> Concatenate with tabular features -> Fully connected layers -> Softmax over treatments -> Estimated outcomes
**Critical path**: Embedding extraction and concatenation with tabular data is critical for multimodal performance; any degradation in embedding quality directly impacts prescriptive accuracy
**Design tradeoffs**: The softmax relaxation enables training but may introduce approximation errors compared to exact discrete optimization; knowledge distillation sacrifices some granularity for interpretability
**Failure signatures**: Poor embedding quality manifests as random or biased treatment assignments; overfitting shows as excellent training performance but poor validation results
**First experiments**: 1) Test embedding layer separately on clinical note classification tasks to verify feature extraction quality; 2) Evaluate PNN performance on unimodal subsets to quantify multimodal benefit; 3) Compare Mirrored OCT performance against random forests to validate distillation approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How can interpretability be fully recovered for the unstructured modalities (embeddings) in multimodal PNNs, given that Mirrored OCTs currently only explain the tabular features?
- Basis in paper: "While the embedding features from the clinical notes are not interpretable, we can still recover some interpretability through the tabular features selected by the Mirrored OCT."
- Why unresolved: The current knowledge distillation method relies on Optimal Classification Trees, which inherently cannot provide semantic explanations for high-dimensional vector embeddings derived from language models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modification to the distillation process or an auxiliary interpretation mechanism (e.g., attention mapping) that can quantitatively link unstructured inputs to specific prescriptions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the softmax approximation of the objective function affect the optimality of the prescribed treatment policy compared to exact discrete optimization?
- Basis in paper: The paper states that because the indicator function is not differentiable, they "soften" the objective using a probabilistic softmax approach to enable backpropagation.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the "softened" objective consistently converges to the global optimum of the true discrete problem or if it introduces a relaxation gap that degrades policy quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis on small-scale datasets where PNN results are benchmarked against exact mixed-integer programming solvers to measure the performance gap.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the PNN performance to noise or bias in the counterfactual estimation step (rewards matrix Γ)?
- Basis in paper: The method relies on a pre-computed rewards matrix Γ (using Doubly Robust or Direct methods), assuming these estimates are accurate proxies for true outcomes.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates robustness to data splits but does not analyze the model's resilience to systematic errors or noise within the counterfactual estimates themselves.
- What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis using synthetic datasets with known ground-truth counterfactuals, where controlled noise is injected into the rewards matrix during training.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on estimated outcomes rather than observed post-intervention results, introducing uncertainty about real-world effectiveness
- Comparison with state-of-the-art methods is limited to four unimodal datasets, with generalizability to other multimodal domains untested
- Stability analysis across randomized data splits doesn't address potential overfitting concerns given the complexity of multimodal data fusion

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical implementation and knowledge distillation methodology
- Medium confidence in claimed performance improvements due to reliance on estimated rather than observed outcomes
- Low confidence in generalizability across different multimodal domains beyond the two healthcare applications presented

## Next Checks
1. Conduct prospective validation studies measuring actual post-intervention outcomes rather than estimated improvements
2. Test the PNN framework across diverse multimodal domains including non-healthcare applications to assess generalizability
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of individual multimodal components to the overall performance gains
