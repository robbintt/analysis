# DeepResearch$^{\text{Eco}}$: A Recursive Agentic Workflow for Complex Scientific Question Answering in Ecology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.10522
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10522
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Recursive LLM workflow achieves up to 21-fold more sources and 14.9-fold higher source density per 1,000 words in ecological synthesis

## Executive Summary
DeepResearchEco introduces a recursive, parameter-driven LLM workflow for scientific synthesis that enhances depth and breadth of literature exploration. Applied to 49 ecological questions, it achieves up to 21-fold more sources and 14.9-fold higher source density per 1,000 words. High-parameter settings (depth=4, breadth=4) yield expert-level analytical depth, cross-regional diversity, and superior information integration. Results show both depth and breadth independently contribute equally to synthesis quality, with depth enabling mechanistic reasoning and breadth ensuring global coverage. The system demonstrates scalable, domain-aware synthesis that rivals expert integration in ecology.

## Method Summary
The system employs a recursive agentic workflow with four sub-agents: generate SERP queries, search (ORKG Ask API for scholarly corpus or Firecrawl for web), summarize result, and generate report. Users input research questions with depth ($d \in \{1, 4\}$) and breadth ($b \in \{1, 4\}$) parameters. The workflow recursively searches, extracts learnings and follow-up questions, then synthesizes into schema-validated Markdown reports. Query count halves at each recursion depth. Evaluation uses similarity metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore, WMD) and domain-specific quality scores based on ecological vocabularies.

## Key Results
- 21-fold increase in source integration and 14.9-fold rise in sources integrated per 1,000 words
- High-parameter settings (d=4, b=4) achieve expert-level analytical depth and cross-regional diversity
- Depth and breadth parameters contribute equally to synthesis quality improvements
- Information density scales super-linearly: 21× more sources yield only 41.5% more words

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Recursive Query Refinement via Depth Parameter
Increasing depth transforms synthesis from surface-level description to mechanistic understanding through iterative query refinement. Each recursive layer receives accumulated "learnings" and follow-up questions, enabling progressively focused subqueries. Moving from d1 to d4 yields a 5.9-fold increase in source utilization (18.9 to 111.1 sources).

### Mechanism 2: Parallel Branching via Breadth Parameter
Increasing breadth expands geographic and methodological coverage without proportionally increasing content verbosity. The breadth parameter controls how many SERP-style queries are generated at each level, with queries halved at each depth level. Moving from b1 to b4 results in a 5.8-fold increase in source utilization (19.2 to 110.8).

### Mechanism 3: Information Density Scaling Through Source Integration
High depth-breadth configurations achieve 14.9× higher source density per 1,000 words. The system forces compression by merging top-k results into condensed "learnings" and synthesizing into fixed-length outputs, creating super-linear density scaling: 21× more sources yield only 41.5% more words.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: DeepResearch extends single-pass RAG into recursive, multi-step retrieval
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why standard RAG fails when answering a question requiring evidence from 100+ sources?

- **Concept: Search Engine Results Page (SERP) Optimization**
  - Why needed here: The `generate SERP queries` sub-agent converts natural research questions into keyword-optimized queries
  - Quick check question: Given "What are the effects of invasive species in grasslands?", what SERP-style query would you generate?

- **Concept: Schema-Constrained Output Validation**
  - Why needed here: The system enforces JSON schema validation on all outputs
  - Quick check question: Why might an LLM fail schema validation, and how would you detect it programmatically?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** generate SERP queries -> search -> summarize result -> generate report
- **Critical path:** User inputs question + parameters → Loop: generate queries → search → summarize → decrement depth → Final: generate schema-validated report
- **Design tradeoffs:** Depth vs. cost (each layer multiplies API calls); breadth vs. redundancy (high breadth risks overlap); ORKG Ask vs. Firecrawl (scholarly rigor vs. broader coverage)
- **Failure signatures:** Empty learnings (check search API or query quality); schema validation errors (inspect malformed JSON); recursive drift (follow-ups diverge from original intent)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline calibration: Run d1_b1 on 5 questions; verify output structure and source count (~9 sources per report)
  2. Parameter sweep: Compare d1_b4 vs. d4_b1 on same questions; assess whether depth or breadth drives quality gains
  3. Failure mode test: Run d4_b4 with vague question (e.g., "What is ecology?"); inspect whether breadth expansion retrieves irrelevant sources

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How effectively does the workflow transfer to scientific domains outside of ecology, such as materials science or social science?
- To what extent do automated vocabulary-based metrics correlate with human expert assessments of synthesis quality?
- Can the recursive workflow be optimized to reduce computational cost while maintaining high information density?

## Limitations

- Evaluation framework relies on proxy measures rather than direct human expert comparison
- Claims about expert-level quality remain qualitative without empirical validation
- Generalizability to non-ecological domains is asserted but not empirically tested

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Core observation that depth and breadth parameters independently scale source integration and information density is strongly supported by quantitative metrics.

**Medium Confidence:** Claims about expert-level analytical depth and cross-regional diversity are supported by domain-specific quality scores but rely on proxy measures rather than direct human evaluation.

**Low Confidence:** Claims about scalability to other scientific domains lack empirical validation and the ORKG corpus may not represent other fields.

## Next Checks

1. **Human Expert Benchmarking:** Conduct direct comparison between DeepResearchEco outputs and human expert syntheses on identical ecological questions, measuring inter-rater agreement on analytical depth and cross-regional coverage.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test:** Apply the workflow to non-ecological scientific domains (e.g., materials science) using domain-specific vocabularies to test whether depth-breadth scaling relationships hold.

3. **Error Propagation Analysis:** Systematically test whether increasing recursion depth amplifies retrieval drift by injecting controlled noise into early-stage learnings and tracking error compounding across recursion layers.
