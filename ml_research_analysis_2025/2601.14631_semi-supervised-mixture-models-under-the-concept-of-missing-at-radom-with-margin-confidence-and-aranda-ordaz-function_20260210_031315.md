# Semi-Supervised Mixture Models under the Concept of Missing at Radom with Margin Confidence and Aranda Ordaz Function

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.14631
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14631
- **Reference count**: 27
- **Primary result**: ECM-AO framework outperforms logistic regression baselines in AUC, LogLoss, and Brier score across various label missingness levels, particularly under moderate to high label sparsity

## Executive Summary
This study addresses semi-supervised learning with missing labels under a Missing at Random (MAR) mechanism, focusing on Gaussian mixture models. The key innovation is explicitly modeling the missingness probability as a function of classification uncertainty, quantified via margin confidence and flexibly parameterized using the Aranda–Ordaz link function. An efficient ECM algorithm is developed to jointly estimate both the mixture parameters and the missingness mechanism, enabling robust imputation of missing labels. Empirical results show that the proposed ECM-AO framework consistently outperforms logistic regression baselines in AUC, LogLoss, and Brier score across various label missingness levels, particularly under moderate to high label sparsity.

## Method Summary
The method combines a two-component Gaussian mixture model with a Missing at Random framework where label missingness depends on classification uncertainty. The core approach uses an ECM algorithm that alternates between an E-step (computing posterior responsibilities and margin confidence) and two CM-steps (updating mixture parameters and missingness parameters). The missingness probability is modeled via the Aranda-Ordaz link function, which flexibly captures asymmetric relationships between uncertainty and missing probability. The framework jointly estimates all parameters from incomplete data without requiring a separate imputation step.

## Key Results
- ECM-AO achieves AUC ~0.71, LogLoss ~0.67, and Brier score ~0.19 on synthetic Gaussian mixtures with 70% missing labels
- Under non-Gaussian mixtures (Gamma, Beta, Laplace), ECM-AO maintains lower LogLoss and Brier scores compared to logistic regression
- Performance advantage diminishes but remains positive under extreme missingness (90%), with ECM-AO showing LogLoss ~0.79 versus baseline ~0.91
- On MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset, ECM-AO achieves AUC ~0.88, LogLoss ~0.65, and Brier score ~0.19 with 70% missing labels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Squared margin confidence provides a computationally efficient approximation to Shannon entropy for modeling classification uncertainty.
- **Core assumption**: Observations have margin confidence values where m² ≤ 0.36 (corresponding to posterior probabilities in [0.2, 0.8]), which covers the majority of practical observations.
- **Evidence**: Figure 1 demonstrates the second-order Taylor approximation closely matches true entropy for m² < 0.36; equation (5) shows the mathematical relationship.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Jointly estimating mixture model parameters and the missingness mechanism reduces selection bias induced by ignoring how labels go missing.
- **Core assumption**: Labels are Missing at Random (MAR)—missingness depends on observed features (via uncertainty) but not on the unobserved label values themselves.
- **Evidence**: Table I shows ECM variants achieve LogLoss ~0.67 vs. 0.97 for logistic baseline; Figure 4 shows stable AUC under increasing missingness.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The Aranda-Ordaz link function captures asymmetric relationships between uncertainty and missing probability, improving robustness under distributional misspecification.
- **Core assumption**: The true missingness mechanism may have skewed or asymmetric dependence on classification uncertainty, particularly under non-Gaussian data distributions.
- **Evidence**: Table II shows ECM-AO maintains lower LogLoss and Brier scores across Gamma, Beta, and Laplace mixtures; AO link yields slightly higher precision in Table I.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Rubin's Missing Data Taxonomy (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
  - **Why needed**: The entire framework is built on the MAR assumption. Without understanding when missingness depends only on observed data (MAR) versus unobserved labels (MNAR), you cannot determine if ECM-AO is appropriate for your dataset.
  - **Quick check**: If difficult-to-classify samples are more likely to have missing labels because annotators skip ambiguous cases, which mechanism applies? What if annotators skip samples from a specific class regardless of difficulty?

- **Concept**: Expectation-Conditional Maximization (ECM) Algorithm
  - **Why needed**: Parameter estimation requires understanding the E-step (computing posterior responsibilities τᵢⱼ) and the two CM-steps (updating mixture parameters θ, then missingness parameters α, λ). Implementation requires knowing when to use quasi-Newton vs. line search.
  - **Quick check**: In ECM versus standard EM, what is the difference in how the M-step is structured? Why might ECM be preferred when parameters have different constraints?

- **Concept**: Link Functions in Generalized Linear Models
  - **Why needed**: The choice between logit and AO link affects flexibility in modeling the missingness mechanism. Understanding that logit enforces symmetry while AO introduces a shape parameter explains the robustness benefits.
  - **Quick check**: What constraint does logit impose on the relationship between the linear predictor and the response probability? How does the AO link's λ parameter change this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Features yⱼ → GMM Core (τₖⱼ) → Margin Confidence Module (δⱼ) → Missingness Mechanism (qⱼ) → ECM Optimizer → Bayesian Classifier
- **Critical path**: 
  1. Initialize Θ⁽⁰⁾ = {θ⁽⁰⁾, α₀⁽⁰⁾, α₁⁽⁰⁾, λ⁽⁰⁾}
  2. E-step: Compute τᵢⱼ⁽ᵗ⁾, derive δⱼ⁽ᵗ⁾, evaluate qⱼ⁽ᵗ⁾
  3. CM-step 1: Maximize Q₁(θ) for mixture parameters
  4. CM-step 2: Maximize Q₂(α, λ) for missingness parameters
  5. Check convergence; iterate if not converged
  6. Apply Bayesian classifier to unlabeled observations
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Fixed vs. learned λ: Pre-specifying λ reduces computation; learning λ adds flexibility but may overfit
  - Margin threshold: Applying the m² = 0.36 threshold improves approximation validity but excludes confident samples
  - Initialization strategy: Random initialization vs. supervised warm-start affects convergence speed and local optima risk
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Convergence to trivial solution: All πₖ → 0 except one component; typically indicates poor initialization or insufficient class separation
  - Degrading performance at high missingness: ECM-AO advantage reverses near 90% missing; indicates insufficient information for joint estimation
  - Numerical instability in AO link: λ approaching boundaries (0 or extreme values) may cause overflow; requires bounded optimization
  - Inconsistent posterior updates: τᵢⱼ oscillating between iterations suggests step size issues in CM-steps
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce baseline simulation: Generate 2-component Gaussian mixture with 70% MAR missingness; verify AUC ~0.71, LogLoss ~0.67 match Table I
  2. Missingness sensitivity sweep: Vary missing proportion from 50% to 90%; plot AUC curves to identify operating range where ECM-AO provides advantage
  3. Distributional robustness test: Apply to non-Gaussian data; compare ECM-AO vs. logit-link ECM to quantify robustness benefit per Table II methodology

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Question 1**: How can the margin confidence metric be generalized to exploit the full posterior probability vector for mixture models with more than two components?
- **Question 2**: How can the ECM-AO framework be adapted to maintain performance advantages under extreme label sparsity (e.g., 90% missingness)?
- **Question 3**: To what extent is the ECM-AO framework robust to violations of the Missing at Random (MAR) assumption, specifically under Missing Not at Random (MNAR) mechanisms?

## Limitations
- The MAR assumption is critical but not universally satisfied in real-world labeling scenarios
- Margin confidence approximation degrades for extreme confidence cases outside the [0.2, 0.8] posterior range
- Binary classification focus limits direct applicability to multi-class problems
- Performance advantage diminishes under extreme label sparsity (>90% missing)

## Confidence
- **High**: AUC improvements over logistic baseline, ECM algorithm convergence properties, binary classification with two-component GMMs
- **Medium**: Robustness claims under distributional misspecification, performance maintenance at high missingness levels, generalization to real-world datasets
- **Low**: Multi-class extension feasibility, computational scalability beyond binary classification, comparison with modern deep semi-supervised methods

## Next Checks
1. **MAR assumption verification**: Analyze a real dataset to empirically test whether missing labels correlate with classification uncertainty (as required by MAR) versus label values (which would indicate MNAR)
2. **Extreme confidence validation**: Systematically evaluate performance when including observations with posterior probabilities outside [0.2, 0.8] to quantify the approximation degradation
3. **Multi-class extension**: Implement a three-component GMM version and evaluate whether the margin confidence approximation and ECM framework maintain their benefits beyond binary classification
