# Identifying Primary Stress Across Related Languages and Dialects with Transformer-based Speech Encoder Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24571
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24571
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Transformer-based models achieve 99%+ word accuracy on Croatian/Serbian stress identification, with 10-point drop on more distant dialects

## Executive Summary
This study investigates transformer-based speech encoder models for automatic primary stress identification in multi-syllabic words across related South Slavic languages and dialects. The researchers fine-tuned a pre-trained conformer model (w2v-bert-2.0) with an audio frame classification head, demonstrating superior performance over traditional SVM classifiers using acoustic features. Experiments showed near-perfect results for Croatian and Serbian (99.1-99.3% word accuracy) but notable degradation for more distant dialects, with only a few hundred training examples needed for strong performance.

## Method Summary
The researchers fine-tuned a pre-trained conformer model (w2v-bert-2.0) with a frame classification head for binary stress detection at 20ms intervals. Audio frames were labeled 0/1 based on forced alignment with syllable nuclei, then post-processed by selecting the syllable nucleus closest to the longest span of positive predictions. Training used 10,443 multi-syllabic Croatian words, with evaluation across Croatian, Serbian, Chakavian, and Slovenian test sets. The approach achieved high accuracy on closely related languages while revealing systematic biases from training data distribution.

## Key Results
- Transformer model achieved 99.1-99.3% word accuracy on Croatian and Serbian test sets
- Performance dropped to 88.9% for Chakavian and 89.0% for Slovenian, primarily due to first-syllable bias from training data
- Only 500 training samples were sufficient to reach peak performance on distant dialects
- The model significantly outperformed traditional SVM classifiers using prosodic features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-trained speech transformers encode stress-relevant prosodic information in higher layers, requiring only light fine-tuning to unlock.
- Mechanism: The w2v-bert-2.0 conformer (580M parameters), pre-trained on 4.5M hours across 143+ languages, already captures pitch, intensity, and duration patterns in its representations. Fine-tuning with a frame-level classification head specializes these general prosodic features for stress detection.
- Core assumption: The pre-training corpus contains sufficient prosodic diversity for stress patterns to emerge without explicit supervision.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model with an audio frame classification head"
  - [Section 4.1] "The raw transformer model is a 580-million-parameters conformer model which was pre-trained on 4.5 Mh of unlabeled audio data covering more than 143 languages"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; corpus neighbors focus on dialect modeling and ASR transfer, not prosody specifically.
- Break condition: If pre-training data lacks tonal/prosodic diversity (e.g., dominated by monotonous speech), stress signals may not be encoded.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Frame-level binary classification with nucleus-aware post-processing localizes stress more precisely than syllable-averaged features.
- Mechanism: Each 20ms frame is labeled 0/1 (1 during stressed nucleus). After inference, the longest contiguous span of positive predictions is identified, and the nearest syllable nucleus is selected. This preserves temporal resolution compared to averaging representations over syllables.
- Core assumption: Forced alignment provides sufficiently accurate nucleus boundaries for labeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.1] "we set our problem as a binary classification task on each audio frame"
  - [Section 4.3] "the syllable nucleus closest to the longest range of a span of positive predictions is selected"
  - [corpus] Not explicitly validated in corpus neighbors.
- Break condition: Poor alignment quality causes label noise; overlapping speech or rapid articulation degrades frame-level precision.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-lingual transfer degrades predictably with phonological distance, compounded by training-data position bias.
- Mechanism: Croatian training data has 78% first-syllable stress, biasing predictions toward initial syllables. Serbian (similar stress patterns) transfers well; Slovenian (65% stress position mismatch) and Chakavian (14% unseen positions) show ~10-point accuracy drops.
- Core assumption: The model learns positional priors from training distribution rather than purely acoustic stress cues.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 5.2] "the wrong predictions on both Chakavian and Slovenian are mostly due to the first-syllable stress being preferred"
  - [Section 3.4] "13 (65%) of these have a different position of the primary stress [in Slovenian vs. Croatian]"
  - [corpus] ParlaSpeech 3.0 neighbor supports cross-lingual Slavic corpus construction but doesn't address stress transfer.
- Break condition: Training data with balanced stress positions would likely improve cross-lingual robustness.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Conformer architecture (CNN + Transformer hybrid)**
  - Why needed here: w2v-bert-2.0 uses conformer blocks; understanding local convolution + global attention helps explain why fine-tuning converges in ~1 epoch.
  - Quick check question: Why would a conformer be preferred over a pure transformer for 20ms frame-level audio classification?

- Concept: **Position bias in sequence classification**
  - Why needed here: The 78% first-syllable stress in training creates systematic errors on Slovenian; debiasing techniques (class weighting, position-aware loss) may help.
  - Quick check question: If training data has 78% class A at position 1, how would you detect whether a model learned positional vs. acoustic features?

- Concept: **Forced alignment for speech annotation**
  - Why needed here: Labels depend on Kaldi-generated nucleus boundaries; alignment errors propagate as label noise.
  - Quick check question: What happens to frame-level stress labels if forced alignment shifts nucleus boundaries by 40ms?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Audio (16kHz) -> Mel spectrogram -> w2v-bert-2.0 conformer -> Frame classification head -> Binary predictions -> Post-processing -> Word-level stress position

- Critical path:
  1. Load pre-trained w2v-bert-2.0 from HuggingFace
  2. Add frame classification head (2 output classes)
  3. Prepare dataset: force-align audio, label frames (0/1 per nucleus timing)
  4. Fine-tune with lr=1e-5, batch_size=32, 20 epochs, ~4.5 min/epoch on A100
  5. Post-process predictions to word-level stress positions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Frame-level vs. syllable-level classification**: Frame-level preserves temporal precision but requires alignment; syllable-level simpler but loses resolution.
  - **Full fine-tuning vs. frozen encoder**: Paper fine-tunes full model; freezing encoder may reduce overfitting on small data but likely hurts accuracy.
  - **Binary vs. multi-class (position prediction)**: Binary per-frame is simpler; direct position prediction would require fixed syllable counts.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Systematic position bias**: Model predicts first syllable regardless of acoustic evidence → check training position distribution.
  - **High variance with <500 samples**: Performance unstable → ensure minimum 500 multi-syllabic words.
  - **Poor cross-dialect transfer with new stress patterns**: >10% accuracy drop → expect retraining or domain adaptation needed.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate baseline on Croatian test set with 500 training samples; verify 95%+ accuracy.
  2. Ablate post-processing: compare "longest positive span" vs. "max probability frame" selection.
  3. Test position debiasing: reweight loss by inverse stress-position frequency; measure Slovenian/Chakavian improvement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: How can the robustness of transformer-based stress identification be improved to mitigate performance drops on related dialects and languages?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that future work will include "developing techniques for model robustness to language and dialect change."
  - Why unresolved: The current fine-tuned model exhibits a 10-point accuracy drop on Chakavian and Slovenian compared to Croatian/Serbian, largely due to a bias toward the first syllable learned from the training data.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of techniques (e.g., multi-dialect fine-tuning, adapter layers) that reduce the performance gap on the Chakavian and Slovenian test sets without sacrificing Croatian performance.

- **Question**: To what extent does the model rely on word memorization versus generalizable acoustic cues, and does gender influence performance?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly lists "more in-depth analyses such as gender and word memorization effects" as part of future work.
  - Why unresolved: While the study demonstrates high overall accuracy, it does not investigate whether the model is learning prosodic patterns or simply memorizing stress positions for specific vocabulary items, nor does it analyze performance differences across genders.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies showing performance on unseen words versus frequently occurring training words, and a stratified analysis of accuracy based on speaker gender.

- **Question**: Can the superior accuracy of transformers be combined with the cross-dialectal stability of traditional acoustic features?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The results section notes the "significant robustness of the traditional features" across diverse test sets, whereas the transformer's performance fluctuates more severely based on linguistic distance from the training data.
  - Why unresolved: The paper establishes a trade-off where SVMs using prosodic features are less accurate but more stable across dialects, while transformers are highly accurate but brittle when transferred to Slovenian or Chakavian.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A hybrid modeling approach or a transformer regularized with prosodic constraints that maintains high accuracy while minimizing the performance drop observed in the Artur-SL and Mi´ciPrinc-CKM datasets.

## Limitations

- Performance degrades by ~10 points on dialects with different stress patterns due to training data's first-syllable bias
- Cross-lingual transfer limited to closely related languages; more distant languages would likely require retraining
- Frame-level labeling accuracy depends entirely on forced alignment quality, which isn't independently validated

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Transformer model superiority over SVM baseline on Croatian and Serbian test sets (99.1-99.3% accuracy)
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about minimal training data requirements (few hundred words sufficient)
- **Medium confidence**: The systematic first-syllable bias explanation for cross-lingual errors

## Next Checks

1. **Post-processing algorithm validation**: Implement and test the "longest positive span" selection method independently to verify it correctly handles edge cases like multiple stress spans within single words and boundary conditions near word edges.

2. **Position debiasing experiment**: Reweight training loss by inverse stress-position frequency to create a balanced distribution, then measure the impact on Slovenian and Chakavian accuracy to confirm whether positional bias is the primary cross-lingual failure mode.

3. **Alignment quality assessment**: Generate synthetic test cases with known stress positions and introduce controlled alignment errors (±20ms, ±40ms shifts) to quantify the impact of forced alignment noise on frame-level labeling accuracy.
