# Coinvisor: An RL-Enhanced Chatbot Agent for Interactive Cryptocurrency Investment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.17235
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17235
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** RL-enhanced tool selection improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over base model for cryptocurrency investment analysis

## Executive Summary
Coinvisor is an RL-enhanced chatbot agent that performs interactive cryptocurrency investment analysis through a multi-agent framework with specialized sub-agents (PBAgent, HEAgent, CNAgent) for project background, historical events, and news analysis. The system employs reinforcement learning (PPO) to optimize tool selection strategies, shifting from minimal single-tool responses to comprehensive multi-tool investigation plans. A hybrid reward function balances syntactic correctness with semantic quality (coverage and relevance) to encourage thorough analysis. User studies with 20 cryptocurrency investors show high satisfaction (4.64/5 overall) and strong preference over both general LLMs and existing crypto platforms.

## Method Summary
The system uses a Llama-xLAM-2-8b-fc-r base model trained with PPO via TRL library using QLoRA (rank 8, alpha 32) on 1,000 synthetic crypto investment prompts. A hybrid reward function combines rule-based syntactic correctness (30% weight) with semantic quality scored by an LLM judge (70% weight, prioritizing information coverage at 80% and relevance at 20%). The multi-agent framework decomposes analysis into specialized roles executed by dedicated LLM prompts, with outputs synthesized by a Qwen3 reasoning model. Evaluation uses 500 manually annotated prompts measuring F1 score for tool selection accuracy.

## Key Results
- RL training improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over base model in tool orchestration
- User study shows high satisfaction (4.64/5) with consistent high scores across all functional modules and low variability
- Users strongly prefer Coinvisor over general LLMs (4.62/5) and existing crypto platforms for investment analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: RL-Optimized Multi-Step Tool Selection
Reinforcement learning fine-tunes the caller model to move from minimal, single-tool responses to comprehensive, multi-tool investigation strategies. The system models tool selection as a Markov Decision Process and uses PPO with a hybrid reward function that explicitly rewards "Information Coverage" and "Relevance," counteracting the base model's efficiency-driven minimalism. The judge model (Qwen3-30B-A3B) scores coverage (0.8 weight) and relevance (0.2 weight) to guide the policy toward higher-quality plans.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Agent Decomposition for Specialized Analysis
A multi-agent framework with role-specialized sub-agents (PBAgent for project background, HEAgent for historical events, CNAgent for real-time news) enables deeper, more structured analysis than a monolithic agent could achieve. Each agent is a dedicated LLM with specific prompt templates, allowing parallel or sequential processing with structured data exchange between agents.

### Mechanism 3: Hybrid Reward for Balancing Coverage and Precision
The hybrid reward function combines syntactic correctness (rule-based) and semantic quality (LLM-judge-based) to enforce valid tool calls while encouraging comprehensive, high-quality analysis plans. The weighted sum (w_judge=0.7, w_correct=0.3) prioritizes breadth of investigation for investment queries, with coverage weighted at 0.8 and relevance at 0.2 within the judge component.

## Foundational Learning

**Reinforcement Learning from Human/AI Feedback (RLHF/RLAIF):** Needed to align LLM tool-calling behavior with complex domain-specific objectives beyond supervised learning. Quick check: Can you explain how a reward model or judge LLM converts a trajectory of tool calls into a scalar reward for PPO training?

**Tool-Augmented LLMs & Function Calling:** Essential for understanding how Coinvisor invokes external tools/APIs. Quick check: What is the standard format for defining a tool's schema (e.g., name, description, parameters) that an LLM like xLAM-2-8b-fc-r-fc-r uses to generate a call?

**Multi-Agent System (MAS) Coordination Patterns:** Critical for analyzing how specialized agents work in concert. Quick check: In Coinvisor, is the coordination between PBAgent, HEAgent, and CNAgent primarily parallel, sequential, or hierarchical? What coordinates their outputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** User Interface (Web chatbot) -> Orchestration Layer (RL-tuned Caller Model: xLAM-2-8b-fc-r) -> Tool/Agent Layer (Data Analytics Tools & Report Agents like PBAgent/CNAgent) -> Reasoning Layer (Qwen3 model for synthesis). External APIs (Binance, Etherscan, CoinGecko) and Judge Model (for training) are peripheral.

**Critical path:** User's investment query -> Caller Model generates multi-step tool call plan -> Tools/Agents execute (fetching real-time data, analyzing news) -> All structured outputs fed to Reasoning Model (Qwen3) -> Final synthesized response returned to user. RL training loop is a separate offline path.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Real vs. Simulated Tool Execution in Training:** Training uses simulated tool outputs for efficiency (faster, cheaper) vs. potential sim-to-real gap where model might not handle real, noisy, or delayed tool outputs well.
- **Coverage vs. Precision in Reward:** Heavy weighting on coverage (0.8) encourages thoroughness but risks information overload or reduced precision vs. potential for less focused, more verbose outputs.
- **Specialized Agents vs. Monolithic Agent:** Decomposing into PBAgent/HEAgent/CNAgent allows specialized prompts and parallel execution vs. coordination complexity and possible loss of holistic reasoning.

**Failure signatures:**
- **Tool Orchestration Failure:** Caller model selects irrelevant tools, misses critical ones, or calls them in poor sequence. Look for low F1 scores on tool selection benchmarks or user feedback about incomplete analysis.
- **Agent Coordination Failure:** Outputs from PBAgent, HEAgent, and CNAgent are contradictory or poorly integrated by reasoning model, leading to incoherent final report.
- **Real-Time Data Latency/Failure:** Heavy reliance on external APIs (Binance, Etherscan) makes system vulnerable to API rate limits, downtime, or stale data, especially during market volatility.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Ablation Study on Reward Weights:** Retrain caller model with different weights for `w_cov` and `w_rel` in judge reward. Evaluate on 500-query benchmark to measure impact on precision, recall, and F1.
2. **Sim-to-Real Gap Analysis:** Compare caller model's performance (tool selection accuracy) when trained with simulated tool outputs versus real tool outputs to assess simulation assumption risk.
3. **User Study with Think-Aloud Protocol:** Conduct small-scale (5-10 users) think-aloud study where users verbalize thoughts while using Coinvisor for specific investment task. Record where they feel analysis is incomplete, redundant, or confusing.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Does training the caller model on simulated tool outputs compromise robustness when the agent encounters real-world API latency, rate limits, or unexpected data formats? The paper assumes simulation suffices for decision-making but doesn't evaluate performance with real noisy data. Resolution would require comparing agents trained on simulated vs. live API calls in noisy production environments.

**Open Question 2:** To what extent does the "LLM-as-a-Judge" reward model align with human expert preferences, and does it induce reward hacking? The paper identifies subjectivity in the reward mechanism as a threat but doesn't quantify correlation between judge scores and human expert scores. Resolution would require comparative analysis scoring model trajectories using both automated judge and blinded human expert panel.

**Open Question 3:** What specific architectural safeguards are required to transition Coinvisor from decision-support system to one capable of autonomous transaction execution? The paper frames execution gap as safety feature but leaves technical challenge of integrating secure execution layers unresolved. Resolution would require prototype integrating simulation layer or "human-in-the-loop" verification demonstrating safe failure modes.

## Limitations

- User study sample size (n=20) is relatively small for drawing broad conclusions about investor satisfaction
- RL training relies heavily on simulated tool outputs, potentially creating sim-to-real gap with degraded real-world performance
- Multi-agent coordination pattern not explicitly described as parallel or sequential, creating uncertainty about latency bottlenecks

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- RL training methodology (PPO with hybrid reward) is technically sound with specific, measurable improvements in F1 score (26.6%) and recall (40.7%)
- Multi-agent decomposition into specialized roles is a valid architectural pattern with reasonable theoretical justification
- User satisfaction metrics (4.64/5 overall, 4.62/5 vs alternatives) are clearly reported and internally consistent

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Claim that RL shifts behavior from "minimal to comprehensive" strategies is supported by metrics but relies on judge model's coverage/relevance scoring accuracy
- Assertion that specialized agents provide "deeper, more structured analysis" than monolithic agent is theoretically plausible but lacks direct comparative validation

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Generalization claim that Coinvisor will perform equally well for all cryptocurrency investment scenarios given limited evaluation dataset diversity and heavy reliance on simulated training data

## Next Checks

1. **Sim-to-Real Performance Gap Analysis:** Compare caller model's tool selection accuracy and execution success rate when using real API calls versus simulated outputs used in training. Measure successful call rate, latency, and error handling differences across 100 diverse investment queries.

2. **Extreme Market Volatility Test:** Deploy Coinvisor during high cryptocurrency market volatility (major price swings, network congestion) and measure API call success rates, response times, and whether analysis quality degrades compared to normal market conditions.

3. **Cross-Investor Role Validation:** Expand user study to 30-50 participants representing different cryptocurrency investor profiles (day traders, long-term holders, institutional analysts) and measure whether satisfaction scores and preferred features vary significantly by user type.
