# From Videos to Indexed Knowledge Graphs -- Framework to Marry Methods for Multimodal Content Analysis and Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01513
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01513
- Authors: Basem Rizk; Joel Walsh; Mark Core; Benjamin Nye
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework transforms videos into frame-level indexed knowledge graphs using a modular pipeline of pre-trained models, enabling retrieval and continual learning with domain-specific extensions.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for constructing and querying knowledge graphs from video data, with a focus on continual learning and knowledge extension. The framework enables efficient prototyping of pipelines for multi-modal content analysis by integrating pre-trained models. A novel method is introduced to transform videos into a temporal semi-structured data format, and further into a frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation. This representation is query-able and supports continual learning, allowing for the dynamic incorporation of new domain-specific knowledge. The primary result is the demonstration of a proof-of-concept software that can query information from a database of videos and append new domain-specific knowledge.

## Method Summary
The framework processes videos through a modular pipeline using DataWindow-Pipe abstractions. DataWindows accumulate raw media segments and intermediate inferences as they flow through Pipes (e.g., keyframe extraction, OCR, image tagging, dense captioning, scene graph parsing). The pipeline first generates aligned transcription-frame segments using Whisper and Spacy, then applies vision-language processing cascades: tagging → localization → segmentation → captioning → scene graph parsing. Dense captions are filtered using concreteness scores, and entities are mapped to WordNet synsets with WSD for indexing. Domain-specific knowledge is added via VirtualSynsets paired with mini-classifiers trained on ~50 annotated samples.

## Key Results
- Modular pipeline successfully transforms videos into frame-indexed knowledge graphs with WordNet synset nodes
- VirtualSynsets enable domain-specific knowledge extension with minimal training data (~50 samples)
- Proof-of-concept demonstrates queryable video knowledge base with retrieval capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: DataWindow-Pipe Abstraction for Modular Inference Composition
- **Claim:** The DataWindow-Pipe abstraction enables flexible composition of heterogeneous pre-trained models by standardizing data flow through a common container format.
- **Mechanism:** DataWindows act as accumulative state containers carrying raw media segments and intermediate inferences. Pipes read from and write to the DataWindow without direct coupling. The Pipeline orchestrator manages parallelism and sequencing.
- **Core assumption:** Overhead of maintaining generalized containers does not negate modularity benefits; individual model inference times can achieve near real-time when composed.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "The system uses a modular design where DataWindow objects flow through Pipes... enabling flexible experimentation with different model combinations." [section 3.1]: "A DataWindow contains theoretically an unlimited number of placeholders for any format and any type of inferences, allowing Pipe(s) to read, and add/manipulate information."
- **Break condition:** If pipeline latency becomes dominated by DataWindow serialization/deserialization overhead, or if cross-pipe dependencies require tight coupling.

### Mechanism 2: Cascaded Vision-Language Processing with Concrete Filtering
- **Claim:** Sequential application of tagging → localization → segmentation → captioning, followed by concreteness-based filtering, reduces noisy relation extraction from generated captions.
- **Mechanism:** RAM provides open-vocabulary tags; these construct prompts for GroundingDino to localize objects; SAM produces fine masks; BLIP dense-captions cropped regions; scene graph parser extracts (subject, predicate, object) triplets; concreteness scores filter abstract entities.
- **Core assumption:** Errors from earlier stages do not cascade irrecoverably; SAM's automatic segmentation can partially compensate for upstream misses.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.2.2]: "Those relations' graphs are extracted and collected per every caption sentence... To filter the noisy relations in our graph, we adapt the approach performed in [44], by filtering the subjects-objects-relation tuples based on the mean of concreteness scores."
- **Break condition:** If concreteness filtering removes too many valid relations for abstract but domain-critical concepts.

### Mechanism 3: WordNet Synset Indexing with VirtualSynset Extension
- **Claim:** Mapping detected entities to WordNet synsets via WSD, then connecting via hypernym/hyponym relations, enables semantic retrieval; VirtualSynsets with mini-classifiers may support domain-specific extension.
- **Mechanism:** Nouns/verbs from transcriptions and captions are disambiguated using PyWSD with frame-level context, mapped to WordNet synsets, and nodes are linked by lexical relations. VirtualSynsets wrap domain-specific concepts and are paired with lightweight classifiers.
- **Core assumption:** WordNet coverage is sufficient for domain concepts; ~50 user-annotated samples are enough to train reliable mini-classifiers.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.3.1]: "We extract nouns and verbs... with the help of PyWSD word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm... we are able to identify corresponding word senses on the basis of WordNet." [section 3.3.2]: "In our demo, qualitatively, we show that using about 50 samples, that are interactively annotated by the user in few seconds, our system fine-tunes a YOLOv8 model to make this classification."
- **Break condition:** If WSD errors misassign synsets at scale, or if mini-classifiers overfit to few samples.

## Foundational Learning

- **Scene Graph Parsing:**
  - Why needed here: The pipeline uses scene graph parsing to extract structured (subject, predicate, object) triplets from dense captions; understanding dependency parsing and relation extraction clarifies how raw captions become graph edges.
  - Quick check question: Given the caption "A person wearing a helmet rides a bicycle on a road," can you identify at least two subject-predicate-object triplets?

- **WordNet Synsets and Lexical Relations:**
  - Why needed here: Nodes in the VideoKnowledgeGraph are WordNet synsets connected by hypernym/hyponym edges; grasping synsets is necessary to understand indexing and query traversal.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between "car.n.01" and "car.n.02" in WordNet, and how would the hypernym chain differ?

- **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):**
  - Why needed here: PyWSD maps words to synsets using context; WSD quality directly affects graph node identity and retrieval accuracy.
  - Quick check question: For the word "bank" in the sentence "He sat on the river bank," which WordNet synset should be selected, and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** DataWindowGenerator → DataWindows → KeyFrameExtractor → EasyOCR → ImageTagging (RAM) → GroundingDino → HQ-SAM → CroppingObjectFocuser → BLIP captioning → SceneGraphParser → WSD → SynsetNodes → VideoKnowledgeGraph

- **Critical path:**
  1. Video → DataWindowGenerator → DataWindows (aligned frame-transcription segments)
  2. DataWindow → KeyFrameExtractor → representative frames
  3. Frames → OCR (EasyOCR) + ImageTagging (RAM)
  4. Tags → GroundingDino (boxes) → HQ-SAM (masks) → CroppingObjectFocuser
  5. Cropped regions + full frames → BLIP captioning → merged dense captions
  6. Dense captions → SceneGraphParser (dependency parsing + co-reference resolution + concreteness filter)
  7. Triplets + tags + transcription → WSD → SynsetNodes → VideoKnowledgeGraph (hypernym-linked, frame-indexed)
  8. Query → query graph → overlap matching against VideoKnowledgeGraphs

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - BLIP vs. BLIP2: Authors report qualitative preference for BLIP (cheaper, sometimes better on close-ups)
  - Mask vs. crop: Authors choose rectangular crop over exact mask cutout for simplicity and robustness
  - Dynamic keyframe count: Scaled inertia + FAISS k-means avoids fixed n_kframes but adds clustering overhead

- **Failure signatures:**
  - OCR noise on animated text or partial glyphs propagates to erroneous tags
  - Redundant dense captions across similar consecutive frames increase downstream load
  - WSD misassignments cause incorrect synset nodes and retrieval misses
  - Mini-classifiers trained on ~50 samples may exhibit high variance on out-of-distribution frames

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run the provided pipeline recipe on a short video (30–60s) and inspect the output VideoKnowledgeBase JSON to verify frame-indexed inferences and extracted triplets
  2. Substitute BLIP with BLIP2 in the Captioner pipe and qualitatively compare caption diversity and accuracy on a held-out clip
  3. Create a VirtualSynset for a domain concept not in WordNet (e.g., "surgical_mask"), annotate ~50 samples via the demo interface, fine-tune the mini-classifier, and measure precision@5 on retrieval queries involving that concept

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can incorporating visual cues such as scene changes and object movements into the coherency calculation improve the generation of DataWindows, particularly for silent video segments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that visual channels offer "untapped potential" and that visual cues could be incorporated to "better generate the DataWindows (i.e., segment the video) — especially with silent video segments."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation relies primarily on textual transcription and coherency scoring based on that text, leaving visual segmentation unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating segmentation quality and semantic coherence against ground truth timestamps using a multimodal fusion approach versus the text-only baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does providing the captioning model with context regarding previously generated captions reduce redundancy and increase diversity in the dense captioning process?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that processing frames independently leads to redundant captions and explicitly propose "providing the captioning model with context about previously generated captions" as a solution.
- Why unresolved: The current pipeline processes each frame independently using BLIP, lacking a mechanism to maintain state or context across the frame sequence.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative metrics measuring caption distinctiveness and redundancy rates across consecutive frames in a video, comparing the current isolated inference against a context-aware approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can replacing discrete WordNet synsets with continuous embedding spaces improve the framework's ability to handle semantic nuance and continual learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest it is possible to "explore translating discrete WordNet senses into continuous embedding space to enable more nuanced semantic comparisons" or avoid discrete outcomes entirely.
- Why unresolved: The current system constructs the Video Knowledge Graph using discrete, hard-coded WordNet lexical relationships and identifiers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the retrieval performance of a continuous embedding-based graph against the discrete Synset-based graph, specifically testing on queries involving ambiguous or fine-grained semantic concepts.

## Limitations

- **Scalability and latency:** The DataWindow-Pipe abstraction may incur significant overhead when processing long videos with multiple heavy models running in parallel; hardware requirements are unspecified.
- **Quality of cascaded inference:** Errors in early stages (OCR, tagging) propagate downstream; concreteness filtering may remove valid but abstract domain concepts.
- **Mini-classifier generalization:** Training domain-specific classifiers on ~50 annotated samples may lead to overfitting and poor performance on out-of-distribution frames.
- **Evaluation gap:** The paper provides a qualitative proof-of-concept but lacks quantitative metrics for retrieval precision/recall, classification accuracy, or latency benchmarks.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The modular DataWindow-Pipe design is clearly described and implementable; the synset-based indexing mechanism (WordNet + WSD) is technically sound.
- **Medium confidence:** The cascaded vision-language processing pipeline is plausible but untested at scale; mini-classifier fine-tuning with ~50 samples is a reasonable but unproven approach.
- **Low confidence:** Claims about real-time performance, scalability, and retrieval accuracy are unsupported by quantitative evidence.

## Next Checks

1. **Hardware scalability test:** Measure end-to-end pipeline latency on videos of increasing length (30s, 5min, 30min) using a defined GPU (e.g., A100 80GB). Report per-pipe and total latency, and peak GPU memory usage.
2. **Retrieval accuracy benchmark:** Construct a small test set (e.g., 10 videos with 20 queries each) with ground-truth relevant segments. Evaluate retrieval precision@5 and recall@10 for both WordNet-based and VirtualSynset-based queries.
3. **Mini-classifier generalization study:** Train VirtualSynset classifiers on 50 samples, then measure performance on held-out test sets of increasing size (50, 100, 500 samples). Report precision, recall, and F1-score, and analyze overfitting trends.
