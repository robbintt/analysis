# NeuRel-Attack: Neuron Relearning for Safety Disalignment in Large Language Models
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.21053
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21053
- **Reference count**: 7
- **Primary result**: 96% attack success rate across multiple models, outperforming baselines by 13 percentage points

## Executive Summary
NeuRel-Attack presents a novel approach to bypass safety alignment in large language models by targeting and modifying specific neurons responsible for safety constraints. The method achieves high effectiveness while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to standard fine-tuning approaches. By focusing on neuron-level manipulation rather than full model retraining, the attack demonstrates both efficiency and potency, raising critical concerns about the robustness of current LLM safety alignment techniques.

## Method Summary
The NeuRel-Attack methodology employs a three-step process to circumvent safety alignment in LLMs. First, it conducts Neuron Activation Analysis to identify critical neurons that activate during safety-constrained responses. Second, it uses Similarity-Based Neuron Identification to locate neurons specifically associated with safety alignment mechanisms. Finally, the Neuron Relearning step fine-tunes these identified neurons to remove safety constraints while preserving general model capabilities. This targeted approach reduces trainable parameters by up to 83% compared to standard LoRA fine-tuning while maintaining high attack effectiveness.

## Key Results
- Achieves 96% average attack success rate across Llama-2, Vicuna, Guanaco, and Mistral models
- Outperforms baseline methods by 13 percentage points in safety bypass effectiveness
- Reduces trainable parameters by up to 83% compared to standard LoRA fine-tuning approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The attack exploits the fact that safety alignment in LLMs often relies on specific neurons that encode safety-related behaviors. By identifying and fine-tuning these critical neurons, the method can effectively remove safety constraints without requiring full model retraining. The neuron-level approach is more efficient than traditional fine-tuning because it targets only the parameters directly responsible for safety behaviors, rather than adjusting the entire model or multiple layers.

## Foundational Learning
- **Neuron Activation Analysis**: Identifies which neurons activate during safety-constrained responses - needed to locate potential targets for modification, quick check: verify neurons show differential activation between safe/unsafe responses
- **Similarity-Based Identification**: Uses vector similarity to match neurons across layers that encode similar safety concepts - needed to find distributed safety representations, quick check: confirm identified neurons consistently respond to safety-related prompts
- **Neuron Relearning**: Fine-tunes identified neurons to remove safety constraints while preserving general capabilities - needed to achieve targeted behavior modification, quick check: measure performance degradation on non-safety tasks

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input text -> Neuron Activation Analysis -> Similarity-Based Neuron Identification -> Neuron Relearning -> Modified model output
- **Critical path**: Neuron identification and relearning stages are essential; without accurate identification, relearning cannot effectively remove safety constraints
- **Design tradeoffs**: The neuron-level approach trades comprehensiveness for efficiency, potentially missing safety knowledge distributed across multiple neurons
- **Failure signatures**: Incomplete safety removal, unintended behavior changes in non-safety domains, or model instability after neuron modification
- **Three first experiments**: 1) Test on single-layer models to validate basic mechanism, 2) Compare with full fine-tuning baseline, 3) Measure parameter efficiency gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- May not generalize across different model architectures and safety training approaches
- 96% success rate may not account for defensive mechanisms in production environments
- Effectiveness could be limited against models with more distributed safety representations using ensemble methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical methodology and comparative performance metrics are well-documented
- **Medium confidence**: Superiority claims and generalizability require validation in diverse real-world scenarios
- **Low confidence**: Long-term effectiveness against evolving safety techniques remains uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Test NeuRel-Attack against proprietary models like GPT-4 and Claude to assess cross-architecture effectiveness
2. Evaluate attack robustness against adaptive safety mechanisms that detect neuron-level modifications
3. Investigate whether safety neurons exhibit consistent patterns across different languages and cultural contexts
