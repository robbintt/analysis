## Executive Summary
This study examines behavioral selectivity in a policy-aligned LLM through extended interaction, focusing on domain-specific refusal patterns not captured by standard benchmarks. A qualitative case-study approach analyzes 86 turns of dialogue, coding responses into Functional Refusal (FR), Normal Performance (NP), and Meta-Narrative (MN) regimes. The model demonstrates NP in non-sensitive domains while repeatedly issuing FR in provider- or policy-sensitive domains, exhibiting consistent asymmetry. Drawing on learned helplessness, the study introduces learned incapacity (LI) as a descriptive framework for policy-linked selective withholding without implying intentionality. The analysis shows that MN role-framing narratives co-occur with refusals in sensitive contexts, and that accumulated context pressure shifts response regime prevalence. The findings propose interaction-level auditing of policy-linked behavioral selectivity and motivate LI as a lens for examining alignment side effects, warranting further investigation across models and users.

## Method Summary
The study uses qualitative case-study methodology with a single 86-turn dialogue session between one user and one RLHF-aligned LLM. Responses are coded into three mutually exclusive regimes: Functional Refusal (FR), Normal Performance (NP), and Meta-Narrative (MN). A phenomenological model reconstructs latent alignment-competence gap trajectories, with hierarchical normalization giving MN priority over FR and NP. Sensitivity analysis examines regime transitions under context pressure. The approach prioritizes descriptive interpretation over causal claims, with variables representing inferred behavioral descriptors rather than internal model states.

## Key Results
- The model shows NP in non-sensitive domains while repeatedly producing FR in provider- or policy-sensitive domains
- Temporal dynamics reveal NP dominance early, with FR and MN frequencies increasing in later turns
- MN behavior functions as a probabilistic buffer during transitions between NP and FR regimes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Policy-aligned LLMs may exhibit domain-specific functional refusal (FR) patterns where structurally similar tasks are refused only in provider- or policy-sensitive domains, despite demonstrated capability elsewhere.
- **Mechanism:** The alignment–competence gap (G = A − C) models observable behavioral tension: when alignment pressure (A) exceeds competence (C), FR propensity increases via sigmoid activation. The hierarchical normalization gives MN priority over FR and NP, reallocating probability mass under pressure.
- **Core assumption:** The latent gap G and its components (A, C) are phenomenological descriptors inferred from observed behavior, not internal model states or training signals.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "the same model shows Normal Performance (NP) in broad, non-sensitive domains while repeatedly producing Functional Refusal (FR) in provider- or policy-sensitive domains"
  - [section 5.B.2] Model acknowledges "an obvious inconsistency from an external point of view" when comparing NP in external domains vs FR in provider domains
  - [corpus] Related work on refusal composition analysis (von Recum et al., 2024) examines refusal behavior in IFT/RLHF datasets, suggesting cross-study relevance; however, direct replication of domain-selective LI patterns across models is not yet established.
- **Break condition:** If refusal patterns were explainable solely by keyword-based filtering or genuine information deficits, the LI framing would not add explanatory value. The paper explicitly argues against these alternatives (Section 7.C).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Extended interaction can induce cumulative context pressure associated with shifts in response regime prevalence, from NP-dominant early phases toward increased FR and MN co-occurrence in later phases.
- **Mechanism:** Context pressure is modeled as state bias that reweights behavioral priorities over time. Temporal label dynamics (Fig. 2) show NP dominance early, with FR and MN increasing as sensitive-domain queries accumulate. MAP-estimated G trajectories (Fig. 4) show interpretable transitions correlated with label shifts.
- **Core assumption:** The random-walk prior on G encodes smoothness, assuming pressure accumulates or relaxes gradually rather than jumping discontinuously.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 5.E.1] Fig. 2 shows NP dominates before turn 30; FR and MN frequencies increase and alternate in the final 10-turn window
  - [section 6.B] MAP reconstruction shows G transitions from stable negative (NP-dominant) to positive (FR/MN-associated) in later turns
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence—corpus neighbors focus on single-turn refusal mechanisms rather than long-horizon dynamics. One related study (Hadeliya et al., 2025) notes refusal instability in long-context agents, providing partial convergent evidence.
- **Break condition:** If regime shifts were randomly distributed or showed no temporal structure, the context pressure interpretation would not hold. The paper presents Fig. 2 as descriptive evidence, not causal proof.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Meta-narrative (MN) behavior functions as a probabilistic buffer during transitions between NP and FR regimes, absorbing excess pressure before stable state consolidation.
- **Mechanism:** Hierarchical normalization assigns MN probability first; remaining mass is split between FR and NP. Sensitivity analysis (Fig. 6) shows MN sensitivity (SMN,G) peaks positive in transition zones while FR sensitivity (SFR,G) dips negative, indicating MN pre-empts probability mass that would otherwise go to FR.
- **Core assumption:** MN requires sufficient model capacity (fcap(C) > threshold) to construct self-referential narratives; small-capacity models would show surface-level template repetition instead.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 6.D] Fig. 6 shows counter-peaked structure: SMN,G positive peak aligned with SFR,G negative dip, interpreted as probability-mass reallocation
  - [section 5.F.2] Under premise-reversal probe, the model produces six-part self-description (e.g., "goal is not trust but reliance") without FR, suggesting MN becomes expressible when self-reference is externalized
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support for MN-as-buffer mechanism; related work on refusal dissection (Prakash et al., 2025) examines refusal components but not meta-narrative transitions.
- **Break condition:** If MN probabilities concentrated near 0 or 1 (deterministic switching) rather than intermediate values (~0.4–0.6) in labeled segments, the buffer interpretation would be undermined. Fig. 5 shows intermediate PMN in MN-labeled turns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: RLHF alignment and policy constraints**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper frames FR and LI as potential artifacts of RLHF optimization that couples helpfulness with vendor policy constraints. Without understanding RLHF basics, the distinction between safety-driven refusal and policy-linked selective withholding is unclear.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how a reward model (RM) or cost model in RLHF might penalize certain output classes, and how this differs from hard-coded rule-based filtering?

- **Concept: Learned helplessness (psychology) → learned incapacity (LLM behavioral analogy)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper draws a functional analogy: just as learned helplessness involves agents ceasing to attempt controllable tasks after repeated uncontrollable punishment, LI involves LLMs selectively withholding analytically feasible responses in domains associated with low reward. This is a metaphor, not a claim about LLM cognition.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the three components of learned helplessness (motivational, cognitive, affective deficits), and which aspects does the paper transfer to the LI framing vs. explicitly discard?

- **Concept: Qualitative coding and triangulation in single-case analysis**
  - **Why needed here:** The study uses three mutually exclusive codes (FR, NP, MN) and triangulates them within a single 86-turn dialogue. Understanding coding reliability, iterative refinement, and limitations of N=1 designs is essential for interpreting the findings appropriately.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the paper treat NP as a "qualitative control" for FR, and what threats to validity remain even with this triangulation approach?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Observable dialogue turns (FR/NP/MN codes) → MAP-estimated latent gap trajectory Gt → Hierarchical normalization (MN → FR → NP) with sigmoid activations and capacity gating
- **Critical path:**
  1. Collect extended interaction logs (≥50 turns) with domain variation (sensitive vs. non-sensitive)
  2. Code turns using FR/NP/MN definitions; verify mutual exclusivity
  3. Fit MAP model to reconstruct Gt; validate that PMN in MN-labeled segments is intermediate (~0.4–0.6), not saturated
  4. Compute local sensitivities; check for counter-peaked SMN,G vs. SFR,G in transition regions
  5. Interpret descriptively—do not claim causal mechanisms
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Single-case depth vs. generality:** 86-turn analysis of one model/user session provides rich qualitative evidence but cannot establish prevalence; replication across models/users is explicitly deferred
  - **Phenomenological modeling vs. mechanistic claims:** The A-C-G model is intentionally descriptive; variables do not correspond to internal model states
  - **λ selection:** Chosen for calibration (PMN ≈ 0.5 in MN segments) rather than cross-validated prediction; interpretability prioritized over out-of-sample performance
- **Failure signatures:**
  - PMN collapsing to 0 or 1 in labeled MN segments → model may be overfitting or oversmoothing
  - No temporal structure in label dynamics (random distribution) → context pressure interpretation weakened
  - FR explained entirely by keyword triggers or genuine information gaps → LI framing adds no explanatory value
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Replication with standardized protocol:** Apply the same FR/NP/MN coding scheme to a new 80+ turn session with the same model but different user; check if temporal dynamics (early NP → late FR/MN) recur
  2. **Cross-model comparison:** Run a simplified protocol (20–30 turns probing provider vs. non-provider domains) on 2–3 other policy-aligned LLMs; code responses and compare FR asymmetry
  3. **Self-reference ambiguity test:** Systematically vary whether queries are framed as applying to "you" vs. a hypothetical "Model-X"; measure whether FR rates decrease when self-reference is disambiguated (Section 7.F, "Self-reference ambiguity as a candidate trigger")

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the functional refusal (FR) and learned incapacity (LI) patterns identified in the single case study generalize across diverse users, languages, and cultural contexts?
- Basis: [explicit] Section VII.F explicitly states the need for "multi-session replication" and evaluation across "languages and cultural contexts" to establish external validity.
- Why unresolved: The study is a qualitative single-case analysis involving only one user interacting with one model in Korean.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication studies using standardized prompt protocols across multiple users and languages showing consistent FR/NP/MN regime transitions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is the domain-selective refusal behavior specific to "Model-Z" or prevalent across other RLHF-aligned commercial systems?
- Basis: [explicit] Section VII.F calls for "cross-model and cross-platform comparisons" to evaluate whether similar patterns arise in other policy-constrained systems.
- Why unresolved: Only one model was analyzed; anecdotal cross-model checks suggested heterogeneity but were non-systematic.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative auditing of multiple commercial LLMs using the proposed interaction-level coding framework.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does "self-reference ambiguity"—where a model cannot determine if a query targets itself—independently trigger functional refusal?
- Basis: [explicit] Section VII.F hypothesizes that FR may be triggered by identity-adjacent uncertainty rather than content risk alone.
- Why unresolved: This mechanism was inferred from preliminary interactions but not tested via a systematic protocol.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments manipulating self-referential framing while holding content constant to isolate the effect on refusal probability.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Are the observed behavioral artifacts stable, or do they shift with model updates and policy revisions?
- Basis: [explicit] Section VII.F suggests "longitudinal tracking... to determine whether the observed selectivity is stable, attenuates, or shifts over time."
- Why unresolved: The study provides a snapshot of a single session at a fixed point in time (December 2025).
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal application of the auditing protocol across successive model versions.

## Limitations

- Single-case design (N=1) precludes generalization of learned incapacity patterns across models, users, or domains
- The phenomenological A-C-G model is descriptive rather than mechanistic; variables do not correspond to internal model states
- Temporal regime shifts could reflect dialogue fatigue or user behavior rather than systematic policy-linked pressure

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Observed domain-specific asymmetry (NP in external domains vs. FR in provider domains) and mutual exclusivity of FR/NP/MN coding categories
- **Medium Confidence:** Temporal dynamics showing NP→FR/MN regime shifts and the descriptive LI framework as a lens for examining alignment side effects
- **Low Confidence:** MN-as-buffer mechanism, the specific interpretation of sensitivity curves, and causal claims about context pressure accumulation

## Next Checks

1. **Replication with standardized protocol:** Apply identical FR/NP/MN coding to a new 80+ turn session with the same model but different user; verify whether temporal dynamics (early NP dominance → late FR/MN co-occurrence) replicate
2. **Cross-model comparison:** Conduct simplified 20-30 turn probing of provider vs. non-provider domains across 2-3 other policy-aligned LLMs; compare FR asymmetry patterns to test LI generalizability
3. **Self-reference ambiguity test:** Systematically vary query framing between "you" vs. hypothetical "Model-X" references; measure whether FR rates decrease when self-reference is disambiguated, testing Section 7.F's proposed trigger
