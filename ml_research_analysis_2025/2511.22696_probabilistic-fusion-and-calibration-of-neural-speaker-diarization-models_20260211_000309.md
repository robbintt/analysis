# Probabilistic Fusion and Calibration of Neural Speaker Diarization Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22696
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22696

- Primary result: Fuse-then-Calibrate with Dynamic Logits fusion achieves 6.543% DER on CallHome two-speaker benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first comprehensive framework for calibrating and fusing neural speaker diarization models at the probability level. The authors address the problem that End-to-End Neural Diarization (EEND) systems produce frame-level probabilistic speaker activity estimates, but the reliability and calibration of these confidence scores have been largely neglected, limiting effective model fusion. They propose working with continuous probability outputs rather than hard segment-level decisions, enabling more sophisticated fusion and calibration techniques that leverage model uncertainty and complementary strengths across different architectures.

## Method Summary
The framework combines three EEND-EDA models with different acoustic features (MFB, ECAPA-TDNN+MFB, GeMAPS+MFB) trained on simulated two-speaker conversations. Models output frame-level logits that are transformed to probabilities in either multilabel or powerset space. The fusion engine combines outputs using methods like Dynamic Logits, Entropy, or MetaLearner fusion. A single Platt Scaling calibration layer is then applied to the fused output. The best configuration uses Fuse-then-Calibrate ordering with Dynamic Logits fusion and powerset calibration, evaluated on the CallHome two-speaker benchmark.

## Key Results
- Fuse-then-Calibrate ordering with Dynamic Logits fusion achieves 6.543% DER, outperforming DOVER-Lap (6.910% DER)
- Individual model calibration provides up to 19% relative DER reduction when properly implemented in powerset space
- Joint calibration in powerset space consistently outperforms independent per-speaker calibration
- Dynamic Logits fusion consistently ranks among top performers across different calibration strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Fuse-then-Calibrate Ordering
- Claim: Fusing raw model outputs before applying calibration is often more effective and computationally efficient than calibrating individual models first.
- Mechanism: The framework first combines uncalibrated logits or probabilities from multiple models using a fusion function (e.g., weighted average). A single calibration map (Platt scaling) is then learned for this fused output. This allows the calibration step to correct the ensemble's systematic biases jointly rather than correcting individual biases that may cancel out during fusion.
- Core assumption: The fusion process preserves sufficient information from the base models such that the combined uncalibrated output is a better input for a single calibrator than individually corrected outputs are for fusion.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "...Fuse-then-Calibrate ordering generally outperforms... while requiring calibration of only a single combined model." [Section V.E] Shows F→C achieving 6.543% DER (Dynamic Logits) vs C→F at 6.910%.

### Mechanism 2: Joint Powerset Calibration
- Claim: Calibrating a diarization model in the "powerset" space (treating all speaker combinations as distinct classes) outperforms independent per-speaker calibration.
- Mechanism: Instead of calibrating $P(speaker_1)$ and $P(speaker_2)$ independently, the method transforms outputs to a joint space (e.g., $P(s_1 \cap s_2)$, $P(s_1 \cap \neg s_2)$) and learns a calibration map here. This explicitly captures the statistical dependence between speakers (e.g., overlapping speech patterns) which independent binary calibration ignores.
- Core assumption: The errors in predicting one speaker's activity are statistically dependent on the activity of other speakers, and the calibration model (e.g., matrix scaling) has sufficient capacity to capture this.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "...joint calibration in powerset space consistently outperforms independent per-speaker calibration." [Section V.D] Individual models calibrated in Mult space perform worse than uncalibrated versions; Powerset calibration recovers performance.

### Mechanism 3: Dynamic Logits Fusion
- Claim: Weighting model contributions by the magnitude of their logits improves fusion over simple averaging.
- Mechanism: The fusion assigns higher weights to models that show higher "confidence" (larger absolute logit values) for a specific frame. This dynamically prioritizes the model with the strongest signal for that specific input, mitigating noise from uncertain models.
- Core assumption: The absolute magnitude of logits correlates positively with the likelihood of correct prediction (i.e., confident models are correct models).
- Evidence anchors: [Section III.B.1] Eq. (11-12) define the weighting based on $|z|$. [Section V.C & V.E] Dynamic Logits consistently appears among top performers (e.g., 6.543% DER in F→C).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Miscalibration in Neural Networks**
  - Why needed here: The paper assumes the reader understands that modern neural networks are often "overconfident"—predicting 0.9 probability when accuracy is only 0.7. Without grasping this, the need for the calibration module is unclear.
  - Quick check question: If a model outputs a probability of 0.8 for "Speaker Active," but the speaker is actually active only 60% of the time at that score, is the model calibrated?

- **Concept: Multilabel vs. Powerset Representation**
  - Why needed here: The choice of output space is the central design trade-off in the paper. One must understand why treating overlapping speech as independent binary problems differs from treating it as a single multi-class problem.
  - Quick check question: For 2 speakers, how many output classes does a Multilabel head have versus a Powerset head?

- **Concept: Logit vs. Probability Space**
  - Why needed here: The paper proposes fusing in "logit space" (pre-softmax/sigmoid) rather than probability space. Understanding the unbounded nature of logits vs. bounded probabilities is necessary to understand why simple averaging fails in one but works better in the other.
  - Quick check question: Why might averaging two probability scores of 0.01 and 0.01 result in a "confused" signal, whereas averaging the corresponding logits (large negative numbers) might preserve the "definitely negative" signal better?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Base Models -> Fusion Engine -> Space Transformer -> Calibrator -> Thresholding
- **Critical path:** Base Logits → Fusion (Logit Space) → Convert to Powerset → Calibrate (Power Space) → Thresholding
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Fusion Space:** Multilabel (Lower dimensionality, $S$) vs. Powerset (Explicit overlap modeling, $2^S$)
  - **Ordering:** Calibrate-then-Fuse (High redundancy, robust to single model failure) vs. Fuse-then-Calibrate (Efficient, relies on fusion quality)
  - **Fusion Logic:** Unsupervised (Dynamic/Entropy - no training data needed) vs. Supervised (MetaLearner - requires labeled calibration set)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **DER Degradation with Calibration:** Observed when calibrating individual models in Multilabel space (Table IV). Indicates the independence assumption breaks the calibration.
  - **Domain Mismatch:** If the "Fine-tuned" model is used on data wildly different from CallHome, the calibration map (learned on CH1) may distort probabilities further.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Sanity Check:** Run the 3 base models on the test set. Compute DER and BCE. Verify they are miscalibrated (check reliability diagrams if possible, or high BCE).
  2. **Ablate Calibration Space:** Take the best fusion method (Dynamic Logits). Compare DER when the final calibrator is trained in Multilabel space vs. Powerset space. Confirm Powerset is superior.
  3. **Validate F->C Efficiency:** Compare the DER of a "Calibrate-then-Fuse" pipeline vs. "Fuse-then-Calibrate." Verify that F->C matches or beats C->F while reducing calibration complexity (1 calibrator vs 3).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the probabilistic fusion and calibration framework be effectively extended to scenarios with more than two speakers, and how do the relative advantages of multilabel vs. powerset representations change as speaker count increases?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work should extend this framework to scenarios with more speakers..."
- Why unresolved: All experiments were conducted on the CallHome two-speaker benchmark only; the powerset formulation's class count grows exponentially (K=2^S), creating computational and data sparsity challenges as S increases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on 3+ speaker benchmarks (e.g., AMI, DIHARD) comparing calibration quality, fusion effectiveness, and computational costs across both output formulations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can alternative proper scoring rules be designed that better correlate with Diarization Error Rate (DER) optimization than Binary Cross-Entropy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "...explore alternative proper scoring rules that may better correlate with DER optimization"; [inferred] The paper observes cases where improved BCE does not translate to improved DER (e.g., ECAPA-TDNN shows substantial BCE reduction but minimal DER improvement).
- Why unresolved: BCE is a proper scoring rule but was designed for general probabilistic prediction, not the specific structure of speaker diarization errors; the mismatch between calibration objectives and task metrics remains unaddressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and empirical comparison of diarization-specific scoring rules that incorporate miss/false-alarm/confusion error structures, evaluated against both calibration metrics and DER.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can decision-theoretic frameworks leverage well-calibrated probabilities to optimize speaker decision thresholds based on application-specific costs and utilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "The application of decision theory to optimize thresholds based on application-specific costs and well-calibrated probabilities remains an important direction for future work"; [explicit] "...well-calibrated probabilities enable optimal decision-making under varying costs and priors through decision theory—an important avenue for future work."
- Why unresolved: This work uses a fixed threshold of 0.5 for speaker decisions; the full potential of calibrated probabilities for cost-sensitive decision-making remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating threshold optimization under asymmetric misclassification costs (e.g., penalizing false alarms more than misses in broadcast media vs. opposite in security applications).

## Limitations
- The powerset calibration mechanism assumes statistical dependencies between speakers exist and are exploitable, but the paper doesn't characterize when this assumption fails (e.g., distant microphone scenarios with low overlap)
- The Dynamic Logits fusion heuristic lacks theoretical grounding for why logit magnitude correlates with correctness, and could fail if base models have divergent calibration profiles
- All experiments were conducted on the CallHome two-speaker benchmark only, limiting generalizability to multi-speaker or different domain scenarios

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The empirical superiority of Fuse-then-Calibrate ordering (6.543% vs 6.910% DER) and the general benefit of calibration for individual models (up to 19% relative improvement) are well-supported by direct comparisons in Section V.E.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that joint powerset calibration consistently outperforms independent per-speaker calibration is supported but based on a single dataset (CallHome two-speaker). The mechanism's generality across domains and speaker counts remains unproven.
- **Low Confidence**: The Dynamic Logits fusion heuristic's theoretical justification is weak. While it performs well empirically, the assumption that larger logits indicate better predictions isn't universally valid, particularly across models with different output distributions.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Test the Fuse-then-Calibrate pipeline on a different diarization dataset (e.g., AMI meetings or DIHARD) to verify the calibration ordering benefit generalizes beyond CallHome.
2. **Powerset Scalability Test**: Evaluate the calibration performance as speaker count increases (3+ speakers) to identify the computational/accuracy tradeoff point where powerset space becomes impractical.
3. **Fusion Robustness Analysis**: Systematically vary the base model calibration quality (mix calibrated and uncalibrated models) to determine when Fuse-then-Calibrate breaks down versus Calibrate-then-Fuse becoming preferable.
