# Leveraging LLMs for Structured Data Extraction from Unstructured Patient Records

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.13700
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13700
- Reference count: 24
- System achieves >82% agreement for most features in structured data extraction from clinical notes

## Executive Summary
This study presents a HIPAA-compliant, locally deployed LLM-based system for automating structured data extraction from unstructured electronic health record (EHR) notes. The system employs tool-calling with customizable schemas and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for report filtering to process clinical documentation and extract features such as diagnosis dates and condition presence/absence. Validated against a manually annotated gold-standard dataset of 100 patients, the system demonstrates high accuracy (>82% agreement for most features) while also identifying several annotation errors missed in manual review. The modular, containerized pipeline offers a promising approach to reduce the burden of manual chart review and improve consistency in clinical data capture for research applications.

## Method Summary
The system architecture combines large language models with tool-calling capabilities to extract structured data from unstructured clinical notes. It uses customizable extraction schemas to define target data elements and employs RAG techniques for report filtering to improve context relevance. The pipeline processes clinical notes through a modular, containerized framework designed for HIPAA compliance with local deployment. The system was evaluated against a gold-standard dataset of 100 manually annotated patient records, comparing automated extraction results to human annotations to assess accuracy and identify potential improvements in data quality.

## Key Results
- System achieved >82% agreement for most extracted features when compared to manual annotations
- Successfully identified several annotation errors in the manually curated gold-standard dataset
- Demonstrated potential to reduce manual chart review burden while maintaining high accuracy in structured data capture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages LLMs' natural language understanding capabilities to interpret unstructured clinical text and extract structured data elements according to predefined schemas. The tool-calling mechanism enables the model to perform specific extraction tasks with greater precision, while RAG filtering ensures relevant context is available for accurate extraction. The modular architecture allows for customization of extraction schemas based on specific research needs, and local deployment maintains HIPAA compliance by keeping sensitive patient data within institutional boundaries.

## Foundational Learning
The system builds on recent advances in LLM capabilities for structured output generation, particularly tool-calling frameworks that enable precise data extraction tasks. It incorporates retrieval-augmented generation techniques from the NLP literature to improve context relevance during extraction. The modular containerized design reflects best practices in MLOps for healthcare applications, ensuring reproducibility and scalability while maintaining regulatory compliance requirements.

## Architecture Onboarding
The pipeline follows a modular design with distinct components for text processing, schema-based extraction, and validation. Users can customize extraction schemas by defining target data elements and their relationships. The system requires local deployment infrastructure meeting HIPAA compliance standards, with containerized deployment enabling easier scaling and maintenance. Integration with existing EHR systems would require API connections for data ingestion and result export, with appropriate security controls for patient data.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several areas requiring further investigation: how the system's performance varies across different clinical note types and specialties; whether the extraction accuracy remains consistent across different EHR systems and documentation practices; and how the system handles temporal relationships between clinical events when extracting structured data. The authors also note the need to evaluate long-term performance and potential degradation over time with evolving clinical documentation practices.

## Limitations
- Validation limited to small dataset (n=100 patients) from single institution, limiting generalizability across diverse clinical contexts and note types
- Performance metrics not broken down by individual features, obscuring which data elements may be less reliable
- Evaluation methodology conflates true system accuracy with correction of pre-existing annotation errors in gold standard
- Local deployment requirements may limit accessibility for smaller institutions with limited computational resources
- The system's reliance on LLM technology means it inherits known limitations around hallucination and inconsistent outputs

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: LLM-based tool-calling and RAG approaches for structured data extraction from clinical notes; modular containerized pipeline architecture
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about reducing manual chart review burden and increasing consistency; identification of annotation errors
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability across institutions, EHR systems, and clinical contexts; long-term performance stability

## Next Checks
1. External validation on datasets from multiple institutions with different EHR systems and documentation practices
2. Detailed per-feature accuracy analysis to identify less reliable data elements
3. Longitudinal performance assessment on clinical notes from different time periods to evaluate degradation over time
4. Evaluation of system performance across different clinical specialties and note types
5. Assessment of computational resource requirements and scalability across different institutional contexts
