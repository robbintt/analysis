# Digital Shielding for Cross-Domain Wi-Fi Signal Adaptation using Relativistic Average Generative Adversarial Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.20568
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20568
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 96% accuracy in material classification using digital shielding approach

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain adaptation in Wi-Fi sensing where environmental variations significantly affect signal integrity and system performance. The authors propose a digital shielding approach using a Relativistic Average Generative Adversarial Network (RaGAN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks in both the generator and discriminator. The model is trained to emulate a Faraday cage effect, suppressing domain-specific interference while preserving the integrity of Wi-Fi signals. An acrylic box lined with electromagnetic shielding fabric was used to create a clean dataset, and signals from various materials were acquired both inside and outside the box. The denoised signals were evaluated using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM), achieving an accuracy of 96%. The approach not only demonstrates robust cross-domain generalization but also enables material classification, offering potential applications in security systems for detecting concealed objects.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses RaGAN with Bi-LSTM networks to digitally shield Wi-Fi signals from domain-specific interference. The system processes Channel State Information (CSI) amplitude data extracted from ESP32 devices operating at 2.4 GHz. Training pairs consist of shielded (clean) and unshielded (noisy) signals acquired from four material cubes (acrylic, aluminum, copper, pine) placed inside and outside an acrylic box lined with electromagnetic shielding fabric. The generator learns to map unshielded signals to their shielded counterparts using a custom loss function combining MSE, L1, and relativistic average GAN loss. A multi-class SVM trained on shielded data is then used to evaluate the quality of denoised signals, with 96% accuracy achieved on material classification tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieved 96% accuracy in material classification using denoised signals
- Successfully emulated Faraday cage effect digitally using RaGAN with Bi-LSTM architecture
- Demonstrated effective cross-domain generalization with MSE of approximately 0.19 between generated and shielded ground truth
- Validated approach using real-world ESP32 CSI data across 10 days of acquisition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The relativistic average discriminator stabilizes training by comparing real and generated samples relatively rather than absolutely
- Mechanism: Standard GAN discriminators classify samples as real/fake independently, causing training instability when generator/discriminator capabilities diverge. The RaGAN discriminator estimates the probability that real data appears more realistic than generated data, providing more informative gradients and reducing mode collapse risk
- Core assumption: The relative comparison framework translates meaningfully to 1D signal denoising domains, not just image generation where it was originally validated
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...Relativistic average Generative Adversarial Network (RaGAN)..."
  - [section] "In particular, RaGAN introduces a relativistic average discriminator, which considers the real and generated samples as relative to each other rather than absolute entities"
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus evidence for RaGAN in Wi-Fi sensing; most neighbor papers use standard CNN/Transformer architectures without relativistic discriminators

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bi-LSTM processing captures bidirectional temporal dependencies essential for reconstructing clean signal trajectories from noisy inputs
- Mechanism: Wi-Fi CSI amplitude sequences exhibit temporal structure where each timestep depends on both preceding and following context. Bi-LSTM processes sequences forward (capturing evolution patterns) then backward (incorporating future context), concatenating hidden states to form richer representations than unidirectional processing
- Core assumption: The informative signal structure spans sufficient temporal windows that bidirectional context meaningfully improves reconstruction over causal (forward-only) models
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks in both the generator and discriminator"
  - [section] "By utilizing Bi-LSTM networks, the architecture processes the signal in both the forward direction... and the backward direction, incorporating future relationships"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus validation; neighbor papers like HandPass and PulseFi use CNN/Transformer architectures for CSI, with limited Bi-LSTM adoption reported

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training with paired shielded/unshielded signals creates a supervised mapping that generalizes to unseen environments without requiring environment-specific knowledge
- Mechanism: The acrylic box lined with EM shielding fabric provides ground-truth "clean" signals (DS). The generator learns to map unshielded signals (DU) to their shielded counterparts by minimizing content loss (MSE + L1 between generated and ground-truth) plus adversarial loss. This teaches the model to strip domain-specific interference patterns regardless of their source
- Core assumption: The shielding fabric adequately approximates a true Faraday cage, and the learned transformation transfers to environments with interference patterns not represented in training data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "An acrylic box lined with electromagnetic shielding fabric was used to create a clean dataset..."
  - [section] "The discriminator is trained with shielded samples... while the generator is trained with unshielded samples..."
  - [corpus] No corpus papers explicitly use shielded/unshielded paired training for domain adaptation; this appears novel to this work

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
  - Why needed here: The entire architecture builds on adversarial training between generator and discriminator. Without understanding loss dynamics, mode collapse, and training stability challenges, debugging this system is impossible
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the discriminator must not become too strong relative to the generator, and what symptoms would indicate this imbalance?

- Concept: **Channel State Information (CSI) in Wi-Fi**
  - Why needed here: The model processes CSI amplitude features extracted from OFDM subcarriers. Understanding how multipath, attenuation, and material properties manifest in CSI is essential for interpreting what the model learns
  - Quick check question: Given a CSI matrix of shape n × K (packets × subcarriers), what does each element represent and why might amplitude be preferred over phase for this application?

- Concept: **Sequence Modeling with LSTMs**
  - Why needed here: Both generator and discriminator use Bi-LSTMs to process temporal signal structure. Understanding hidden states, forget gates, and sequence processing is prerequisite to modifying the architecture
  - Quick check question: Why would a Bi-LSTM potentially outperform a standard LSTM for signal reconstruction, and what is the computational cost tradeoff?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input (1000 × 52 normalized amplitude) -> Generator: FC(52→256) -> Dropout(0.3) -> LeakyReLU -> Bi-LSTM(256 hidden) -> FC(512→52) -> Dropout(0.3) -> LeakyReLU -> LayerNorm -> Output (1000 × 52)
  - Input (1000 × 52) -> Discriminator: LayerNorm -> Bi-LSTM(256 hidden) -> FC(512→256) -> Dropout(0.3) -> LeakyReLU -> FC(256→1) -> Sigmoid -> Scalar probability
  - Loss Function: LG = Lc + λ·LRaG, where Lc = (LMSE + L1)/2 and λ = 100
  - Classifier: Multi-class SVM (RBF kernel, γ = 1/2σ2) trained on shielded spectra, tested on generated spectra

- Critical path: Data collection (shielded + unshielded pairs) -> CSI extraction -> Amplitude computation -> Normalization -> RaGAN training -> Generator inference -> SVM classification. The shielded box data quality directly determines upper bound on performance

- Design tradeoffs:
  - SISO vs MIMO: Paper uses single-antenna setup for simplicity; MIMO would provide richer spatial information but increase complexity
  - Amplitude-only vs amplitude+phase: Phase discarded to avoid alignment requirements; may lose discriminative information
  - Bi-LSTM vs Transformer: Bi-LSTM chosen for temporal modeling; Transformers may scale better for longer sequences but require more data
  - SVM vs deep classifier: SVM provides interpretable evaluation; deep classifiers might achieve higher accuracy but obscure whether improvements come from better denoising or classifier capacity

- Failure signatures:
  - Discriminator loss → 0 early: Generator not learning; reduce discriminator learning rate or increase generator capacity
  - MSE plateau at high value: Generator unable to match shielded spectra; check data alignment between paired samples
  - SVM accuracy ≈ random (25% for 4 classes): Generated spectra not preserving material-specific features; content loss weight may be insufficient
  - High variance across day-subsets: Temporal generalization failing; acquire more diverse training conditions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Sanity check paired data: Before training RaGAN, compute MSE between shielded and unshielded versions of same object. If variance is too low, the "denoising" task may be trivial; if too high, verify acquisition synchronization
  2. Baseline ablation: Train Bi-LSTM_CGAN variant and compare accuracy (paper reports 92% vs 96% for RaGAN). This validates whether relativistic discriminator provides meaningful improvement for your data
  3. Cross-environment validation: Train on acquisitions from days 1-7, test on days 8-10. Monitor both MSE and SVM accuracy to distinguish reconstruction quality from feature preservation. If MSE low but accuracy drops, the model is removing discriminative signal along with noise

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the proposed digital shielding model generalize effectively to complex, uncontrolled real-world environments?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states the proposed model "will also be evaluated in more complex real-world environments to assess its generalizability" in future work
  - Why unresolved: The current study primarily utilizes a controlled setup involving an acrylic box and specific object placements
  - What evidence would resolve it: Successful deployment and high accuracy maintenance in diverse, cluttered physical spaces without model recalibration

- Is the method capable of distinguishing between a significantly wider variety of materials and complex object geometries?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion notes that "a more comprehensive dataset will be collected, including a broader variety of materials" for future studies
  - Why unresolved: The current dataset is limited to four specific materials (acrylic, aluminum, copper, pine) and a single cube shape (2×2×2 cm)
  - What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating high classification accuracy across a dataset containing diverse material compositions and irregular object shapes

- Can advanced deep learning classifiers outperform the standard multi-class SVM used for material identification in this context?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion indicates that "future efforts will explore advanced classification frameworks specifically tailored to material recognition tasks," such as Neural Dynamic Classification (NDC)
  - Why unresolved: The current validation relies on a standard SVM to prove the denoising capability, leaving the potential of more sophisticated classifiers unexplored
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the denoised signals against advanced models like NDC or Dynamic Ensemble Learning to determine if accuracy exceeds the current 96%

## Limitations

- Data Collection Validity: The assumption that the acrylic box with electromagnetic shielding fabric provides "clean" signals may be questionable, as the effectiveness of this shielding configuration for 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signals is not validated
- Architecture Generalization: While RaGAN with Bi-LSTM shows strong performance (96% accuracy), the lack of direct comparison to other domain adaptation methods limits claims about the superiority of this specific architecture
- Real-World Applicability: The controlled environment with fixed material cubes and deliberate shielding may not capture the complexity of real-world scenarios where interference patterns are dynamic and unpredictable

## Confidence

**High Confidence (90-100%)**:
- The RaGAN framework with Bi-LSTM architecture can be implemented as described and will train successfully on paired shielded/unshielded data
- The methodology for extracting CSI amplitude features from ESP32 devices is technically sound
- The multi-class SVM evaluation provides a valid baseline for measuring signal classification performance

**Medium Confidence (60-89%)**:
- The relativistic average discriminator provides meaningful improvement over standard GAN discriminators for this specific signal denoising task (limited corpus evidence, though theoretical framework is established)
- The 96% accuracy generalizes to unseen environmental conditions (based on reported cross-day validation, but limited to 10-day acquisition period)
- The digital shielding approach generalizes to environments with interference patterns not represented in training data (theoretical possibility, but not extensively validated)

**Low Confidence (0-59%)**:
- The acrylic/EM fabric shielding configuration provides truly clean reference signals (no validation of shielding effectiveness reported)
- The model will maintain performance when deployed with different Wi-Fi hardware or frequency bands (no cross-platform validation)
- The learned transformation will transfer to completely different interference sources (only tested within controlled material acquisition setup)

## Next Checks

1. **Shielding Effectiveness Validation**: Measure and report the actual attenuation provided by the acrylic/EM fabric configuration across the 2.4 GHz band using a spectrum analyzer. Compare raw shielded vs unshielded signal power levels to quantify the "cleanliness" of the reference data and establish the physical basis for the supervised learning task

2. **Architecture Ablation Study**: Implement and compare against at least two alternative domain adaptation approaches: (a) standard Bi-LSTM-CGAN without relativistic discriminator, and (b) a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) approach. This would validate whether the RaGAN-specific mechanisms provide measurable advantages beyond just using GAN-based domain adaptation

3. **Cross-Platform Generalization Test**: Deploy the trained model on a different Wi-Fi hardware platform (e.g., USRP software-defined radio or commercial Wi-Fi card with different chipset) and evaluate performance degradation. This would validate whether the learned denoising transformation depends on ESP32-specific CSI characteristics or generalizes to broader Wi-Fi sensing applications
