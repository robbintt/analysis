# InfoDPCCA: Information-Theoretic Dynamic Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.08884
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08884
- Reference count: 19
- InfoDPCCA is a novel dynamic probabilistic CCA framework designed to extract shared latent representations from two interdependent sequences of observations, achieving superior clustering performance and latent state reconstruction compared to baseline approaches.

## Executive Summary
InfoDPCCA introduces an information-theoretic framework for dynamic probabilistic canonical correlation analysis that explicitly extracts only the mutual information shared between two interdependent observation sequences. The method combines a variational information bottleneck objective with a two-step training scheme that first learns compressed representations and then builds a full generative model. Experiments demonstrate InfoDPCCA's ability to recover ground truth latent states from synthetic Hénon map data and achieve superior clustering performance on fMRI data from multiple medical datasets, with NMI scores up to 1.000 and Silhouette scores up to 0.908.

## Method Summary
InfoDPCCA employs a two-step training approach. Step I learns a shared latent encoder using an information bottleneck objective that balances compression of input information with predictive sufficiency while penalizing encoding of sequence-specific information through conditional mutual information regularization. Step II freezes the shared latent encoder and trains a full generative model including private latents, optionally using residual connections and RNN reuse to stabilize training. The method is designed for two interdependent sequences and uses RNNs to encode temporal dependencies.

## Key Results
- InfoDPCCA achieves 72% global-mean correlation with ground truth latent states on synthetic Hénon map data, outperforming baseline approaches
- On medical fMRI data, InfoDPCCA achieves NMI scores up to 1.000 and Silhouette scores up to 0.908, surpassing PCA and DPCCA baselines
- The method demonstrates promise in detecting identity-specific dynamics in fMRI data, particularly on the ECEO dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Information Bottleneck Objective for Mutual Information Extraction
The information-theoretic objective forces shared latent states $z_t^0$ to encode only the mutual information between observation sequences through a combination of compression, predictive sufficiency, and regularization terms. The regularization explicitly penalizes encoding sequence-specific information by minimizing conditional mutual information terms.

### Mechanism 2: Two-Step Training Decouples Representation Learning from Generation
Separating information-theoretic representation learning from generative modeling prevents the shared latent from "cheating" by offloading dynamics to private latents, improving latent state quality. Step I captures shared dynamics which transfer meaningfully to Step II.

### Mechanism 3: Residual Emitter Connections with Gating Units
Reusing Step I's emitter network via residual connections with learnable gates stabilizes Step II training by adaptively controlling information flow from the fixed Step I emitter, assuming $z_t^0$ dominates the generative process.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB)** - Understanding the static IB objective $\min_\beta I(z;x) - I(z;y)$ is prerequisite as InfoDPCCA extends VIB to dynamic, two-sequence settings. Quick check: Can you explain why VIB uses a stochastic encoder $q_\phi(z|x)$ rather than deterministic mappings?

- **Concept: Mutual Information and Conditional Mutual Information** - The objective requires understanding $I(z;x|y) = I(z;x) - I(z;y)$ and how variational bounds approximate intractable MI terms. Quick check: Why does minimizing $I(z_t^0; x_{1:t}^1|x_{1:t}^2)$ discourage $z_t^0$ from encoding sequence-1-specific information?

- **Concept: Probabilistic CCA and State-Space Models** - InfoDPCCA builds on DPCCA's factorization structure and extends it with information-theoretic constraints. Quick check: In standard DPCCA, what prevents the shared latent $z_t^0$ from encoding private information?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: RNN encoders $d_1, d_2$ -> hidden states $h_t^1, h_t^2$ -> shared latent encoder $q_0^{1:2}$ -> $z_t^0$ distribution -> emitter networks -> observation predictions, with optional residual connections and private latents $z_t^1, z_t^2$

- **Critical path**: 1) Implement Step I: RNNs → shared encoder → IB objective (Equation 26); 2) Freeze Step I parameters; 3) Implement Step II: Add private latents → ELBO objective (Equation 28) → optionally reuse RNN hidden states (Equation 35)

- **Design tradeoffs**: Higher $\beta$ → stronger mutual information constraint but risk of underfitting shared dynamics; residual connections reduce parameters but assume Step I emitter quality; reusing RNNs reduces redundancy but couples Step I and II inference

- **Failure signatures**: Low correlation with ground truth latents (Step I not converging or $\alpha/\beta$ misconfigured); poor clustering NMI (shared latents not capturing discriminative mutual information); training instability in Step II (check gating unit saturation or learning rate mismatch)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate Hénon map experiment with $\alpha=1, \beta=0.1$; verify global-mean correlation approaches 72%; 2) Ablate Step I (train only Step II) to confirm performance drop to ~65% correlation; 3) Test on ECEO dataset with and without residual connections; compare NMI/Silhouette scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How can optimal values for the information-theoretic hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be determined theoretically rather than relying on cross-validation? The authors currently rely on default values ($\alpha=1, \beta=0.1$) or cross-validation, which does not guarantee optimal trade-off between compression and predictive sufficiency.

- **Open Question 2**: Can rigorous metrics be developed to directly validate that the extracted shared latent states $z_t^0$ encode *only* mutual information? The paper relies on downstream clustering performance as a proxy rather than a direct measurement of information exclusivity in the latent space.

- **Open Question 3**: How can the InfoDPCCA framework be extended to handle multiple data streams (multi-view) simultaneously? The current mathematical formulation is explicitly designed for exactly two interdependent sequences.

## Limitations

- Hyperparameter sensitivity: The α and β values significantly affect mutual information extraction but lack theoretical guidance for optimal selection
- Model scalability: Experiments use relatively small datasets; performance on larger, noisier real-world datasets remains unknown
- Generalization claims: Superiority claims over baselines need more rigorous comparison frameworks with statistical significance testing

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The two-step training architecture and information-theoretic objective formulation are well-defined and mathematically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Synthetic experiment results are reproducible and align with theoretical expectations, but real-world fMRI results lack statistical significance testing
- **Low confidence**: Claims about superiority over PCA and DPCCA baselines in fMRI clustering need more rigorous comparison frameworks

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter robustness**: Systematically vary α ∈ [0.1, 1, 10] and β ∈ [0.01, 0.1, 1] on synthetic data to identify stable regions and failure modes

2. **Statistical significance testing**: Apply paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to fMRI clustering results across multiple random seeds to validate reported improvements

3. **Scalability assessment**: Evaluate on larger fMRI datasets (e.g., HCP with 1000+ subjects) to test computational efficiency and performance stability under increased data complexity
