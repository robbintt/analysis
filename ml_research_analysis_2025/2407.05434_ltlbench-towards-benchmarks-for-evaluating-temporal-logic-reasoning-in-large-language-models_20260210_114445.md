# LTLBench: Towards Benchmarks for Evaluating Temporal Logic Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2407.05434
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05434
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GPT-5-Mini with few-shot CoT achieves highest accuracy (93.95%) on LTLBench, with performance degrading as formula complexity increases

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LTLBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models' ability to reason with temporal information using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The authors develop a systematic pipeline to generate temporal reasoning problems from random event graphs and LTL formulas, converting them into natural language prompts. LTLBench comprises 2000 problems designed to test LLMs across varying complexity levels. The benchmark is used to evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs using five different prompting methods, revealing significant performance variations based on model size, prompting strategy, and problem complexity.

## Method Summary
The authors present a three-stage pipeline for generating temporal reasoning challenges: (1) random event graph generation where nodes represent events and edges represent temporal constraints, (2) LTL formula generation using five core temporal operators (X, F, G, U, R) with controlled complexity, and (3) conversion to natural language prompts through template-based transformation. The LTLBench dataset contains 2000 problems with varying numbers of events (3-7) and operators (1-3), creating a spectrum of complexity levels. The benchmark evaluates models using zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting methods, with accuracy measured against ground-truth evaluations computed via the Spot library.

## Key Results
- GPT-5-Mini with few-shot CoT achieves highest accuracy (93.95%) across all tested models
- Performance drops significantly as problem complexity increases with more formula operators or events
- Qualitative analysis reveals three main reasoning issues: temporal semantics misalignment, context-hypothesis detachment, and reasoning error amplification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by systematically varying the complexity of temporal reasoning tasks through controlled manipulation of event graph structure and LTL formula composition. The generation pipeline creates problems with predictable difficulty scaling, allowing researchers to identify specific failure points in LLM reasoning capabilities. By converting formal logic specifications into natural language prompts, the benchmark bridges the gap between theoretical temporal reasoning and practical LLM evaluation, revealing how models handle temporal semantics when embedded in conversational contexts.

## Foundational Learning

**Linear Temporal Logic (LTL):** A formal system for specifying properties of temporal sequences using logical operators and temporal modalities. Needed to understand the theoretical foundation of temporal reasoning tasks; quick check: verify understanding of X (next), F (eventually), G (always), U (until), and R (release) operators.

**Event Graph Structure:** A directed graph where nodes represent events and edges encode temporal relationships between them. Required to comprehend how problem complexity is constructed; quick check: trace temporal paths through sample event graphs.

**Prompt Engineering Methods:** Techniques including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting that influence model performance. Essential for understanding evaluation methodology; quick check: compare prompt structures across different methods.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Event Graph Generator -> LTL Formula Generator -> Natural Language Template Converter -> LLM Evaluator -> Accuracy Assessment

**Critical Path:** Problem Generation (Graph → Formula → Prompt) → Model Inference (Prompt → Response) → Ground Truth Evaluation (Spot Library) → Accuracy Calculation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Synthetic problem generation enables controlled complexity scaling but may not reflect natural temporal reasoning scenarios; natural language conversion makes problems accessible to LLMs but may introduce semantic ambiguity; evaluation focuses on propositional LTL but real-world temporal reasoning often involves metric temporal operators.

**Failure Signatures:** Temporal semantics misalignment (incorrect interpretation of operator meaning), context-hypothesis detachment (loss of problem context during reasoning), reasoning error amplification (small errors cascading through multi-step reasoning).

**First Experiments:** 1) Run GPT-5-Mini with few-shot CoT on increasing complexity problems to map performance degradation curve, 2) Compare zero-shot vs few-shot performance across all models to quantify prompting impact, 3) Test models on problems with specific operator combinations to identify which temporal constructs pose greatest challenges.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly identify open questions in its discussion.

## Limitations

- LTLBench evaluates only propositional LTL without temporal operators beyond the basic five, which may not fully capture real-world temporal reasoning complexity
- The synthetic nature of generated problems may not reflect natural language temporal reasoning scenarios where temporal cues are embedded in rich contextual information
- Qualitative analysis was limited to a small subset of errors without systematic categorization of failure modes

## Confidence

**High:** Effectiveness of the generation pipeline and comparative performance rankings across models
**Medium:** Generalizability of results to broader temporal reasoning tasks given the constrained problem space
**Low:** Claims about specific failure modes due to limited qualitative analysis without systematic categorization

## Next Checks

1. Validate the benchmark on real-world temporal reasoning datasets to assess external validity and determine if synthetic LTL problems accurately predict performance on naturally occurring temporal reasoning tasks.

2. Extend the problem generation to include nested temporal operators and metric temporal logic constructs to evaluate whether current LLMs can handle more complex temporal specifications beyond propositional LTL.

3. Conduct ablation studies varying the prompt templates and event graph structures to determine which aspects of the problem formulation most significantly impact model performance and reasoning accuracy.
