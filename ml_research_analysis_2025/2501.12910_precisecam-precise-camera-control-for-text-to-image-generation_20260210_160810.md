## Executive Summary
PreciseCam introduces a novel method for achieving precise camera control in text-to-image generation models. The approach enables control over four intuitive camera parameters—roll, pitch, vertical field of view (vFoV), and distortion (ξ)—without requiring multi-view data or 3D scene representations. By translating these parameters into a Perspective Field-Unified Spherical (PF-US) representation and integrating it into a ControlNet-based framework, PreciseCam achieves consistent camera control across both realistic and artistic styles, significantly outperforming prompt engineering and style tag approaches.

## Method Summary
PreciseCam translates camera parameters into per-pixel guidance maps using the PF-US representation, which encodes up-vectors and latitude angles as RGB images. These maps are fed to a ControlNet framework that conditions a frozen SDXL base model. The method creates a novel dataset of 57,380 images with ground-truth camera parameters and prompts derived from 360° panoramas. Training uses middle-block-only ControlNet residual injection for optimal camera adherence and image quality. The approach generalizes to artistic styles not present in training data and maintains prompt adherence comparable to baseline SDXL.

## Key Results
- Achieves precise, consistent camera control across realistic and artistic styles
- Significantly outperforms prompt engineering and style tag approaches like Adobe Firefly
- Maintains prompt adherence comparable to baseline SDXL while enabling camera views the baseline cannot produce
- Enables applications like background generation for object rendering and video generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Four intuitive camera parameters can be translated into per-pixel guidance maps that steer diffusion without requiring 3D scene representations.
- **Mechanism:** The PF-US representation converts extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters into up-vectors u_x and latitude angles φ_x, encoded as RGB images and fed to ControlNet.
- **Core assumption:** Per-pixel geometric cues capture sufficient information about camera configuration to guide generation without explicit scene geometry.
- **Evidence anchors:** Equations 1-3 define PF-US projection; visual results show consistent parameter effects; weak direct validation in corpus.
- **Break condition:** Strongly non-horizontal ground planes or complex gravity-defying compositions may create ambiguous encoding.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Injecting ControlNet residuals only at the U-Net bottleneck achieves camera adherence while preserving base model quality.
- **Mechanism:** During training, residuals added to bottleneck and decoder; at inference, only middle-block residuals are injected.
- **Core assumption:** Camera conditioning information is sufficiently global to be communicated through the compressed bottleneck representation.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.2 ablation shows middle-block-only residuals yield best trade-off; ControlNet architecture analysis.
- **Break condition:** Fine-grained local adjustments may require spatial precision beyond bottleneck capacity.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Ground-truth PF-US maps from 360° image crops enable training without multi-view data or estimated pseudo-labels.
- **Mechanism:** Arbitrary camera configurations sampled from 360° panoramas, PF-US maps computed analytically, BLIP-2 generates prompts.
- **Core assumption:** 360° panorama distribution is sufficiently diverse to generalize to arbitrary prompts and artistic styles.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.3 parameter ranges; Figure 7 shows artistic style generalization; novel dataset contribution.
- **Break condition:** Training panoramas lacking specific scene types may fail to generalize to those domains.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Perspective Field representation**
  - Why needed here: Essential for debugging PF-US encoding and interpreting conditioning failures
  - Quick check question: Given a camera tilted 30° downward (pitch = -30°), how would the latitude values change from image top to bottom?

- **Concept: ControlNet conditioning architecture**
  - Why needed here: Prerequisite for modifying injection points or extending to other conditions
  - Quick check question: Why does zero-convolution initialization allow training without disrupting the frozen base model?

- **Concept: Unified Spherical camera model**
  - Why needed here: Needed to interpret intrinsic parameter effects and generate valid PF-US maps
  - Quick check question: How does increasing ξ from 0.1 to 0.9 affect the projected position of a point at fixed 3D coordinates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - User input (text prompt + camera parameters) -> PF-US Encoder (analytical transformation) -> RGB-encoded PF-US map -> ControlNet (copy of SDXL encoder/mid blocks) -> Zero Convolution (1×1 conv, zero-initialized) -> SDXL U-Net (frozen) -> Denoised image

- **Critical path:**
  1. User specifies Ω via sliders
  2. PF-US map computed analytically (Eqs. 1-3)
  3. Map encoded as 1024×1024 RGB image
  4. ControlNet processes map; residuals extracted from middle block
  5. Residuals added to SDXL bottleneck during denoising
  6. Output image adheres to camera specification

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Bottleneck-only vs. full injection: Bottleneck improves consistency; full injection adds distortion (chose bottleneck-only at inference)
  - Yaw exclusion: Cannot define left/right without scene reference; excluding yaw simplifies learning (intentional design choice)
  - BLIP-2 prompts: May be inaccurate, but acceptable since only ControlNet is trained, not the text encoder

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Objects incorrectly oriented vertically in extreme roll (SDXL prior bias)
  - Semantic incoherence when prompt conflicts with camera view
  - Poor generalization if PF-US estimation is used instead of ground truth

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate PF-US encoding: Generate PF-US maps for known configurations and verify up-vector/latitude values match analytical expectations
  2. Ablate residual injection: Train with full injection, compare inference results using full, bottleneck-only, and decoder-only; evaluate camera adherence vs. image quality
  3. Test generalization boundaries: Generate images with extreme parameter combinations across diverse prompts; identify failure modes and quantify adherence degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on ground-truth PF-US maps from 360° panoramas may limit generalization to domains not well-represented in training data (e.g., underwater, aerial scenes)
- Exclusion of yaw control simplifies the learning problem but may restrict applications requiring full camera pose specification
- Assumption of horizontal ground plane may break down in scenes with non-horizontal ground planes or artistic compositions with tilted horizons

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Core mechanism of translating camera parameters to PF-US maps and using ControlNet conditioning is well-justified by equations and ablation studies
- **Medium confidence:** Generalization to artistic styles is supported qualitatively but lacks systematic quantitative evaluation
- **Low confidence:** "Significantly outperforms" claim lacks quantitative metrics to substantiate the "significant" performance claim

## Next Checks
1. **Generalization stress test:** Systematically evaluate performance on prompts describing scenes not well-represented in 360° panorama training data (e.g., underwater, aerial, microscopic); measure camera adherence and prompt fidelity
2. **Quantitative comparison:** Conduct user study or automated evaluation to quantitatively compare PreciseCam against prompt engineering and style tag approaches; report statistical significance
3. **Robustness to non-horizontal scenes:** Generate images with camera parameters for scenes with non-horizontal ground planes; quantify camera adherence failure rates and analyze encoding breakdown
