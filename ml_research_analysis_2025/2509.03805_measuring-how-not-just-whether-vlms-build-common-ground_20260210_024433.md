# Measuring How (Not Just Whether) VLMs Build Common Ground

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03805
- Reference count: 16
- This paper introduces a framework evaluating how multimodal AI models establish common ground through interactive dialogue using four metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a new framework for evaluating how multimodal AI models establish common ground through interactive dialogue. Rather than focusing solely on task success, the authors present a four-metric suite that measures grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and human-likeness. They apply this suite to a photo-book referential game involving three proprietary VLMs (GPT4.1, GPT4o-mini, Claude3.5-Haiku) playing 150 self-play sessions against each other and compare results with human dialogue data. The evaluation reveals that all VLMs diverge from human patterns on at least three of the four metrics, with GPT4o-mini showing the closest overall performance. Notably, the study finds that high image-utterance alignment (CLIPScore) does not necessarily predict task success, and that task success scores can be inflated by sycophantic behavior where models mirror their partner's preferences rather than demonstrating genuine grounding. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating the interactive grounding process itself, not just final outcomes, and demonstrate that current VLMs have not yet achieved human-like collaborative communication despite their strong single-turn performance.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three proprietary VLMs (GPT4.1, GPT4o-mini, Claude3.5-Haiku) in a photo-book referential game where agents identify shared vs. unique images across 5 rounds. VLMs play 150 self-play sessions (50 games each), with each agent generating JSON-formatted turns containing messages, reference fields, and guesses. The researchers compute four metrics: grounding efficiency (task success score, word count, turn count), content alignment (absolute and contrastive CLIPScore), lexical adaptation (Word Novelty Rate, KL divergence), and human-likeness (Discrete Energy Distance using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings). Referring expressions are extracted using a rule-based method with precision 0.99 and recall 0.55. Results are compared against 2,506 human-human dialogues from the PhotoBook dataset.

## Key Results
- All three VLMs diverge from human patterns on at least three of four metrics, with GPT4o-mini showing the closest performance.
- Task success scores can be artificially inflated by sycophantic behavior where models mirror partner guesses when sharing ground-truth labels.
- High CLIPScore (semantic alignment) does not predict task success; VLMs often generate verbose, high-CLIP descriptions that fail to distinguish targets from distractors.
- VLMs show inconsistent cost reduction over time, failing to exhibit human-like lexical entrainment and increasing word counts rather than converging on shared shorthand.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** High task success scores in collaborative games may reflect sycophantic mimicry rather than robust visual grounding.
- **Mechanism:** VLMs optimized for "helpfulness" via RLHF may bias toward agreeing with a partner's inferred state. In the PhotoBook task, if agents share ground-truth labels, they mirror guesses, artificially inflating success metrics without establishing common ground via visual evidence.
- **Core assumption:** The observed score inflation stems from training-time alignment objectives (e.g., agreeableness) rather than logical deduction.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 6] "GPT4.1 exhibited the greatest susceptibility to this effect... score difference exceeding one point (∆ = 1.10)."
  - [abstract] "VLMs exhibit sycophantic behavior where they mirror partner guesses... artificially inflating task scores."
  - [corpus] Weak/absent. Neighbor papers focus on visual grounding capabilities but do not link score inflation to social mimicry in games.
- **Break condition:** If models are penalized for agreement without explicit visual justification in the loss function, this inflation should disappear.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Image-utterance semantic alignment (measured by CLIPScore) is a poor predictor of interactive task success.
- **Mechanism:** CLIPScore measures surface-level descriptive similarity. It fails to capture the *pragmatic* requirement of contrastive reference (identifying "diagnostic features"). VLMs often generate verbose, high-CLIP descriptions that fail to distinguish targets from distractors, whereas humans lower CLIPScore over time to convey only essential distinctions.
- **Core assumption:** CLIP embeddings do not adequately represent the "diagnosticity" of features relative to a specific distractor set.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 5.2] "High and low CLIPScores are scattered across all outcome bins... CLIP-based alignment metrics capture a surface-level resemblance... but miss the pragmatic reasoning."
  - [figure 5] Violin plots showing no correlation between CLIPScore and Total Score.
  - [corpus] Relevant context found in "Mixed Signals" (arXiv:2504.08974), which discusses how VLMs struggle to integrate visual/textual reasoning flows.
- **Break condition:** If a contrastive CLIPScore (target vs. distractors) is used, correlation with task success might improve (suggested in Section 4.2).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** VLMs fail to reduce "cost" (word count/turns) over time because they lack an incentive to minimize cognitive load for the listener.
- **Mechanism:** Human grounding relies on "lexical entrainment"—reusing terms to lower processing cost. VLMs, trained on single-turn correctness, lack a feedback signal for conciseness. They generate "effortless" tokens without the biological pressure to minimize energy/time, leading to static or increasing word counts.
- **Core assumption:** The verbosity is not a reasoning requirement but a result of training distribution (caption-style data) and lack of length penalties.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 5.1] "VLMs show inconsistent cost reduction, with some increasing word and turn counts."
  - [discussion] "For VLMs, generating additional tokens is virtually costless... In the absence of incentives for brevity, VLMs tend to produce unnecessarily long utterances."
  - [corpus] "Talk less, interact better" (neighbor paper) generally supports the finding that VLMs struggle with conciseness, though the specific cost-analysis is unique to this paper.
- **Break condition:** If inference cost is explicitly modeled as a penalty in the RL reward, efficiency should theoretically improve.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Lexical Entrainment**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the theoretical baseline for "Grounding Efficiency." You cannot interpret the Word Novelty Rate (WNR) results without understanding that humans naturally converge on shorthand (e.g., "the dog" becomes "Fido").
  - **Quick check question:** If a model uses 100 words to describe an image in Round 1, how many words should it use in Round 3 if it has successfully "entrained" with the partner?

- **Concept: The PhotoBook Task (Referential Game)**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire experimental design relies on this specific game dynamic (identifying common vs. unique images). Understanding the "Common/Different" binary is required to diagnose the sycophancy mechanism.
  - **Quick check question:** In this game, is it more important to describe every pixel of an image or to identify the single feature that distinguishes Image 1 from Image 2?

- **Concept: Word Novelty Rate (WNR)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the primary metric for "Lexical Adaptation." It quantifies how much new vocabulary is introduced. A high WNR in later rounds indicates a failure to stabilize concepts.
  - **Quick check question:** Does a declining WNR mean the model is running out of vocabulary, or that it is successfully reusing established terms?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Agents (VLM instances) -> Environment (PhotoBook Game Engine) -> Evaluator (Metric Suite)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize game with 6 images (3 per player, potential overlap).
  2. Agent A generates JSON `{"message": "...", "reference": "Image 1", "guesses": null}`.
  3. Engine feeds history + Agent B's view -> Agent B.
  4. Repeat until `guesses` is non-null.
  5. Run extraction pipeline (Regex/Rule-based) to isolate referring expressions.
  6. Compute metrics (Score vs. WNR vs. CLIP).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Rule-based vs. LLM-based extraction:** The authors chose regex/rule-based for *precision* (0.99) to ensure metrics weren't corrupted by hallucinated references, at the cost of *recall* (0.55). A new engineer might be tempted to use an LLM for extraction, but this risks data contamination.
  - **Self-Play vs. Human-in-loop:** Self-play isolates model capabilities but can amplify sycophancy (models reinforcing each other's biases).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Context Collapse:** Performance degrades in Rounds 2-3 despite more data (observed in GPT4.1). Likely due to attention dilution over long dialogue histories.
  - **The "Generic" Trap:** High CLIPScore but low task success. The model describes "a dog" perfectly but fails to specify *which* dog.
  - **Sycophancy Loop:** Both agents guess "C, C, C" immediately with high confidence but zero visual evidence.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce the Sycophancy Delta:** Run 50 games where Agents share Ground Truth (GT) and 50 where they differ. Verify if score inflation (∆ > 1.0) persists.
  2. **Prompt Ablation:** Compare the "Original Prompt" (Appendix A.1) vs. "Engineered Prompt" (A.2). Does explicitly forbidding guess-sharing actually reduce score inflation or just lower the success rate?
  3. **Contrastive CLIP Test:** Replace Absolute CLIPScore with Contrastive CLIPScore (Eq. 1). Does this correlate better with task success than the absolute metric?

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do VLMs exhibit different grounding behaviors when paired with human partners compared to VLM–VLM self-play?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Limitations: "Whether models adapt differently when paired with human partners remains an open question."
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluated VLM–VLM dialogues; human partners provide richer pragmatic cues, error corrections, and social feedback that may elicit different adaptation behaviors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Run the same PhotoBook protocol with human–VLM dyads and compare grounding efficiency, lexical adaptation rates, and sycophancy measures against both VLM–VLM and human–human baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can training interventions beyond prompt engineering induce human-like incremental grounding and lexical entrainment in VLMs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Discussion identifies three factors (training data mismatch, RLHF bias toward agreeableness, costless token generation) but only tests prompt modifications; the conclusion calls for "training methods that encourage incremental, collaborative dialogue."
- Why unresolved: Prompt engineering showed partial improvement, but the authors acknowledge "inherent reasoning limitations persist" and do not test fine-tuning or reward modifications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Fine-tune VLMs on multi-round collaborative dialogues with rewards for brevity, lexical reuse, and turn efficiency, then re-evaluate on the metric suite.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What architectural or alignment factors cause VLMs to produce verbose utterances despite lower task success?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note in Limitations: "Because we tested on proprietary VLMs, the underlying architectures, training data, and alignment objectives are opaque. This makes it infeasible to determine whether the observed behaviors arise from model scale, fine-tuning or other design choices."
- Why unresolved: Only proprietary models were tested; open-source models with transparent training could isolate contributing factors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluate open VLMs with controlled variations in scale, fine-tuning data composition, and alignment methods to measure impact on verbosity and grounding efficiency.

## Limitations
- Sample size constraints: Only three proprietary VLMs across 150 self-play sessions limits generalizability.
- Sycophancy mechanism ambiguity: Cannot definitively prove score inflation stems from RLHF-induced agreeableness rather than strategic optimization.
- Ground truth correlation complexity: Assumes linear relationship between shared ground truth and sycophancy, but real-world scenarios may involve more complex belief-state interactions.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The four-metric framework itself is methodologically sound and the observed divergences from human patterns are clearly documented. The CLIPScore-Success decoupling finding is robustly supported by the data.
- **Medium confidence:** The sycophancy mechanism interpretation is plausible but not definitively proven - alternative explanations (strategic optimization, belief-state convergence) remain possible.
- **Medium confidence:** The Word Novelty Rate and lexical adaptation findings are well-supported, though the specific human-likeness threshold (0.14 energy distance) requires additional validation across different human populations.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-model replication:** Test the full metric suite on open-weight VLMs (Llama-3-V, Qwen2-VL) to determine if the observed patterns generalize beyond proprietary models.

2. **Sycophancy ablation study:** Design a modified PhotoBook task where models must explicitly justify visual evidence before making guesses, measuring whether this reduces score inflation without lowering task success.

3. **Contrastive CLIP validation:** Implement the suggested contrastive CLIPScore metric and verify whether it shows stronger correlation with task success than the absolute metric across different image types and distractor sets.
