# Multimodal Conditional MeshGAN for Personalized Aneurysm Growth Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19862
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19862
- Reference count: 31
- MCMeshGAN is the first multimodal conditional mesh-to-mesh GAN for 3D aneurysm growth prediction

## Executive Summary
MCMeshGAN introduces a novel multimodal conditional mesh-to-mesh GAN architecture for predicting 3D aneurysm growth. The model addresses the challenge of modeling subtle local deformations and global anatomical changes in complex 3D geometries through a dual-branch architecture. It combines a local KNN-based convolutional network to preserve fine-grained geometric details with a global graph convolutional network to capture long-range structural context, overcoming the over-smoothing limitations of deep GCNs. A dedicated condition branch encodes clinical attributes (age, sex) and the target time interval to generate anatomically plausible, temporally controlled predictions.

## Method Summary
MCMeshGAN employs a dual-branch architecture consisting of a local KNN-based convolutional network and a global graph convolutional network. The local branch preserves fine-grained geometric details through nearest-neighbor-based convolutions, while the global branch captures long-range structural context via graph convolutions. A condition branch encodes clinical attributes (age, sex) and target time interval to enable personalized predictions. The model was trained on TAAMesh, a longitudinal thoracic aortic aneurysm mesh dataset of 590 multimodal records from 208 patients, and evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines using metrics including mean absolute error, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance.

## Key Results
- Mean absolute error of 1.285 mm on test set
- Chamfer distance of 1.831 mm on test set
- Hausdorff distance of 9.815 mm on test set
- Consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in both geometric accuracy and clinically important diameter estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-branch architecture effectively addresses the fundamental challenge of preserving both local geometric details and global structural context in 3D mesh prediction. The KNN-based local convolutions excel at capturing fine-grained features and subtle deformations specific to aneurysm regions, while the graph convolutional network provides essential global anatomical context without suffering from over-smoothing effects. The condition branch's integration of clinical attributes enables temporally controlled and personalized predictions, bridging the gap between pure geometric modeling and clinical relevance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Convolutional Networks**: Why needed - to capture global structural relationships in 3D meshes; Quick check - verify global context preservation in ablation studies
- **KNN-based Mesh Convolutions**: Why needed - to preserve local geometric details and prevent over-smoothing; Quick check - compare local feature preservation with pure GCN approaches
- **Condition Injection**: Why needed - to enable personalized predictions based on clinical attributes; Quick check - assess performance degradation when removing condition branch
- **Mesh-to-Mesh Generation**: Why needed - to predict future anatomical states from current geometry; Quick check - validate against clinical growth patterns
- **Multimodal Data Integration**: Why needed - to combine imaging data with clinical metadata; Quick check - evaluate performance with/without clinical attributes

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Input Mesh + Clinical Attributes -> Local KCN Branch + Global GCN Branch + Condition Branch -> Predicted Future Mesh
- **Critical Path**: The local KNN convolutions handle fine-grained detail preservation while global GCN captures structural context; both branches must integrate effectively through the generator
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Local detail vs. global context, computational efficiency vs. prediction accuracy, generalization vs. overfitting to single institution data
- **Failure Signatures**: Over-smoothing of local features (GCN dominance), loss of global context (KCN isolation), poor temporal generalization (condition branch inadequacy)
- **3 First Experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing local KCN branch to assess detail preservation impact, 2) Testing with synthetic noise injection to evaluate robustness, 3) Varying condition branch inputs to assess personalization effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can MCMeshGAN maintain performance when applied to external, multi-center datasets with varying imaging protocols?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that the model was "only tested on our private dataset" and plan to "test on external data" to improve generalization.
- **Why unresolved**: The TAAMesh dataset is derived from a single institution (Hammersmith Hospital), potentially introducing site-specific biases that may not transfer to other clinical environments.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Successful validation on independent, multi-center thoracic aortic aneurysm datasets with different scanner manufacturers and acquisition parameters.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Does the use of MCMeshGAN predictions lead to improved clinical decision-making regarding intervention timing compared to standard diameter measurements?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The conclusion notes the model has "not yet been tested in real clinical workflows" and requires validation against patient outcomes.
- **Why unresolved**: High geometric accuracy (e.g., low Chamfer distance) does not guarantee that the predictions are clinically useful for determining surgical thresholds.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Prospective clinical trials or retrospective studies correlating model-predicted growth rates with actual patient rupture events or surgical outcomes.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can architectural refinements or advanced loss functions eliminate the residual surface roughness observed in the generated meshes?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors list "Rough Mesh Surface" as a limitation, noting that "generated meshes can still appear rough" despite the dual-branch architecture.
- **Why unresolved**: The current combination of KCN and GCN preserves details but still generates texture artifacts that impair visual quality.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Demonstration of smoother surface normals and curvature consistency without sacrificing the geometric fidelity of the aneurysm sac.

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: Would the inclusion of hemodynamic factors (e.g., blood pressure) or medication history improve predictive accuracy beyond demographic data (age/sex)?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The condition branch currently integrates only age and sex, whereas the introduction acknowledges that aneurysm progression involves complex "physiological principles" often modeled by biomechanical approaches.
- **Why unresolved**: Growth is driven by wall stress and hemodynamics; ignoring these variables forces the model to infer biological stress purely from geometry and basic demographics.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Ablation studies showing improved MAE or MIS diameter error when adding clinical variables like systolic blood pressure or anti-hypertensive medication status.

## Limitations
- Single institutional dataset limits generalizability to other populations and imaging protocols
- Performance metrics benchmarked only against other deep learning approaches without direct comparison to clinical prediction models
- Assumes sufficient local mesh density, which may not hold for highly irregular or sparse geometries
- Does not address potential biases in clinical attribute encoding or effects across diverse demographic groups
- Temporal prediction horizon and frequency of follow-up scans not explicitly discussed

## Confidence
- **High**: The technical novelty of the dual-branch architecture and its ability to preserve local geometric details while capturing global context is well-supported by the methodology and results.
- **Medium**: The clinical relevance of the diameter estimation improvements is plausible but requires validation in real-world clinical workflows and comparison with expert predictions.
- **Low**: Generalizability to other aneurysm types, imaging modalities, or institutions is uncertain due to the single-site dataset and lack of external validation.

## Next Checks
1. **External validation**: Test MCMeshGAN on aneurysm datasets from multiple institutions with different imaging protocols and patient demographics.
2. **Clinical integration**: Compare predictions against manual measurements by radiologists and clinical risk stratification models in a prospective study.
3. **Longitudinal robustness**: Evaluate model performance on extended time intervals and assess stability when predicting growth over multiple years.
