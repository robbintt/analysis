# The Structure of Relation Decoding Linear Operators in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26543

- Linear operators for relational decoding in transformer models can be highly compressed using low-rank tensor networks without significant accuracy loss

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the structure of linear operators that decode relational facts in transformer language models, extending prior single-relation findings to collections of relations. The authors demonstrate that collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed using simple order-3 tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this redundancy, they develop a cross-evaluation protocol applying each decoder to subjects of every other relation, revealing that these linear maps extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties rather than encoding distinct relations. This property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and why they generalize only to semantically close relations.

## Method Summary
The authors extend the probing paradigm from single-relation studies to collections of relations, training and analyzing linear operators that map hidden states to relation targets. They employ tensor network compression to reduce the dimensionality of these operators while measuring decoding accuracy. The cross-evaluation protocol systematically applies each trained decoder to subjects from every relation in the collection, creating a comprehensive matrix of performance scores that reveals semantic relationships between relations. This methodology allows for both quantitative compression analysis and qualitative insights into the semantic structure of the decoders.

## Key Results
- Collections of relation decoders can be compressed using order-3 tensor networks with minimal accuracy loss
- Cross-evaluation reveals that decoders extract coarse-grained semantic properties rather than relation-specific information
- Decoders generalize only to semantically close relations, consistent with a property-based rather than relation-specific encoding structure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The linear operators in transformer models extract semantic properties from hidden states rather than encoding relations specifically. This explains why compression works - the redundancy comes from multiple decoders capturing similar semantic features. The cross-evaluation protocol reveals that these operators respond to coarse-grained properties shared across relations, making them transferable to semantically similar relations but not to dissimilar ones. This property-based structure is both efficient (enabling compression) and limiting (constraining generalization to semantically close relations).

## Foundational Learning
- **Linear operators in transformer models**: Why needed - to understand how models extract and represent relational information; Quick check - verify that linear maps from hidden states to relation targets can be learned and evaluated
- **Tensor network compression**: Why needed - to reduce dimensionality of learned operators while preserving functionality; Quick check - confirm that low-rank approximations maintain acceptable decoding accuracy
- **Cross-evaluation protocol**: Why needed - to systematically reveal semantic relationships between relation decoders; Quick check - ensure that performance matrix captures meaningful semantic similarity patterns
- **Semantic properties extraction**: Why needed - to understand what information decoders actually capture; Quick check - validate that extracted properties align with human semantic intuitions
- **Transformer hidden state representations**: Why needed - as the substrate from which decoders extract information; Quick check - verify that hidden states contain sufficient relational information for linear decoding

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Hidden states -> Linear decoders -> Relation targets -> Cross-evaluation matrix -> Tensor compression

Critical path: Training decoders on relation pairs → Cross-evaluating across all relations → Measuring semantic similarity → Applying tensor compression → Validating accuracy retention

Design tradeoffs: Compression efficiency vs. decoding accuracy, relation-specific vs. property-based encoding, linear vs. nonlinear extraction methods

Failure signatures: Complete loss of accuracy under compression suggests decoders encode relation-specific rather than property-based information; poor cross-evaluation performance indicates lack of semantic structure in operators

First experiments:
1. Train linear decoders on a small set of relations and measure baseline accuracy
2. Apply cross-evaluation protocol to reveal semantic similarity structure
3. Compress decoders using tensor networks and measure accuracy degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focuses on limited relation sets, limiting generalizability to broader semantic domains
- Binary semantic similarity judgments may oversimplify nuanced relationships between relations
- Analysis assumes linear decoding captures all relevant relational information, potentially missing nonlinear aspects

## Confidence
High: Linear operators extract coarse-grained semantic properties rather than relation-specific information
Medium: Proposed explanation for compression - redundancy stems from property-based encoding
Low: Generalizability of findings to other model architectures or larger relation vocabularies

## Next Checks
1. Apply compression and cross-evaluation methodology to wider variety of relations including temporal, spatial, and causal relations
2. Test whether similar patterns emerge in decoder-only models like GPT architectures
3. Examine alignment between extracted properties and human semantic judgments using established semantic distance metrics
