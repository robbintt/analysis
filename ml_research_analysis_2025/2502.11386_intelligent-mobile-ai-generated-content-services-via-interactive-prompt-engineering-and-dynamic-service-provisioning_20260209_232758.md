# Intelligent Mobile AI-Generated Content Services via Interactive Prompt Engineering and Dynamic Service Provisioning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.11386
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11386
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposed scheme improves single-round generation success probability by 6.3x and user QoE by 67.8% compared to baseline DRL approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses two key challenges in mobile AI-Generated Content (AIGC) services: poor generation quality from raw user prompts due to inexperience, and inefficient static service provisioning that fails to account for task heterogeneity. The proposed solution introduces an interactive prompt engineering framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to refine prompts based on task-specific requirements, combined with dynamic service provisioning via Diffusion-Enhanced Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (D3PG) to optimize inference trials and transmission power allocation. The system leverages LLM-based assessing agents to provide proxy feedback for training without requiring real-time human intervention.

## Method Summary
The approach consists of two main components: prompt engineering and dynamic service provisioning. For prompt engineering, an LLM generates a corpus of modifier strategies, which are then refined using IRL (specifically GAIL) to learn a policy that imitates expert prompt refinement behaviors. An LLM-based assessing agent scores generated images to provide feedback for training the IRL discriminator. For resource provisioning, D3PG optimizes the number of inference trials and transmission power allocation by treating policy generation as a denoising process, using a diffusion model as the actor network that iteratively refines random noise into optimal resource allocation actions.

## Key Results
- Prompt engineering approach improves single-round generation success probability by 6.3 times compared to static strategies
- D3PG increases user service experience by 67.8% compared to baseline DRL approaches (PPO and SAC)
- System demonstrates effective handling of heterogeneous AIGC tasks with varying computational requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: IRL for Prompt Engineering
Inverse Reinforcement Learning enables a "prompt engineering policy" to outperform static strategies by imitating expert behaviors rather than relying on hard-coded reward functions. The system uses a GAIL framework where a generator network proposes prompt strategies while a discriminator distinguishes these from expert strategies derived from demonstration datasets. This forces the generator to learn high-quality prompt structures without explicit reward engineering.

### Mechanism 2: D3PG for Resource Allocation
Diffusion-Enhanced DPG improves resource allocation by treating policy generation as a denoising process. Unlike standard DRL that maps states to actions directly, D3PG uses a diffusion model as the actor network that starts with random noise and iteratively refines it over T steps into an optimal resource allocation action. This iterative refinement enhances exploration in the complex mobile AIGC environment.

### Mechanism 3: LLM-based Assessing Agent
An LLM-based assessing agent provides a reliable proxy for human subjective feedback, enabling the training loop to close without real-time human intervention. The system employs an LLM with role prompting and in-context memory to score generated images, serving as the target for the IRL expert policy and the reward signal for DRL.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) & GAIL**
- **Why needed here:** Treats prompt engineering as an imitation problem because defining "good art" mathematically is impossible. Understands how a discriminator guides a generator to mimic expert data.
- **Quick check question:** Can you explain why IRL is preferred over standard Supervised Learning when the "expert" data is sparse or when the goal is to maximize future reward rather than matching labels?

**Concept: Diffusion Models (Denoising Process)**
- **Why needed here:** D3PG replaces the standard actor network with a diffusion model that iteratively removes noise from a random vector to produce structured resource allocation actions.
- **Quick check question:** How does the "forward process" (adding noise) relate to the "denoising process" (generating an action) in training the D3PG actor?

**Concept: Nakagami-m Fading & BER**
- **Why needed here:** Dynamic provisioning optimizes transmission power based on Bit Error Rate (BER). Understanding how channel gain and distance affect SNR and subsequently image fidelity is crucial.
- **Quick check question:** In Eq. (9), how does increasing transmission power P_i alter the BER, and why does this matter for complex vs. simple image transmission?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
1. **Service Configuration (Offline):**
   - Prompt Optimizer (LLM) -> Generates corpus
   - Assessing Agent (LLM) -> Scores images to build Dataset D
   - IRL Module -> Trains Prompt Policy π_ω
   - D3PG Module -> Trains Provisioning Policy π_θ

2. **Service Operation (Online):**
   - User Request -> Prompt Policy (Refines Text) -> Provisioning Policy (Sets Power/Trials) -> Stable Diffusion -> Transmission

**Critical path:** The Demonstration Dataset Construction (Section IV-B). If the LLM assessor creates noisy or biased scores, the IRL expert policy becomes flawed, and the subsequent resource allocation learns to optimize for the wrong generation quality.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Exploration vs. Latency: D3PG has complexity O(T S_p). Increasing diffusion steps T improves resource allocation accuracy but increases decision latency.
- Corpus Size vs. Computation: Large Prompt Corpus (L_c) allows better refinement but creates massive action space. The paper uses an empirical filter (Table II) to restrict strategies.

**Failure signatures:**
- High Re-generation Rate: Indicates Prompt Engineering policy π_ω is selecting ineffective corpus elements
- QoE Stagnation: If D3PG reward plateaus early, diffusion actor may not be learning denoising process correctly (check noise schedule α_t)
- Resource Exhaustion: Static provisioning baselines failing on complex images confirms need for dynamic allocation

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Validate the Assessor: Run LLM Assessor on generated images and compare scores against standard metrics (Image-Reward/NIMA) to replicate correlation shown in Fig. 9.
2. Ablation of Prompt Strategies: Implement "Default," "Random," and "IRL" policies. Measure single-round success probability to verify 6.3x improvement (Fig. 12).
3. D3PG Convergence: Deploy D3PG agent in simulated environment with varying user distances (d_i) and compare converged utility reward against PPO and SAC baselines (Fig. 14).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper identifies three key open questions:

1. How robust is the LLM-based assessing agent (ℓ_r) in modeling diverse human subjective preferences, given that IRL training relies entirely on this proxy for rewards? The agent simulates a generic "AIGC user" via role prompting but may fail to capture specific individual tastes or cultural nuances.

2. Does the computational complexity of D3PG allow for real-time service provisioning in large-scale mobile networks with high user density? The iterative denoising process (T steps) adds significant overhead compared to standard DRL baselines, potentially violating latency constraints when serving hundreds of concurrent users.

3. Can the proposed prompt engineering framework be effectively extended to dynamic AIGC tasks (e.g., text-to-video) while maintaining temporal consistency? The current prompt engineering strategies rely on static aspects like "lighting" and "object description" that don't account for temporal logic required for video generation.

## Limitations

- Heavy reliance on LLM-based assessment mechanisms without extensive human preference validation creates uncertainty about whether the system optimizes for metrics that correlate with actual user satisfaction
- Computational overhead of D3PG's iterative denoising process may create latency issues in large-scale deployments, potentially offsetting quality improvements
- Critical implementation details including D3PG architecture specifics and hyperparameters are underspecified, making faithful reproduction difficult

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core observation that user prompts require refinement and that static resource allocation fails for heterogeneous tasks is well-supported by existing literature and basic empirical observation. The mathematical framework for D3PG and IRL is sound.

**Medium Confidence:** Specific implementation details and claimed performance improvements (6.3x success probability increase, 67.8% QoE improvement) are derived from controlled experiments but lack independent validation.

**Low Confidence:** The LLM-based assessment mechanism's ability to accurately simulate human aesthetic preferences across diverse image styles and prompt types is the weakest link without extensive human preference validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Human Preference Validation:** Conduct a user study comparing images generated using IRL-prompt-refined strategies against baseline approaches to verify whether the 6.3x improvement in success probability translates to statistically significant improvements in human-perceived quality.

2. **Latency-Accuracy Tradeoff Analysis:** Measure actual wall-clock time required for D3PG decision-making versus standard DRL approaches across varying diffusion steps (T) to quantify whether the 67.8% QoE improvement persists when accounting for additional computational latency.

3. **Robustness to Prompt Diversity:** Test the IRL prompt engineering policy on systematically varied prompt types (abstract concepts, specific objects, artistic styles) not present in the original demonstration dataset to evaluate effectiveness outside its training distribution.
