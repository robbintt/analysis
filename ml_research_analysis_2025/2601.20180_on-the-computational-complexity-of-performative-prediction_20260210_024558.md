## Executive Summary
This paper establishes fundamental computational barriers in performative prediction by identifying a sharp phase transition in the tractability of finding performatively stable points. The authors prove that computing an ε-performatively stable point is PPAD-hard when the distribution shift parameter ρ is close to 1 (specifically ρ = 1 + O(ε)), placing it in the same complexity class as finding Nash equilibria in general-sum games. However, when ρ = 1 + O(ε⁴), they provide a polynomial-time ellipsoid-based algorithm that computes stable points efficiently. This dichotomy reveals that even small changes in problem parameters can dramatically affect computational feasibility.

The paper also establishes unconditional query lower bounds requiring exponentially many empirical risk minimization (ERM) evaluations to find stable points in the worst case. Additionally, for the specific setting of strategic classification, the authors prove that finding a strategic local optimum is PLS-hard, complementing prior NP-hardness results for global optimality. These results collectively highlight that learning under performative effects faces fundamental computational barriers, even in seemingly simple settings with quadratic losses and affine distribution shifts.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a combination of complexity-theoretic reductions and algorithmic design to establish their results. For the hardness results, they reduce from PPAD-complete problems (specifically, finding Nash equilibria in general-sum games) to show that computing performatively stable points is PPAD-hard when ρ = 1 + O(ε). This reduction carefully constructs a performative prediction problem whose stable points correspond to Nash equilibria of the original game. For the positive result, they develop an ellipsoid-based algorithm that leverages the structure of the performative prediction problem when ρ is sufficiently small (ρ = 1 + O(ε⁴)). The algorithm uses an approximate first-order oracle for ERM and achieves poly(d, log(1/ε)) complexity. The query lower bounds are established through explicit construction of adversarial distribution families that force any algorithm to make exponentially many ERM queries. For strategic classification, they reduce from the PLS-complete problem of finding a local optimum in the max-cut problem to establish PLS-hardness.

## Key Results
- PPAD-hardness of computing ε-performatively stable points when ρ = 1 + O(ε)
- Polynomial-time ellipsoid algorithm for computing stable points when ρ = 1 + O(ε⁴) with poly(d, log(1/ε)) complexity
- Exponential query lower bounds for finding stable points via ERM evaluations
- PLS-hardness of finding strategic local optima in strategic classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The computational phase transition arises from the interaction between the distribution shift parameter ρ and the geometry of the loss landscape. When ρ is close to 1 (specifically ρ = 1 + O(ε)), the performative prediction problem can encode the computational hardness of finding Nash equilibria in general-sum games. The authors construct a reduction where stable points of the performative prediction problem correspond exactly to Nash equilibria of the original game, establishing PPAD-hardness. However, when ρ becomes sufficiently small (ρ = 1 + O(ε⁴)), the distribution shift becomes gentle enough that the loss landscape becomes more tractable, allowing for polynomial-time computation via the ellipsoid method. This sharp transition reveals that the computational complexity is highly sensitive to the magnitude of distribution shifts, with a critical threshold separating intractable from tractable regimes.

## Foundational Learning
- **PPAD complexity class**: The class of problems whose solutions can be found by following paths in a directed graph where every node has in-degree and out-degree at most one. This is needed because it characterizes the complexity of finding Nash equilibria in general-sum games, which the authors use for their hardness reduction. Quick check: Verify that the reduction preserves the path-following structure required for PPAD-completeness.
- **Performative prediction framework**: A learning paradigm where the model's predictions influence the data distribution, creating a feedback loop between the model and the environment. This is needed as the fundamental setting being analyzed. Quick check: Confirm that the distribution shift mechanism is well-defined and continuous in the model parameters.
- **Ellipsoid method**: An optimization algorithm that maintains an ellipsoid containing the feasible region and iteratively shrinks it based on separation oracles. This is needed for the polynomial-time algorithm when ρ is small. Quick check: Verify that the separation oracle can be implemented efficiently with access to an approximate first-order oracle for ERM.
- **Strategic classification**: A special case of performative prediction where data points strategically modify their features to achieve better outcomes under the classifier. This is needed to establish the PLS-hardness result for local optimality. Quick check: Confirm that the strategic behavior model satisfies the assumptions required for the reduction.
- **Query complexity**: The number of oracle calls required by an algorithm to solve a problem. This is needed to establish the exponential lower bounds on ERM evaluations. Quick check: Verify that the adversarial distribution construction forces any algorithm to make exponentially many queries in the worst case.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Performative prediction problem -> Distribution shift parameter ρ -> Computational complexity class (PPAD-hard vs polynomial-time)

**Critical Path**: 
1. Define performative prediction problem with quadratic loss and affine distribution shift
2. Construct reduction from PPAD-complete problem when ρ = 1 + O(ε)
3. Develop ellipsoid algorithm for ρ = 1 + O(ε⁴)
4. Establish query lower bounds via adversarial distribution construction
5. Prove PLS-hardness for strategic classification via max-cut reduction

**Design Tradeoffs**: The sharp computational phase transition represents a fundamental tradeoff between problem expressivity (larger ρ allows modeling stronger distribution shifts) and computational tractability. The ellipsoid-based algorithm trades off practical efficiency for theoretical polynomial-time guarantees, relying on approximate first-order oracles rather than exact computations.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- When ρ is too close to 1 (specifically ρ = 1 + O(ε)), algorithms may fail to find stable points due to PPAD-hardness
- When the distribution shift mechanism deviates from the assumed affine form, the complexity results may not apply
- When the loss function is non-quadratic, the polynomial-time algorithm may not generalize

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement the ellipsoid-based algorithm and test on synthetic performative prediction problems with varying ρ values to empirically observe the phase transition
2. Construct the PPAD-hardness reduction explicitly for small games and verify that stable points correspond to Nash equilibria
3. Generate adversarial distribution families to test the exponential query lower bounds by attempting to find stable points with limited ERM queries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- PPAD-hardness results assume specific problem structures (quadratic losses, affine distribution shifts) that may not generalize to all performative settings
- The polynomial-time algorithm's efficiency relies heavily on the ellipsoid method's oracle complexity, which may not translate to practical performance
- Query lower bounds assume worst-case distributions, potentially overestimating real-world requirements

## Confidence
- **High**: PPAD-hardness result (rigorous reduction from well-established PPAD-complete problems)
- **High**: Ellipsoid-based algorithm (uses well-established techniques with clear complexity analysis)
- **Medium**: Query lower bounds (depends on specific adversarial distribution constructions)
- **Medium**: PLS-hardness for strategic classification (reduction may not capture all realistic strategic scenarios)

## Next Checks
1. Empirical evaluation of the ellipsoid-based algorithm on synthetic and real-world datasets to assess practical efficiency
2. Investigation of alternative problem structures beyond quadratic losses and affine distribution shifts to test the robustness of complexity results
3. Exploration of approximation algorithms that might achieve near-stable points with reduced computational complexity, bridging the gap between worst-case lower bounds and practical performance
