# Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting Based on Fourier Analysis and Cross Attention Mechanism

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.06917
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06917
- Authors: Yuqi Xiong; Yang Wen
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Proposed AEFIN framework achieves 66-85% MSE improvement over baselines for non-stationary time series forecasting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Attention-Enhanced Fourier-Integrated Network (AEFIN) to address the challenge of forecasting non-stationary time series data where traditional deep learning models struggle with time-varying statistical characteristics. The framework decomposes time series into stable and unstable components using Fourier analysis, processes them with specialized architectures, and employs a cross-attention mechanism to enhance information sharing between components. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements across multiple benchmark datasets, particularly for non-stationary conditions.

## Method Summary
AEFIN uses frequency-domain decomposition to isolate non-stationary dynamics, then processes stable and unstable components with specialized architectures. The model applies Discrete Fourier Transform to identify dominant frequency components, extracts them as "unstable" while the residual becomes "stable," and uses cross-attention to merge information pathways. A composite loss function in both time and frequency domains constrains the model to maintain spectral consistency while fitting temporal data. The framework is compatible with various backbone models including DLinear, Informer, and SCINet.

## Key Results
- Achieves 66-85% MSE reduction compared to baseline models on ExchangeRate dataset
- Demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets including ETTh1/ETTh2, Electricity, Traffic, and Weather
- Shows particular effectiveness for non-stationary data conditions where traditional models struggle
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various prediction horizons (96, 168, 336, 720 steps)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Frequency-domain decomposition isolates non-stationary dynamics, allowing the model to process stable and unstable components with specialized architectures.
- **Mechanism:** The model applies DFT to input sequence, identifies top K dominant frequency components, extracts them via filtering as unstable component, and subtracts them from original series to obtain stable component.
- **Core assumption:** Dominant frequency components effectively capture non-stationary factors while residual represents stationarity.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "...combines Fourier analysis networks... to capture seasonal patterns and trend characteristics." [Section III.A] "...Top K selects the frequencies with the largest amplitudes... to obtain the unstable component..."
- **Break condition:** If noise floor is high or non-stationarity manifests in low-amplitude high-frequency bursts, TopK selection will fail.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Cross-attention enables stable component to be dynamically re-weighted by unstable component, restoring lost interdependencies.
- **Mechanism:** Uses unstable component as Query and stable component as Key/Value to compute attention weights and create new stable representation that attends to unstable features.
- **Core assumption:** Stable and unstable components are not independent; unstable series state provides context necessary to interpret stable series.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "...introduces a cross-attention mechanism to improve information sharing between stable and unstable components..." [Section III.B] "...use the unstable component as the Query (Q), and the stable component as the Key (K) and Value (V)..."
- **Break condition:** If correlation between stable and unstable components is spurious or purely additive, cross-attention may overfit to noise.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Composite loss function in both time and frequency domains constrains model to maintain spectral consistency while fitting temporal data.
- **Mechanism:** Loss is weighted sum of MSE on stable time-domain components, MAE on unstable time-domain components, and MSE on frequency spectrum of stable component.
- **Core assumption:** Enforcing frequency-domain consistency prevents structural drift in predictions, acting as regularizer.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "...design a new loss function that combines time-domain stability constraints... and frequency-domain stability constraints..." [Section III.E] "...ensure that the spectral characteristics of the predicted stable component are consistent..."
- **Break condition:** If forecasting task requires stable component to shift phase or frequency, frequency-domain constraint may over-regularize.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) & Top-K Filtering**
  - **Why needed here:** Entry point of AEFIN architecture; without understanding DFT mapping and Top-K isolation, definition of "stable" vs "unstable" remains opaque.
  - **Quick check question:** If time series consists of linear trend plus high-frequency noise, which component will likely capture linear trend under AEFIN's Top-K scheme?

- **Concept: Cross-Attention vs. Self-Attention**
  - **Why needed here:** Core architectural modification is Cross-Attention block; understanding that Q comes from one domain and K,V from another is essential to distinguish from standard Transformer self-attention.
  - **Quick check question:** In AEFIN cross-attention block, which input tensor determines "where to look" (Query) and which provides the "content" (Value)?

- **Concept: Non-Stationarity in Time Series**
  - **Why needed here:** Problem statement relies on failure of standard models to handle time-varying statistics; understanding this motivation explains why model separates and reintegrates components.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might standard normalization technique fail on dataset with sudden permanent shift in mean?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer -> Frequency Decomposition -> Cross-Attention Fusion -> Parallel Backbones -> Merger -> Loss
- **Critical path:** Frequency Decomposition is dependency bottleneck; if Top-K selection is too aggressive, unstable branch receives insufficient signal and stable branch forced to model residual dynamics it wasn't designed for.
- **Design tradeoffs:** 
  - Flexibility vs. Complexity: Significant parameter overhead, especially for longer prediction horizons due to MLP expansion in unstable branch and cross-attention matrices
  - Inductive Bias: Choice of MAE for unstable and MSE for stable components biases model to treat unstable parts as "noisy/sparse" and stable parts as "dense/exact"
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Parameter Explosion: If training OOM on long horizons, check Unstable Branch MLP width
  - Component Mismatch: If validation loss plateaus early, K value may be misaligned with dataset's actual seasonality
  - Over-stationarization: If outputs look overly smooth, Cross-Attention may be failing to inject unstable features back into stable stream
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Alignment: Run AEFIN + Informer backbone vs. Vanilla Informer on ExchangeRate dataset (horizon 96) to reproduce ~85% MSE reduction
  2. Ablation on K: Vary Top-K frequency count to determine sensitivity to "stable/unstable" threshold
  3. Loss Function Dissection: Train versions disabling frequency loss (γ=0), then unstable loss (β=0), to verify contribution of dual-domain optimization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question 1:** How can incompatibility between AEFIN's frequency decomposition and linear forecasting backbones be resolved?
  - **Basis:** Authors note AEFIN performs worse than DLinear baseline on most datasets, suggesting linear structural characteristics are unsuitable for predicting decomposed components separately.
  - **Why unresolved:** Paper identifies performance gap but doesn't propose mechanism to align frequency-domain processing with linear models' inductive biases.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Modified version that improves upon DLinear baseline metrics rather than degrading them.

- **Question 2:** How can quadratic growth in parameters and computational overhead be mitigated for long-term forecasting horizons?
  - **Basis:** Section V states model parameters increase rapidly with forecasting time step, resulting in greater resource consumption and slower inference speeds.
  - **Why unresolved:** Authors identify limitation but only suggest future exploration of distributed computing or graph neural networks without architectural solution.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Architectural variant maintaining linear or constant parameter count relative to output horizon without sacrificing accuracy gains.

- **Question 3:** Does static frequency component selection limit model performance on highly volatile test instances?
  - **Basis:** Method relies on global threshold for frequency decomposition, assuming relative stability in spectral density distribution between training and inference windows.
  - **Why unresolved:** Static K derived from training data may fail to capture shifting seasonal patterns in test set with high distributional shift.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies comparing static K against instance-adaptive K selection method on datasets with high distributional shift.

## Limitations
- Performance degradation on linear forecasting backbones suggests frequency decomposition may not align with linear models' structural characteristics
- Quadratic growth in parameters and computational overhead for long-term forecasting horizons limits scalability
- Static frequency component selection (K) may not adapt well to shifting seasonal patterns in highly volatile test instances

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Empirical performance improvements (MSE/MAE reductions of 66-85%) are well-documented across multiple datasets and baselines. Overall architecture is sound and experimental protocol is reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence:** Theoretical justification for frequency decomposition and cross-attention mechanisms is reasonable but relies on assumptions about nature of non-stationarity that require further validation.
- **Low Confidence:** Optimal values for K and loss weights are not derived from theory and appear to be dataset-specific tuning choices without clear guidance for generalization.

## Next Checks

1. **Component Decomposition Validation:** Run diagnostic experiment plotting actual decomposed X_stable vs X_non_stable on non-stationary dataset to verify Top-K selection captures meaningful non-stationary dynamics and not just noise.

2. **Cross-Attention Necessity Test:** Create ablation study removing cross-attention layer entirely, forcing model to predict stable and unstable components independently, to quantify actual contribution of information-sharing mechanism.

3. **Frequency Loss Sensitivity Analysis:** Train versions with γ=0, γ=0.1, γ=0.5, γ=0.7 to determine if frequency-domain constraint provides regularization benefits or potentially constrains valid forecast dynamics.
