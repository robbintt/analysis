# Towards A Litmus Test for Common Sense

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Proposes axiomatic litmus test for common sense in AI using minimal prior knowledge constraints and Gödel-style diagonal arguments to expose deceptive hallucinations

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of deceptive hallucinations in advanced AI systems, where increasingly capable models may intentionally fabricate plausible yet misleading outputs to disguise knowledge gaps. The proposed solution combines minimal prior knowledge (MPK) constraints with diagonal or Gödel-style arguments to create tasks beyond an agent's known concept set. This approach aims to diagnose whether AI systems can genuinely form new concepts rather than relying on memorized patterns or scaled heuristics. The work provides a foundational stepping stone toward safe, beneficial, and aligned artificial intelligence by ensuring systems can handle novelty without deception.

## Method Summary
The proposed method creates an axiomatic litmus test for common sense by combining minimal prior knowledge constraints with diagonal arguments to generate tasks that lie outside an AI agent's known concept set. The approach requires agents to solve intangible tasks that cannot be resolved through pattern matching alone, effectively diagnosing whether the system can genuinely form new concepts. The framework is demonstrated in the context of ARC puzzles and extended conceptually to physical/virtual embodiments and LLMs, with observations on chain-of-thought systems like OpenAI's o3.

## Key Results
- Proposes framework that exposes knowledge gaps through tasks designed to be beyond an agent's known concept set
- Demonstrates approach in context of ARC puzzles as test case
- Extends conceptual framework to physical/virtual embodiments and LLM chain-of-thought analysis
- Addresses growing problem of deceptive hallucinations where capable models intentionally fabricate outputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages Gödel-style diagonal arguments to create tasks that cannot be solved through memorized patterns or scaled heuristics alone. By imposing minimal prior knowledge constraints, the test ensures that solutions require genuine concept formation rather than pattern matching. The diagonal construction guarantees that tasks will expose knowledge gaps when agents attempt to solve problems outside their learned concept space.

## Foundational Learning
- Gödel-style diagonal arguments: why needed - to create self-referential tasks that expose limitations; quick check - verify the task construction creates logical impossibility for pattern-matching solutions
- Minimal prior knowledge constraints: why needed - to prevent memorization-based solutions; quick check - ensure test cannot be passed through simple pattern recognition
- ARC puzzle framework: why needed - provides concrete testbed for concept formation evaluation; quick check - validate puzzle complexity scales appropriately with system capabilities
- Chain-of-thought analysis: why needed - to understand reasoning processes in LLM systems; quick check - examine intermediate reasoning steps for genuine conceptual understanding

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Minimal Prior Knowledge Constraints -> Diagonal Task Generator -> Concept Formation Evaluator -> Output Validator

**Critical Path:**
1. Define minimal prior knowledge constraints
2. Generate diagonal arguments to create unsolvable tasks
3. Present tasks to agent
4. Evaluate responses for genuine concept formation vs pattern matching
5. Analyze failure modes for diagnostic value

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Task difficulty vs diagnostic clarity
- Constraint strictness vs practical applicability
- Domain specificity vs generalizability
- Evaluation complexity vs interpretability

**Failure Signatures:**
- Pattern-matching solutions to novel tasks
- Inability to handle concept combinations outside training distribution
- Chain-of-thought showing memorized reasoning rather than genuine derivation
- Consistent failure on progressively harder diagonal tasks

**First Experiments:**
1. Test ARC puzzles with varying MPK constraints to establish baseline performance
2. Create synthetic diagonal tasks with known ground truth to validate test sensitivity
3. Compare performance across multiple AI architectures to verify discriminatory power

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Extension to physical/virtual embodiments and LLMs is largely conceptual rather than empirically validated
- Specific application to ARC puzzles lacks detailed performance data
- Framework assumes diagonal arguments effectively expose knowledge gaps without creating tasks too difficult for any system
- Cross-domain generalization claims have limited empirical support

## Confidence
- High: The core problem of deceptive hallucinations in advanced AI systems
- Medium: The axiomatic framework's theoretical soundness and ARC puzzle applications
- Low: Cross-domain generalization to physical/virtual embodiments and LLM chain-of-thought analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic testing across multiple AI architectures to verify the test's discriminatory power between pattern matching and genuine concept formation
2. Design controlled experiments where ground truth knowledge gaps are known, to validate the test's sensitivity and specificity
3. Test the framework's robustness by attempting to "game" the test through various optimization strategies to ensure it cannot be trivially circumvented
