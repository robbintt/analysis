# Redefining Simplicity: Benchmarking Large Language Models from Lexical to Document Simplification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.08281
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08281
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** LLMs outperform non-LLM methods across lexical, syntactic, sentence, and document simplification tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark comparing large language models (LLMs) against traditional methods across four text simplification tasks: lexical, syntactic, sentence, and document simplification. The study evaluates lightweight (Gemma2-2B), closed-source (GPT-4o), and open-source (Llama3.1-70B) LLMs using both automatic metrics and human evaluation. Results show that LLMs consistently outperform non-LLM approaches across all tasks, with GPT-4o achieving the highest performance in most cases and even surpassing human-annotated references. Notably, lightweight LLMs like Gemma2 excel in sentence and syntactic simplification but lag in lexical and document tasks. The paper also highlights the inadequacy of traditional evaluation metrics for assessing LLM-generated simplifications.

## Method Summary
The study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of three LLM types (lightweight Gemma2-2B, closed-source GPT-4o, and open-source Llama3.1-70B) across four text simplification tasks. Each model is assessed using both automatic metrics (BLEU, SARI, FKGL) and human evaluation on English datasets. The tasks range from lexical substitution at the word level to full document simplification. Performance is benchmarked against four traditional non-LLM baselines. The evaluation framework includes multiple metrics to capture different aspects of simplification quality, though the paper notes limitations in existing metrics' ability to fully assess LLM outputs.

## Key Results
- LLMs outperform non-LLM methods across all four simplification tasks (lexical, syntactic, sentence, document)
- GPT-4o achieves the highest performance in most tasks, often surpassing human-annotated references
- Gemma2 excels in sentence and syntactic simplification but underperforms in lexical and document tasks
- Traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient for assessing LLM-generated simplifications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None provided in source material.

## Foundational Learning

**Lexical Simplification**: Why needed - Replaces complex words with simpler alternatives while preserving meaning. Quick check - Compare vocabulary complexity scores between original and simplified text.

**Syntactic Simplification**: Why needed - Reduces sentence complexity by restructuring grammar without changing content. Quick check - Measure parse tree depth and dependency distance changes.

**Sentence Simplification**: Why needed - Combines lexical and syntactic changes to simplify entire sentences. Quick check - Evaluate readability scores and meaning preservation.

**Document Simplification**: Why needed - Maintains coherence across multiple sentences while simplifying overall content. Quick check - Assess document-level fluency and topic consistency.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Text -> Preprocessing -> LLM/Non-LLM Model -> Postprocessing -> Evaluation Metrics -> Human Assessment

**Critical Path**: Input → Tokenization → Model Generation → Output Filtering → Metric Calculation → Human Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Model size vs. computational efficiency (Gemma2-2B is faster but less capable than Llama3.1-70B/GPT-4o for complex tasks), automatic vs. human evaluation (scalability vs. quality assessment), task-specific vs. general-purpose models.

**Failure Signatures**: Over-simplification leading to loss of meaning, introduction of grammatical errors, failure to maintain document coherence, outputs exceeding reference quality (indicating metric inadequacy).

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare Gemma2-2B vs. Llama3.1-70B on sentence simplification with varying computational constraints
2. Test GPT-4o on document simplification with human evaluation vs. automatic metrics
3. Evaluate non-LLM baselines against LLMs on lexical simplification tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in source material.

## Limitations
- Exclusive focus on English-language datasets limits generalizability to other languages and cultural contexts
- Reliance on automatic evaluation metrics may not fully capture nuanced aspects of simplification quality
- Limited selection of three LLMs and four traditional baselines may not represent the full spectrum of approaches
- Comparison to human references assumes optimal quality, yet LLM outputs sometimes surpass human quality

## Confidence
- **High**: LLMs generally outperform traditional non-LLM methods across all four simplification tasks
- **Medium**: Ranking of specific LLM models (GPT-4o > Llama3.1-70B > Gemma2-2B) due to limited model testing and task variability
- **Medium**: Conclusion that traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient, based on subjective human judgments

## Next Checks
1. Test the proposed methodology across multiple languages to assess cross-linguistic generalization and identify potential language-specific challenges
2. Conduct ablation studies varying model size and architecture within the same family (e.g., different Gemma2 sizes) to isolate the impact of model capacity on simplification performance
3. Implement and evaluate alternative evaluation frameworks that incorporate task-specific quality dimensions (coherence, readability, factual consistency) rather than relying primarily on standard automated metrics
