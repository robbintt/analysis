# Communication-Efficient Zero-Order and First-Order Federated Learning Methods over Wireless Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08013
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08013
- Reference count: 28
- Two novel methods reduce FL communication to two scalars per round instead of full gradient vectors

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the communication bottleneck in federated learning over wireless networks by proposing two methods that dramatically reduce the communication overhead from full gradient vectors to just two scalar values per learning round. The proposed Enhanced Zero-Order Federated Learning (EZOFL) and Enhanced First-Order Federated Learning (EFOFL) methods incorporate wireless channel effects directly into the learning algorithms, eliminating the need for separate channel state information estimation. Both approaches achieve competitive accuracy with standard FL methods while significantly reducing communication requirements.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two communication-efficient FL methods for wireless networks. EZOFL uses a zero-order optimization approach with a two-point gradient estimator that computes gradients using only function evaluations rather than explicit gradient computation. EFOFL employs a randomized first-order gradient computation strategy. Both methods leverage the relationship between gradient magnitude and channel state to transmit only scalar values that represent the compressed information. The algorithms incorporate wireless channel effects directly into the learning process, avoiding separate CSI estimation. The methods are designed for nonconvex optimization problems and include asynchronous variants to handle devices with varying availability.

## Key Results
- Both EZOFL and EFOFL achieve convergence rates of O(1/√K) for nonconvex smooth functions
- Methods reduce communication from full gradient vectors to only two scalar values per learning round
- MNIST experiments show competitive accuracy compared to standard FL methods while significantly reducing communication overhead
- Robust performance across different channel conditions when incorporating channel effects directly into learning algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The core innovation lies in exploiting the relationship between gradient magnitude and wireless channel state to compress communication. By recognizing that devices with stronger channels can reliably transmit more information, the methods transmit only scalar values that encode gradient information when channel conditions are favorable. The zero-order approach estimates gradients through function evaluations rather than computing them explicitly, while the first-order approach uses randomized gradient computation. This direct incorporation of channel effects into the learning algorithm eliminates the need for separate CSI estimation and gradient reconstruction steps, creating a more efficient end-to-end system.

## Foundational Learning
- Zero-order optimization: Optimization methods that estimate gradients using only function evaluations rather than explicit gradient computation. Needed because direct gradient computation may be infeasible or expensive in wireless settings. Quick check: Verify the two-point gradient estimator correctly approximates true gradients.
- Nonconvex optimization: Optimization problems where the objective function has multiple local minima and is not convex. Needed because most modern ML models involve nonconvex loss surfaces. Quick check: Confirm convergence analysis holds for the specific nonconvex functions used.
- Federated learning communication overhead: The bandwidth and latency costs of transmitting model updates from distributed devices to a central server. Needed to understand the motivation for compression techniques. Quick check: Measure actual bytes transmitted versus baseline methods.
- Wireless channel state information (CSI): Knowledge of the current channel conditions between devices and the server. Needed to understand how channel effects can be leveraged for communication efficiency. Quick check: Compare performance with and without CSI incorporation.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Devices -> Wireless Channel -> Server -> Aggregated Model -> Devices

Critical path: Local computation on devices → Channel state-dependent scalar transmission → Server aggregation → Model update broadcast

Design tradeoffs: The methods trade off between communication efficiency and convergence speed. Using only two scalars per round significantly reduces communication but may require more rounds to converge compared to full gradient transmission. The zero-order method avoids gradient computation but may need more function evaluations. The first-order method is more direct but still requires careful randomization to maintain compression.

Failure signatures: Poor convergence when channel conditions are consistently bad across all devices, indicating the scalar transmission cannot capture sufficient gradient information. Performance degradation with highly non-IID data distributions where local optima differ significantly across devices. Synchronization issues in asynchronous variants leading to stale updates that degrade model quality.

First experiments:
1. Implement EZOFL and EFOFL on MNIST with varying channel conditions to verify the claimed communication savings and accuracy
2. Test convergence behavior under different numbers of devices and compare against standard FedAvg
3. Evaluate the impact of channel state incorporation by running ablations with and without direct channel integration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees primarily established for nonconvex smooth functions without explicit consideration of non-smooth or constrained optimization scenarios
- Convergence analysis assumes bounded gradients and second moments, which may not hold in all practical FL applications
- Asynchronous variant mentioned but lacks detailed convergence analysis compared to the synchronous case
- O(1/√K) convergence rate is standard for nonconvex optimization but may not be competitive with accelerated methods in wall-clock time

## Confidence
- High confidence in communication efficiency claims and basic experimental validation
- Medium confidence in theoretical convergence analysis for the synchronous case
- Low confidence in practical performance under highly heterogeneous network conditions with many devices

## Next Checks
1. Implement the asynchronous variant with detailed convergence monitoring and compare against the synchronous version under varying device availability patterns
2. Conduct experiments with non-IID data distributions across devices to evaluate robustness beyond the MNIST benchmark
3. Test the methods on larger-scale datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 or real-world federated datasets) to assess scalability and communication savings in more challenging scenarios
