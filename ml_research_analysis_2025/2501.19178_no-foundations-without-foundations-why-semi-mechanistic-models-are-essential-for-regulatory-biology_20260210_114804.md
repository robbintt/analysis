# No Foundations without Foundations -- Why semi-mechanistic models are essential for regulatory biology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.19178
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19178
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Semi-mechanistic frameworks integrating mechanistic insight with experimental design are essential for foundation models in regulatory biology

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that foundation models in regulatory biology require semi-mechanistic frameworks that combine mechanistic insight with experimental design. The authors develop a ground-up mathematical model of perturbation-based CRISPR screens, unifying in vitro and in vivo experimental designs across differentiating and non-differentiating cellular systems. Their framework reveals previously unrecognized assumptions in existing ML methods and connects to techniques like variational autoencoders and causal models. The model proposes modified loss functions incorporating biological intuitions, which they demonstrate improve predictive performance on published data.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a mathematical framework for perturbation-based CRISPR screens that integrates mechanistic understanding with experimental design considerations. They create a unified approach that applies to both in vitro and in vivo experimental setups across different cellular differentiation states. The framework identifies hidden assumptions in current machine learning approaches and proposes modified loss functions that incorporate biological principles. They demonstrate their approach using neural ODE models with enforced steady-state assumptions, showing improved convergence and prediction robustness.

## Key Results
- Modified loss functions incorporating biological intuitions improve predictive performance on published CRISPR screen data
- Enforcing steady-state assumptions in neural ODE models leads to faster convergence and more robust predictions
- Systems-level understanding of cellular regulation requires first-principles perspectives on experimental design and data generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by grounding machine learning approaches in first-principles understanding of cellular regulatory mechanisms. By explicitly modeling the experimental design process and incorporating mechanistic knowledge about cellular responses to perturbations, the approach captures fundamental biological constraints that traditional black-box models miss. The steady-state enforcement in neural ODEs reflects the biological reality that many cellular systems operate near equilibrium states, which constrains the solution space and improves learning efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
- Perturbation-based CRISPR screens: These are experimental methods to understand gene function by systematically knocking out genes; understanding them is needed to model how experimental data is generated.
- Neural ODEs: Continuous-depth neural networks that solve differential equations; required for modeling dynamic biological processes over time.
- Variational autoencoders: Generative models that learn probability distributions; connected to the framework for understanding latent biological states.
- Causal inference: Methods for determining cause-effect relationships; essential for distinguishing direct from indirect regulatory effects.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Experimental Design -> Mechanistic Model -> Modified Loss Function -> Neural ODE Architecture

**Critical Path:** Data generation (experimental design) -> Mathematical formulation (mechanistic model) -> Objective function modification (biological constraints) -> Model training and validation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational efficiency for biological interpretability and improved generalization. Black-box approaches are faster but miss mechanistic insights; this approach is slower but more robust.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance indicates either incorrect mechanistic assumptions, violation of steady-state conditions, or inappropriate experimental design for the biological question being asked.

**First Experiments:** 1) Apply framework to a simple gene knockout dataset with known ground truth, 2) Compare steady-state vs non-steady-state neural ODE performance on the same dataset, 3) Test modified loss functions against standard cross-entropy loss on perturbation screens

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation across diverse datasets reduces confidence in generalizability claims
- Computational overhead and potential scalability issues with high-throughput screening data not fully explored
- Experimental recommendations remain primarily theoretical without real-world validation

## Confidence
- Claim that ML methods rely on unrecognized assumptions: Medium confidence (theoretical justification present but limited empirical validation)
- Claim that semi-mechanistic frameworks are essential for foundation models: High confidence (supported by mathematical rigor)
- Claim that first-principles perspectives are necessary for systems-level understanding: High confidence (well-supported by framework)

## Next Checks
1. Systematic benchmarking of the proposed loss function modifications against current state-of-the-art methods across multiple perturbation-based CRISPR screen datasets
2. Investigation of computational efficiency and scalability when applying the framework to genome-wide screening data
3. Validation of the steady-state assumption enforcement in neural ODE models across different cell types and differentiation states to assess robustness and generalizability
