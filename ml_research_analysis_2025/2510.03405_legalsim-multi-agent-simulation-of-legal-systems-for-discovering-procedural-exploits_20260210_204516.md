# LegalSim: Multi-Agent Simulation of Legal Systems for Discovering Procedural Exploits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.03405
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03405
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: PPO policy most effective at exploiting procedural weaknesses in legal simulations; bandit is most consistently competitive

## Executive Summary
LegalSim is a multi-agent simulation framework for studying how AI agents can discover and exploit procedural vulnerabilities in codified legal systems. The system models litigation as a turn-based adversarial game where agents execute actions (e.g., discovery requests, motions, sanctions) validated by a JSON rules engine, with outcomes influenced by a stochastic judge model. Rather than optimizing for simple win/loss, agents are evaluated on a composite exploit score measuring cost inflation, calendar pressure, settlement pressure, and rule compliance. Across bankruptcy, patent, and tax regimes, PPO consistently wins, the bandit policy is most competitive, and emergent exploit chains—such as cost-inflating discovery sequences—are identified that are procedurally valid yet systemically harmful.

## Method Summary
LegalSim abstracts litigation into a turn-based adversarial game with a structured action space validated by a JSON rules engine. Agents (PPO, contextual bandit with LLM, direct LLM policy, heuristic) compete across bankruptcy, patent, and tax regimes. The exploit score captures procedural harm via opponent-cost inflation, calendar pressure, settlement pressure, and rule compliance. Results are validated under judge variation and stress tests.

## Key Results
- PPO policy wins most often across tested regimes.
- Contextual bandit is most consistently competitive.
- LLM-based policies trail; hand-crafted heuristic is weakest.
- Emergent exploit chains (e.g., cost-inflating discovery sequences) are procedurally valid yet harmful.
- Results stable under judge variation and stress tests.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LegalSim models legal adversarial dynamics as a structured game where actions are validated by a JSON rules engine and outcomes depend on a stochastic judge. This abstraction allows agents to explore the action space systematically, identifying chains of procedurally valid moves that inflate costs or pressure settlements. The composite exploit score rewards strategies that harm the opponent beyond just winning, exposing systemic vulnerabilities. PPO and bandit policies excel because they efficiently navigate the structured space and balance short-term gains with long-term exploit potential.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent simulation**: Models interactions between opposing legal agents to reveal emergent behaviors.
  - *Why needed*: Real litigation involves adversarial dynamics not captured by single-agent models.
  - *Quick check*: Verify agents can both cooperate and compete in controlled scenarios.
- **JSON rules engine**: Validates actions against codified legal procedures.
  - *Why needed*: Ensures simulated actions are procedurally valid, grounding exploits in realistic constraints.
  - *Quick check*: Test edge-case actions for correct rejection or acceptance.
- **Composite exploit score**: Rewards systemic harm (cost, calendar, settlement pressure) beyond binary outcomes.
  - *Why needed*: Captures subtle procedural exploitation not visible in win/loss metrics.
  - *Quick check*: Confirm exploit score increases for known harmful action chains.
- **Stochastic judge model**: Introduces unpredictability in ruling outcomes.
  - *Why needed*: Reflects real judicial variability, preventing deterministic exploits.
  - *Quick check*: Measure exploit score variance across judge seeds.
- **Emergent exploit chains**: Sequences of valid actions producing outsized harm.
  - *Why needed*: Identifies systemic weaknesses not obvious from individual actions.
  - *Quick check*: Trace exploit chains and validate procedural correctness.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
JSON Rules Engine -> Action Space Generator -> Agent Policy (PPO/Bandit/LLM/Heuristic) -> Judge Model -> Exploit Score Calculator -> Game State Updater

**Critical Path**
Agent selects action → JSON rules engine validates → Judge stochastically resolves → State updates → Exploit score recalculated → Next turn

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Structured action space vs. full legal realism (simplicity vs. nuance)
- Stochastic judge vs. deterministic rulings (unpredictability vs. reproducibility)
- Composite exploit score vs. binary outcomes (systemic insight vs. simplicity)

**Failure Signatures**
- Exploit score fails to increase despite known harmful chains (rules engine or score miscalibration)
- Agents converge on trivial strategies (reward shaping or insufficient exploration)
- Exploit chains disappear under judge variation (overfitting to judge randomness)

**First Experiments**
1. Run single-agent vs. random policy to confirm exploit chains are reproducible.
2. Validate exploit score increases for known harmful action sequences.
3. Test exploit score stability under different judge seeds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Abstraction may not fully capture real-world litigation nuance or unpredictability.
- Proxy metrics for exploitation may not reflect true systemic harm magnitude.
- Limited exploration of legal regimes raises questions about external validity.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: PPO consistently outperforms others; bandit is most competitive within simulation.
- **Medium confidence**: Emergent exploit patterns are procedurally valid and harmful in simulation; real-world transferability is less certain.
- **Medium confidence**: Exploit scoring framework is robust to judge variation, pending broader regime testing.

## Next Checks
1. Test exploit detection and scoring on broader legal regimes (e.g., criminal, family law).
2. Conduct expert review of identified exploit chains for real-world plausibility.
3. Implement hybrid judge model blending deterministic rules with granular stochasticity or precedent data to test exploit sensitivity.
