# Information Loss under Coarse-Grained Partitions: A Discrete Framework for AI Ethics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.07347
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347
- **Reference count**: 37
- **Primary result**: Information loss is zero if and only if the original distribution is uniform within each grain

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a discrete mathematical framework for quantifying information loss when fine-grained score distributions are coarsened into interpretable partitions for AI ethics applications. The method treats underlying score scales as finite ordered sets, models coarse evaluation as partitions into ordered intervals, and defines information loss using discrete Kullback-Leibler divergence against a categorical unification baseline. The framework demonstrates how to balance interpretability and informational integrity in AI-driven decision-making, with applications in educational grading and explainable AI systems.

## Method Summary
The framework defines a Coarse-Grained Partition (CGP) as a totally ordered partition of a finite underlying set U into grains. For a given discrete probability distribution P_U over U and a partition π, the method computes the pushforward probability P_π(i) = Σ(u∈G_π,i) P_U(u) for each grain. The Categorical Unification (CU) baseline distributes this grain probability uniformly across all elements in the grain, creating Q_CU(u) = P_π(i)/|G_π,i| for u∈G_π,i. Information loss is quantified as the discrete Kullback-Leibler divergence D_KL(P_U || Q_CU), with the primary theoretical result showing zero loss occurs if and only if P_U is uniform within each grain.

## Key Results
- Information loss measured by KL-CU is zero if and only if the original distribution is uniform within each grain
- The framework provides a principled method for designing interpretable AI systems while preserving informational integrity
- Educational grading experiments demonstrate optimal threshold selection that minimizes information loss while maintaining interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for coarse-graining that explicitly quantifies the trade-off between interpretability and information retention. By defining categorical unification as the baseline, it creates a principled reference point for measuring information loss that accounts for the structure of the partition itself. The discrete KL divergence metric provides a well-understood measure of distributional difference that is computationally tractable and interpretable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Coarse-Grained Partition (CGP)**: A totally ordered partition of a finite set into grains, where the order of grains is inherited from the underlying set. Needed to model interpretable categories while preserving ordinal relationships. Quick check: Verify partition maintains total order and covers all elements.
- **Categorical Unification (CU)**: A method that distributes grain probability uniformly across all elements within that grain. Needed as a principled baseline for measuring information loss under coarse-graining. Quick check: Confirm uniform distribution within each grain preserves total probability.
- **Discrete Kullback-Leibler Divergence**: Measures the information lost when Q_CU approximates P_U, calculated as Σ_u P_U(u) log[P_U(u)/Q_CU(u)]. Needed to quantify the information loss in a principled way. Quick check: Ensure zero terms when P_U(u)=0.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: P_U (original distribution) -> π (partition) -> P_π (pushforward) -> Q_CU (categorical unification) -> D_KL (information loss)

**Critical Path**: The method requires computing the pushforward probabilities P_π(i) for each grain, constructing the CU distribution Q_CU, and then calculating the KL divergence. The computational bottleneck is typically the divergence calculation, which is O(|U|).

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework assumes uniform within-grain distributions (CU), which may not always be realistic. Alternative unification strategies could better capture domain knowledge but would require new theoretical foundations for information loss quantification.

**Failure Signatures**: Information loss approaching the maximum (log|G_π,i| for each grain) indicates poor partitioning choices. Zero information loss suggests the partition perfectly captures the distributional structure, but may indicate overfitting to noise.

**First Experiments**:
1. Replicate the educational grading experiment with the provided score data to verify the minimum information loss occurs at threshold T=7
2. Test the framework with uniform, bimodal, and skewed distributions to assess sensitivity to underlying score structure
3. Implement a search algorithm for optimal multi-grain partitions beyond simple thresholds and evaluate interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Pareto-optimal balance**: Does a balance exist between evaluation efficiency and information retention in AI-driven decision-making? The paper hypothesizes a potential trade-off but calls for further research to investigate this formally.
- **Relaxed covering condition**: How does the framework behave when elements can exist outside defined grains? The paper identifies this as a primary limitation of the current approach.
- **Alternative divergence measures**: Do measures like Jensen-Shannon Divergence or Wasserstein Distance yield different characterizations of information loss? The paper suggests these may be explored in future studies.

## Limitations
- Assumes uniform within-grain distributions through the CU baseline, which may not capture all real-world scenarios
- Restricted to discrete, finite scales and ordered partitions, limiting direct application to continuous systems
- Does not formally address how to optimize partition structure beyond simple threshold-based approaches

## Confidence
- **High**: The mathematical definitions of CU, KL-CU divergence calculation, and the core theorem regarding uniformity are well-defined and verifiable
- **Medium**: Practical utility and optimal design principles for real-world coarse-grained partitions are demonstrated but not exhaustively validated across diverse scenarios
- **Low**: Performance and implications of alternative unification methods beyond CU are not explored in detail

## Next Checks
1. Verify the DKL-CU calculation for the educational grading example (Table 4) using the provided score data (Table 1) to confirm the minimum occurs at threshold T=7
2. Test the framework's sensitivity to different underlying score distributions (e.g., uniform, bimodal, skewed) for a fixed partition to assess its robustness
3. Implement a simple search algorithm to find optimal multi-grain partitions (beyond binary thresholds) for a given distribution and evaluate if the resulting partitions align with intuitive notions of interpretability and fairness
