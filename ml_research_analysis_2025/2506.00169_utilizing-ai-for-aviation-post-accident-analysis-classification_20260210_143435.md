# Utilizing AI for Aviation Post-Accident Analysis Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00169
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00169
- Authors: Aziida Nanyonga; Graham Wild
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: AI-based NLP and deep learning models achieve >87% accuracy for aviation safety report classification on large datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates AI approaches for automated analysis of aviation safety reports, focusing on three key tasks: classifying aircraft damage levels, identifying flight phases during incidents, and uncovering thematic patterns via topic modeling. The authors train multiple deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU, CNN, BERT variants) on datasets from NTSB, ATSB, and ASN, finding that larger datasets yield significantly better performance. Topic modeling techniques (LDA, NMF) successfully extract meaningful themes from incident reports. The findings demonstrate that AI can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of aviation safety analysis, supporting more proactive safety management.

## Method Summary
The study applies natural language processing and deep learning to classify aviation safety reports into damage levels (4 classes), flight phases (7 classes), and extract thematic patterns through topic modeling. Models are trained on NTSB (27K-36K reports), ATSB (50K reports), and ASN (4K reports) datasets using RNN variants, CNNs, and transformer-based architectures. Preprocessing includes tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF/Word2Vec feature extraction. Topic modeling uses LDA, NMF, LSA, and pLSA with coherence scoring. Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, and coherence metrics for topic models.

## Key Results
- RNN-based models achieve >87% accuracy for damage classification and flight phase identification on large datasets (NTSB)
- Topic modeling (LDA, NMF) successfully extracts semantically coherent themes from aviation safety narratives
- Dataset size critically impacts performance—smaller datasets (ASN, 4K reports) yield significantly lower accuracy (~64%)
- LDA demonstrates superior topic coherence while NMF produces more granular and distinct topics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sequential deep learning models (RNN variants) can classify aviation safety outcomes from unstructured narrative text with high accuracy when trained on sufficiently large datasets.
- Mechanism: RNN-based architectures (sRNN, LSTM, BLSTM, GRU) process text sequences to capture temporal dependencies and semantic relationships, mapping narrative patterns to discrete classes (damage levels, flight phases).
- Core assumption: Aviation safety narratives contain consistent linguistic signals that correlate with specific outcomes, and these patterns are learnable from sufficient examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Results show high accuracy (>87%) for damage classification and flight phase identification when using large datasets, with smaller datasets yielding lower performance."
  - [section]: "all models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 87.9%, with sRNN and joint RNN-based models like GRU+LSTM and sRNN+BLSTM+GRU performing particularly well."
  - [corpus]: Sequential Classification paper (FMR=0.54) confirms similar findings with RNN architectures on NTSB data.
- Break condition: Accuracy degrades significantly when (a) dataset size drops below ~5,000 reports, or (b) task complexity increases (7 flight phase classes vs. 4 damage levels).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Topic modeling techniques (LDA, NMF) extract semantically coherent themes from aviation safety reports, enabling identification of recurring incident patterns.
- Mechanism: Probabilistic and matrix factorization methods decompose document-term matrices into latent topic distributions, revealing underlying thematic structures without labeled training data.
- Core assumption: Incident reports exhibit consistent vocabulary usage around specific failure modes (mechanical failures, fuel system issues) that cluster into interpretable topics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Topic modeling (LDA, NMF) successfully extracted meaningful themes from incident reports."
  - [section]: "LDA demonstrated superior topic coherence, suggesting stronger semantic relationships within extracted themes, while NMF produced more granular and distinct topics."
  - [corpus]: Limited direct validation—related papers focus on classification rather than topic modeling quality assessment.
- Break condition: Topic coherence degrades when preprocessing over-stems domain-specific terminology or when document collection lacks thematic consistency.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Classification performance depends on both dataset size (number of narratives) and corpus richness (narrative length/content density), with larger corpora yielding consistently better results.
- Mechanism: More training examples reduce variance; longer narratives provide richer context for disambiguating similar cases. The total corpus size (words) appears more predictive than document count alone.
- Core assumption: Both dimensions—instance count and narrative depth—contribute independently to model generalization, and their interaction is task-dependent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Results show high accuracy (>87%) for damage classification and flight phase identification when using large datasets, with smaller datasets yielding lower performance."
  - [section]: "the NTSB had... average narrative length of 107.5 words, while the ATSB had... average narrative length of 20.4 words... the total corpus for the NTSB was 2.9 million words, while for the ATSB it was 1 million words."
  - [corpus]: Impact of Dataset Size paper confirms "larger datasets consistently improve predictive accuracy."
- Break condition: Small datasets (<5,000 reports) with short narratives produce unreliable models regardless of architecture sophistication (ASN achieved only 64% accuracy vs. 87% for larger datasets).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Recurrent Neural Networks and Sequence Modeling (LSTM, GRU, BLSTM)**
  - Why needed here: All high-performing models in this paper are RNN variants designed to process sequential text while maintaining memory of earlier tokens.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why BLSTM might outperform unidirectional LSTM for flight phase classification, where context from both before and after key phrases matters?

- **Concept: Topic Modeling (LDA vs. NMF)**
  - Why needed here: The paper compares probabilistic (LDA) and matrix factorization (NMF) approaches for unsupervised theme extraction from safety reports.
  - Quick check question: What is the tradeoff between LDA's topic coherence and NMF's topic granularity, and which would you choose for identifying specific mechanical failure patterns?

- **Concept: Classification Metrics for Imbalanced Multiclass Problems**
  - Why needed here: Flight phase classification involves 7 classes with likely uneven distribution; accuracy alone may be misleading.
  - Quick check question: If "enroute" incidents occur 40% of the time and "standing" incidents only 5%, which metric (precision, recall, F1) would you prioritize for the minority class?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Data Sources (NTSB/ATSB/ASN) -> Preprocessing (tokenization, stop words, lemmatization, encoding) -> Feature Extraction (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, embeddings) -> Model Layer: Classification: sRNN | LSTM | BLSTM | GRU | CNN | combinations | Topic Modeling: LDA | NMF | LSA | pLSA -> Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, coherence scores)

- **Critical path:** Preprocessing quality -> embedding representation -> model architecture selection -> dataset size/corpus richness determine final performance. Start with NTSB data (largest corpus, 2.9M words) for initial prototyping before testing generalization to ATSB/ASN.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **sRNN vs. LSTM/GRU:** sRNN faster to train; LSTM/GRU better for longer sequences with complex dependencies.
  - **Single model vs. ensembles:** Combinations (GRU+LSTM) show marginal gains (~1-2%) but significantly increase compute time—often not worth it.
  - **LDA vs. NMF for topics:** LDA gives higher coherence scores; NMF produces more interpretable granular topics for focused investigation.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Accuracy <70% with deep models: Check dataset size (<10,000 reports) or narrative quality (avg length <30 words).
  - Topic coherence <0.4: Review preprocessing for over-aggressive stemming or domain term removal.
  - Large gap between train and test accuracy: Investigate class imbalance or distribution shift between data splits.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Train sRNN and LSTM on NTSB damage classification (4 classes, 27K reports). Target: >87% accuracy per paper benchmarks.
  2. **Dataset size ablation:** Train same architecture on ASN data (4,372 reports) to quantify performance degradation and validate corpus-size hypothesis.
  3. **Topic model comparison:** Run LDA and NMF on NTSB narratives with k=10 topics; compare coherence scores and manually inspect top-10 words per topic for interpretability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the length of individual narratives or the total number of narratives have a greater impact on the accuracy of damage level classification models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section IV.A that because narrative length and sample size varied simultaneously between the ATSB and NTSB datasets, "Future research clearly needs to investigate the relative impact of each of these dimensions separately."
- Why unresolved: The comparative analysis confounded the two variables (NTSB had fewer reports but longer narratives; ATSB had more reports but shorter narratives), making it impossible to isolate the effect of text length versus sample size.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled ablation study using a single dataset where narrative length is artificially truncated to create varying input sizes while keeping sample counts constant, and vice versa.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does integrating flight data recorder information with textual narratives improve the accuracy of flight phase identification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section IV.B, the paper notes that "incorporating features beyond textual narratives, such as flight data recorder information, could further enhance model accuracy and robustness."
- Why unresolved: Current research relies exclusively on unstructured text from accident reports, ignoring structured numerical data that may contain critical context about the flight phase not mentioned in the narrative.
- What evidence would resolve it: A multimodal deep learning study that fuses time-series flight data with NLP features to classify flight phases, compared against text-only baselines.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the binary damage classification of the ASN dataset be effectively mapped to the four-level damage scale used by NTSB and ATSB for comparative modeling?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section VI.A highlights a limitation for future work: the ASN dataset uses a binary "A1 or A2" classification (written off or repaired), whereas NTSB/ATSB use four levels (destroyed, substantial, minor, none).
- Why unresolved: The difference in label granularity prevents a direct comparison of model performance across the ASN, NTSB, and ATSB datasets, limiting the ability to generalize findings across different aviation reporting systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study that either collapses the 4-level NTSB/ATSB data into binary categories to match ASN or uses a multi-task learning approach to harmonize the different labeling schemas.

## Limitations

- Performance varies dramatically across datasets (87%+ on NTSB vs. 64% on ASN), suggesting results are highly dataset-dependent rather than generalizable
- Critical hyperparameters (learning rates, batch sizes, epochs, layer dimensions) are unspecified, preventing exact replication
- Evaluation lacks detailed error analysis and confusion matrices, limiting understanding of failure modes

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: RNN architectures can achieve >87% accuracy on aviation safety classification tasks when trained on large, rich-text datasets (NTSB)
- **Medium confidence**: Topic modeling extracts meaningful themes, but validation is qualitative rather than quantitative; coherence scores alone don't confirm semantic relevance to safety analysis
- **Low confidence**: Cross-dataset generalization claims are weakly supported—the ASN model's 64% accuracy suggests architecture choice matters less than corpus size and narrative quality

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset size ablation**: Systematically train models on progressively smaller subsets of NTSB data (starting from 5,000 reports down to 500) to confirm the claimed threshold where accuracy degrades significantly
2. **Preprocessing impact**: Compare model performance with and without aggressive stop-word removal and lemmatization to quantify their effect on classification accuracy and topic coherence
3. **Cross-dataset transfer**: Train models on NTSB data and evaluate directly on ATSB/ASN without fine-tuning to measure distribution shift and true generalization capability
