# Elucidating Rectified Flow with Deterministic Sampler: Polynomial Discretization Complexity for Multi and One-step Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08735
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08735
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: First polynomial discretization complexity for rectified flow models under bounded support assumption

## Executive Summary
This paper provides theoretical analysis of rectified flow-based models using deterministic samplers, proving polynomial discretization complexity for both multi-step and one-step settings. The authors introduce a Langevin process as a corrector for multi-step models and derive improved complexity bounds compared to previous diffusion-based approaches. Under the bounded support assumption, they achieve complexity of 1/(ε^6 · δ^6 · W^2) for multi-step models and L_f/ε^3 + 1/(α · W^2) for one-step models, where ε is the error tolerance, δ is the early stopping parameter, W is the Wasserstein distance, L_f is the Lipschitz constant, and α is the discretization scheme parameter.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes rectified flow models by establishing a vector perturbation lemma that provides better dependence on the early stopping parameter δ compared to previous approaches. For multi-step models, they introduce a Langevin corrector process to improve discretization complexity. The analysis leverages optimal transport theory and stochastic analysis techniques to prove polynomial complexity bounds. The key innovation is the vector perturbation lemma, which enables tighter control of approximation errors in the flow matching framework.

## Key Results
- Proved first polynomial discretization complexity for rectified flow models under bounded support assumption
- Achieved 1/(ε^6 · δ^6 · W^2) complexity for multi-step models, improving upon previous diffusion-based models
- Derived L_f/ε^3 + 1/(α · W^2) complexity for one-step models with explicit dependence on Lipschitz constant and discretization parameter

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The improved complexity bounds stem from the vector perturbation lemma, which provides tighter control over approximation errors in the flow matching framework. By introducing the Langevin corrector process, the multi-step model can better approximate the target distribution with fewer discretization steps. The bounded support assumption enables more realistic analysis compared to previous approaches that assumed Gaussian or unbounded distributions. The deterministic sampler approach leverages the rectified flow's structure to achieve better theoretical guarantees than variance-preserving or variance-exploding alternatives.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Source Distribution -> Rectified Flow -> Target Distribution

Critical Path: Data generation follows the flow from source to target through the rectified flow transformation, with discretization steps controlled by the theoretical bounds.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Multi-step vs one-step: Multi-step models offer better complexity but require more parameters and computation per sample
- Early stopping parameter δ: Larger values improve convergence but may increase computational cost
- Discretization scheme parameter α: Balances between approximation accuracy and computational efficiency

Failure Signatures:
- Poor convergence when δ is too small relative to the complexity of the target distribution
- Numerical instability in the Langevin corrector for highly non-smooth target distributions
- Suboptimal performance when the bounded support assumption is violated

First Experiments:
1. Verify the polynomial complexity empirically by measuring discretization error vs number of steps
2. Compare performance of multi-step with and without Langevin corrector across different datasets
3. Test sensitivity to early stopping parameter δ by varying it across multiple orders of magnitude

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Practical performance gains from theoretical improvements may be limited by the ε^3 and δ^6 dependencies
- Bounded support assumption may not capture all real-world scenarios with heavy-tailed distributions
- Vector perturbation lemma requires empirical validation to confirm practical benefits

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical contributions regarding polynomial discretization complexity
- Medium confidence in comparison claims against previous diffusion-based models
- Low confidence in claims about explaining superior empirical performance

## Next Checks
1. Implement and benchmark the Langevin corrector process on standard datasets to verify the theoretical complexity improvements translate to practical gains
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the early stopping parameter δ to empirically validate the improved dependence shown in the vector perturbation lemma
3. Test the one-step model performance across different values of the discretization scheme parameter α to understand the trade-offs between complexity and generation quality
