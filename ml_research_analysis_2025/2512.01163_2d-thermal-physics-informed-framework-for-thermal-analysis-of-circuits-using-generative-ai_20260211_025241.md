# 2D-ThermAl: Physics-Informed Framework for Thermal Analysis of Circuits using Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.01163
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01163
- Authors: Soumyadeep Chandra; Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury; Kaushik Roy
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves ~200× faster inference than FEM with 0.71°C RMSE for thermal analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ThermAl, a physics-informed generative AI framework for rapid thermal analysis of integrated circuits. Traditional FEM-based simulations are computationally prohibitive for early-stage design, necessitating iterative redesign cycles to resolve late-stage thermal failures. ThermAl addresses this by employing a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to maintain physical fidelity, directly estimating full-chip transient and steady-state thermal distributions from input activity profiles.

Trained on an extensive dataset of heat dissipation maps for over 200 circuit configurations generated via COMSOL, ThermAl delivers precise temperature mappings with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of only 0.71°C and achieves up to ~200× faster inference than conventional FEM tools. Cross-validation on an extended dataset spanning 25-95°C demonstrates robust generalization and high accuracy (<2.2% full-scale RMSE) even under elevated thermal stress conditions.

## Method Summary
ThermAl employs a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to ensure physical consistency in thermal predictions. The framework is trained on a comprehensive dataset of over 200 circuit configurations with heat dissipation maps generated using COMSOL simulations. By directly mapping input activity profiles to full-chip thermal distributions, ThermAl enables rapid estimation of both transient and steady-state temperatures, achieving high accuracy with significantly reduced computational overhead compared to traditional FEM methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves ~200× faster inference than conventional FEM tools
- Delivers precise temperature mappings with RMSE of only 0.71°C
- Demonstrates robust generalization with <2.2% full-scale RMSE across 25-95°C temperature range

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ThermAl's physics-informed approach ensures that the generative model adheres to fundamental thermal principles while maintaining high computational efficiency. The hybrid U-Net architecture effectively captures spatial dependencies in thermal distributions, while positional encoding helps the model understand circuit geometry. The Boltzmann regularizer acts as a physics constraint, ensuring that predicted temperature distributions follow realistic thermal behavior patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **COMSOL-based thermal simulation**: Provides ground truth data for training; essential for creating realistic training datasets that capture complex thermal behaviors in integrated circuits.
- **U-Net architecture**: Enables efficient encoding and decoding of spatial thermal information; critical for mapping input activity profiles to full-chip temperature distributions.
- **Positional encoding**: Helps the model understand circuit geometry and spatial relationships; improves the accuracy of thermal predictions by incorporating geometric context.
- **Boltzmann regularizer**: Acts as a physics constraint to ensure physically consistent outputs; prevents the model from generating unrealistic thermal distributions that violate fundamental principles.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Activity Profiles -> U-Net Encoder -> Bottleneck -> U-Net Decoder -> Boltzmann Regularizer -> Temperature Distribution

**Critical Path:**
Input activity profiles → U-Net encoder → bottleneck representation → U-Net decoder → physics regularization → output thermal map

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Speed vs. accuracy: Achieves ~200× speedup but requires careful balance between model complexity and inference time
- Model size vs. generalization: Larger models may improve accuracy but could reduce generalization across different circuit types
- Physics constraints vs. flexibility: Boltzmann regularizer ensures physical consistency but may limit the model's ability to capture novel thermal behaviors

**Failure Signatures:**
- Systematic underestimation of peak temperatures in high-power regions
- Inability to capture transient thermal effects in rapidly switching circuits
- Reduced accuracy for circuit geometries significantly different from training data

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate ThermAl's predictions against COMSOL simulations for a range of circuit configurations
2. Test the model's performance on circuit layouts not present in the training data
3. Evaluate the impact of removing the Boltzmann regularizer on prediction accuracy and physical consistency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on synthetic circuit configurations and temperature ranges (25-95°C)
- Limited validation against real-world fabrication data or extreme thermal scenarios
- U-Net architecture may face scalability challenges when extended to 3D integrated circuits or heterogeneous material stacks

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Claims regarding computational speedup (~200×) over FEM and basic accuracy metrics (RMSE values) are well-supported by the presented methodology and controlled experiments.

**Medium confidence:**
- Generalization claims across the 25-95°C range and the assertion of "physically consistent" outputs require further validation, as the paper lacks detailed error analysis across different circuit types and thermal gradients.
- The scalability and applicability to real-world design scenarios, given the focus on synthetic datasets and relatively simple circuit configurations in the evaluation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation using thermal data from actual fabricated chips under various operating conditions, including stress tests beyond the 25-95°C range.
2. Evaluate ThermAl's performance on 3D integrated circuit configurations and heterogeneous material stacks to assess architectural scalability.
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the positional encoding and Boltzmann regularizer components to overall accuracy and physical consistency.
