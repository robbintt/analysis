core_contribution: FocusNet is a transformer-enhanced attention network for accurate
  and robust polyp segmentation across multiple imaging modalities. It addresses the
  limitation of existing models trained on single-modality data by integrating a Cross-semantic
  Interaction Decoder Module (CIDM) for coarse segmentation, a Detail Enhancement
  Module (DEM) for refining shallow features, and a Focus Attention Module (FAM) that
  combines local and pooling attention to balance local detail with global context.

# FocusNet: Transformer-enhanced Polyp Segmentation with Local and Pooling Attention

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.13597
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13597
- **Reference count:** 36
- **Primary result:** FocusNet achieves dice coefficients of 82.47% on BLI, 88.46% on FICE, 92.04% on LCI, 82.09% on NBI, and 93.42% on WLI, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

## Executive Summary
FocusNet is a transformer-enhanced attention network designed for accurate and robust polyp segmentation across multiple imaging modalities. It addresses the limitation of existing models trained on single-modality data by integrating a Cross-semantic Interaction Decoder Module (CIDM) for coarse segmentation, a Detail Enhancement Module (DEM) for refining shallow features, and a Focus Attention Module (FAM) that combines local and pooling attention to balance local detail with global context. The model is evaluated on PolypDB, a large multi-center, multi-modality dataset, and demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art CNN, transformer, and Mamba-based methods. FocusNet shows strong generalization across modalities and clinical centers, with statistical significance confirmed by low P-values.

## Method Summary
FocusNet integrates transformer-based attention mechanisms with traditional CNN architectures to enhance polyp segmentation accuracy. The model employs a Cross-semantic Interaction Decoder Module (CIDM) for coarse segmentation, a Detail Enhancement Module (DEM) for refining shallow features, and a Focus Attention Module (FAM) that combines local and pooling attention. These components work together to balance local detail with global context, enabling robust performance across diverse imaging modalities. The model is trained and evaluated on PolypDB, a large multi-center, multi-modality dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art results.

## Key Results
- Dice coefficients: 82.47% (BLI), 88.46% (FICE), 92.04% (LCI), 82.09% (NBI), 93.42% (WLI)
- Outperforms state-of-the-art CNN, transformer, and Mamba-based methods
- Demonstrates strong generalization across modalities and clinical centers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FocusNet leverages transformer-based attention mechanisms to capture global context while maintaining local detail. The Cross-semantic Interaction Decoder Module (CIDM) enhances coarse segmentation by integrating cross-semantic information, while the Detail Enhancement Module (DEM) refines shallow features for improved accuracy. The Focus Attention Module (FAM) combines local and pooling attention to balance fine-grained details with broader contextual understanding. This multi-level approach enables robust performance across diverse imaging modalities and clinical settings.

## Foundational Learning
- **Transformer Attention:** Captures long-range dependencies; quick check: verify attention weights for global context
- **Cross-semantic Interaction:** Integrates information across semantic levels; quick check: ensure cross-semantic consistency
- **Pooling Attention:** Aggregates spatial information; quick check: validate pooling effectiveness
- **Detail Enhancement:** Refines shallow features; quick check: measure improvement in fine detail accuracy
- **Multi-modal Generalization:** Adapts to diverse imaging modalities; quick check: test on unseen modalities

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Encoder -> CIDM -> DEM -> FAM -> Decoder
- **Critical Path:** Input -> Encoder -> CIDM (coarse) -> DEM (refine) -> FAM (attention) -> Decoder (output)
