# ForecastGAN: A Decomposition-Based Adversarial Framework for Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.04445
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04445
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ForecastGAN achieves 37.54% average improvement over transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining competitive for long-term horizons

## Executive Summary
ForecastGAN introduces a decomposition-based adversarial framework for multi-horizon time series forecasting that addresses key limitations of existing approaches, particularly transformer models that underperform in short-term forecasting and typically ignore categorical features. The method integrates three core modules: decomposition of time series into trend and seasonality components, model selection from linear architecture variants, and adversarial training using conditional GANs. Validation across eleven benchmark datasets demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while maintaining competitive performance for long-term horizons.

## Method Summary
ForecastGAN operates through three integrated modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components using average pooling (kernel 25, padding 'same'), a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations from four linear variants based on validation loss, and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network training. The framework effectively integrates both numerical and categorical features through one-hot encoding. The Generator is selected from Linear, NLinear, DLinear, or DELinear variants based on lowest validation MSE, then trained adversarially against a 3-layer MLP Discriminator with gradient penalty. The approach shows particular strength in short-term forecasting where transformers typically underperform.

## Key Results
- Achieves 37.54% average improvement over transformer models for short-term forecasting across 11 benchmark datasets
- Maintains competitive performance for long-term forecasting horizons
- Effectively handles mixed numerical and categorical features, unlike many transformer-based approaches
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diverse datasets including ETT, Electricity, Traffic, and Weather

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ForecastGAN's effectiveness stems from its decomposition-based approach that separates trend and seasonality components, allowing specialized modeling of each. The model selection module ensures optimal architecture choice for specific forecasting horizons rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach. The adversarial training component enhances prediction robustness by training the generator against a discriminator, which helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization. The framework's ability to incorporate categorical features through one-hot encoding addresses a limitation of many transformer-based approaches that focus solely on numerical data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Decomposition-based forecasting**: Separating time series into trend and seasonal components allows specialized modeling of each pattern; needed because different temporal patterns require different modeling approaches
- **Model selection for forecasting**: Dynamically choosing the optimal architecture based on validation performance ensures the best fit for specific datasets and horizons; quick check: compare selected model performance against baseline models
- **Conditional GAN for time series**: Using adversarial training to improve forecast robustness and generalization; needed because standard supervised learning can overfit to training data
- **Mixed feature handling**: One-hot encoding categorical features enables integration with numerical data in the forecasting pipeline; needed because real-world time series often contain both feature types
- **Multi-horizon forecasting**: Designing architectures that perform well across different forecasting horizons rather than optimizing for a single horizon; needed because forecasting requirements vary by application

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Decomposition Module -> Model Selection Module -> Adversarial Training Module -> Forecast Output

**Critical Path**: Raw time series → Decomposition (trend + seasonality) → Linear model selection → cGAN training → Point forecasts

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses linear model variants for parameter efficiency and interpretability versus potentially better performance from non-linear architectures; fixed decomposition kernel size versus adaptive decomposition for varying seasonality strengths

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Generator loss approaching 0 indicates discriminator collapse
- Validation performance significantly worse than training indicates overfitting
- Poor decomposition results (trend not smooth, seasonality not capturing patterns) indicate inappropriate kernel size

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Implement decomposition module on sample dataset and visualize trend/seasonality components
2. Train all four linear model variants on decomposed data and verify model selection works correctly
3. Test cGAN training with simple generator/discriminator pair to verify adversarial training stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the framework be extended to provide uncertainty quantification through prediction intervals rather than solely point forecasts? The authors identify this as a key future research direction, noting that while the conditional GAN theoretically models probability distributions, current implementation only evaluates deterministic point estimates.
- Does expanding the Model Selection Module to include non-linear or attention-based architectures improve performance on complex datasets? Section 6.5 notes current reliance on linear variants potentially constrains performance on certain complex datasets.
- Can an adaptive mechanism be developed to automatically determine the optimal look-back window size based on specific dataset characteristics? Section 7 identifies this as a goal for enhancing usability, noting that current manual hyperparameter tuning is required.

## Limitations
- Critical gaps exist in how noise is integrated into the linear generator architecture, making the generative component unclear
- Embedding mechanism for combining decomposed numerical features with one-hot encoded categorical features is underspecified
- Fixed decomposition kernel size assumes strong seasonality, which may degrade performance on datasets with weak or non-stationary seasonality patterns

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Decomposition methodology (average pooling for trend, residual for seasonality) and adversarial training framework (BCE + gradient penalty) are clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Four linear model variants and selection criteria are specified but exact mathematical formulations not fully detailed
- **Low Confidence**: Integration of noise into linear generator and embedding mechanism for mixed features are critical gaps preventing complete reproduction

## Next Checks
1. Verify noise injection mechanism by implementing and testing multiple approaches for integrating noise into the linear Generator to determine which aligns with the original method
2. Validate embedding strategy by experimenting with different concatenation and embedding dimensions for combining decomposed numerical features with one-hot encoded categorical features
3. Test decomposition sensitivity by evaluating ForecastGAN performance across datasets with varying seasonality strengths using both fixed and adaptive kernel sizes for trend extraction
