# A Challenge to Build Neuro-Symbolic Video Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.13851
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13851
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Neuro-symbolic approach outperforms traditional deep learning for temporally complex video tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of building video agents capable of interpreting complex, temporally extended events and taking real-world actions. Current deep learning approaches struggle with long-term temporal reasoning essential for tasks like home security monitoring and autonomous driving. The authors propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines deep learning perception models with formal temporal logic frameworks to enable structured reasoning, interpretability, and formal guarantees. The paper introduces the TLV dataset with frame-level annotations for temporally dependent events and metrics like F1-score and NeuS-V to evaluate temporal fidelity in video generation.

## Method Summary
The proposed neuro-symbolic approach uses the NSVS-TL pipeline that maps videos to probabilistic automata using neural perception models, converts user queries to temporal logic specifications, and solves as a verification problem. For video search, the system decomposes queries into atomic events, sequences them logically, and validates against temporal constraints. For video generation evaluation, NeuS-V uses LLMs to extract atomic propositions from prompts, VLMs for semantic scoring, and formal verification for satisfaction probability. The TLV dataset serves as the foundation for development and evaluation, compiled from Waymo and NuScenes images with frame-level temporal annotations.

## Key Results
- Neuro-symbolic methods outperform traditional deep learning models in complex video search tasks
- Temporal coherence in video generation improves as scenario complexity increases
- Initial results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining neural perception with formal temporal logic

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The neuro-symbolic approach works by leveraging the complementary strengths of deep learning perception and formal logic reasoning. Deep learning models excel at feature extraction and pattern recognition from video frames, while temporal logic provides a rigorous framework for representing and verifying complex temporal relationships. By decomposing user queries into atomic events and mapping them to probabilistic automata, the system can perform structured reasoning over long temporal horizons. This hybrid approach enables interpretability through formal specifications and provides guarantees about temporal constraint satisfaction that pure neural approaches cannot offer.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal Logic (TL)**: A formal system for specifying and reasoning about temporal properties - needed for representing complex event sequences; quick check: can you write "event A happens before event B" in TL?
- **Probabilistic Automata**: Models that capture state transitions with probabilities - needed for representing uncertainty in video perception; quick check: can you compute transition probabilities from observation sequences?
- **Frame-level Temporal Annotations**: Precise labeling of when events occur in videos - needed for training and evaluation; quick check: can you align event labels with exact video frames?
- **LLM-based Query Decomposition**: Using language models to parse natural language into formal specifications - needed for bridging natural language and formal logic; quick check: does the LLM correctly identify atomic propositions?
- **VLM-based Semantic Scoring**: Using vision-language models for confidence assessment - needed for evaluating video generation quality; quick check: does the VLM score generated frames consistently?
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proof of system properties - needed for guaranteeing temporal constraint satisfaction; quick check: can you verify a simple temporal property?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Query -> Query Decomposition -> Temporal Logic Parser -> Probabilistic Automaton Construction -> Model Checking -> Output

**Critical Path**: The key path involves query decomposition into temporal logic specifications, conversion to probabilistic automata using neural perception, and formal verification to extract satisfying video segments.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades off computational complexity for interpretability and formal guarantees. While pure neural approaches may be faster, the neuro-symbolic method provides verifiable reasoning about temporal relationships at the cost of additional processing steps.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor query decomposition leads to incorrect TL specs; inadequate perception models miss atomic events; improper automaton construction creates spurious transitions; verification may fail on overly complex specifications.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test query decomposition pipeline on simple temporal queries to verify TL spec generation
2. Evaluate perception model performance on atomic event detection before full pipeline integration
3. Run NeuS-V evaluation on a small set of generated videos to validate temporal fidelity assessment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Neural perception model selection and implementation details are not fully specified
- TL specification language and LLM prompting strategy lack complete documentation
- No reference implementation provided despite GitHub repository reference
- Probabilistic automaton construction details (thresholding, transition probabilities) are unspecified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: TLV dataset utility, evaluation metrics appropriateness, general neuro-symbolic methodology
- **Medium confidence**: Relative performance claims between neuro-symbolic and traditional approaches
- **Low confidence**: Specific implementation details required for exact reproduction

## Next Checks
1. Reconstruct the TL specification language and query decomposition workflow using the described formal logic framework, then validate against provided TLV examples
2. Implement the probabilistic automaton construction pipeline with different perception models to assess sensitivity to model choice
3. Run the NeuS-V evaluation pipeline on generated videos to verify temporal fidelity assessment methodology
