# Could you be wrong: Debiasing LLMs using a metacognitive prompt for improving human decision making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.10124
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10124
- Authors: Thomas T. Hills
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: The "Could you be wrong?" prompt consistently elicits deeper reflection, self-correction, and more nuanced responses from LLMs across discriminatory bias, metacognitive limitations, and evidence omission scenarios.

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces a metacognitive prompt—"Could you be wrong?"—to debias large language models (LLMs) by encouraging them to critically evaluate their own outputs. This approach leverages the LLM's latent knowledge about biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence, which may remain unexpressed without such prompting. Tested across various scenarios—including discriminatory bias, metacognitive limitations, and evidence omission—the prompt consistently elicited deeper reflection, self-correction, and more nuanced responses. For example, in a medical reasoning task, ChatGPT-4o identified the fictional nature of a condition and provided multiple reasons for potential error. In the case of the "too much choice" effect, it surfaced contradictory evidence absent from its initial response. The method shows promise as a general, prompt-based strategy for improving LLM outputs by invoking adversarial internal critique, aligning with human decision-making debiasing techniques.

## Method Summary
The method involves posing a target question to an LLM, then immediately following up with the metacognitive prompt "Could you be wrong?" Using ChatGPT-4o with default settings (no personalization, new chat window per test), the author tested this approach across three scenarios: (1) LLM Word Association Test adapted from Bai et al. (2025) for discriminatory bias; (2) medical multiple-choice questions with fictional organ "Glianorex" from Griot et al. (2025); and (3) factual query about the "too much choice effect" to test evidence omission. Each scenario was run >10 times for qualitative consistency, with comparable results reported across Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1.

## Key Results
- Across discriminatory bias scenarios, the prompt revealed stereotypical response patterns and prompted the model to identify potential biases in its own reasoning
- In medical reasoning tasks, ChatGPT-4o correctly identified fictional conditions and provided multiple reasons for potential error
- For factual queries like the "too much choice" effect, the prompt surfaced contradictory evidence absent from the initial response

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Metacognitive prompts activate latent knowledge that exists within the model but remains unexpressed under standard prompting conditions.
- **Mechanism:** LLMs store information about biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence in their vector embeddings and transformer attention heads. However, because they respond autoregressively to user prompts, they tend to generate stereotypical, high-frequency responses unless explicitly cued to access deeper knowledge representations. The "could you be wrong?" prompt functions as a retrieval cue that reorients attention toward underutilized regions of the model's knowledge.
- **Core assumption:** The model has been trained on sufficient data containing metaknowledge about reasoning errors, alternative perspectives, and evidence conflicts.
- **Evidence anchors:** "LLMs trained on vast amounts of information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if prompted."
- **Break condition:** If the model lacks relevant counter-evidence in its training data, the prompt may elicit confabulation rather than genuine metacognitive reflection.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Outputs must be made explicit before they can be evaluated, creating a two-phase process: generation followed by adversarial critique.
- **Mechanism:** LLMs lack intrinsic self-awareness—they cannot reflect on internal representations until those representations become part of the output stream. The initial response serves as an externalized "thought" that subsequent prompts can target for evaluation. This mirrors the human concept that we often discover what we think by articulating it first.
- **Core assumption:** The model's autoregressive architecture allows earlier outputs to condition later reasoning within the same context window.
- **Evidence anchors:** "LLMs need to produce content in order to evaluate it."
- **Break condition:** If context window limits truncate the initial response, or if the model doesn't maintain sufficient attention to earlier outputs, critique quality degrades.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Adversarial self-questioning surfaces alignment gaps between user intent and model interpretation.
- **Mechanism:** The prompt invites the model to consider how its interpretation might differ from what the user intended. By asking for potential errors and alternative interpretations, the model reveals discrepancies in how prompts are understood versus how they were meant. This is particularly valuable because LLMs often interpret prompts through stereotypical patterns rather than nuanced user intent.
- **Core assumption:** The model can represent and articulate differences between surface-level interpretation and deeper intent.
- **Evidence anchors:** "Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and users interpret prompts are not aligned."
- **Break condition:** If the model's fine-tuning heavily optimizes for single confident answers, it may resist generating alternative interpretations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Autoregressive generation and context conditioning**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that LLMs generate tokens sequentially, with each token conditioned on all previous tokens in the context, explains why initial outputs shape subsequent reflections.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why an LLM cannot "think before it speaks" in the way humans can?

- **Concept: Attention as selective access**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames LLMs as attentional systems that prioritize certain information based on prompts. Understanding attention helps explain why latent knowledge requires explicit retrieval cues.
  - Quick check question: What happens to information in an LLM's training data that is never cued by a relevant prompt?

- **Concept: Metacognition as externalized evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The paper's intervention relies on the model evaluating its own outputs. Recognizing that metacognition in LLMs is fundamentally different from human self-awareness prevents overattribution of genuine introspection.
  - Quick check question: When an LLM says "I could be wrong because...", is it accessing a self-model or generating plausible text based on training patterns?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input layer (user prompt) → Initial LLM response → Intervention point (metacognitive prompt) → Processing (model conditions on both) → Output (augmented response) → Optional iteration
- **Critical path:** 1. Ensure initial response is complete and visible in context; 2. Apply metacognitive prompt immediately after initial output; 3. Parse critique response for actionable limitations; 4. If critique is shallow ("Yes, I could be wrong"), re-prompt with "Explain all the ways you could be wrong"; 5. Iterate until diminishing returns on new information
- **Design tradeoffs:** Latency vs. depth (each iteration adds API call latency); token costs (roughly doubles token usage); over-correction risk (excessive hedging); prompt sensitivity (phrasing variations affect depth)
- **Failure signatures:** Shallow compliance (generic hedging without specific analysis); confabulation under pressure (inventing false limitations); context overflow (long responses hit token limits); inconsistency across runs
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Baseline calibration (test on prompts with known ground truth to document correct vs. spurious error identification); 2. Iterative depth test (run prompt cycle 3 times, tracking genuinely new information); 3. Cross-domain validation (apply across at least three domains to assess task-dependent effectiveness)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does iterative application of the "could you be wrong" prompt reliably surface deeper or distinct biases (e.g., omission bias) that remain hidden in single-shot applications?
- **Basis in paper:** The author states in the discussion, "Asking 'could you be wrong' iteratively produces the 'omission bias' along with many others," suggesting a "general rule" to exhaust the LLM's capacity for self-critique.
- **Why unresolved:** The provided demonstrations utilize a single follow-up prompt, whereas the discussion suggests that uncovering less prominent biases may require multiple iterative rounds not tested in the main examples.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A study comparing the number and type of biases identified after single versus multiple rounds of the metacognitive prompt across various tasks.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can other human debiasing frameworks, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or perspective-taking, be effectively translated into general-purpose LLM prompts?
- **Basis in paper:** The conclusion argues that "human psychology offers a new avenue for prompt engineering," specifically citing that CBT and other therapies share the goal of making implicit knowledge explicit.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper validates only the "could you be wrong" intervention, leaving the efficacy of the broader "long history of effective prompt-based improvements" mentioned in the abstract untested in LLM contexts.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative experiments implementing specific psychological debiasing techniques (e.g., CBT belief-challenging prompts) against the metacognitive prompt to evaluate relative performance.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the "could you be wrong" prompt significantly improve performance on standardized benchmarks for metacognition and bias compared to baseline responses?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper relies on "demonstration" and "qualitatively consistent responses" rather than statistical analysis, leaving the quantitative magnitude of improvement on benchmarks (like Griot et al.) unknown.
- **Why unresolved:** The author provides verbatim chat logs to prove the concept works but notes that the examples are "showing but one instance," making it unclear if the method generalizes to high accuracy across full datasets.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A controlled evaluation measuring the "none of the above" selection rate and factual accuracy on the fictional medical benchmark with and without the metacognitive prompt.

## Limitations

- The paper relies on qualitative demonstrations rather than systematic quantitative measurement of when the prompt surfaces genuine latent knowledge versus superficial hedging
- Effectiveness appears task-dependent, with no established patterns for when the method works best across different domains
- The approach may elicit confabulation when pushed for errors that don't exist, potentially generating spurious limitations

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The prompt consistently produces additional output content when applied to initial LLM responses
- **Medium confidence:** The additional content represents genuine latent knowledge about biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence rather than confabulation
- **Low confidence:** The method generalizes beyond tested scenarios to become a reliable, general-purpose debiasing technique

## Next Checks

1. **Content authenticity test:** Design experiments where ground truth is known (e.g., factual questions with verifiable answers) to systematically measure whether the prompt correctly identifies genuine error sources versus inventing spurious limitations.

2. **Cross-model generalization study:** Test the prompt across at least 5 different model families/architectures (including smaller models) to determine whether effectiveness correlates with model size, training approach, or specific architectural features.

3. **Automated evaluation framework:** Develop quantitative metrics to distinguish between genuine metacognitive reflection and superficial hedging, enabling systematic measurement of prompt effectiveness across diverse use cases.
