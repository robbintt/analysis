# Robustness Evaluation of Machine Learning Models for Fault Classification and Localization In Power System Protection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.15385
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15385
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Machine learning models for fault classification remain highly robust to sensor and communication degradation, while fault localization is sensitive to voltage measurement loss and sampling rate reduction.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a systematic framework to evaluate machine learning model robustness for power system protection under realistic data degradation scenarios. Using high-fidelity EMT simulations, the framework quantifies the impact of sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and communication losses on fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) performance. The results reveal a fundamental asymmetry: FC maintains high accuracy (>99% F1) across most degradations but drops ~13% when single-phase measurements are lost, while FL shows severe sensitivity to voltage loss (>150% error increase) and relay outages (up to 37% accuracy degradation). The findings emphasize the importance of voltage redundancy, reliable communication to key substations, and task-specific sampling strategies for resilient, ML-assisted protection systems.

## Method Summary
The study employs EMT simulations at 6.4 kHz to generate 9,023 fault cases with 8 protection relays measuring 3-phase voltage and current (48 channels total). Data is windowed to ±80 ms around fault inception and segmented into 50 ms overlapping windows with 5 ms stride. An MLP with 2 hidden layers and ReLU activations is trained using 5-fold cross-validation at the episode level to prevent temporal leakage. The model is evaluated on baseline data and then systematically degraded through sensor loss, downsampling, relay failures, phase loss, and temporal dropout to quantify robustness impacts on FC (F1-score) and FL (MAE).

## Key Results
- FC F1-scores remain above 0.99 under most degradation types but drop by ~13% when single-phase measurements are lost
- FL voltage loss increases localization error by over 150%, while current loss causes ~71% increase
- Sampling rates below 400 Hz (FC) and 800 Hz (FL) lead to notable performance drops
- Substation 2 relay outage degrades FL accuracy by up to 37%, highlighting critical communication dependencies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) exhibit asymmetric robustness to data degradation, with FC being broadly stable while FL is highly sensitive to specific measurement losses.
- **Mechanism:** FC relies on global disturbance patterns that remain discriminable across multiple sensor channels, whereas FL depends on precise spatial references derived primarily from voltage measurements and central grid locations. This mirrors classical distance protection, where voltage provides the spatial fault reference.
- **Core assumption:** The MLP architecture learns representations analogous to classical protection logic; this interpretability claim is inferred but not formally proven.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%."
  - [Section 3.1] "The MAE increases from 7.8 in the baseline to 13.4 under current loss and 20.6 when voltage inputs are missing, corresponding to relative error increases of approximately 71% and 163%, respectively."
  - [corpus] Neighboring paper "Impact of Data Sparsity on Machine Learning for Fault Detection" corroborates sensitivity patterns under limited observability.
- **Break condition:** Robustness asymmetry may not hold if FL models incorporate explicit physical constraints (e.g., distance protection equations) or if FC models are trained on insufficiently diverse fault types.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Single-phase measurement loss causes the most severe degradation for FC because models rely on inter-phase correlations for fault type discrimination.
- **Mechanism:** Three-phase power systems exhibit characteristic fault signatures (e.g., phase-to-phase vs. phase-to-ground) that require complete phase information to distinguish. Removing one phase disrupts the symmetry and correlation patterns the model has learned, impairing both classification and localization.
- **Core assumption:** The MLP learns inter-phase relationships implicitly through training data; this is inferred from performance patterns, not direct inspection of learned weights.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.4] "F1-scores dropping from 0.99 (baseline) to 0.85-0.87 when one phase was missing; a relative decrease of about 12-14%."
  - [Section 3.4] "The sharp drop under single-phase loss shows that the models rely on inter-phase correlations, which are disrupted when one phase is missing, impairing symmetry and spatial fault inference."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on phase-loss mechanisms; neighboring papers focus on sensor placement and overall data sparsity.
- **Break condition:** Performance may improve with architecture modifications that explicitly model three-phase relationships (e.g., graph neural networks with phase topology) or data augmentation strategies that simulate phase loss during training.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** FL accuracy degrades nonlinearly with reduced sampling rates because fine temporal details of transient propagation are required for precise distance estimation.
- **Mechanism:** Fault location estimation depends on capturing high-frequency transient waveforms that propagate through transmission lines. Lower sampling rates alias these transients, losing the temporal precision needed for accurate distance calculation, while broader waveform characteristics sufficient for fault type classification persist.
- **Core assumption:** The 50ms window captures sufficient transient information; shorter windows may alter these threshold findings.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Table 2] FL MAE increases from 7.80 (6.4kHz) to 8.20 (400Hz) to 14.67 (100Hz); FC F1 remains above 0.98 until 200Hz.
  - [Section 3.2] "The results suggest that FC primarily depends on broader waveform characteristics that persist at lower resolutions, whereas FL accuracy depends on fine temporal details of transient propagation."
  - [corpus] Neighboring paper on PMU placement discusses sampling requirements but does not systematically evaluate downsampling effects.
- **Break condition:** Thresholds (400Hz for FC, 800Hz for FL) are specific to this topology and fault set; systems with different line lengths or fault characteristics may shift these boundaries.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Electromagnetic Transients (EMT) Simulation
  - **Why needed here:** The study uses EMT simulations at 6.4kHz to generate high-fidelity voltage and current waveforms that capture transient fault behavior. Understanding EMT is essential for interpreting why downsampling degrades FL more than FC.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a 50ms window at 100Hz (5 samples) provide insufficient information for transient-based fault localization compared to 6.4kHz (320 samples)?

- **Concept:** Distance Protection Principles
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly connects FL behavior to classical distance protection, where voltage and current measurements provide the spatial fault reference. This analogy explains the asymmetric sensitivity to voltage loss.
  - **Quick check question:** In classical distance protection, which measurement (voltage or current) primarily determines fault location, and how does this relate to the 163% error increase under voltage loss?

- **Concept:** F1-Score vs. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - **Why needed here:** The study uses F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) for FC (classification) and MAE (average absolute deviation) for FL (regression). These metrics quantify different failure modes and cannot be directly compared.
  - **Quick check question:** An F1-score of 0.99 with an MAE of 7.8% line length: which metric would you prioritize when evaluating protection system reliability, and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw EMT waveforms → 50ms windows (±80ms around fault) → 320×48 flattened tensors → MLP (2 hidden layers, ReLU) → FC (11 softmax) or FL (1 linear)

- **Critical path:** Input preprocessing (windowing) → model training on complete data → baseline evaluation → controlled degradation injection → relative performance comparison. The episode-level split prevents temporal leakage between training and validation windows.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - MLP architecture prioritizes interpretability and computational efficiency but underutilizes temporal and spatial dependencies (acknowledged limitation).
  - 50ms window balances transient capture and computational load; shorter windows may miss propagation details.
  - Five degradation scenarios (sensor outage, downsampling, relay failure, phase loss, temporal dropout) cover realistic failures but do not include noise injection or adversarial perturbations.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Voltage loss: FL MAE increases 163% (dominant spatial reference lost).
  - Substation 2 outage: FL MAE increases 103% (central measurements critical).
  - Single-phase loss: FC F1 drops 12-14% (inter-phase correlations disrupted).
  - Sampling below 400Hz (FC) or 800Hz (FL): Gradual but measurable degradation.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Replicate baseline:** Train MLP on complete 6.4kHz data; verify FC F1≈0.99 and FL MAE≈7.8% with 5-fold CV.
  2. **Voltage ablation:** Zero all voltage channels at inference time; confirm FL MAE increases to ~20% while FC remains stable.
  3. **Sampling threshold test:** Downsample to 800Hz, 400Hz, 200Hz; plot FC F1 and FL MAE curves to identify task-specific knee points.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The asymmetric robustness patterns are derived from a single double-line topology and may not extend to meshed networks with different protection coordination schemes.
- Phase-loss causality is inferred from performance drops rather than direct inspection of learned representations or model internals.
- Sampling rate thresholds are specific to the 50ms window length and may shift for systems with different line lengths or transient characteristics.

## Confidence
- **High:** Core robustness evaluation framework, EMT simulation methodology, and relative degradation patterns under sensor outage and communication loss.
- **Medium:** Task-specific sampling rate thresholds and the distance-protection analogy for FL sensitivity to voltage loss.
- **Low:** Internal mechanisms of phase-correlation learning and the generalizability of asymmetry to different grid topologies.

## Next Checks
1. **Topology Transfer Test:** Apply the framework to a meshed network with looped protection zones to verify whether the FC/FL robustness asymmetry persists under different electrical distances and relay coordination patterns.
2. **Model Internals Inspection:** Use SHAP or attention visualization on the MLP to confirm that phase-loss degradation correlates with disrupted inter-phase feature importance, directly validating the correlation-based mechanism.
3. **Window-Length Sensitivity:** Repeat the sampling rate experiments with 20ms and 100ms windows to determine whether the 400Hz/800Hz thresholds are artifacts of the 50ms choice or reflect fundamental signal characteristics.
