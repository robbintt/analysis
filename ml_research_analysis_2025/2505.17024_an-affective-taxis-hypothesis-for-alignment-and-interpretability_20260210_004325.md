core_contribution: This paper proposes an affectivist approach to AI alignment by
  reframing goals and values in terms of affective taxis - the idea that organisms
  navigate internal physiological landscapes through movement. The authors suggest
  that AI agents must model both human affective states and the interoceptive facts
  that ground them to achieve alignment.

# An Affective-Taxis Hypothesis for Alignment and Interpretability
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.17024
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17024
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Affective valence emerges from directional derivatives of attractant gradients in interoceptive space, providing biological grounding for evaluative reasoning in AI alignment

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes an affectivist approach to AI alignment by reframing goals and values in terms of affective taxis - the idea that organisms navigate internal physiological landscapes through movement. The authors suggest that AI agents must model both human affective states and the interoceptive facts that ground them to achieve alignment. They present a computational model of affect based on taxis navigation and discuss evidence from C. elegans that supports their model. The key insight is that affective valence emerges from the directional derivatives of attractant gradients in interoceptive space, providing a biological grounding for evaluative reasoning.

## Method Summary
The authors present a computational model of affect based on taxis navigation in interoceptive space. They argue that organisms move to maintain physiological variables within optimal ranges, and that affective valence emerges from the directional derivatives of these physiological gradients. The model is supported by evidence from C. elegans chemotaxis studies, where worms navigate chemical gradients using similar principles. The approach suggests that AI alignment requires understanding not just observable behavior, but the underlying physiological basis of affect that generates those behaviors.

## Key Results
- Affective valence emerges from directional derivatives of attractant gradients in interoceptive space
- C. elegans chemotaxis provides biological support for the affective-taxis model
- The approach addresses the identifiability problem in alignment by focusing on physiological grounding rather than observable behavior alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The affective-taxis hypothesis works by grounding affective states in measurable physiological variables and their gradients. Organisms navigate their internal interoceptive landscapes by moving to maintain physiological variables within optimal ranges. Affective valence emerges as the directional derivative of these physiological gradients - organisms experience positive affect when moving toward physiological attractors and negative affect when moving away. This creates a computational framework where alignment can be achieved by modeling both the human's affective states and the interoceptive facts that ground them.

## Foundational Learning
- Interoceptive signaling: Internal physiological signals that inform the organism about its internal state; needed to understand the basis of affective experience
- Taxis navigation: Movement toward or away from stimuli based on gradients; provides the computational framework for affective processing
- Directional derivatives: Mathematical concept measuring rate of change in a specific direction; explains how valence emerges from physiological gradients
- C. elegans chemotaxis: Movement of nematodes in response to chemical gradients; serves as biological validation of the model
- Identifiability problem: Difficulty in determining true underlying preferences from observed behavior; addressed by physiological grounding
- Valence computation: Process of determining positive or negative affect; emerges from gradient navigation rather than being a separate computational process

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: AI agent -> Human interoceptive monitoring -> Gradient computation -> Valence prediction -> Alignment decisions
Critical path: Interoceptive measurement → Gradient computation → Valence emergence → Alignment action
Design tradeoffs: Physiological complexity vs. computational tractability; individual variation vs. generalizable models
Failure signatures: Misalignment between measured and actual interoceptive states; gradient computation errors leading to incorrect valence
First experiments: 1) Validate gradient-valence relationship in controlled human studies; 2) Test model's ability to predict affective responses to known stimuli; 3) Compare alignment performance against baseline methods using standardized benchmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Extrapolation from C. elegans (302 neurons) to human affective systems remains largely speculative
- Practical feasibility of measuring and modeling complex human interoceptive landscapes is unaddressed
- Current neuroscientific methods for accessing interoceptive information are limited

## Confidence
- Biological grounding extrapolation: Medium confidence
- Model's ability to capture human values: Medium confidence
- Feasibility of interoceptive measurement: Medium confidence
- Solution to identifiability problem: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation of the model's predictions using human physiological data, particularly examining whether affective valence correlates with directional derivatives in measured interoceptive dimensions
2. Implementation of the computational model in a simple AI agent and testing its ability to navigate human-specified affective landscapes
3. Comparative analysis of the affective-taxis approach against existing alignment methods using standardized benchmarks for value learning and goal specification
