## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multi-agent verification system that addresses multimedia misinformation through systematic integration of Multimodal Large Language Models with external verification tools. The system operates through six stages: raw data processing, planning, information extraction, deep research, evidence collection, and report generation. The core Deep Researcher Agent employs four specialized tools—reverse image search, metadata analysis, fact-checking databases, and verified news processing—to extract spatial, temporal, attribution, and motivational context. The approach was demonstrated on a challenge dataset sample, successfully verifying content authenticity and extracting precise geolocation, timing, and source attribution across multiple platforms.

## Method Summary
The system processes multimedia content through a six-stage pipeline: (1) Raw data processing extracts keyframes and analyzes videos using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Yandex Image Search API; (2) A Planner Agent coordinates verification strategy; (3) Information extraction sections content into temporal, geographical, entity, and metadata claims; (4) A Deep Researcher Agent conducts iterative searches using four tools (reverse image search, metadata analysis, fact-checking databases, verified news processor); (5) Evidence collection aggregates findings and resolves conflicts; (6) Report generation produces structured Markdown output. The system was demonstrated on the ACMMM25 Grand Challenge dataset's 50 multimedia samples.

## Key Results
- Successfully verified content authenticity on challenge dataset sample (Case ID43-3)
- Extracted precise geolocation coordinates (48.4647° N, 35.0462° E) and exact timestamps (04/05/2022, 19:58:37 local time)
- Traced source attribution across multiple platforms through comprehensive metadata and contextual analysis
- Demonstrated systematic extraction of spatial, temporal, attribution, and motivational context dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Tool-augmented MLLM reasoning reduces hallucination by grounding outputs in verifiable external evidence. The Deep Researcher Agent queries external tools and synthesizes retrieved evidence through MLLM reasoning, producing claims anchored to traceable sources. Core assumption: external tools return reliable information and the MLLM correctly interprets and integrates tool outputs. Break condition: if tool outputs are noisy, contradictory, or manipulated, grounding may propagate errors.

### Mechanism 2
The "Where/When/Who/Why" extraction framework provides systematic coverage of verification-critical contextual dimensions. The system decomposes content analysis into four structured extraction tasks—spatial context, temporal context, attribution context, and motivational context—ensuring multi-dimensional evidence collection. Core assumption: misinformation can be detected through contextual inconsistency across these dimensions. Break condition: if content lacks exploitable cues in one or more dimensions, the framework may produce inconclusive results.

### Mechanism 3
Six-stage pipeline modularization enables parallel processing and systematic verification coverage. The pipeline separates concerns—raw data processing, planning, information sectioning, deep research, evidence synthesis, and report generation—allowing specialized agents/tools per stage. Core assumption: modular separation does not lose critical cross-stage dependencies. Break condition: if critical information is discarded or misclassified in early stages, downstream stages cannot recover it.

## Foundational Learning

- **MLLM hallucination and grounding strategies**: Why needed—the paper identifies hallucination as a key limitation and structures the entire system around external tool grounding. Quick check: Can you explain why an MLLM might confidently fabricate details about an image, and how tool augmentation addresses this?

- **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) verification techniques**: Why needed—the four tools (reverse image search, metadata analysis, fact-checking databases, verified news processing) are standard OSINT methods. Quick check: What type of misinformation would reverse image search detect versus fail to detect?

- **Agent orchestration and tool-calling patterns**: Why needed—the Planner Agent and Deep Researcher Agent use LLM tool-calling to coordinate multiple external APIs. Quick check: How should an agent handle a tool that returns empty or contradictory results?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw media → Frame Extractor → Planner Agent (strategy) → Deep Researcher Agent (tool calls + iterative search) → Evidence synthesis → Final report

- **Critical path**: Raw media processing through Frame Extractor feeds into Planner Agent for strategy creation, which delegates to Deep Researcher Agent for tool orchestration and iterative search, followed by evidence synthesis and final report generation. The Deep Researcher Agent is the bottleneck; all verification quality depends on its tool orchestration.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Gemini 2.0 Flash vs. larger MLLMs (speed vs. reasoning depth), Yandex API vs. Google/Tineye (regional coverage differences), iterative search depth vs. latency (evidence quality vs. response time), automated report vs. human-in-loop (efficiency vs. oversight).

- **Failure signatures**: Empty tool responses (API rate limits), inconsistent timestamps across sources (temporal verification gap), no geolocation match (landmark recognition failure), high-confidence contradictory evidence (coordinated misinformation requiring multi-source triangulation).

- **First 3 experiments**: (1) Ablation study—run verification with one tool disabled at a time to measure each tool's contribution; (2) Latency profiling—instrument each stage to identify bottlenecks, particularly Deep Researcher Agent's iterative search; (3) Error taxonomy analysis—run system on edge cases and categorize failure modes by stage and tool.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Human-Centered Contestable AI**: How can contestable AI mechanisms, such as tiered appeal systems, be integrated into the verification workflow without compromising automated efficiency? The paper identifies this as a primary future direction, but current architecture prioritizes automated pipeline execution.

- **Explainable AI Methods**: Can XAI methods providing dynamic multimodal explanations and uncertainty quantification improve report trustworthiness? The paper calls for future research into XAI methods enabling uncertainty quantification and source tracking.

- **Quantitative Performance**: What is the quantitative performance and error rate across the full 50-sample dataset compared to baseline methods? The evaluation presents only a single demonstrative result rather than aggregate metrics or comparative analysis.

## Limitations

- No quantitative validation—lacks accuracy metrics, ablation studies, or comparative benchmarks
- Implementation details unspecified—agent prompts, iterative search parameters, and conflict-resolution strategies are absent
- Performance on edge cases unproven—system's robustness to deepfakes, cross-lingual content, and coordinated disinformation campaigns remains unknown

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Tool-augmented MLLM reasoning for grounding outputs in external evidence is well-established in broader literature (e.g., RAMA framework)
- **Medium confidence**: Six-stage pipeline architecture appears sound based on related multi-agent systems, though specific stage boundaries are not fully specified
- **Low confidence**: Claims about comprehensive multimedia verification capability are not substantiated by quantitative evidence

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study**: Disable each verification tool individually and measure impact on verification accuracy across 20+ challenge dataset samples to quantify each tool's contribution

2. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the complete system on at least two additional multimedia misinformation datasets (e.g., MediaEval, FakeNewsNet) to assess generalization beyond the challenge sample

3. **Error case analysis**: Run the system on 10 known misinformation examples and 10 verified authentic examples, then perform detailed failure mode analysis by stage and tool to identify systematic weaknesses
