# Ensemble Elastic DQN: A novel multi-step ensemble approach to address overestimation in deep value-based reinforcement learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.05716
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05716
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: EEDQN consistently outperformed baseline DQN methods and matched or exceeded state-of-the-art ensemble DQNs in final returns on most MinAtar environments

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm that addresses overestimation bias and improves sample efficiency by combining ensemble learning with elastic multi-step returns. EEDQN dynamically adjusts the bootstrap horizon based on state similarity and uses different aggregation strategies for single-step (mean) and multi-step (minimum) experiences to mitigate overestimation while maintaining exploration. The algorithm was evaluated against standard and ensemble DQN variants on the MinAtar benchmark, demonstrating consistently robust performance across all tested environments.

## Method Summary
EEDQN is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that combines ensemble learning with elastic multi-step returns. The algorithm uses an ensemble of N=2 networks that dynamically adjust their bootstrap horizon based on state similarity, calculated as the absolute difference of average Q-values between consecutive states. For single-step experiences (d=0), EEDQN uses mean aggregation of target Q-values, while for multi-step experiences (d>0), it uses minimum aggregation. The threshold for continuing multi-step accumulation is computed as h = Avg(B) + StdDev(B)/sqrt(n), where B is a buffer storing state differences. The algorithm was implemented using MushroomRL and evaluated on the MinAtar benchmark with standard DQN hyperparameters.

## Key Results
- EEDQN achieved consistently robust performance across all five MinAtar environments (Seaquest, SpaceInvaders, Asterix, Breakout, Freeway)
- EEDQN was the only algorithm that successfully predicted well below the theoretical maximum Q-value across all environments, demonstrating effective overestimation mitigation
- EEDQN matched or exceeded state-of-the-art ensemble DQNs in final returns on most MinAtar environments
- The algorithm showed superior sample efficiency compared to baseline DQN methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EEDQN addresses overestimation bias through a two-pronged approach: ensemble learning reduces variance in Q-value estimates by maintaining multiple independent networks, while the minimum aggregation for multi-step returns prevents optimistic bias from propagating through longer trajectories. The elastic step mechanism dynamically adjusts the bootstrap horizon based on state similarity, allowing the algorithm to automatically determine when the environment dynamics change enough to warrant resetting the multi-step accumulation. By using mean aggregation for single-step targets and minimum for multi-step targets, EEDQN balances the need for accurate value estimation with the prevention of overestimation bias.

## Foundational Learning

**Ensemble Learning**
- Why needed: Reduces variance in Q-value estimates and mitigates overestimation bias
- Quick check: Compare performance with single network vs. ensemble of size N

**Multi-step Returns**
- Why needed: Improves sample efficiency by propagating rewards through multiple time steps
- Quick check: Monitor the distribution of accumulated steps (d) during training

**Overestimation Bias**
- Why needed: Common problem in Q-learning where max operator leads to systematically inflated value estimates
- Quick check: Compare maximum predicted Q-values against theoretical bounds

**State Similarity Measures**
- Why needed: Determines when to continue or reset multi-step accumulation based on environment dynamics
- Quick check: Analyze the distribution of z values (state difference metric) during training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: State Observations -> Q-Networks (N=2) -> State Difference Calculation -> Elastic Step Logic -> Replay Buffer -> Target Aggregation (Mean/Min) -> Q-Value Updates

**Critical Path**: Experience collection → State difference calculation → Threshold comparison → Multi-step accumulation or storage → Batch sampling → Target computation (mean for single-step, min for multi-step) → Network updates

**Design Tradeoffs**: The use of minimum aggregation for multi-step returns effectively prevents overestimation but may introduce underestimation bias if ensemble members diverge significantly. The dynamic threshold mechanism adds computational overhead but provides adaptive control over the trade-off between sample efficiency and bias prevention.

**Failure Signatures**: If d values are consistently 0, the threshold logic is triggering too easily, forcing single-step updates. If Q-values significantly lag behind actual returns, the minimum aggregation may be too aggressive, causing underestimation bias.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Monitor the distribution of accumulated steps (d) during training to verify the threshold logic is functioning correctly
2. Compare maximum predicted Q-values against theoretical bounds to confirm overestimation mitigation
3. Analyze the performance difference between using mean vs. minimum aggregation for multi-step returns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study is limited to the MinAtar benchmark, which may not generalize to more complex environments
- Only N=2 ensemble members were evaluated, leaving questions about scalability to larger ensembles
- Critical hyperparameters like epsilon decay schedule and network architecture details were not fully specified

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The core algorithmic contribution and overestimation mitigation claims are well-supported by empirical evidence
- Medium Confidence: Sample efficiency improvements are convincingly demonstrated, but generalizability beyond MinAtar needs validation
- Medium Confidence: Superiority over baseline methods is established, but comparisons to state-of-the-art ensemble methods show mixed results

## Next Checks
1. Conduct architectural sensitivity analysis by varying Q-network depth, width, and activation functions to assess implementation impact
2. Extend evaluation to diverse benchmarks including Atari 2600 games via Arcade Learning Environment and continuous control tasks
3. Evaluate EEDQN with larger ensemble sizes (N=4, N=8) to determine scalability and computational efficiency trade-offs
