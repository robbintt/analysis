# Low Tensor-Rank Adaptation of Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.06153
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06153
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Demonstrates that KAN parameter updates for transfer learning exhibit low tensor-rank structure, enabling efficient adaptation via Tucker decomposition.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LoTRA (Low Tensor-Rank Adaptation), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) that leverages the low Tucker-rank structure of parameter updates when transferring between similar tasks. The authors show that KANs can be adapted to new PDEs or functions using a small core tensor and transformation matrices, reducing parameters by up to 10× compared to full fine-tuning while maintaining accuracy. The approach is validated on various PDEs including elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations, with systematic studies on compression ratio effects and learning rate strategies.

## Method Summary
LoTRA adapts pre-trained KANs by decomposing the parameter update tensor into a low-rank Tucker representation. The method freezes the pre-trained tensor $A_{pt}$ and adds trainable components $\{G, U^{(1)}, U^{(2)}, U^{(3)}\}$ where $G$ is a core tensor and $U$ matrices transform along each mode. The adaptation follows $A_{ft} = A_{pt} + G \times_1 U^{(1)} \times_2 U^{(2)} \times_3 U^{(3)}$. The authors theoretically analyze the expressiveness of this approximation and derive learning rate strategies that scale differently for each component to ensure efficient training. Implementation requires careful initialization of $U^{(2)}$ based on the initial gradient direction.

## Key Results
- KAN parameter updates for transfer learning exhibit rapid singular value decay, enabling effective low-rank compression
- LoTRA achieves 10× parameter reduction while maintaining accuracy on elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs
- Theoretically derived differential learning rates significantly improve convergence compared to uniform rates
- Slim KAN variants (without pre-training) show regularization benefits but require higher compression ratios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The update tensors required to adapt a pre-trained KAN to a new task exhibit an inherent low Tucker-rank structure, allowing for efficient compression.
- **Mechanism**: By treating the parameter update (difference between target and pre-trained tensors) as a tensor, Tucker decomposition isolates the essential "task-specific" variance into a small core tensor and transformation matrices. This allows the model to learn the adaptation using significantly fewer parameters than the full tensor.
- **Core assumption**: The structural similarity between tasks (e.g., physical parameters in PDEs) results in parameter updates that lie on a low-dimensional manifold.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "evidence on the low tensor-rank structure in KAN parameter updates"; [section III-A] Figure 1 shows rapid decay in singular values for fine-tuned updates.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Efficient training of LoTRA components requires differential learning rates; uniform learning rates lead to inefficient gradient updates.
- **Mechanism**: The gradient magnitude scales differently for the core tensor ($G$) versus the transformation matrices ($U$) based on input dimensions ($n$) and basis function counts ($n_d$). Specifically, the transformation matrices require learning rates inversely proportional to their associated dimension sizes to maintain a stable step size ($\Theta(1)$) relative to the model scale.
- **Core assumption**: The first-order linearization of the function value change accurately predicts training progress (Definition 1).
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "using identical learning rates across all components leads to inefficient training"; [section IV-B, Theorem 2] Proves efficient training is impossible with uniform rates and specifies: $\eta_0 = \Theta(1)$, $\eta_1 = \Theta(n^{-1})$, $\eta_2 = \Theta(1)$, $\eta_3 = \Theta(n_d^{-1})$.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: LoTRA preserves expressiveness by bounding the approximation error relative to the "tail" singular values of the parameter update tensor.
- **Mechanism**: Theorem 1 establishes that the approximation error is bounded by the sum of squared discarded singular values. If the "energy" of the update is concentrated in the top singular values (low rank), the Tucker approximation ($A + G \times U$) closely approximates the full fine-tuning target.
- **Core assumption**: Basis functions are uniformly bounded and smooth (Assumption 1).
- **Evidence anchors**: [section IV-A, Theorem 1] Explicitly bounds $\|\Psi_{ft}(x) - \Psi_{tg}(x)\|^2$ by discarded singular values.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: **Tucker Decomposition (HOSVD)**
  - **Why needed here**: This is the mathematical engine of LoTRA. You must understand how a 3rd-order tensor (KAN parameters) factors into a core tensor $G$ and three transformation matrices $U$.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain why the parameter count of $\{G, U^{(1)}, U^{(2)}, U^{(3)}\}$ can be smaller than the original tensor $A$?

- **Concept**: **Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs)**
  - **Why needed here**: Unlike MLPs, KANs learn activation functions on edges, represented as parameter tensors (spline coefficients) rather than weight matrices.
  - **Quick check question**: In a KAN layer, what do the dimensions $n_\ell$, $n_{\ell+1}$, and $n_d$ represent in the parameter tensor $A_\ell$? (Input dim, Output dim, Basis functions).

- **Concept**: **Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML)**
  - **Why needed here**: The paper targets solving PDEs. You need to know that the network acts as a surrogate for the PDE solution, minimizing residuals rather than just data fitting.
  - **Quick check question**: Why is "transfer learning" valuable when solving a *class* of PDEs with varying parameters (e.g., $\lambda$)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Frozen Core Tensor $A_{pt}$ -> LoTRA Adapter $\{G, U^{(1)}, U^{(2)}, U^{(3)}\}$ -> Output $A_{ft} = A_{pt} + G \times_1 U^{(1)} \times_2 U^{(2)} \times_3 U^{(3)}$

- **Critical path**:
  1. Pre-train a standard KAN on a source PDE to get $A_{pt}$
  2. Initialize LoTRA components ($G=0$; $U^{(1)}, U^{(3)}$ random scaled; $U^{(2)}$ aligned with initial gradient $v_0$ as per Eq. 8)
  3. Set differential learning rates ($\eta_1 \propto 1/n, \eta_3 \propto 1/n_d$)
  4. Fine-tune on target PDE

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Compression Ratio (cr) vs. Expressiveness**: High $cr$ (smaller core) saves memory but risks failing on complex tasks (e.g., Hyperbolic PDEs)
  - **Learning Rate Complexity**: The theoretically optimal rates require tuning per-layer dimensions ($n_\ell$), adding hyperparameter overhead compared to standard Adam tuning

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Divergence/Instability**: Occurs if using uniform learning rates for deep layers where $n$ is large (violates Theorem 2)
  - **Stagnation**: Validation error drops but training loss remains high $\to$ Compression ratio is too aggressive (Core tensor too small)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **LR Validation**: Replicate the "LR-1" vs "LR-4" experiment on the Elliptic PDE to confirm that the theoretical differential rates converge faster than uniform rates
  2. **Rank Analysis**: Visualize the singular values of a fully fine-tuned KAN update vs. LoTRA's approximation to ensure the chosen "cr" captures the signal
  3. **Slim KAN Baseline**: Train a "Slim KAN" (LoTRA with zero pre-train) on a simple function fitting task to verify that the low-rank structure acts as regularization and prevents overfitting to noise

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Does the efficacy of LoTRA generalize to non-scientific transfer learning tasks, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) or large-scale computer vision, beyond the tested physics-informed domains?
  - **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "Although our study mainly focuses on fine-tuning KANs using LoTRA for solving various PDEs, further exploration of LoTRA for broader transfer learning tasks remains an important direction."
  - **Why unresolved**: The paper's experiments focus almost exclusively on solving PDEs (elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic) and simple function representation, leaving the applicability to other domains untested.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Empirical evaluations of LoTRA on standard NLP or vision transfer learning benchmarks (e.g., GLUE, CIFAR-100) showing competitive performance against full fine-tuning or LoRA.

- **Open Question 2**: Can the theoretically derived learning rate scaling strategy be improved or adapted for adaptive optimization algorithms like Adam, rather than just vanilla gradient descent?
  - **Basis in paper**: [inferred] Theorem 2 provides a specific learning rate selection strategy based on a theoretical analysis of vanilla gradient descent ($\eta_1 \propto n^{-1}$, etc.). However, the experiments utilize the Adam optimizer, creating a theoretical gap between the analysis and implementation.
  - **Why unresolved**: The theoretical guarantees for efficient training rely on assumptions specific to gradient descent dynamics, which do not directly transfer to the adaptive moment estimation used in Adam.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: A theoretical extension of Theorem 2 to adaptive optimizers, or ablation studies comparing the derived scaling laws against standard learning rate schedules within Adam.

- **Open Question 3**: How does LoTRA integrate into complex deep learning architectures, such as Transformer-KAN hybrids or Convolutional KANs, regarding convergence speed and stability?
  - **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Conclusion suggests, "Future research could... explore its practical integration into more complex deep learning architectures."
  - **Why unresolved**: The paper primarily validates LoTRA on three-layer KANs and a simple ResNet-KAN hybrid. The interaction between tensor decomposition and the complex skip connections or attention mechanisms in state-of-the-art architectures is unknown.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Architectures combining LoTRA with attention mechanisms (Transformers) or deep residual blocks, demonstrating stable training dynamics and parameter efficiency.

## Limitations

- **Limited Scope**: All experiments involve transferring within PDE families with similar physics, leaving effectiveness for truly distinct tasks untested
- **Theoretical Gap**: The learning rate theory is derived for vanilla gradient descent but experiments use Adam optimizer
- **Compression Tradeoff**: The relationship between compression ratio and approximation error is demonstrated but not systematically explored across diverse PDE families

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The theoretical framework for Tucker decomposition in KANs is mathematically sound; the error bound in Theorem 1 is rigorous given stated assumptions
- **Medium Confidence**: The empirical demonstrations on PDE transfer learning are convincing but limited in scope; the learning rate theory is sound but could benefit from broader validation
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of findings to non-PDE applications and truly distinct task pairs; the robustness of the approach to different KAN architectures and basis functions

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Apply LoTRA to transfer between fundamentally different PDE types (e.g., Elliptic → Hyperbolic) or between PDEs and non-PDE tasks (e.g., image classification) to test the limits of low-rank adaptation

2. **Systematic Compression Study**: Conduct a comprehensive ablation across multiple compression ratios (cr ∈ {1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16}) and multiple PDE families, measuring both approximation error and computational efficiency to establish practical guidelines

3. **Learning Rate Ablation**: Systematically vary the learning rate ratios (η₁/η₀, η₃/η₀) around the theoretically optimal values across different KAN architectures and task difficulties to quantify the sensitivity to the theoretical prescriptions and identify when they break down
