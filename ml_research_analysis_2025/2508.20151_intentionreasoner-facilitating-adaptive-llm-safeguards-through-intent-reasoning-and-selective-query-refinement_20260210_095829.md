core_contribution: IntentionReasoner addresses the challenge of balancing safety,
  over-refusal, and utility in LLM safeguards. It introduces a multi-level classification
  system (Completely Unharmful, Borderline Unharmful, Borderline Harmful, Completely
  Harmful) combined with intent reasoning and selective query rewriting to neutralize

# IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.20151
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Primary result:** Achieves up to 99.4% F1 score on safety benchmarks with near-zero over-refusal rates

## Executive Summary
IntentionReasoner introduces a novel approach to LLM safety that balances protection against harmful content with maintaining utility and reducing over-refusal. The system employs multi-level classification (Completely Unharmful, Borderline Unharmful, Borderline Harmful, Completely Harmful) combined with intent reasoning and selective query rewriting. By constructing a comprehensive 163K-sample dataset with intent annotations and safety labels, the approach uses supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with a multi-reward function. The result is a safeguard system that achieves exceptional safety performance while significantly reducing unnecessary rejections of benign queries.

## Method Summary
The IntentionReasoner framework implements a three-stage pipeline: query intent reasoning to classify requests into one of four safety levels, selective query rewriting to neutralize harmful intent while preserving benign objectives, and response generation with safety-integrated outputs. The system is trained on a large-scale dataset of 163,000 samples annotated with both intent classifications and safety labels. The training combines supervised fine-tuning on this dataset with reinforcement learning that optimizes multiple reward signals including safety compliance, response quality, and query preservation. The multi-level classification system allows for nuanced handling of borderline cases rather than binary safe/unsafe decisions.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 99.4% F1 score on safety benchmarks across multiple evaluation datasets
- Reduces over-refusal rates to near zero while maintaining strong safety performance
- Achieves near-zero jailbreak success rates with as low as 1.2% Attack Success Rate (ASR)
- Improves response quality while reducing output length by approximately 20%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its multi-level classification approach that moves beyond binary safe/unsafe decisions. By distinguishing between completely harmless, borderline harmless, borderline harmful, and completely harmful queries, the system can apply appropriate interventions at different levels of granularity. The intent reasoning component identifies the underlying purpose of user queries, allowing the system to neutralize harmful intent while preserving benign objectives in borderline cases. The selective query rewriting mechanism transforms potentially harmful requests into safe alternatives without losing the user's original intent, enabling the LLM to generate useful responses even for queries that might otherwise be rejected.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-level safety classification** - Why needed: Binary classification oversimplifies complex safety scenarios and leads to over-refusal. Quick check: Verify the four-tier system correctly categorizes diverse query types.
- **Intent reasoning** - Why needed: Understanding user intent enables nuanced handling of ambiguous or borderline requests. Quick check: Test intent extraction accuracy on mixed-purpose queries.
- **Selective query rewriting** - Why needed: Allows transformation of harmful content while preserving useful information. Quick check: Validate that rewritten queries maintain original intent while removing harmful elements.
- **Reinforcement learning with multi-reward optimization** - Why needed: Balances competing objectives of safety, utility, and response quality. Quick check: Confirm reward function weights appropriately balance safety vs. utility trade-offs.
- **Large-scale annotated dataset construction** - Why needed: High-quality training data is essential for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. Quick check: Validate annotation consistency and coverage across safety categories.
- **Cross-model safety evaluation** - Why needed: Ensures robustness across different LLM architectures and capabilities. Quick check: Test safety performance across multiple base models.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Query → Intent Reasoner → Safety Classifier → Query Rewriter → LLM → Response Filter → Output

**Critical Path:** The core safety pipeline flows from intent reasoning through classification to selective rewriting, with each component building on the previous stage's output. The intent reasoner's classification directly determines whether and how the query is rewritten before reaching the LLM.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The system trades computational overhead (additional classification and rewriting steps) for improved safety-utility balance. The multi-level approach adds complexity compared to binary classification but enables more nuanced handling of borderline cases. The reliance on GPT-4o for data annotation introduces potential centralization risks but ensures high-quality labels.

**Failure Signatures:** Over-refusal may indicate overly conservative classification thresholds. Safety failures suggest inadequate intent reasoning or rewriting. Response quality degradation points to aggressive query transformation. Performance degradation could indicate insufficient fine-tuning on diverse query patterns.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test classification accuracy on a held-out set of mixed-purpose queries to verify intent reasoning capabilities
2. Evaluate rewritten query preservation by comparing original and transformed queries' core intent
3. Measure safety performance on adversarial prompts designed to bypass intent classification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on English language queries, raising concerns about cross-lingual generalization
- Reliance on GPT-4o for data annotation introduces potential bias and limits transparency
- Dataset construction depends heavily on proprietary model outputs rather than human-annotated ground truth
- Limited testing against adaptive adversarial attacks and dynamic red-teaming approaches
- Real-world deployment performance on distribution shift and emerging attack patterns remains unverified

## Confidence
- Safety performance claims: **High** - Well-supported by benchmark results and multiple evaluation datasets
- Over-refusal reduction: **High** - Quantitatively demonstrated with specific metrics
- Generalization across domains: **Medium** - Limited by evaluation scope and language coverage
- Adversarial robustness: **Low** - Not thoroughly tested against adaptive attacks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-lingual evaluation using non-English harmful content datasets to assess language generalization
2. Implement dynamic red-teaming with adaptive adversarial attacks to test robustness against evolving jailbreak techniques
3. Deploy in controlled real-world settings with live user traffic to measure performance on distribution shift and emerging attack patterns
