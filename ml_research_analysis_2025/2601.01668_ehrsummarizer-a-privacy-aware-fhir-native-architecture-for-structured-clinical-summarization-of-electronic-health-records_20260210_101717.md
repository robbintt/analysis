# EHRSummarizer: A Privacy-Aware, FHIR-Native Architecture for Structured Clinical Summarization of Electronic Health Records

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01668
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01668
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: FHIR-native reference architecture for structured clinical summarization of EHRs with privacy-aware constraints

## Executive Summary
EHRSummarizer is a reference architecture designed to generate structured clinical summaries from electronic health records while maintaining privacy constraints. The system retrieves high-yield FHIR R4 resources, normalizes them into a clinical context package, and produces summaries constrained to retrieved evidence. It supports both hosted and local model deployment options to accommodate organizational privacy requirements. The architecture explicitly avoids generating diagnostic or treatment recommendations and omits unsupported content from summaries.

## Method Summary
The architecture implements a FHIR-native approach for clinical summarization, retrieving targeted high-yield FHIR R4 resources and normalizing them into a clinical context package. The system generates structured summaries based on retrieved evidence while maintaining privacy constraints. It offers flexibility in model deployment through both hosted and local options. The summarization process is designed to be constrained to evidence in the retrieved context, avoiding unsupported content generation.

## Key Results
- Prototype demonstrations show end-to-end functionality in synthetic/test FHIR environments
- System supports both hosted and local model deployment to align with organizational privacy requirements
- Evaluation plan focuses on faithfulness, omission risk, temporal correctness, usability, and operational monitoring

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The architecture leverages FHIR-native data retrieval to ensure structured, standardized access to clinical information. By constraining summarization to retrieved evidence and avoiding unsupported content generation, the system maintains privacy and reduces hallucination risks. The dual deployment model (hosted and local) allows organizations to balance functionality with privacy requirements. The structured approach to summarization ensures consistency and reproducibility in clinical documentation.

## Foundational Learning
- FHIR R4 resource retrieval: Critical for accessing standardized clinical data; quick check: verify resource types and data completeness
- Clinical context normalization: Essential for creating coherent summaries; quick check: validate context package structure
- Privacy-aware constraints: Fundamental to ethical deployment; quick check: audit summary content against source data
- Evidence-based summarization: Core to maintaining accuracy; quick check: compare generated summaries with source evidence

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
FHIR Server -> Context Packager -> Privacy Filter -> Summary Generator -> Output Formatter

**Critical Path:**
Resource retrieval → Context normalization → Privacy filtering → Summary generation → Output formatting

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Privacy vs. completeness: Strict filtering may omit clinically relevant information
- Local vs. hosted deployment: Local offers better privacy but requires more resources
- Structured vs. narrative output: Structured summaries ensure consistency but may be less flexible

**Failure Signatures:**
- Incomplete context packages due to resource access issues
- Privacy filter blocking legitimate clinical content
- Summary generator producing inconsistent outputs
- Output formatting errors in structured data representation

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test resource retrieval from synthetic FHIR server with various query patterns
2. Validate privacy filter behavior with controlled test cases
3. Benchmark summary generation quality using standardized clinical scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper outlines evaluation plans focused on faithfulness, omission risk, temporal correctness, usability, and operational monitoring, but does not specify particular open questions beyond these planned evaluations.

## Limitations
- Validated only in synthetic/test FHIR environments with no clinical deployment
- Lacks empirical evaluation of performance metrics like faithfulness and omission risk
- No clinical outcomes data or provider usability testing reported
- Privacy-aware constraints effectiveness untested in real-world settings

## Confidence
- High confidence in architectural design and technical implementation details
- Medium confidence in privacy-aware claims based on design rather than empirical validation
- Medium confidence in stated benefits pending real-world clinical evaluation
- Low confidence in clinical impact claims as no clinical studies performed

## Next Checks
1. Conduct field validation in live clinical environments to assess real-world performance and usability
2. Perform systematic evaluation of faithfulness, omission risk, and temporal correctness using standardized clinical scenarios
3. Execute clinical workflow studies with healthcare providers to measure impact on efficiency and decision support
