# Enhancing kelp forest detection in remote sensing images using crowdsourced labels with Mixed Vision Transformers and ConvNeXt segmentation models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.14001
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14001
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: 73% kelp pixel detection with low false positives using crowdsourced labels and ensemble of MIT and ConvNeXt models

## Executive Summary
This study presents a method for detecting kelp forests using Landsat satellite imagery combined with crowdsourced labels and advanced deep learning models, specifically Mixed Vision Transformers (MIT) and ConvNeXt segmentation architectures. The approach leverages crowdsourced data to overcome the challenge of obtaining large-scale expert-labeled datasets in ecological research, demonstrating that such labeling can be a viable alternative to traditional methods. The methodology achieved high accuracy, identifying approximately 73% of kelp forest pixels while maintaining low false positives. The integration of U-Net with MIT encoders proved most effective, with UpperNet and ConvNeXt also delivering strong results.

## Method Summary
The methodology uses Landsat satellite imagery with 7 spectral bands (Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1, cloud mask, DEM) and crowdsourced labels from citizen scientists. The model ensemble combines 4 MIT encoders (b2/b3/b4) with U-Net decoders and 3 ConvNeXt encoders with UpperNet decoders. Input channels are reduced to SWIR1, NIR, and Green for training, with DEM used in post-processing for land-sea masking. The models are trained using dice loss, AdamW optimizer with cosine annealing scheduler, and various image sizes (512-768). Test-time augmentation includes 4 flips, with a 0.43 probability threshold applied to ensemble predictions. The land mask is applied using DEM altitude data to eliminate false positives on land.

## Key Results
- Approximately 73% of kelp forest pixels were identified while maintaining low false positives
- U-Net with MIT encoders emerged as the best segmentation architecture
- Key Landsat bands including SWIR1 and NIR were crucial for accurate segmentation
- Altitude data in postprocessing eliminated false positives on land
- Ensembling MIT and ConvNeXt models improved validation scores by 0.006 units

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Infrared Spectral Signatures Exploit Vegetation Physiology
- **Claim:** SWIR1 and NIR bands capture chlorophyll absorption and moisture content patterns that distinguish kelp from open water.
- **Mechanism:** Healthy vegetation reflects NIR strongly due to internal leaf scattering while absorbing visible light via chlorophyll. SWIR1 responds to moisture content. The combination creates a spectral signature that discriminates kelp canopy (floating vegetation) from seawater, even in turbid coastal waters.
- **Core assumption:** Kelp canopy spectral signatures are sufficiently distinct from water and other features at 30m resolution.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Key Landsat bands, such as ShortWave InfraRed (SWIR1) and Near-InfraRed (NIR), were crucial"
  - [section 2.1] "A plant leaf typically has a low reflectance in the visible spectral region because of strong absorption by chlorophyll, a relatively high reflectance in the near-infrared"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support for kelp-specific NIR/SWIR mechanisms; related papers address forest carbon estimation with different spectral approaches.
- **Break condition:** If kelp is submerged beyond surface reach, NIR reflectance drops sharply and the mechanism degrades.

### Mechanism 2: Transformer-ConvNeXt Ensemble Captures Complementary Spatial Patterns
- **Claim:** Ensembling MIT (transformer) and ConvNeXt (convolutional) encoders improves segmentation by combining global context with local feature extraction.
- **Mechanism:** MIT encoders (from SegFormer) use self-attention to model long-range dependencies across pixels; ConvNeXt provides strong local convolutional inductive biases. U-Net decoder with skip connections reconstructs fine boundaries from MIT features; UpperNet decoder handles ConvNeXt outputs. Averaging predictions reduces individual model biases.
- **Core assumption:** The two encoder families make independent errors that averaging can reduce.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "combining Mixed Vision Transformers (MIT) with ConvNeXt models... U-Net emerged as the best segmentation architecture"
  - [section 3] "Ensembling four MIT models improved the validation score by 0.004 units and by incorporating the ConvNeXt models further improved the score by 0.002"
  - [corpus] Related segmentation work uses transformers or convnets; corpus does not directly validate this specific hybrid.
- **Break condition:** If both model families share systematic bias on the same image regions (e.g., boundary pixels), ensemble gains diminish.

### Mechanism 3: Elevation-Based Post-Processing Eliminates Land False Positives
- **Claim:** DEM (Digital Elevation Model) thresholding removes predicted kelp on land, providing a measurable boost.
- **Mechanism:** The ASTER DEM band provides altitude in meters. Predictions on pixels above sea level are masked to zero, preventing the model from labeling land as kelp.
- **Core assumption:** DEM alignment with Landsat imagery is accurate; kelp does not occur in intertidal zones at this resolution.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "altitude data was used in postprocessing to eliminate false positives on land"
  - [section 2.4.1] "the DEM band was used in the post processing phase by applying a land-sea mask"
  - [section 3] "Using the raw altimetry data at the post processing phase... gave a high score boost, +0.0058"
  - [corpus] No corpus papers use DEM for kelp specifically; similar coastal masking concepts appear in related remote sensing literature.
- **Break condition:** Misaligned DEM or tidal variation creates false negatives at coastlines.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Semantic Segmentation with U-Net
  - **Why needed here:** U-Net is the core decoder architecture; skip connections preserve spatial detail.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why skip connections help preserve boundary accuracy?

- **Concept:** Vision Transformers (MIT/SegFormer)
  - **Why needed here:** MIT encoders provide global context via self-attention.
  - **Quick check question:** How does self-attention differ from convolution in modeling pixel relationships?

- **Concept:** Spectral Bands in Remote Sensing (NIR/SWIR)
  - **Why needed here:** NIR and SWIR1 are identified as the most important input channels.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might NIR be more useful than visible bands for detecting surface vegetation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Landsat 7 bands (SWIR1, NIR, Green) -> Preprocessing (clip, normalize, ImageNet) -> MIT/ConvNeXt encoders -> U-Net/UpperNet decoders -> Ensemble (averaging) -> DEM land mask -> Output (0.43 threshold)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Select SWIR1 + NIR + Green bands; apply preprocessing (clip to [6000, 24000], normalize).
  2. Train MIT-b2/b3/b4 with U-Net at multiple image sizes (512, 640, 768).
  3. Train ConvNeXt-tiny/base with UpperNet.
  4. Ensemble predictions via averaging; apply DEM mask; threshold at 0.43.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - 80/20 single split vs. k-fold: faster iteration but potentially noisier validation.
  - 3 bands vs. 7: simpler input, but may lose marginal information from other indices (competition winners used additional computed indices).
  - Larger image sizes improve context but amplify annotation noise.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High false positives near coastlines -> DEM misalignment or threshold issues.
  - False negatives at kelp boundaries -> model undertrained on edge cases or resolution-limited.
  - Persistent errors on specific chips -> possible annotation errors in ground truth (e.g., shifted masks).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline MIT-b2 with U-Net on 512x512 images; evaluate Dice on validation split.
  2. Ablate input bands: train with NIR+SWIR1 only vs. NIR+SWIR1+Green; compare validation scores.
  3. Add ConvNeXt-tiny with UpperNet to the ensemble; measure improvement over MIT-only ensemble.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does integrating dynamic environmental data, specifically wave height, enhance kelp detection accuracy compared to spectral and elevation data alone?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "incorporating weather data, such as wave height, as inputs could significantly enhance our methodology’s performance."
- Why unresolved: The current study utilized only spectral bands and static elevation data; environmental weather variables were suggested for future work but not tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies training the model with additional channels for wave height and storm frequency, followed by performance comparison.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the models trained on Falkland Islands imagery generalize effectively to detect kelp forests in other geographic regions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes the dataset is "from a specific area" and suggests "using an even larger and more diverse dataset (including other regions, not just Falkland islands) could increase method’s performance."
- Why unresolved: The training and validation data were restricted to the Falkland Islands, limiting the validation of the model's global applicability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the pre-trained models on labeled satellite imagery from diverse coastal regions (e.g., California, Australia) without retraining.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the precise mechanism behind the performance gain observed when smoothing the altimetry data used for land-sea masking?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors applied a convolution to altimetry data for a slight improvement but state, "It is unclear whether this improvement is due to minor misalignments... a lack of kelp forests in tidal zones, or some other factor."
- Why unresolved: The improvement was empirically observed during post-processing, but the root cause (e.g., correcting geospatial misalignment vs. excluding valid tidal zones) was not isolated.
- What evidence would resolve it: A spatial analysis of prediction differences in tidal zones and a geometric alignment check between the Landsat and ASTER data.

## Limitations

- Primary reliance on crowdsourced labels may contain systematic errors not fully characterized
- Single 80/20 split rather than k-fold validation limits generalizability assessment
- 30m resolution constraint inherently limits detection of smaller or submerged kelp patches
- Model performance on other coastal regions with different environmental conditions remains untested

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The core methodology of using SWIR1 and NIR bands for vegetation discrimination is well-established in remote sensing literature.
- **Medium confidence:** The specific performance metrics (73% pixel detection, Dice score improvements) are well-documented for this dataset but may not generalize.
- **Medium confidence:** The effectiveness of the MIT-ConvNeXt ensemble approach is demonstrated but not extensively validated against other ensemble strategies.

## Next Checks

1. Test model generalization on kelp detection in a different coastal region with distinct environmental conditions and validate against expert-labeled ground truth.
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing performance with full 7-band input versus the 3-band subset to quantify information loss from reduced spectral input.
3. Evaluate temporal consistency by applying the trained model to multi-year Landsat imagery from the same region to assess detection stability across seasons and years.
