# Comparative Analysis of 47 Context-Based Question Answer Models Across 8 Diverse Datasets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00323
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00323
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 47 context-based QA models evaluated across 8 datasets, with ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512 achieving highest accuracy of 43% without fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
This study benchmarks 47 context-based question-answering models from Hugging Face across eight diverse datasets without fine-tuning. The primary finding is that models trained on SQuAD v1 or v2 datasets, particularly ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512, achieved the highest overall accuracy of 43%. Key insights include that model performance decreases with longer answers, context complexity impacts accuracy without clear patterns, and larger models don't guarantee better results. While genetic algorithms combining multiple models showed some improvement, gains were minimal. The study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate base models and datasets for optimal performance in question-answering tasks across different domains.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated 47 context-based question-answering models from Hugging Face across eight diverse datasets without any fine-tuning. Models were assessed using standard accuracy metrics, with particular attention to performance variations based on answer length and context complexity. A genetic algorithm approach was also tested to combine multiple models and potentially improve overall performance. The evaluation focused on baseline performance to establish a comparative framework for understanding model capabilities across different domains and dataset characteristics.

## Key Results
- ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512 achieved the highest overall accuracy of 43%
- Model performance consistently decreases with longer answer lengths
- Larger models do not guarantee better performance compared to smaller models
- Genetic algorithm combinations showed minimal performance improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
This study works by providing a comprehensive baseline evaluation framework that reveals fundamental relationships between model architecture, training data, and performance characteristics. The methodology of testing models without fine-tuning establishes a clear understanding of inherent model capabilities and limitations, while the cross-dataset evaluation reveals how different model architectures handle varying domain complexities. The genetic algorithm approach demonstrates how model combinations can be explored systematically, even if gains are limited in this baseline scenario.

## Foundational Learning
1. Context-based question answering fundamentals
   - Why needed: Essential for understanding the task domain and evaluation criteria
   - Quick check: Can identify question, context, and answer components in sample data

2. Hugging Face model ecosystem
   - Why needed: Necessary for understanding model availability and implementation
   - Quick check: Can load and run inference with at least one QA model

3. Genetic algorithm optimization basics
   - Why needed: Required to understand the model combination approach
   - Quick check: Can implement a simple genetic algorithm for a toy problem

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Datasets -> Question-Answering Models -> Evaluation Pipeline -> Performance Metrics -> Analysis

**Critical Path:**
Model selection -> Dataset loading -> Inference execution -> Accuracy calculation -> Result aggregation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The decision to evaluate without fine-tuning prioritizes baseline comparison fairness over potentially higher absolute performance numbers. This approach reveals inherent model capabilities but may underrepresent some models' true potential when properly adapted to specific datasets.

**Failure Signatures:**
Poor performance on longer answers suggests attention mechanism limitations or context comprehension issues. Minimal genetic algorithm improvements indicate either model redundancy or insufficient optimization parameters.

**First Experiments:**
1. Run inference on a single model with a small subset of one dataset to verify pipeline functionality
2. Compare performance of a single model across two different datasets to observe domain sensitivity
3. Test the genetic algorithm approach with just three models to verify combination methodology

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- All models evaluated without fine-tuning, potentially underrepresenting true performance capabilities
- Context complexity analysis lacked clear patterns, suggesting insufficient statistical power or analysis methods
- Breadth across eight datasets may sacrifice depth needed for domain-specific performance insights

## Confidence
- Overall accuracy findings (High): Standardized evaluation across multiple models and datasets provides robust baseline measurements
- Answer length impact (Medium): Performance degradation with longer answers is observed but underlying mechanisms need exploration
- Model size vs performance relationship (Low): Contradicts typical field expectations and requires additional validation
- Genetic algorithm improvements (Low): Minimal gains suggest either approach refinement needed or evaluation methodology limitations

## Next Checks
1. Re-run the evaluation with fine-tuning for the top 10 performing models on each dataset to establish performance ceilings and compare against baseline results
2. Conduct a more granular analysis of context complexity by categorizing contexts into explicit complexity tiers and performing statistical tests to identify specific complexity factors that impact performance
3. Test the genetic algorithm approach with extended evolutionary cycles and alternative fitness functions to determine if longer optimization can yield more substantial performance improvements
