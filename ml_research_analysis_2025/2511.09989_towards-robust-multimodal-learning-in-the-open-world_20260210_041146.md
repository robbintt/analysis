# Towards Robust Multimodal Learning in the Open World

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.09989
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09989
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Three methods advancing multimodal robustness: compositional generalization (ProCC), modality-missing robustness (C2KD), and hallucination mitigation (SID).

## Executive Summary
This thesis tackles robustness challenges in multimodal learning for open-world environments through three key contributions. ProCC addresses compositional zero-shot learning by modeling cross-primitive interactions via curriculum learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like MIT-States and C-GQA. C2KD ensures robustness under modality-missing conditions through On-the-Fly Selection Distillation and bidirectional knowledge transfer, improving cross-modal knowledge transfer across audio-visual, image-text, and RGB-depth tasks. SID mitigates hallucinations in large vision-language models through Context and Text-aware Token Selection, reducing hallucinations by 12-20% while maintaining generative quality. Together, these methods advance reliable multimodal AI systems capable of handling novel compositions, missing modalities, and modality-prior biases in dynamic real-world scenarios.

## Method Summary
The thesis introduces three distinct approaches to enhance multimodal learning robustness. ProCC employs a three-stage progressive curriculum learning strategy: first training an object classifier, then adding a state classifier with Cross-Primitive Compatibility (CPC) module conditioned on frozen object features, and finally finetuning all components. C2KD implements bidirectional knowledge distillation using Proxy networks and On-the-Fly Selection Distillation (OFSD) to filter samples based on Kendall Rank Correlation, enabling effective cross-modal transfer under modality imbalance. SID provides a training-free approach to hallucination mitigation in LVLMs by identifying and perturbing the least important vision tokens through Context and Text-aware Token Selection (CT2S), then using contrastive decoding to improve output quality. Each method addresses specific robustness challenges: compositional generalization, modality-missing scenarios, and hallucination reduction respectively.

## Key Results
- ProCC achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIT-States and C-GQA benchmarks for compositional zero-shot learning
- C2KD improves cross-modal knowledge transfer across audio-visual, image-text, and RGB-depth tasks with bidirectional distillation
- SID reduces hallucinations by 12-20% in large vision-language models while maintaining generative quality through training-free token selection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methods work by addressing fundamental robustness challenges in multimodal learning. ProCC's progressive curriculum enables the model to first learn stable primitive concepts (objects) before combining them with states, reducing error propagation in novel compositions. C2KD's bidirectional distillation with selective filtering ensures knowledge transfer only when modalities are sufficiently aligned, preventing negative transfer under modality imbalance. SID's token selection strategy exploits the observation that hallucinations often arise from over-reliance on specific vision tokens, and by perturbing these while maintaining fluency through contrastive decoding, it can reduce spurious outputs without requiring model retraining.

## Foundational Learning
- **Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL):** Learning to recognize novel combinations of known primitives (states and objects) without seeing them during training. *Why needed:* Real-world scenarios frequently present unseen object-state pairs. *Quick check:* Can the model predict "ripe apple" when trained only on "green apple" and "ripe banana"?
- **Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation:** Transferring knowledge between different modalities (e.g., audio to visual) when some modalities may be missing. *Why needed:* Real-world sensors often fail or provide incomplete data. *Quick check:* Does the student model maintain performance when one modality is absent?
- **Contrastive Decoding:** Improving generation quality by contrasting original and perturbed model outputs. *Why needed:* Standard decoding can amplify hallucinations in LVLMs. *Quick check:* Does the decoded output remain fluent while being more factually accurate?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** ResNet-18 Encoder -> MLP Classifiers (ProCC) | Audio/Visual Encoders -> Proxy Networks -> KD Loss (C2KD) | LLaVA/InstructBLIP -> Token Selection Hook -> Contrastive Decoding (SID)
**Critical Path:** ProCC: Encoder → Object Classifier → State Classifier + CPC → Output. C2KD: Source Encoder → Proxy → Student Encoder → KD Loss. SID: LLM → Token Selection → Disturbed Forward → Contrastive Decoding.
**Design Tradeoffs:** ProCC trades increased training complexity for better compositional generalization. C2KD trades potential negative transfer risk for modality-robust performance. SID trades inference speed for hallucination reduction without retraining.
**Failure Signatures:** ProCC: Predicting feasible but incorrect compositions. C2KD: Student accuracy drops below baseline. SID: Degraded fluency or repetitive text.
**First Experiments:** 1) Train ProCC stages sequentially on MIT-States and evaluate compositional accuracy. 2) Implement C2KD on AVE dataset with modality dropout and measure robustness. 3) Apply SID to LLaVA on POPE benchmark and measure hallucination reduction.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Automatic Hyperparameter Selection:** Can an external network be trained to automatically determine optimal pruning ratios and layers for SID in LVLMs, replacing manual configuration?
- **Feature-Based CMKD:** Is it possible to implement effective feature-based cross-modal knowledge distillation despite significant divergence in cross-modal intermediate features?
- **Negative Instruction Generation:** Can CT2S be utilized to automatically generate high-quality negative instructions for robust visual instruction tuning, replacing expensive GPT-4-based methods?

## Limitations
- ProCC relies on ResNet-18 features which may limit scalability to more complex visual domains
- C2KD effectiveness depends heavily on Proxy network architecture and KRC threshold selection
- SID introduces additional inference overhead through contrastive decoding and requires careful tuning of disturbance weight

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The overall methodological frameworks are well-established and logically sound, with empirical improvements over baselines supported by quantitative metrics
- **Medium Confidence:** Specific implementation details for some components are described but may require careful tuning for optimal performance
- **Low Confidence:** The thesis lacks sufficient detail on computational efficiency comparisons and extensive analysis of real-world deployment challenges

## Next Checks
1. **ProCC Ablation Study:** Conduct comprehensive ablation analysis of the three-stage training progression, isolating contributions of each stage to quantify individual and combined effects on compositional generalization performance.

2. **SID Token Selection Robustness:** Test the CT2S token selection mechanism across different LLaVA/InstructBLIP variants to verify generalizability beyond specific configurations and evaluate impact on generation speed.

3. **C2KD Negative Transfer Analysis:** Perform detailed failure analysis on samples where negative transfer occurs, examining whether the KRC filtering threshold is universally optimal or requires task-specific adjustment.
