# Multi-Class Segmentation of Aortic Branches and Zones in Computed Tomography Angiography: The AortaSeg24 Challenge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.05330
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05330
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: First large-scale benchmark for multi-class aortic segmentation; top algorithm achieves DSC 0.782, NSD 0.817 on 40 test cases

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the AortaSeg24 Challenge, introducing the first large-scale dataset for multi-class segmentation of aortic branches and zones in CTA scans. The dataset includes 100 CTA volumes with expert annotations for 23 clinically relevant classes. A cascaded framework using nnU-Net with residual encoders (ResEnc) achieved the best performance, demonstrating significant advances in automated aortic segmentation that could support precise clinical measurements and treatment planning.

## Method Summary
The top-performing method (A1) used a cascaded nnU-Net framework with ResEncM and ResEncL architectures. The approach consisted of a coarse localization stage (downsampled to 1.9mm) followed by a fine segmentation stage (1.0mm isotropic). Five models were trained with 5-fold cross-validation, using BCE + Dice loss, SGD optimizer with initial LR 0.01, and extensive data augmentation (excluding mirroring for anatomical consistency). The ensemble approach achieved mean DSC of 0.782 and NSD of 0.817 across 40 test cases.

## Key Results
- Mean Dice score of 0.782 and NSD of 0.817 across 40 test cases
- Cascaded framework with ResEnc architectures outperformed single-stage approaches
- Anatomically-constrained augmentation (no mirroring) improved laterality accuracy
- Dataset and code publicly available at https://aortaseg24.grand-challenge.org

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cascaded Region-of-Interest (ROI) Segregation
The cascaded framework improves multi-class accuracy by first localizing the aortic region at low resolution, then performing fine-grained segmentation on the cropped volume. This reduces background noise and allows the model to focus computational resources on the anatomy of interest. The critical assumption is that the coarse stage can reliably capture the full aortic extent without missing small branches.

### Mechanism 2: Anisotropic Receptive Fields via Residual Encoders
Replacing standard U-Net encoders with deep residual encoders (ResEnc) captures tubular vascular structures more effectively through larger receptive fields. The residual connections enable deeper networks without vanishing gradients, allowing the model to understand connectivity between aortic root and distal zones simultaneously.

### Mechanism 3: Anatomically-Constrained Augmentation
Disabling geometric augmentations like mirroring preserves physiological reality critical for correctly labeling left/right branches. Medical images have fixed laterality, and mirroring creates impossible anatomies that confuse the classifier. The model relies on absolute spatial coordinates to distinguish between symmetric structures.

## Foundational Learning

- **nnU-Net (Self-configuring Framework):** Automatically configures patch size, batch size, and architecture based on dataset fingerprinting. Essential for replicating results without manual hyperparameter tuning. Quick check: How does nnU-Net determine optimal patch size for 3D volumes?

- **3D Semantic Segmentation vs. Instance Segmentation:** The challenge segments 23 classes as distinct semantic labels, distinguishing between branches and zones rather than simply isolating the aorta. Quick check: Can two different classes occupy the same voxel in this dataset?

- **Resampling and Spacing:** All data resampled to 1x1x1mm isotropic spacing, with coarse stage using 1.9mm. Managing voxel spacing correctly preserves geometric relationships necessary for segmentation. Quick check: Why would a model resample to lower resolution (1.9mm) for first stage?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input 3D CTA Volume (1mm iso) -> Stage 1 (Coarse: 3D nnU-Net ResEnc) -> Bounding Box Generator -> Stage 2 (Fine: 3D nnU-Net ResEnc) -> 23-class mask
- **Critical path:** Interface between Stage 1 and Stage 2 - bounding box must be loose enough to account for registration errors but tight enough to reduce GPU memory load
- **Design tradeoffs:** ResEncL vs. ResEncM (accuracy vs. VRAM), cascaded vs. single stage (accuracy vs. complexity), mirroring (laterality accuracy vs. training data size)
- **Failure signatures:** Zone bleeding (Zone 1 vs Innominate), missing branches (small vessels cropped), laterality swap (left vs right renal artery confusion)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline validation with 3D U-Net on 50 training cases, 2) Ablation study on mirroring augmentation impact, 3) Cascaded vs. single stage comparison on cropped vs. full volume

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. How robust are the algorithms when applied to aortic pathologies outside the training distribution, such as Type A dissections or aneurysms?
2. Does high segmentation overlap translate directly into clinically acceptable accuracy for automated cross-sectional diameter measurements?
3. Can these models maintain high performance when applied to multi-center data with heterogeneous imaging protocols and different modalities like 4D flow MRI?

## Limitations
- Dataset restricted to uncomplicated type B aortic dissections, limiting applicability to other aortic conditions
- Reliance on single imaging modality (CTA) and consistent protocols
- No quantification of cascaded ROI strategy's robustness to registration errors

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Cascaded ROI segregation improves multi-class segmentation accuracy by reducing background noise
- **Medium Confidence:** Residual encoders capture vascular topology better than standard U-Net due to increased receptive fields
- **Medium Confidence:** Anatomically-constrained augmentation prevents impossible anatomies and improves laterality classification

## Next Checks

1. Run controlled ablation study comparing training with and without mirroring augmentation to measure impact on left/right branch classification accuracy
2. Implement failure analysis pipeline examining per-class DSC scores to identify systematic confusion between adjacent structures
3. Test cascaded framework's robustness by intentionally introducing coarse-stage localization errors and measuring impact on fine-stage segmentation quality
