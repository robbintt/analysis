# Concept-Centric Token Interpretation for Vector-Quantized Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00698
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00698

- Primary result: Introduces CORTEX framework achieving Top-5 classification accuracies exceeding 73% for concept extraction and enabling interpretable image editing

## Executive Summary
This paper presents CORTEX, a novel framework for interpreting Vector-Quantized Generative Models (VQGMs) by identifying concept-specific token combinations. The framework addresses the interpretability challenge in VQGMs by mapping codebook tokens to semantic concepts through an Information Extractor. CORTEX provides both sample-level and codebook-level explanations, enabling researchers to understand which tokens are important in generating specific images and how token combinations represent broader concepts. The method demonstrates substantial improvements over baseline approaches in concept extraction and token interpretation, while also enabling practical applications such as targeted image editing and bias detection in generative models.

## Method Summary
CORTEX employs a two-stage approach to interpret VQGMs. First, an Information Extractor maps codebook tokens to semantic concepts using cross-attention mechanisms with a frozen pretrained vision-language model (VL-Model). The Information Extractor computes attention scores between codebook tokens and concept-related text embeddings, then applies class-balanced sampling to create a balanced dataset for training. For sample-level explanation, the framework identifies token importance scores by measuring the impact of removing individual tokens on the target concept probability. For codebook-level explanation, CORTEX optimizes token combinations representing specific concepts by treating the concept score as a reward function and optimizing token sampling probabilities through a reward function and sampling probabilities approach. The framework demonstrates effectiveness across multiple pretrained VQGMs and enables applications beyond interpretability, including targeted image editing and bias detection.

## Key Results
- Achieves Top-5 classification accuracies exceeding 73% with Information Extractors for concept extraction
- Reduces original label probabilities by up to 36.5% while increasing target label probabilities over 11-fold compared to baselines
- Demonstrates systematic bias detection, revealing that tokens associated with certain demographics appear significantly more frequently than others in neutral prompts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CORTEX works by establishing a clear mapping between codebook tokens and semantic concepts through the Information Extractor. The cross-attention mechanism between codebook tokens and concept-related text embeddings allows the model to learn which tokens are semantically related to which concepts. By optimizing token combinations for specific concepts, the framework can identify the minimal set of tokens needed to represent or manipulate a concept in generated images. The sample-level explanation approach effectively identifies which tokens contribute most to a specific image's generation, while the codebook-level approach discovers general patterns of token usage for concepts across the dataset.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Image -> VQGM Encoder -> Codebook Tokens -> Information Extractor -> Concept Scores -> Sample-Level/ Codebook-Level Analysis

Critical Path: VQGM Generation -> Codebook Token Extraction -> Information Extractor Training -> Concept Extraction -> Token Optimization

Design Tradeoffs: The framework balances between interpretability and computational efficiency by using frozen VL-models for concept extraction rather than training from scratch. The choice between sample-level and codebook-level explanations provides flexibility for different use cases.

Failure Signatures: Poor concept extraction may indicate insufficient training data for the Information Extractor or inadequate concept definitions. Token optimization failures could result from improper reward function design or convergence issues in the optimization process.

3 First Experiments:
1. Test Information Extractor classification accuracy on a held-out validation set of concept-token pairs
2. Verify sample-level token importance scores by removing top-ranked tokens and measuring concept score degradation
3. Validate codebook-level optimization by generating images with optimized token combinations and checking concept representation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions including how to extend CORTEX to other types of generative models beyond VQGMs, how to handle more complex or abstract concepts that may not have clear visual representations, and how to scale the approach to larger codebooks or more diverse concept sets. The authors also note the need for more comprehensive bias detection and mitigation strategies beyond what CORTEX currently provides.

## Limitations
- Performance depends on the quality and diversity of the training data for the Information Extractor
- May struggle with highly abstract or complex concepts that lack clear visual representations
- Computational cost increases with codebook size and concept set complexity

## Confidence
High: Information Extractor achieves Top-5 classification accuracies exceeding 73%, demonstrating reliable concept extraction
Medium: Token optimization effectiveness shows substantial improvements but may vary across different VQGMs and concepts
Medium: Bias detection results are compelling but may require further validation across more diverse datasets

## Next Checks
1. Validate CORTEX performance on a different VQGMs architecture not included in the original experiments
2. Test the framework's ability to handle abstract concepts by creating a benchmark set of complex semantic relationships
3. Evaluate the computational efficiency of the Information Extractor and token optimization processes at scale
