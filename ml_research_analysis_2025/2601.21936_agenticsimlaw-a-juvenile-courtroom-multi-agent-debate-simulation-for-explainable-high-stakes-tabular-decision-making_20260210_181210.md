## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured multi-agent debate framework for transparent high-stakes tabular decision making. The system uses a courtroom-style simulation with prosecutor, defense, and judge agents following a 7-turn interaction protocol, providing complete auditability of reasoning processes. Benchmarking on young adult recidivism prediction using NLSY97 data, the framework was compared against traditional chain-of-thought prompting across 90 model-strategy combinations. Structured multi-agent debate showed more stable and generalizable performance than single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. The framework generates complete interaction transcripts enabling systematic profiling of agent behaviors, though it requires 11-14× more tokens than single-turn prompting. Results demonstrate that while specialized statistical models and larger commercial LLMs remain superior for tabular tasks, AgenticSimLaw offers unique benefits in transparency, controllability, and auditability for high-stakes applications requiring human oversight.

## Method Summary
AgenticSimLaw implements a 7-turn courtroom debate protocol where prosecutor and defense agents generate competing arguments about recidivism predictions, while a judge agent maintains explicit belief states and delivers the final verdict. The framework processes tabular data converted to natural language format ("feature is value") and runs each case through 100 simulations per model at temperature 0.7. The system logs all public utterances, private strategies, and belief updates, creating complete audit trails. The approach was benchmarked against standard chain-of-thought prompting using zero-shot, CoT, and n=30-shot approaches on the NLSY97 dataset (1412 cases, 27 features) for binary recidivism classification, comparing 16 small ensemble models against commercial LLMs and statistical baselines like XGBoost and TabPFN.

## Key Results
- Structured multi-agent debate shows more stable performance with lower F1 variance (std. dev. 0.04) compared to StandardLLM zero-shot (std. dev. 0.08)
- AgenticSimLaw exhibits stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics than single-agent reasoning approaches
- The framework requires 11-14× more tokens than single-turn prompting but provides complete auditability of reasoning processes
- While specialized statistical models and commercial LLMs remain superior for tabular tasks, AgenticSimLaw offers unique transparency and controllability benefits for high-stakes applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured adversarial role-play improves reasoning stability by forcing explicit argument testing.
- Mechanism: The prosecutor and defense agents generate competing arguments that the judge must reconcile. This 7-turn protocol with rebuttal phases prevents single-agent confirmation bias by requiring each claim to be contested, reducing variance in downstream predictions.
- Core assumption: Adversarial pressure surfaces overlooked features and counterarguments that single-agent reasoning suppresses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics"
  - [results] "AgenticSimLaw exhibits lower variance in F1 scores across models (std. dev. 0.04 vs. 0.08 for StandardLLM zero-shot)"
  - [corpus] iMAD (2511.11306) reports similar findings: Multi-Agent Debate "engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning paths"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Private strategy formulation before public utterances improves argument quality through forced reflection.
- Mechanism: Each agent generates an internal "strategy" before producing their public statement. This reflection phase forces the model to explicitly plan which features to emphasize and how to structure arguments, rather than generating reactive stream-of-consciousness output.
- Core assumption: Intermediate reasoning steps improve output quality even when those steps are discarded.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [methodology] "Each agent formulates private strategies before creating public utterances, incorporating elements of reflection, self-critique, and planning"
  - [related work] References Sreedhar and Chilton (2024) on argumentative LLMs and reflection
  - [corpus] DiMo (2510.16645) uses similar structured debate "among four specialized LLM agents" to enhance interpretability

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Iterative belief updating by a judge agent creates an auditable reasoning trace.
- Mechanism: The judge maintains explicit belief states (prediction, confidence 0-100%, reasoning) and updates them at three checkpoints during the debate. This creates a temporal record showing how evidence shifted the decision, enabling post-hoc audit of which arguments were persuasive.
- Core assumption: Explicit belief states reflect genuine reasoning updates rather than post-hoc rationalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "creates a fully auditable decision-making process"
  - [results] "self-reported prediction confidence does not correlate with performance accuracy, meaning these debate transcripts should be treated as plausible explanations of agent reasoning processes rather than objective evidence of correctness"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) orchestration
  - Why needed here: AgenticSimLaw is not a prompt trick but a system architecture; understanding turn-taking, role assignment, and termination conditions is prerequisite to modifying or debugging it.
  - Quick check question: Can you diagram what happens in Turns 3-4 versus Turns 5-6, and what inputs the judge receives at each belief update?

- Concept: Tabular data limitations in LLMs
  - Why needed here: The paper benchmarks against XGBoost and TabPFN because standard LLM attention mechanisms struggle with non-sequential feature dependencies; understanding this gap explains why MAD doesn't close the performance gap with statistical models.
  - Quick check question: Why does concatenating tabular features into "feature is value" strings fail to preserve relational structure that gradient boosting exploits?

- Concept: Explainability vs. faithfulness distinction
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly warns that transcripts are "plausible" not "faithful" explanations; conflating these leads to over-trusting audit trails.
  - Quick check question: If a judge reports 80% confidence and the prediction is correct, does the transcript prove the reasoning was sound? What else would you need to verify?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Prosecutor agent: Receives case facts → private strategy → opening → rebuttal → closing
  - Defense agent: Observes prosecutor opening → private counter-strategy → opening → rebuttal → closing
  - Judge agent: Observes all utterances → belief update after openings → belief update after rebuttals → final verdict with reasoning
  - Logging layer: Captures all public utterances, private strategies, belief states, and API metadata (tokens, latency)

- Critical path: The judge's final verdict (Turn 7) is the system output. If parsing fails here, the entire simulation is marked incomplete. Parsing robustness is the single most important reliability concern.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - 11-14× token overhead vs. observability: The paper argues this is justified for high-stakes domains but acknowledges it's inefficient for low-stakes tasks
  - 7-turn protocol vs. reviewer-style aggregation: Explicit debate chosen for procedural transparency; alternative designs (belief-based consensus, reduced turns) could cut costs but lose audit fidelity
  - Temperature 0.7 for debate vs. 0.0 for single-turn: Stochasticity enables diverse reasoning paths but introduces variance; deterministic debate would be more reproducible but less exploratory

- Failure signatures:
  - Malformed JSON responses: LLMs fail to produce parseable output; the system uses regex fallback and logs failures
  - Degenerate predictions: Models like Haiku-3.5 predicted "NO" for every case in CoT/n-shot runs, achieving high accuracy (0.71) but F1=0 on imbalanced data
  - Role collapse: Agents produce generic arguments rather than role-specific positions; would manifest as similar argument structures across prosecutor and defense

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run AgenticSimLaw on 10 cases from your domain with full logging; verify the transcript contains all 7 turns and 3 belief updates. Check for malformed responses and measure actual token costs.
  2. Compare single-agent CoT vs. AgenticSimLaw on the same 10 cases; compute accuracy/F1 for both and check correlation between metrics. Expect higher variance in single-agent.
  3. Ablate the private strategy phase: run the protocol with strategy formulation disabled (agents proceed directly to public utterances). Compare F1 stability and transcript coherence to the full system to isolate the reflection mechanism's contribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the 7-turn protocol be reduced to lower the 11-14× token overhead without losing the stability and observability benefits?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state future work should explore efficiency optimizations, such as reviewer-style aggregation or belief-based consensus, to reduce token costs.
- Why unresolved: The current design prioritizes auditability over efficiency, and it is unknown if shorter interactions yield similar metric stability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking performance variance and audit trail quality in truncated protocols (e.g., 3-turn or 5-turn) against the full 7-turn simulation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does AgenticSimLaw improve performance on multi-label or regression tabular tasks as effectively as on binary classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify the reliance on a single binary classification task as a key limitation and suggest expanding to more complex tasks.
- Why unresolved: The courtroom debate structure is designed for binary outcomes (Guilty/Not Guilty); it is unclear how the role structure adapts to continuous variables or multiple simultaneous labels.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the framework to datasets requiring regression or multi-label classification and analyzing the resulting debate transcripts and accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would integrating external agentic tools (e.g., Python interpreters for AutoML) outperform pure linguistic reasoning in this framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest employing agentic tool use with complementary abilities to "truly exploit LLM strengths" given that statistical models currently outperform LLMs on tabular data.
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies solely on the LLM's internal reasoning capabilities, which struggle with numerical dependencies in tabular data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study where agents can invoke statistical tools versus the current baseline of linguistic debate only.

## Limitations

- Performance ceiling: AgenticSimLaw still underperforms specialized statistical models (XGBoost, TabPFN) and commercial LLMs on tabular classification tasks despite better stability metrics.
- Explainability vs. faithfulness gap: Debate transcripts are "plausible explanations" rather than "objective evidence of correctness," with judge confidence not correlating with actual performance accuracy.
- Missing implementation details: Critical components like exact agent prompts, regex parsing patterns for malformed responses, and the 30-shot examples are not specified in the paper.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The claim that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable performance than single-agent reasoning is well-supported by the reported variance differences (std. dev. 0.04 vs. 0.08) and the stronger accuracy-F1 correlation.
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism that private strategy formulation improves argument quality through forced reflection is plausible given the literature on structured reflection, but the paper doesn't provide ablation data showing the specific contribution of this phase versus the debate structure itself.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that adversarial pressure surfaces overlooked features is theoretically sound but not empirically tested. The paper doesn't analyze which specific arguments led to belief updates or whether the debate genuinely produced novel insights versus role-congruent arguments.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on private strategy phase**: Run AgenticSimLaw with and without the private strategy formulation step (agents proceed directly to public utterances) on the same 10 test cases. Compare F1 score stability and transcript coherence to isolate the reflection mechanism's contribution to overall performance.

2. **Role adherence analysis**: Implement a content analysis of prosecutor vs. defense arguments across 50 complete debates. Quantify how often arguments are genuinely role-specific versus generic, and whether judges show systematic bias toward one role's arguments.

3. **Belief update validation**: For 20 cases with complete belief state tracking, compare judge prediction confidence changes to actual argument quality scores (manual annotation). Determine whether belief updates correlate with argument persuasiveness or reflect other factors like anchoring bias or random drift.
