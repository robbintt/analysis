# Transparency-First Medical Language Models: Datasheets, Model Cards, and End-to-End Data Provenance for Clinical NLP

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.19191
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19191
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces TeMLM, a transparency-first framework for clinical NLP, with synthetic benchmark Technetium-I and ProtactiniumBERT showing F1 0.984 (PHI) and 0.760 (ICD-9).

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces TeMLM, a transparency-first framework for releasing clinical language models, addressing the critical need for traceable, auditable, and reproducible medical AI. TeMLM unifies dataset documentation (TeMLM-Datasheet), model reporting (TeMLM-Card), and end-to-end provenance (TeMLM-Provenance) into a machine-checkable release bundle, supplemented by a lightweight conformance checklist. The framework is instantiated on Technetium-I, a large synthetic clinical dataset with 498,000 notes and 7.74M PHI annotations, using ProtactiniumBERT (100M parameters) for PHI de-identification (F1: 0.984) and ICD-9 coding (F1: 0.760). TeMLM emphasizes transparency as a prerequisite for trustworthy clinical AI, ensuring documentation completeness, leakage audits, privacy risk assessment, and provenance tracking. It aligns with clinical AI reporting guidelines and supports reproducibility even with restricted data. The work aims to make transparency measurable and actionable, fostering safer and more accountable medical NLP development.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes TeMLM, a transparency-first framework for clinical language models, addressing the gap in structured documentation and reproducibility for medical NLP. TeMLM unifies three artifacts: TeMLM-Datasheet (dataset documentation), TeMLM-Card (model reporting), and TeMLM-Provenance (end-to-end provenance). It is instantiated on Technetium-I, a synthetic clinical dataset with 498,000 notes and 7.74M PHI annotations, and ProtactiniumBERT, a BERT-base variant with ~100M parameters. The model is trained for PHI de-identification (token classification, BIO tagging, 10 entity types) and ICD-9-CM top-50 multi-label code extraction. The framework emphasizes machine-checkable bundles and a conformance checklist to ensure transparency and reproducibility, even with restricted data. While the benchmark results are illustrative, the focus is on enabling safer and more accountable medical NLP development.

## Key Results
- TeMLM provides a unified, machine-checkable framework for clinical NLP transparency, integrating datasheets, model cards, and provenance tracking.
- ProtactiniumBERT achieves F1 0.984 for PHI de-identification and 0.760 for ICD-9 coding on the Technetium-I synthetic benchmark.
- The framework supports reproducibility and auditability even with restricted, real-world clinical data, addressing critical gaps in medical AI accountability.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TeMLM works by structuring transparency into three interlocking artifacts—datasheets for dataset documentation, model cards for model reporting, and provenance bundles for end-to-end tracking—each machine-checkable and tied to a conformance checklist. This ensures documentation completeness, leakage audits, and reproducibility. The synthetic Technetium-I benchmark validates the process, while the framework’s design supports extension to real-world, restricted clinical data. By making transparency measurable and actionable, TeMLM fosters safer and more accountable medical NLP development.

## Foundational Learning
- **PHI de-identification (BIO tagging, 10 entity types)**: Needed to anonymize sensitive clinical data; quick check: verify entity type coverage and BIO schema.
- **ICD-9-CM top-50 multi-label classification**: Required for automated coding; quick check: confirm label mapping and multi-label threshold.
- **Synthetic clinical data generation**: Enables safe benchmarking without privacy risks; quick check: validate synthetic realism and annotation quality.
- **Machine-checkable transparency artifacts**: Ensures documentation completeness and reproducibility; quick check: run conformance checklist on release bundle.
- **End-to-end provenance tracking**: Enables auditability of data and model lineage; quick check: trace pipeline steps from raw data to final model.
- **Sliding window inference for long notes**: Handles >512 token context; quick check: verify aggregation logic for overlapping windows.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Technetium-I dataset -> TeMLM-Datasheet, TeMLM-Card, TeMLM-Provenance -> ProtactiniumBERT (MLM pretraining + fine-tuning) -> PHI de-identification + ICD-9 coding
- **Critical path**: Dataset release (Technetium-I) -> Framework instantiation (TeMLM-Datasheet/Card/Provenance) -> Model training (ProtactiniumBERT) -> Evaluation (F1 metrics)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Synthetic data enables safe benchmarking but may not capture real-world complexity; machine-checkable artifacts ensure reproducibility but require tooling adoption.
- **Failure signatures**: Performance mismatch (due to placeholder results), data leakage (inflating metrics), synthetic-to-real gap (transferability issues).
- **First experiments**: (1) Reproduce leakage audit pipeline on Technetium-I and report overlap statistics; (2) Implement ProtactiniumBERT training pipeline with standardized hyperparameters; (3) Conduct user study on TeMLM artifact utility.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: Does TeMLM maintain efficacy and completeness when applied to restricted, real-world clinical data versus the synthetic Technetium-I benchmark? The paper notes that while synthetic benchmarks support process validation, deployment claims should be validated on governed real-world EHR data, but this remains unverified.
- **Open Question 2**: Does adoption of structured TeMLM artifacts quantitatively improve peer review outcomes and downstream reproducibility compared to standard narrative reporting? The paper asserts theoretical benefits but lacks user studies or comparative analysis to confirm reviewer error detection or researcher reproducibility.
- **Open Question 3**: How can minimal transparency metrics be extended to capture calibration under distribution shift and causal validity for generative clinical models? The current metrics act as release gates but may fail to detect clinically dangerous drift or hallucination in generative models.

## Limitations
- The reported benchmark results are explicitly labeled as "illustrative placeholders" rather than final validated performance.
- The framework’s efficacy depends on community adoption of the conformance checklist and provenance tooling.
- Technetium-I being synthetic means reported results may not transfer to real clinical data.

## Confidence
- **High**: Framework design and documentation structure are specified in detail and aligned with established clinical AI reporting guidelines.
- **Medium**: Reproducibility of the Technetium-I benchmark is possible given dataset access, but model weights and exact hyperparameters are unspecified.
- **Low**: Generalizability of transparency benefits requires empirical validation through community adoption.

## Next Checks
- Reproduce the Technetium-I leakage audit pipeline on the released dataset and report patient-level overlap statistics at multiple similarity thresholds.
- Implement the full ProtactiniumBERT training pipeline (MLM pretraining + fine-tuning) with standardized hyperparameters and report updated benchmark results with confidence intervals.
- Conduct a small user study with clinical NLP developers to assess the practical utility and completeness of TeMLM-Datasheet, TeMLM-Card, and TeMLM-Provenance artifacts in real development workflows.
