- Primary result: Achieves 20-40% prompt compression with minimal performance loss for most NLP tasks using token attribution-based filtering

## Executive Summary
FrugalPrompt introduces a novel prompt compression method that leverages token attribution to identify and retain only the most semantically important tokens from input prompts. By using two state-of-the-art attribution methods (GlobEnc and DecompX) to rank tokens by salience, the approach preserves the top-k% tokens in their original order before passing them to frozen LLMs. Evaluated across four NLP tasks, results show that 20% token reduction incurs minimal performance loss for sentiment analysis, QA, and summarization, while mathematical reasoning performance degrades sharply, highlighting task-specific sensitivity to context loss.

## Method Summary
The approach uses task-specific BERT encoders (110M parameters) to compute token-level attribution scores via GlobEnc or DecompX methods. Tokens are ranked by salience, the top-k% are selected and reordered to preserve original sequence, then passed to frozen target LLMs. The method avoids autoregressive compression overhead by using encoder-only models for attribution, achieving significant inference cost and latency reduction while maintaining semantic integrity for most tasks.

## Key Results
- 20% prompt compression achieves minimal performance loss for sentiment analysis, QA, and summarization tasks
- Mathematical reasoning performance degrades sharply below 60% retention due to loss of critical numerical/logical tokens
- Random token selection yields competitive performance on classification tasks, suggesting potential benchmark contamination effects
- Order-preserving top-k selection maintains semantic coherence while discarding redundant tokens

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Attribution-Guided Semantic Filtering
- Token attribution scores from encoder-only models identify semantically critical tokens better than raw attention weights
- GlobEnc aggregates layer-wise contributions via attention rollout plus vector norms; DecompX propagates locally decomposed token representations through all components
- Core assumption: Attribution scores from a frozen 110M encoder approximate true causal importance of tokens for downstream LLM tasks

### Mechanism 2: Order-Preserving Top-k Selection
- Retaining highest-salience tokens in original temporal order yields compressed prompts preserving syntactic coherence
- Tokens ranked by salience, top-k% selected, indices re-sorted to original order before forming reduced prompt
- Core assumption: Semantic meaning can be reconstructed from sparse cues when token order and high-salience content are preserved

### Mechanism 3: Task-Dependent Contextual Tolerance
- Performance degradation under compression is task-specific; classification, QA, and summarization tolerate 20-40% reduction
- For semantic tasks, LLMs can infer missing context from salient cues; for symbolic reasoning, intermediate tokens carry necessary constraints
- Core assumption: Observed performance patterns reflect genuine task structure, not only benchmark contamination

## Foundational Learning

- **Attention Rollout**: Why needed - GlobEnc uses attention rollout to aggregate token influences across layers; understanding raw attention combination helps interpret attribution validity
- **Token Attribution vs. Attention Weights**: Why needed - Raw attention weights do not equal token importance; attribution methods incorporate residuals, norms, and FFNs
- **Benchmark Contamination**: Why needed - Paper identifies potential contamination in common NLP tasks; affects how we interpret performance retention under compression

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input prompt → BERT encoder (110M) → GlobEnc/DecompX attribution → Per-token salience scores → Ranking & top-k filter → Order-preserving reconstruction → Frozen LLM → Output
- **Critical path**: 1) Choose attribution method (GlobEnc for classification/QA; DecompX for reasoning) 2) Set k based on task tolerance 3) Run attribution forward pass 4) Extract scores, rank, filter, reorder 5) Pass compressed prompt to inference LLM
- **Design tradeoffs**: GlobEnc vs. DecompX - GlobEnc stable for classification/QA; DecompX better for reasoning but may overwhelm simpler tasks; Higher k preserves performance; lower k saves cost
- **Failure signatures**: Sharp pass@1 drop on GSM8K below 60% retention; random-k or bottom-k outperforming top-k; sudden metric collapse in summarization at specific k thresholds
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate sentiment classification with k ∈ {80, 60, 50} using both methods; measure accuracy delta vs. baseline 2) Test math reasoning (GSM8K) with k ∈ {80, 60, 50}; log which tokens are dropped 3) Run contamination check: compare top-k, random-k, bottom-k on clean dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Adaptive frugalization strategies**: Can dynamic token retention based on task complexity and model confidence outperform fixed k% thresholds? Current experiments use uniform thresholds ignoring sample-level variation.
- **Benchmark contamination extent**: To what degree does contamination explain resilience of sentiment analysis, QA, and summarization to token reduction? Random-k retention suggests models may use memorized patterns.
- **Attribution adaptation for math reasoning**: Can token attribution methods be adapted to mitigate severe degradation in mathematical reasoning tasks? Current methods fail to preserve critical numerical/logical tokens.

## Limitations

- Attribution method transferability from BERT encoders to LLMs not directly validated
- Potential benchmark contamination may inflate observed compression resilience
- Implementation details for attribution models (training protocols, dataset splits) not fully specified

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Compression reduces inference cost and latency; token attribution methods produce meaningful salience scores; math reasoning performance degrades sharply with compression

**Medium Confidence**: 20% token reduction achieves minimal loss for most tasks; order-preserving selection preserves semantic coherence; BERT attribution transfers to LLM tasks

**Low Confidence**: Benchmark contamination effects are definitively proven; DecompX is universally better for reasoning; approach generalizes to code generation

## Next Checks

- **Cross-Model Attribution Alignment**: Compare BERT vs. LLM attribution scores by measuring correlation between rankings and actual causal importance through systematic token removal experiments
- **Contamination Validation**: Test on datasets with clean training distributions versus contaminated benchmarks, including adversarially constructed prompts to minimize memorization effects
- **Token Type Analysis**: Analyze which token categories (numbers, operators, named entities, stopwords) are retained vs. removed across tasks and correlate with performance degradation patterns
