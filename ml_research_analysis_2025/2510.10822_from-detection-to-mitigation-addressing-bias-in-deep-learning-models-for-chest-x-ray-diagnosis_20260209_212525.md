# From Detection to Mitigation: Addressing Bias in Deep Learning Models for Chest X-Ray Diagnosis

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10822
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: XGBoost head retraining reduces demographic bias in chest X-ray models with minimal computational cost

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a lightweight bias mitigation approach for deep learning models in chest X-ray diagnosis that replaces the final classification layer with an XGBoost classifier trained on frozen embeddings. The method effectively reduces performance disparities across sex, age, and race subgroups while maintaining or improving overall diagnostic accuracy. When combined with active learning, this approach achieves the largest bias reduction across all demographic subgroups compared to standard techniques like adversarial training and reweighting. The solution is validated on both in-distribution (CheXpert) and out-of-distribution (MIMIC) datasets, demonstrating generalizability and clinical reliability.

## Method Summary
The method extracts frozen embeddings from pre-trained CNNs (DenseNet-121 or ResNet-50), applies PCA dimensionality reduction (95% variance retained), and trains an XGBoost classifier on the reduced features. This lightweight head replacement approach avoids full model retraining while achieving comparable or better fairness outcomes. The framework is extended to multi-label classification and tested with active learning that selectively samples uncertain or underrepresented examples over 10 rounds, starting with 15,000 labeled images and adding 2,000 uncertain samples per round.

## Key Results
- XGBoost head retraining reduces subgroup FNR disparities in pleural effusion prediction by nearly half compared to standard baselines
- The approach maintains or improves overall AUPRC while reducing ∆AUPRC across all demographic subgroups
- Combining XGBoost with active learning yields the largest bias reduction across sex, age, and race subgroups
- The method generalizes across CNN architectures with similar fairness outcomes on both DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50
- Computational cost is dramatically lower than full-model retraining approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Replacing the final classification layer with XGBoost reduces demographic bias while maintaining performance. Frozen CNN embeddings preserve learned visual features, and XGBoost's gradient boosting iteratively corrects errors from prior trees, focusing learning on difficult or minority-class examples. This ensemble property handles imbalanced subgroup distributions more effectively than single linear classifiers. Core assumption: Demographic bias is partially encoded in the final classification boundary, not solely in earlier convolutional layers. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "replacing the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall predictive performance"; [section 4.2] "XGBoost offered the best trade-off between performance and fairness... BRF and XGBoost were most robust across all subgroups due to their ensemble design and handling of imbalance." Break condition: If bias originates primarily in convolutional feature extraction, this method will underperform full-model approaches.

### Mechanism 2
Combining XGBoost head retraining with active learning maximizes bias reduction across subgroups. Active learning selectively samples uncertain or underrepresented examples, improving training data balance. XGBoost then leverages this improved distribution. The combination addresses both data-level and classifier-level sources of bias. Core assumption: Uncertainty-based sampling correlates with underrepresented subgroup examples. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups"; [section 4.2] "pool-based approach starting with 15,000 labeled images and adding 2,000 uncertain samples per round over 10 rounds." Break condition: If uncertainty sampling does not preferentially select minority subgroup examples, bias reduction will be limited.

### Mechanism 3
The approach generalizes across CNN architectures with minimal modification. The method operates on embeddings from any image encoder. PCA reduces dimensionality while preserving variance. The XGBoost classifier is architecture-agnostic, requiring only that embeddings contain predictive signal. Core assumption: Different CNN backbones produce embeddings with comparable demographic signal structure. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "apply the method to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes"; [section 4.2] "ResNet-50 architecture with a 512-dimensional embedding output... consistent increase in overall performance and a noticeable reduction in bias." Break condition: Architectures with fundamentally different embedding spaces may require classifier-specific tuning.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Frozen embeddings + transfer learning**
  - Why needed here: The method relies on extracting fixed representations from pre-trained CNNs. Understanding what embeddings capture—and what they don't—is essential for debugging.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why freezing weights prevents gradient flow to earlier layers?

- Concept: **Gradient boosting for imbalanced classification**
  - Why needed here: XGBoost is chosen specifically for its ability to handle class imbalance through iterative error correction.
  - Quick check question: How does boosting differ from bagging in handling minority classes?

- Concept: **Fairness metrics (∆AUPRC, Equalized Odds)**
  - Why needed here: The paper optimizes for reduced performance disparities, not just accuracy. You must understand what these metrics measure.
  - Quick check question: What does ∆AUPRC = 0 indicate about subgroup performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Image encoder (DenseNet-121 or ResNet-50, frozen) → PCA reduction (95% variance) → XGBoost multi-head classifier

- Critical path:
  1. Load pre-trained CNN weights from TorchXRayVision
  2. Extract embeddings for all training images (single forward pass)
  3. Apply PCA fit on training embeddings
  4. Train XGBoost with custom score: `AUPRC - (∆AUPRC_sex + ∆AUPRC_age + ∆AUPRC_race)`
  5. Evaluate on held-out test set with subgroup stratification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - XGBoost depth (max_depth=10): Higher captures interactions but risks overfitting small subgroups
  - PCA variance threshold (95%): Higher retains signal but increases dimensionality
  - Active learning rounds (10 × 2,000 samples): More rounds improve coverage but increase labeling cost

- Failure signatures:
  - ∆AUPRC increases after retraining: Head may be overfitting to majority subgroups; check per-subgroup sample counts
  - Overall AUPRC drops sharply: Embeddings may lack task-relevant signal; verify encoder pre-training
  - Race bias persists despite mitigation: Data imbalance (e.g., Black = 7.1% of CheXpert) may be too severe for head-only methods

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate single-condition baseline (Pleural Effusion) on CheXpert validation set; confirm ∆AUPRC reduction matches paper.
  2. Compare XGBoost vs. Logistic Regression head on multi-label task; measure ∆AUPRC by demographic.
  3. Run XGBoost + active learning on MIMIC (OOD); verify generalization gap is acceptable.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Does the lightweight XGBoost retraining strategy maintain its effectiveness when applied to Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones, given their different inductive biases compared to CNNs?
- Is the efficacy of this bias mitigation approach preserved in 3D imaging modalities like CT or MRI, or does the increased dimensionality and data complexity require architectural modifications?
- Can last-layer retraining effectively mitigate spurious correlations that are deeply encoded in the early convolutional layers, or is full-network fine-tuning necessary for such "deep" biases?

## Limitations
- The method assumes bias is primarily encoded in the final classification layer rather than earlier convolutional layers
- Race bias mitigation remains challenging due to severe data imbalance (Black patients at 7.1% in CheXpert)
- The approach is validated only on chest X-ray data, limiting claims about generalizability to other medical imaging domains
- Active learning heuristics are vaguely specified ("uncertainty-based"), leaving implementation details to reproduction efforts

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Claims about computational efficiency compared to full-model retraining, supported by architectural analysis
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about bias reduction, particularly for sex and age subgroups, with direct experimental evidence but limited cross-domain validation
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about active learning benefits in combination with XGBoost, supported by results but lacking specificity in the active learning mechanism

## Next Checks
1. Implement and validate the specific active learning uncertainty sampling method used (least confidence, margin sampling, or entropy-based) to confirm reported bias reduction gains.
2. Test the XGBoost head replacement approach on a different medical imaging dataset (e.g., dermatology or mammography) to assess generalizability beyond chest X-rays.
3. Compare performance across multiple demographic imbalance scenarios by artificially adjusting subgroup representation in validation sets to understand robustness boundaries.
