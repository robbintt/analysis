# Human-Aligned Skill Discovery: Balancing Behaviour Exploration and Alignment

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Framework that discovers diverse, human-aligned skills by combining skill discovery with alignment objectives

## Executive Summary
Human-aligned Skill Discovery (HaSD) introduces a novel framework that addresses the challenge of discovering useful and diverse skills in reinforcement learning while incorporating human feedback for alignment. The method combines a skill discovery objective with an alignment objective, enabling the discovery of skills that are both exploratory and aligned with human preferences. HaSD is evaluated in 2D navigation and SafetyGymnasium environments, demonstrating its ability to discover diverse, human-aligned skills that are safe and useful for downstream tasks. The framework also includes α-HaSD, an extension that learns configurable skills with varying degrees of diversity-alignment trade-offs.

## Method Summary
HaSD integrates skill discovery with human alignment by optimizing both a skill discovery objective (maximizing coverage and diversity of behaviors) and an alignment objective (incorporating human feedback). The framework uses human preferences to guide the skill discovery process, ensuring that learned skills are not only diverse but also aligned with human values. α-HaSD extends this by allowing configurable trade-offs between diversity and alignment, enabling more flexible skill discovery. The method is evaluated in 2D navigation and SafetyGymnasium environments, showing improved coverage, alignment, and safety compared to baselines.

## Key Results
- HaSD discovers diverse, human-aligned skills that are safe and useful for downstream tasks
- α-HaSD enables configurable skills with varying diversity-alignment trade-offs
- Outperforms baselines in terms of both coverage and alignment in 2D navigation and SafetyGymnasium environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by combining two complementary objectives: skill discovery and alignment. The skill discovery objective encourages exploration of diverse behaviors, while the alignment objective incorporates human feedback to ensure the discovered skills align with human preferences. This dual-objective approach balances exploration and alignment, leading to skills that are both useful and aligned with human values. The α-HaSD extension further enhances this by allowing configurable trade-offs, providing flexibility in skill discovery.

## Foundational Learning
- **Skill Discovery in RL**: The process of discovering reusable behaviors or skills in reinforcement learning environments.
  - Why needed: Enables agents to learn complex tasks by composing simpler, reusable skills.
  - Quick check: Evaluate skill reusability and compositionality in downstream tasks.

- **Human Feedback Integration**: Incorporating human preferences or judgments into the learning process.
  - Why needed: Ensures learned behaviors align with human values and are safe for real-world deployment.
  - Quick check: Measure alignment quality through human evaluations or preference-based metrics.

- **Diversity vs. Alignment Trade-off**: Balancing the exploration of diverse behaviors with the alignment to human preferences.
  - Why needed: Prevents overfitting to human feedback while ensuring practical utility of discovered skills.
  - Quick check: Analyze skill diversity metrics (e.g., coverage) alongside alignment scores.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Skill Discovery Module -> Alignment Module -> Combined Objective -> Skill Policy

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves the interaction between the skill discovery module and the alignment module. The skill discovery module explores diverse behaviors, while the alignment module incorporates human feedback to guide the discovery process. The combined objective optimizes both aspects, ensuring the learned skills are diverse and aligned.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances exploration (diversity) and exploitation (alignment). A key tradeoff is the weighting between these objectives, which can be adjusted using α-HaSD to prioritize either diversity or alignment based on the task requirements.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Over-alignment: Skills become too narrow, losing diversity and generalizability.
- Over-exploration: Skills become diverse but fail to align with human preferences, reducing practical utility.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate skill diversity and alignment in a simple grid-world environment.
2. Test the impact of varying levels of human feedback quality on skill discovery.
3. Compare HaSD with baseline skill discovery methods in terms of coverage and alignment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope is limited to 2D navigation and SafetyGymnasium environments, raising questions about generalizability to more complex tasks.
- The impact of noisy or inconsistent human feedback on skill discovery performance is not thoroughly examined.
- Scalability to high-dimensional tasks and environments with complex state and action spaces is not addressed.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core methodology of combining skill discovery with alignment objectives is sound and well-implemented, with demonstrated effectiveness in the presented environments.
- **Medium confidence**: Scalability claims and potential for real-world application are supported by limited evidence, and the impact of human feedback quality on performance is not sufficiently explored.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate α-HaSD on more complex environments (e.g., Atari games or robotic manipulation tasks) to assess scalability and robustness across different task types and state space complexities.
2. Conduct experiments with varying levels and qualities of human feedback to quantify the impact of feedback noise on skill discovery performance and alignment quality.
3. Implement a user study with multiple human evaluators to assess the consistency and reliability of the alignment objective across different individuals, measuring inter-rater agreement and its effect on skill quality.
