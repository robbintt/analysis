# Reasoning LLMs in the Medical Domain: A Literature Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19097
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19097
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Survey of reasoning techniques in medical LLMs, highlighting performance improvements but persistent safety concerns

## Executive Summary
This survey examines the evolution of reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) within medical applications, tracing their progression from basic information retrieval to sophisticated clinical reasoning systems. It analyzes key techniques including Chain-of-Thought prompting, multi-agent collaborative frameworks, and Reinforcement Learning approaches exemplified by DeepSeek-R1 and Med-R1. The survey evaluates specialized medical models like Med-PaLM 2 and MedAgents, examines optimization strategies such as AutoMedPrompt, and reviews comprehensive evaluation frameworks including HealthBench. Despite significant advances in performance benchmarks, critical challenges persist in interpretability, bias mitigation, patient safety, multimodal reasoning, and clinical workflow integration.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a literature review methodology synthesizing findings across 40 referenced papers covering Chain-of-Thought approaches, multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning methods, and evaluation frameworks. The authors systematically catalog techniques, report benchmark performances from MedQA, PubMedQA, HealthBench, and MultiMedQA, and identify challenges in interpretability, safety, and multimodal reasoning. The survey methodology involves searching arXiv/PubMed for medical LLM reasoning papers from 2022-2025, categorizing them into predefined taxonomies, and verifying cited benchmark claims against original sources.

## Key Results
- Chain-of-Thought prompting significantly improves medical reasoning performance by externalizing intermediate reasoning steps
- Reinforcement Learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1 and Med-R1 show superior cross-modality and cross-task generalization
- Multi-agent collaborative frameworks can outperform single-agent systems, with MDTeamGPT reporting 90.1% accuracy on MedQA
- Frontier models have doubled average performance scores within a year, but worst-case performance in high-stakes situations drops by approximately one-third

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting appears to improve medical reasoning performance by externalizing intermediate reasoning steps.
- Mechanism: CoT prompts the model to articulate sequential reasoning steps before generating a final answer, effectively decomposing complex problems into manageable sub-tasks. This mirrors clinical diagnostic processes where physicians methodically work through symptom analysis, hypothesis generation, and evidence gathering.
- Core assumption: Models possess latent multi-step reasoning capabilities that can be elicited through structured prompting; the generated intermediate steps genuinely reflect the model's reasoning process rather than post-hoc rationalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "specialized prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought"
  - [section III] "simply adding 'Let's think step by step' could significantly improve performance on reasoning tasks"
  - [corpus] Related survey "Medical Reasoning in LLMs: An In-Depth Analysis of DeepSeek R1" confirms CoT's role in diagnostic accuracy improvements.
- Break condition: If intermediate reasoning steps are not grounded in authoritative medical knowledge, CoT outputs may appear plausible while containing factual errors or unsupported inferences.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) may enable more generalizable medical reasoning than supervised fine-tuning alone.
- Mechanism: RL allows models to learn through exploration and feedback rather than pattern mimicry. GRPO encourages exploration of diverse reasoning pathways, potentially developing emergent reasoning behaviors not present in training data. Rule-based rewards derived from medical guidelines constrain outputs to clinically valid spaces.
- Core assumption: Reward signals can effectively capture medical reasoning quality; exploration during training transfers to novel clinical scenarios without reward hacking.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Reinforcement Learning approaches exemplified by DeepSeek-R1 and Med-R1"
  - [section IX.B] "Med-R1 demonstrated... superior cross-modality and cross-task generalization (29.94% and 32.06% improvements over baseline)"
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence limited; no direct replication studies of GRPO in medical VLMs identified.
- Break condition: If reward functions fail to capture safety-critical edge cases, models may optimize for measured performance while degrading worst-case reliability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-agent collaborative frameworks appear to outperform single-agent systems for complex medical decisions by simulating multidisciplinary team consultations.
- Mechanism: Multiple LLM agents assume specialist roles, each processing cases from their domain perspective. Consensus aggregation mechanisms synthesize diverse opinions, while iterative discussion structures refine conclusions based on disagreements. Knowledge bases (CorrectKB, ChainKB) accumulate reasoning patterns from past consultations.
- Core assumption: Diversity of agent perspectives improves decision quality; aggregation mechanisms reliably identify correct consensus among conflicting outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V.A] "MDTeamGPT... reported accuracies of 90.1% and 83.9% respectively [on MedQA and PubMedQA]"
  - [section V] "such collaborative reasoning paradigms can indeed surpass the performance of single-agent LLMs"
  - [corpus] "A Survey of LLM-based Agents in Medicine" confirms multi-agent architecture trends but notes evaluation methodology variability.
- Break condition: If specialist agents share common failure modes or knowledge gaps, consensus mechanisms may amplify rather than correct errors.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
  - Why needed here: CoT is the foundational technique underlying most medical reasoning enhancements discussed in the paper. Understanding basic CoT (zero-shot "let's think step by step") is prerequisite to grasping advanced variants like Layered-CoT, Chain-of-Diagnosis, and MedCoT.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why adding intermediate reasoning steps before a final answer might improve diagnostic accuracy?

- Concept: **Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards**
  - Why needed here: The paper positions RL as transformative for medical reasoning (DeepSeek-R1, Med-R1). Understanding how rule-based rewards can be derived from medical guidelines without human annotation is essential for evaluating these approaches.
  - Quick check question: How might you design a reward function that incentivizes correct medical reasoning without requiring expert annotations for every training example?

- Concept: **Medical Evaluation Benchmarks and Failure Modes**
  - Why needed here: The paper's critical insight is that average performance improvements mask dangerous worst-case degradation. Understanding benchmark design (MedQA, HealthBench) and the distinction between average vs. worst-case metrics is essential for responsible deployment.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model that scores 86.5% on MedQA still be unsafe for clinical deployment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Foundation Layer (Base LLM) -> Reasoning Enhancement (CoT/RL/KI) -> Domain Adaptation (Medical fine-tuning) -> Collaboration Layer (Multi-agent) -> Evaluation Layer (Benchmarks)
- Critical path: Start with CoT prompting on existing medical benchmarks (lowest investment) -> Progress to structured CoT variants (Layered-CoT, MedCoT) for transparency -> Evaluate multi-agent frameworks for complex multi-morbidity cases -> Consider RL approaches (GRPO) only when SFT proves insufficient for generalization
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt engineering vs. fine-tuning: OpenMedLM shows sophisticated prompting can match fine-tuning on some benchmarks, but may not transfer to novel tasks
  - Average vs. worst-case performance: HealthBench reveals frontier models double average scores but worst-case drops ~33%—clinical deployment requires optimizing the latter
  - Transparency vs. performance: Compositional models (Gyan) offer interpretability advantages but may sacrifice peak performance
  - Parameter efficiency vs. capability: Med-R1's 2B parameter model outperformed 72B SFT baseline, suggesting architecture choices matter more than scale for some tasks
- Failure signatures:
  - Hallucination in reasoning chains: CoT steps appear medically plausible but contain factual errors (Section X.A)
  - Worst-case collapse: Strong average benchmark performance with dangerous failures in emergency scenarios (Section VII.C)
  - Cross-modality generalization gaps: Models trained on text fail to transfer reasoning to imaging tasks without explicit multimodal training
  - Consensus amplification: Multi-agent systems converge on incorrect answers when agents share biases
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline CoT evaluation: Implement zero-shot CoT on MedQA subset, compare against non-CoT baseline. Measure both accuracy and reasoning step quality via human review.
  2. Worst-case stress testing: Apply HealthBench "Hard" subset methodology—specifically probe emergency scenarios and context-seeking behaviors to identify failure modes hidden by average metrics.
  3. Multi-agent pilot: Implement a minimal 3-agent system (generalist + 2 specialists) on a narrow domain (e.g., diagnostic cases with known differential diagnoses). Compare consensus accuracy against single-agent performance; analyze disagreement patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can worst-case performance in high-stakes medical scenarios be improved to match average performance gains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The survey identifies that while frontier models "doubled average performance scores within a year, worst-case performance in high-stakes situations remains concerning, dropping by approximately one-third."
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation benchmarks like HealthBench reveal fragility where "reliability in critical emergency scenarios and context-dependent reasoning remain inadequate," but no techniques specifically address worst-case optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of training methodologies or architectural modifications that demonstrably reduce worst-case error rates on high-stakes medical tasks without sacrificing average performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What architectures enable effective longitudinal reasoning over dynamic patient states across extended time periods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "LLMs need to move beyond static, single-encounter reasoning to incorporate longitudinal patient data from EHRs. This involves reasoning about disease progression, treatment responses over extended periods, and predicting future health trajectories."
- Why unresolved: Current models process encounters in isolation; no established frameworks exist for temporal medical reasoning over evolving patient conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrated ability to track disease progression, adapt recommendations to changing patient states, and predict outcomes using temporal clinical data sequences.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can reasoning frameworks seamlessly integrate diverse multimodal medical data types including images, genomics, and structured EHRs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The survey notes "comprehensive multimodal reasoning remains a significant challenge" and that "further work is needed to develop reasoning frameworks that seamlessly integrate diverse data types including images, time series data, genomics, and structured electronic health records."
- Why unresolved: Early frameworks like MC-CoT address visual-textual reasoning but no unified approach handles the full spectrum of clinical data modalities with coherent reasoning.
- What evidence would resolve it: A single framework demonstrating strong performance across imaging, genomic, physiological signal, and structured EHR reasoning tasks simultaneously.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What context-aware safety mechanisms can ensure consistent reliability in critical medical scenarios while maintaining clinical utility?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The survey emphasizes that "more robust, context-aware safety mechanisms specifically designed for medical reasoning are needed" and that "healthcare requires consistent reliability in critical moments rather than merely superior average capabilities."
- Why unresolved: Current safety frameworks lack dynamic context sensitivity for identifying and escalating high-stakes situations requiring enhanced accuracy guarantees.
- What evidence would resolve it: Safety mechanisms that dynamically calibrate model confidence and output constraints based on clinical context severity, with validated performance on edge cases.

## Limitations
- Reliance on reported benchmark metrics without independent verification of claimed performance figures
- Rapid pace of model development means some cited results may already be outdated
- Lacks detailed analysis of clinical validation studies beyond benchmark performance
- No systematic methodology specified for synthesizing conflicting claims across papers

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Chain-of-Thought prompting improves medical reasoning performance
- **Medium Confidence**: Reinforcement Learning approaches provide superior generalization compared to supervised fine-tuning
- **Medium Confidence**: Multi-agent frameworks outperform single-agent systems
- **Low Confidence**: Worst-case performance degradation is approximately one-third
- **Medium Confidence**: AutoMedPrompt optimization strategy is effective

## Next Checks
1. **Independent Benchmark Verification**: Replicate the worst-case performance analysis on HealthBench "Hard" subset for three frontier models (DeepSeek-R1, Med-R1, and a supervised fine-tuned baseline) to verify the reported one-third performance degradation.

2. **Cross-Method Comparison**: Implement a controlled experiment comparing Chain-of-Thought prompting, Layered-CoT, and Reinforcement Learning approaches on identical medical reasoning tasks, measuring both average accuracy and worst-case failure rates.

3. **Clinical Safety Protocol Validation**: Design and execute a medical expert review protocol where clinicians evaluate reasoning chains from top-performing models across emergency scenarios, diagnostic uncertainties, and high-stakes treatment decisions to identify hallucination patterns and safety-critical failures not captured by standard benchmarks.
