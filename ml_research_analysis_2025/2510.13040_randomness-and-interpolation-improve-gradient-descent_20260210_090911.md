# Randomness and Interpolation Improve Gradient Descent

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13040
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13040
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: Introduces IAGD and NRSGD optimizers that improve SGD convergence and accuracy through interpolation and noise regularization

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes two novel optimizers based on stochastic gradient descent: Interpolational Accelerating Gradient Descent (IAGD) and Noise-Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent (NRSGD). IAGD uses second-order Newton interpolation to accelerate convergence by assuming linear relationships between gradients, while NRSGD introduces controlled noise to gradients to prevent overfitting. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets using AlexNet and LeNet5 architectures demonstrate that IAGD achieves fastest convergence and shortest training time, while NRSGD achieves superior accuracy. Both methods show stability and avoid underfitting issues common with other optimizers.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces two optimizers that enhance standard SGD. IAGD leverages Newton interpolation to predict optimal update directions by assuming gradients evolve linearly between iterations, effectively accelerating convergence through second-order information. NRSGD adds controlled Gaussian noise to gradient estimates during training, creating a regularization effect that prevents overfitting while maintaining model capacity. Both methods were evaluated on image classification tasks using AlexNet and LeNet5 architectures on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

## Key Results
- IAGD achieved fastest convergence with accuracies of 0.6602 (CIFAR-10) and 0.3656 (CIFAR-100) on AlexNet
- NRSGD demonstrated superior accuracy of 0.6975 (CIFAR-10) and 0.3713 (CIFAR-100) on AlexNet
- Both methods showed improved stability compared to classical optimizers and avoided underfitting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
IAGD works by exploiting the geometric structure of the loss landscape through interpolation. By assuming gradients between consecutive iterations are linearly related, the method can predict more accurate descent directions without computing full Hessian matrices. This second-order information effectively accelerates convergence by making more informed parameter updates. NRSGD operates through noise-induced regularization - the controlled perturbations to gradients prevent the optimizer from overfitting to specific training patterns by introducing stochasticity that smooths the optimization trajectory and encourages better generalization.

## Foundational Learning
- Gradient descent fundamentals: Why needed - Understanding basic SGD mechanics is essential for grasping optimizer improvements; Quick check - Verify understanding of learning rate, batch processing, and convergence criteria
- Newton interpolation methods: Why needed - Critical for understanding IAGD's acceleration mechanism; Quick check - Confirm knowledge of polynomial interpolation and its application to gradient estimation
- Regularization techniques: Why needed - Essential for contextualizing NRSGD's noise-based approach; Quick check - Compare dropout, weight decay, and noise injection as regularization methods

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Data -> Model Forward Pass -> Gradient Computation -> IAGD/NRSGD Update -> Parameter Update
**Critical Path**: Data loading → Forward propagation → Loss calculation → Gradient computation → Optimizer update → Parameter update
**Design Tradeoffs**: IAGD trades computational overhead for faster convergence; NRSGD trades training stability for potential accuracy gains through noise injection
**Failure Signatures**: IAGD may fail on highly non-convex landscapes where interpolation assumptions break down; NRSGD may underperform if noise parameters are poorly tuned
**First Experiments**: 1) Test IAGD on simple convex problems to verify interpolation assumptions 2) Benchmark NRSGD against dropout on small networks 3) Analyze gradient variance under NRSGD noise injection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to two datasets (CIFAR-10/100) and two architectures (AlexNet, LeNet5), restricting generalizability
- Reported accuracies appear unusually low for CIFAR-10/100 with AlexNet, suggesting potential implementation issues
- IAGD's interpolation assumption may not hold for highly non-convex loss landscapes common in deep learning
- NRSGD's noise regularization lacks theoretical grounding for why specific noise characteristics prevent overfitting better than standard methods

## Confidence
- IAGD convergence claims: Medium - Supported by experiments but limited scope
- NRSGD accuracy improvements: Medium - Experimental results present but context unclear
- Stability claims vs other optimizers: Low - Insufficient comparative analysis provided

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments with additional architectures (ResNet, VGG) and datasets (ImageNet, SVHN) to verify scalability
2. Compare IAGD performance on loss landscapes with known convexity properties to validate interpolation assumptions
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of noise parameters in NRSGD versus standard weight decay and dropout regularization
