# ProHD: Projection-Based Hausdorff Distance Approximation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18207
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18207
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: 10-100x faster than exact HD computation with 5-20x lower error than random sampling

## Executive Summary
ProHD addresses the high computational cost of calculating Hausdorff distance (HD) on large, high-dimensional datasets by proposing a projection-guided approximation algorithm. The method identifies a small subset of "extreme" points by projecting data onto informative directions (centroid axis and top principal components) and computing HD on this subset, guaranteeing an underestimate of true HD with bounded additive error. ProHD achieves 10-100x faster computation than exact algorithms and 5-20x lower error than random sampling-based approximations, maintaining results within a few percent of exact values.

## Method Summary
ProHD projects point clouds onto the centroid axis and top principal components, retaining only the top/bottom α-fraction of points along each direction to form a small subset. The Hausdorff distance is then computed exactly on these subsets using approximate nearest neighbor search (Faiss FlatL2 index), yielding guaranteed underestimation of the true HD with a bounded additive error. The method sets α=0.01 and uses m=⌊√D⌋ principal components, reducing computational complexity from O(n²D) to O(nD^1.5) while maintaining accuracy within a few percent.

## Key Results
- 10-100x faster computation than exact algorithms on datasets up to 2 million points
- 5-20x lower error than random sampling-based approximations
- Maintains HD approximation within a few percent of exact values across diverse datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Projecting point clouds onto informative directions and selecting only extreme points preserves the Hausdorff distance with bounded error.
- Mechanism: Points determining the true HD lie near geometric extremes. By projecting onto the centroid axis (connecting cloud centroids) and top principal components, then retaining only the top/bottom α-fraction along each axis, the method captures candidates that define HD while discarding ~95-99% of points.
- Core assumption: The directions carrying maximal inter-cloud separation are captured by centroid and PCA axes; extreme points along these directions are sufficient to approximate the full HD.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "ProHD identifies a small subset of candidate 'extreme' points by projecting the data onto a few informative directions (such as the centroid axis and top principal components)"
  - [section II.B]: "the points contributing to the Hausdorff distance typically lie near the extremes of the combined point clouds along certain discriminative directions"
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus support for this specific projection strategy; primarily validated within paper's experiments.
- Break condition: If the true HD-determining points lie orthogonal to all selected projection directions, the approximation will underestimate by more than the theoretical bound.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The approximation is guaranteed to underestimate true HD with a bounded additive error of 2·min δ(u), where δ(u) is the maximum orthogonal distance from any point to its projection.
- Mechanism: 1D projected HD (Hᵤ) always ≤ true HD because projection discards orthogonal components. The gap between Hᵤ and H is bounded by how far points deviate from direction u. Taking the maximum over multiple directions tightens the bound.
- Core assumption: The δ(u) values for selected directions are substantially smaller than cloud radii, which holds when data has structure captured by low-rank PCA.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "guarantees an underestimate of the true HD with a bounded additive error"
  - [section II.E.1-2]: Formal proof that Hᵤ(A,B) ≤ H(A,B) ≤ Hᵤ(A,B) + 2δ(u), extended to multiple directions in Eq. (5)
  - [corpus]: Corpus papers discuss Hausdorff bounds in control theory contexts but not this projection-based bound.
- Break condition: If all projection directions have large δ(u) (e.g., spherical data in very high dimensions with no low-rank structure), the bound becomes loose.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Computational cost reduces from O(n²D) to O(nD^1.5) while maintaining accuracy within a few percent.
- Mechanism: Subset size scales as O(α·√D·n) rather than n. With α=0.01 and D=256, subsets are ~16% of original size. The expensive HD computation uses fast ANN (Faiss flat index) only on these subsets.
- Core assumption: D ≥ log(n) and α ≪ 1, which holds for typical high-dimensional datasets; ANN query cost dominates subset HD computation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "10-100x faster computation than exact algorithms"
  - [section II.D]: Detailed complexity analysis showing O(nD^1.5) total with O(αnD^1.5) for ANN phase
  - [corpus]: No corpus papers address this specific complexity reduction for HD.
- Break condition: When D is very small (D < log n) or α is set too large, the subset approaches full dataset size and speedup diminishes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Hausdorff Distance (directed and undirected)**
  - Why needed here: The entire method optimizes for this specific metric; understanding that h(A,B) = max_{a∈A} min_{b∈B} ||a-b|| helps grasp why extreme points matter.
  - Quick check question: Given two point sets, can you identify which points determine the directed Hausdorff distance?

- Concept: **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for direction selection**
  - Why needed here: ProHD uses top m=⌊√D⌋ principal components as projection directions; understanding that these capture maximum variance directions explains why they minimize δ(u).
  - Quick check question: Why would the first principal component of A∪B yield a smaller δ(u) than a random direction?

- Concept: **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) with Faiss**
  - Why needed here: The final HD computation on subsets uses Faiss for efficiency; knowing FlatL2 vs. IVF indices helps with tuning.
  - Quick check question: What is the tradeoff between Faiss FlatL2 (exact, used here) vs. IVF-PQ (faster but approximate)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. **CentroidIndices**: Computes centroids, projects onto centroid axis, selects top/bottom α-fraction
  2. **PCAProjIndices**: Runs truncated SVD for top √D components, projects onto each, selects extremes
  3. **Subset Union**: Merges indices from both selection methods
  4. **ANN-HD Compute**: Builds Faiss index on B_sel, queries for all a ∈ A_sel, takes max of directed distances

- Critical path: PCA computation → dominates at O(nD^1.5); parallelizing this phase yields proportional speedup.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - α (selection fraction): Lower α → faster but potentially larger error; paper uses α=0.01 as default
  - m (PCA directions): More directions → better accuracy but larger subsets; paper sets m=⌊√D⌋
  - ANN index type: FlatL2 is exact; could swap for IVF variants if subset still large

- Failure signatures:
  - Systematic underestimation >5% on structured data → likely α too small or m too few
  - No speedup observed → check if D < log n or α inadvertently set too high
  - High variance across runs → verify PCA is deterministic (fixed random seed for SVD)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce synthetic benchmark**: Generate 100k-point clouds in D=4, D=64, D=256; compare ProHD vs. random sampling at α=0.01; expect 5-20x lower error at similar runtime.
  2. **Ablation on direction types**: Run ProHD with (a) centroid only, (b) PCA only, (c) both; measure error gap to quantify each component's contribution.
  3. **Scalability stress test**: Fix D=64, scale n from 10k to 2M; plot runtime and error; verify linear scaling in n holds and error remains stable.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a learned compact direction dictionary tighten the additive error bound more effectively than the current centroid and PCA-based projections?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Future Directions that the additive bound could be tightened by learning a "direction dictionary" to minimize $\min_u \delta(u)$ without increasing subset size.
- Why unresolved: The current method uses fixed geometric projections (centroid and top PCs), which may not minimize the projection residual $\delta(u)$ optimally for all data distributions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing a learned dictionary achieving lower additive error or smaller subset sizes for the same accuracy compared to the PCA baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the projection-based selection strategy be successfully adapted for non-Euclidean set distances like the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) or Gromov–Hausdorff?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose extending ProHD to these other set distances to broaden applicability to non-Euclidean and metric-learning scenarios.
- Why unresolved: ProHD relies on selecting "extreme" points based on orthogonal projections to approximate maximum distances; it is unclear if this geometric heuristic translates to mass-transport problems like EMD.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formulation of projection-guided selection for EMD that provides theoretical bounds or empirical speedups comparable to those seen for Hausdorff distance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can an adaptive selection fraction ($\alpha$) be developed to guarantee strict error budgets while retaining computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes the intent to study "adaptive $\alpha$ schedules" that accommodate strict error budgets.
- Why unresolved: Currently, $\alpha$ is a static hyperparameter; dynamic adjustment would require real-time estimation of convergence or error without incurring the exact computation costs the method seeks to avoid.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm that adjusts $\alpha$ dynamically based on intermediate projection metrics, validated against specific error thresholds on high-dimensional datasets.

## Limitations
- Theoretical bound may become loose for high-dimensional data without low-rank structure
- Accuracy heavily depends on PCA capturing discriminative directions between point clouds
- No open-source implementation provided, requiring complete reimplementation from pseudocode

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The computational speedup claims (10-100x faster) are well-supported by the complexity analysis and synthetic benchmarks.
- **Medium confidence**: The error bounds and generalization to diverse datasets are supported by experiments but rely on assumptions about data structure that aren't fully validated across all possible distributions.
- **Low confidence**: The claim that ProHD maintains "within a few percent" of exact HD across all scenarios, particularly for data with no clear low-rank structure or for streaming data with temporal dependencies.

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness test**: Evaluate ProHD on high-dimensional spherical data (e.g., uniform points on hypersphere) where PCA captures no structure; measure if error bounds remain tight.
2. **Streaming data validation**: Apply ProHD to temporally-evolving point clouds (e.g., video frames or sensor streams) to verify the method's practical utility for online HD monitoring.
3. **Directionality ablation study**: Systematically vary the number of projection directions (m) and selection fraction (α) across multiple datasets to map the full error-speedup tradeoff surface and identify optimal hyperparameters for different data regimes.
