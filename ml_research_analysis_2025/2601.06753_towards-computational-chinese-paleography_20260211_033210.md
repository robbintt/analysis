- One-line primary result: Comprehensive survey charting computational Chinese paleography's evolution from isolated character recognition to integrated multimodal, human-AI collaborative systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of computational Chinese paleography, mapping its evolution from isolated character recognition tasks to integrated multimodal systems. It traces the field's trajectory from classical computer vision to modern deep learning, transformers, and diffusion models, while highlighting the unique challenges posed by Chinese logographic scripts. The survey identifies key datasets, methods, and applications across the methodological pipeline—from foundational visual analysis to contextual reconstruction and advanced reasoning for decipherment. It emphasizes the shift toward human-AI collaboration and knowledge-based approaches driven by data scarcity and the need to bridge AI capabilities with paleographic inquiry.

## Method Summary
The survey analyzes the computational Chinese paleography field through systematic literature review, identifying methodological trends across visual analysis, contextual reconstruction, and advanced reasoning. For baseline reproduction, it identifies HUST-OBS as the primary dataset (140,053 images; 77,064 deciphered images across 1,588 classes) and cites ResNet50 with spectral clustering for variant analysis. The field faces challenges including severe class imbalance, long-tail distributions, and lack of standardized benchmarks. Methods span from supervised deep learning for visual features to radical-based decomposition and multimodal fusion approaches.

## Key Results
- The field has evolved from isolated character recognition to integrated multimodal systems combining visual, textual, and contextual information.
- Human-AI collaboration is increasingly necessary due to data scarcity and the need for expert verification in decipherment tasks.
- Future directions emphasize few-shot/zero-shot learning, multimodal fusion, and expert-augmented systems for deeper knowledge discovery.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal fusion reduces ambiguity in paleography tasks.
- Mechanism: Integrating visual features with textual/contextual information lowers uncertainty. The logographic nature of Chinese script requires simultaneous reasoning over form, meaning, and sound; combining image and text models addresses this more holistically than single-modality approaches.
- Core assumption: Ancient Chinese script is inherently multimodal, so computational solutions must be too. Visual information cannot be abstracted away without critical loss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The survey highlights challenges posed by Chinese logographic scripts and advocates for multimodal systems.
  - [section 2.2] Notes the image modality is indispensable and the field is a "multi-dimensional, multimodal challenge" taking "forms, sounds, meanings, and contexts in unison."
  - [corpus] "WenyanGPT" focuses on language models for Classical Chinese but does not integrate visual data, illustrating the gap in fully multimodal solutions.
- Break condition: The mechanism would break if visual and textual features were fully redundant (not true here) or if fusion architectures fail to align modalities effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Radical-based decomposition enables generalization to rare or unseen characters.
- Mechanism: By learning reusable visual components (radicals) rather than whole characters, models can recombine known elements to recognize novel character forms, supporting few-shot and zero-shot learning in long-tailed distributions.
- Core assumption: The compositional structure of Chinese characters is systematic enough for computational decomposition to be effective even on degraded or variant ancient forms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] Describes radical-based methods that "treat characters as compositions of radicals" and can "support zero-shot learning."
  - [section 6.1.2] Discusses approaches like the "Puzzle Pieces Picker," which deconstructs characters into components for reconstruction into modern equivalents.
  - [corpus] No strong, direct evidence from provided neighbors; radical decomposition is a specialized paleography technique not prominent in the corpus.
- Break condition: The mechanism would break if radical boundaries are ambiguous in ancient scripts or if degradation destroys component structure.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human-AI collaboration overcomes data scarcity and reasoning bottlenecks.
- Mechanism: AI handles scalable, low-level tasks (e.g., feature matching, retrieval) while experts provide high-level verification, contextual reasoning, and hypothesis generation. This synergy augments scholarship without requiring fully autonomous AI.
- Core assumption: Current AI lacks the causal and holistic reasoning needed for deep paleographical insight; expert involvement remains essential.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Underscores the shift toward human-AI collaboration driven by data scarcity.
  - [section 6.2] States the field is "increasingly moving towards human-AI collaborative systems that augment, rather than replace, human expertise."
  - [corpus] "Textarium" provides a precedent for AI-infused scholarly annotation and argumentation environments.
- Break condition: The mechanism would break if AI achieves autonomous expert-level reasoning or if collaboration interfaces introduce excessive friction.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Logographic vs. phonographic scripts.
  - Why needed here: Core to understanding why Chinese paleography is a multimodal (visual+textual) challenge, unlike alphabetic script restoration.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why image features are non-negotiable for Chinese character decipherment, unlike for Latin script restoration?

- Concept: Radical-based character composition.
  - Why needed here: Explains the structural logic behind decomposition methods that enable zero-shot recognition of rare characters.
  - Quick check question: How would a model leverage known radicals to propose a reading for an unseen character?

- Concept: Long-tailed data distribution and data scarcity.
  - Why needed here: Underlies the need for few-shot learning, data augmentation, and human-in-the-loop verification.
  - Quick check question: Why does class imbalance make standard supervised learning insufficient for ancient character recognition?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw artifact image -> Restoration (denoising, inpainting) -> Character detection -> Feature extraction (CNNs, ViTs) -> Radical decomposition -> Multimodal reasoning (visual + text) -> Retrieval/knowledge layer -> Human interface for verification

- Critical path: The pipeline flows from raw artifact image → restoration → detection → radical decomposition → multimodal fusion → retrieval/reasoning → human-AI collaboration for final interpretation.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Purely visual vs. multimodal**: Visual-only models are simpler but lack semantic grounding; multimodal fusion is more powerful but requires aligned data.
  - **Holistic recognition vs. radical-based**: Radical decomposition aids generalization but may fail on ambiguous or heavily damaged characters.
  - **Full automation vs. human-in-the-loop**: Full automation is brittle on low-resource tasks; collaboration requires usable interfaces.

- Failure signatures:
  - Model overfits to common characters and fails on the long-tail.
  - Radical segmentation produces nonsensical components on noisy images.
  - Multimodal fusion ignores visual or textual modality due to imbalance.
  - Retrieval returns paleographically implausible matches due to domain gap between clean glyphs and noisy rubbings.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline Visual Recognition**: Train a CNN/ViT on a standard oracle bone character dataset (e.g., HUST-OBS) to establish performance and identify failure cases on rare classes.
  2. **Radical Decomposition Pipeline**: Implement a component segmentation model and evaluate its ability to cluster character parts; test if recombination improves zero-shot recognition on held-out characters.
  3. **Simple Human-in-the-Loop Retrieval**: Build a basic interface where the model suggests top-k rejoining or decipherment candidates from a retrieval system, and measure how often expert intervention corrects the top suggestion.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can computational models effectively integrate phonological reconstruction and contextual evidence to mirror the holistic "form-sound-meaning" reasoning of expert paleographers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that current AI focuses mostly on "form" and "meaning" but neglects the crucial dimensions of "sound" (phonology) and contextual evidence, which are essential for bridging the gap with humanistic inquiry (Section 7.2).
- Why unresolved: Reconstructing ancient phonology is immensely difficult, and current multimodal models struggle to integrate these sparse, complex linguistic features with visual data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A model that successfully predicts or verifies character readings by jointly optimizing for visual structure, semantic context, and reconstructed phonological vectors.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can generative decipherment models be constrained to produce paleographically sound interpretations that offer genuine scholarly value?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that while diffusion models like OBSD can generate visual hints, these are often of "limited practical value" to experts, and generated glyph interpretations can be "paleographically unsound" (Section 6.1.1).
- Why unresolved: Generative models prioritize visual plausibility over structural logic or historical validity, lacking the "expert" constraints required for academic rigor.
- What evidence would resolve it: A generative system whose outputs are validated by domain experts as structurally consistent hypotheses that successfully aid in the decipherment of previously unknown characters.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent can few-shot and zero-shot learning techniques overcome the extreme data sparsity and long-tail distribution of ancient character datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper lists the shift "From Supervised to Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning" as a key future direction, noting that supervised methods fail because many characters appear only once or twice (Section 7.1, 7.2).
- Why unresolved: The sheer variance in ancient scripts and the lack of sufficient training examples for rare characters make standard generalization difficult.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks showing high recognition accuracy on "tail" classes (rare characters) using models trained on minimal data, comparable to human expert performance on similar tasks.

## Limitations

- The survey lacks baseline quantitative results for core visual recognition tasks and does not provide standardized benchmarks or splits for reproducibility.
- Claims about multimodal superiority and radical-based generalization are methodologically plausible but lack direct experimental validation.
- Human-AI collaboration efficacy is argued from data scarcity principles but not empirically demonstrated.
- The absence of head-to-head performance comparisons between unimodal and multimodal approaches limits claims about fusion benefits.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The field trajectory from isolated recognition to multimodal, human-augmented systems is well-supported by the literature mapping and logical progression described.
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism of radical-based decomposition aiding generalization is plausible and methodologically sound, but lacks direct experimental validation in the survey.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about the absolute superiority of multimodal fusion over unimodal systems are not empirically substantiated with head-to-head performance comparisons.

## Next Checks

1. **Baseline Reproducibility Check**: Train a ResNet-50 on the HUST-OBS dataset (filtered to deciphered characters) with a fixed 80/20 stratified split. Report Top-1 accuracy and per-class breakdowns to confirm the documented long-tail failure mode.

2. **Radical Decomposition Ablation**: Implement a radical segmentation and reassembly pipeline. Compare zero-shot recognition accuracy on held-out characters against a holistic recognition baseline to quantify the claimed generalization benefit.

3. **Multimodal vs. Unimodal Comparison**: Construct a minimal multimodal system (visual + text context) and an equivalent unimodal visual-only system. Evaluate both on a shared benchmark to directly measure the impact of fusion on recognition accuracy.
