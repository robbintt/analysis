# A Negotiation-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Dynamic Scheduling of Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.07707
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07707
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Multi-agent RL framework with negotiation mechanism outperforms baseline heuristics in RMS scheduling

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for dynamic scheduling in reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS), employing deep Q-network agents with an attention-based negotiation mechanism. The approach combines centralized training with decentralized execution, allowing agents to learn coordinated scheduling policies while maintaining operational independence. The framework incorporates several DQN enhancements including prioritized experience replay, n-step returns, double DQN, Huber loss, and soft target updates to improve learning stability and performance.

The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline heuristics in reducing makespan and tardiness while improving machine utilization. Through simulation experiments, the framework shows effective adaptation to stochastic events such as machine breakdowns and reconfiguration delays. However, performance variability increases under these challenging conditions, highlighting areas for future improvement.

## Method Summary
The framework utilizes multi-agent deep Q-networks where each agent represents a job or machine in the manufacturing system. Agents are trained centrally using historical scheduling data and environmental interactions, then execute decisions independently during operation. An attention-based negotiation mechanism resolves conflicts when multiple agents compete for the same resources. The DQN architecture is enhanced with prioritized experience replay for efficient learning, n-step returns for better credit assignment, double DQN to reduce overestimation bias, Huber loss for robust gradient computation, and soft target updates for stable learning dynamics.

## Key Results
- Proposed MARL approach outperforms baseline heuristics in reducing makespan and tardiness
- Framework demonstrates effective adaptation to stochastic events including machine breakdowns
- Improved machine utilization achieved through coordinated agent negotiation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The negotiation-based MARL approach works by enabling agents to learn from collective experiences while maintaining decentralized decision-making. The attention mechanism allows agents to focus on relevant interactions during negotiation, reducing computational complexity. DQN enhancements collectively stabilize learning by addressing common reinforcement learning challenges: experience replay prevents forgetting, n-step returns improve long-term credit assignment, double DQN reduces value overestimation, Huber loss provides robust optimization, and soft target updates prevent divergence.

## Foundational Learning
- **Centralized training, decentralized execution** - Why needed: Enables learning coordinated policies while maintaining operational independence. Quick check: Verify agents can achieve near-optimal performance without communication during execution.
- **Attention mechanisms in MARL** - Why needed: Reduces computational complexity by focusing on relevant agent interactions. Quick check: Measure attention weight distributions to ensure meaningful agent prioritization.
- **Prioritized experience replay** - Why needed: Improves sample efficiency by focusing on important transitions. Quick check: Compare learning curves with and without prioritization.
- **N-step returns** - Why needed: Better credit assignment for delayed rewards in manufacturing scheduling. Quick check: Verify improved long-term planning compared to single-step returns.
- **Double DQN** - Why needed: Prevents overestimation bias in value estimation. Quick check: Compare value estimates with and without double DQN to detect bias reduction.
- **Huber loss** - Why needed: Provides robust optimization less sensitive to outliers. Quick check: Monitor gradient stability during training.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Environment -> Observation preprocessor -> DQN agents -> Attention negotiator -> Action executor -> Reward generator

Critical path: State observation → DQN inference → Negotiation resolution → Action execution → Reward collection → Experience storage

Design tradeoffs: Centralized training provides better coordination learning but requires more memory; decentralized execution enables scalability but may miss global optima; attention negotiation balances communication overhead with decision quality.

Failure signatures: Poor negotiation convergence indicates attention mechanism misconfiguration; unstable learning suggests inadequate DQN enhancements; suboptimal scheduling reveals insufficient exploration or reward shaping issues.

First experiments:
1. Train single agent without negotiation to establish baseline performance
2. Enable negotiation but disable attention mechanism to measure its impact
3. Gradually add DQN enhancements to identify their individual contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No comparison with alternative MARL frameworks to assess negotiation mechanism's relative effectiveness
- Limited scalability analysis - only tested on small to medium-sized problem instances
- Lack of real-world RMS data validation, relying entirely on synthetic simulations

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Performance improvements over heuristic baselines
- **Medium confidence:** Stability improvements from DQN enhancements (no ablation studies)
- **Medium confidence:** Adaptability to stochastic events (limited testing scenarios)

## Next Checks
1. Implement real-world RMS testing to validate simulation results
2. Conduct scalability experiments with larger problem instances and more complex machine configurations
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify individual impact of each DQN enhancement on learning stability and performance
