# VC4VG: Optimizing Video Captions for Text-to-Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.24134
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24134
- **Reference count**: 14
- **Primary result**: Proposes VC4VG framework for optimizing video captions through five-dimensional decomposition, achieving strong correlation between caption quality and T2V generation performance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating high-quality video captions for text-to-video (T2V) systems. The authors identify that current captioning methods struggle with four key issues: lacking visual details, insufficient temporal context, poor stylistic control, and vague semantic references. To address these limitations, they propose VC4VG, a comprehensive framework that decomposes video captioning into five essential dimensions: subject attributes, environmental context, motion dynamics, camera parameters, and stylization. Through systematic optimization and fine-tuning experiments, the authors demonstrate that their approach significantly improves both caption quality and downstream T2V generation performance.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce VC4VG as a framework that decomposes video captioning into five key dimensions: subject attributes, environmental context, motion dynamics, camera parameters, and stylization. They propose a multi-stage optimization pipeline that includes manual annotations, automatic quality enhancement, reinforcement learning fine-tuning, and rule-based generation. To evaluate their approach, they create VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring 1,000 human-verified QA pairs and an automated evaluation protocol. The team develops LLaV A-Video-Gen, their optimized captioner, which undergoes extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments. Results show strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation performance, with their model achieving 804/57.0 total score on VC4VG-Bench and outperforming baseline captioners in VBench evaluations and human assessments.

## Key Results
- Achieves 804/57.0 total score on VC4VG-Bench, demonstrating strong performance in optimized video captioning
- Shows strong correlation between caption quality improvements and T2V generation performance through systematic fine-tuning experiments
- Outperforms baseline captioners in VBench evaluations and human assessments, validating the effectiveness of the five-dimensional decomposition approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by addressing fundamental limitations in current video captioning approaches through systematic decomposition. By breaking down video content into five distinct dimensions (subject attributes, environmental context, motion dynamics, camera parameters, and stylization), the model can capture both the essential details needed for accurate video generation and the stylistic elements that make captions more natural and controllable. The multi-stage optimization pipeline ensures that captions are not only detailed but also temporally coherent and stylistically appropriate for the target T2V models.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
LLaV A-Video-Gen -> VC4VG-Bench -> VBench Evaluation -> Human Assessment

**Critical Path**
The critical path involves: (1) caption generation using the five-dimensional decomposition, (2) quality enhancement through the multi-stage optimization pipeline, (3) T2V fine-tuning experiments, and (4) evaluation using both automated benchmarks and human assessments.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The framework prioritizes detailed caption generation over computational efficiency, requiring substantial fine-tuning resources. The five-dimensional decomposition adds complexity but provides better control over generated content. The human-verified benchmark ensures quality but limits scalability compared to fully automated evaluation methods.

**Failure Signatures**
Poor performance typically manifests as: (1) missing critical visual details in generated videos, (2) temporal incoherence between caption elements, (3) stylistic inconsistencies, or (4) failure to capture complex camera movements. These failures often stem from insufficient training data in specific dimensions or inadequate fine-tuning.

**First Experiments**
1. Evaluate baseline caption quality on VC4VG-Bench before any optimization
2. Test five-dimensional decomposition effectiveness on simple video scenarios
3. Run initial T2V fine-tuning with optimized captions to establish baseline performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations

- Evaluation focuses primarily on static camera setups and common object categories, with limited exploration of complex camera motions or rare visual concepts
- Human evaluation sample size (n=50) may not capture broader perceptual variations across diverse user populations
- Reliance on a single T2V model family (Pika) for fine-tuning experiments may limit architectural generalization

## Confidence

**High**: Correlation between caption optimization and generation quality improvements
**High**: Effectiveness of the five-dimensional decomposition approach
**Medium**: Generalization across different T2V model architectures
**Medium**: Performance with highly complex or abstract visual concepts

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate VC4VG-Bench performance across multiple T2V model families beyond Pika to assess architectural generalization
2. Conduct human evaluations with larger sample sizes (n>100) across diverse demographic groups to validate naturalness assessments
3. Test the framework's effectiveness on videos with complex camera movements and rare object categories not well-represented in current training data
