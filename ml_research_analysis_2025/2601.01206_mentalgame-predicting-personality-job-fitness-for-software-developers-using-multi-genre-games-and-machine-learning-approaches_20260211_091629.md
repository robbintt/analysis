# MentalGame: Predicting Personality-Job Fitness for Software Developers Using Multi-Genre Games and Machine Learning Approaches

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01206
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01206
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 97% precision and 94% accuracy in predicting software development suitability from gameplay behavior alone

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MentalGame, a game-based personality assessment framework that predicts software development suitability through multi-genre serious games and machine learning. The approach combines a custom mobile game with MBTI personality assessment and behavioral analytics, collecting fine-grained gameplay event data from 132 participants. Using a two-phase modeling approach that first labels suitability using personality features then predicts suitability from gameplay behavior alone, the method achieves up to 97% precision and 94% accuracy. The framework offers a scalable, engaging alternative to traditional career assessment methods that relies on implicit behavioral traces rather than explicit personality testing.

## Method Summary
The MentalGame framework uses a two-phase machine learning approach to predict software development suitability. Phase 1 labels suitability using MBTI personality features, achieving 80% accuracy. Phase 2 predicts suitability from gameplay behavior alone using LDA dimensionality reduction followed by MLP classification with random oversampling. The system collects ~120 behavioral features from five game types, including action counts, time measures, retries, pauses, and menu navigation patterns. Stratified k-fold cross-validation evaluates performance, with the best pipeline achieving 97% precision and 94% accuracy.

## Key Results
- Binary classification achieved 97% precision and 94% accuracy in predicting software development suitability
- Behavioral analysis revealed distinct patterns: suitable candidates showed more wins in puzzle games, more side challenges, frequent menu navigation, and fewer pauses, retries, and surrender actions
- The two-phase approach successfully predicted suitability without requiring explicit personality questionnaires in the final model
- LDA dimensionality reduction followed by MLP classification with oversampling proved most effective for this task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages implicit behavioral traces captured during gameplay that correlate with personality traits relevant to software development. By analyzing fine-grained gameplay events across multiple genres, the system identifies patterns that distinguish suitable candidates, such as persistence (fewer surrenders), engagement (more menu interactions), and problem-solving approaches (more wins in logic puzzles). The two-phase approach ensures robust labeling before learning behavioral predictors, while LDA reduction helps extract the most relevant features for classification.

## Foundational Learning
- **MBTI personality assessment**: Used to establish ground truth suitability labels; needed because it provides standardized personality dimensions correlated with job performance; quick check: verify MBTI dimensions map appropriately to software developer traits
- **Serious games for assessment**: Multi-genre games designed to elicit behavioral patterns; needed to capture diverse aspects of cognitive and personality traits; quick check: ensure each game targets specific developer-relevant skills
- **Behavioral analytics from gameplay**: Fine-grained event logging (pauses, retries, wins, menu navigation); needed to extract implicit indicators of personality and capability; quick check: validate feature extraction captures meaningful behavioral differences
- **Two-phase machine learning**: First label data using personality features, then predict from behavior alone; needed to bootstrap training when labeled behavior data is limited; quick check: verify phase 1 accuracy is sufficient before proceeding to phase 2
- **Dimensionality reduction (LDA)**: Supervised reduction to extract relevant features; needed to handle high-dimensional behavioral data and improve classifier performance; quick check: confirm reduction preserves class separability
- **MLP with oversampling**: Neural network classification with minority class balancing; needed to handle imbalanced datasets and capture complex patterns; quick check: verify oversampling doesn't introduce overfitting

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Game Sessions -> Behavioral Feature Extraction -> MBTI Labeling -> LDA Reduction -> MLP Classifier -> Suitability Prediction

**Critical Path:** Gameplay Data Collection → Feature Engineering → Two-Phase Training → Prediction Output

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades immediate interpretability for predictive power, using neural networks that achieve high accuracy but provide limited transparency. The two-phase approach requires initial personality assessment but enables behavior-only prediction later. Multi-genre games increase ecological validity but add implementation complexity.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance indicates either insufficient behavioral signal in the games, inadequate labeling in Phase 1, or overfitting due to small labeled samples. Class imbalance may cause the model to predict only the majority class.

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Replicate Phase 2 classification pipeline with multiple random seeds to assess result stability
2. Conduct feature importance analysis to identify which behavioral patterns drive predictions
3. Apply trained classifier to independent software developer samples to validate real-world performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can the framework predict actual long-term job performance rather than inferred suitability? The study relied on 39 verified labels from self-reported background and expert judgment rather than objective performance data or career tracking. This requires longitudinal data correlating gameplay predictions with workplace metrics like code quality or performance reviews.

**Open Question 2:** How can explainable AI techniques be integrated to transparently link gameplay behaviors to predictions? The neural network provides limited transparency about which specific behavioral patterns drive individual decisions. Implementing SHAP or feature-attribution analyses could provide interpretable feature importance rankings.

**Open Question 3:** Can the multi-genre game mechanics be recalibrated for professions outside software development? The current game stages were optimized specifically for software developer traits like logical reasoning and planning. Application to different career paths with distinct trait requirements would require recalibrating trait mappings.

## Limitations

- Small ground-truth labeled subset (n=39) constrains reliability of classification results
- Underspecified MLP architecture details make exact reproduction difficult
- Cross-validation parameters (fold count, random seed) not reported, affecting reproducibility
- Limited generalizability to professions beyond software development
- Convenience sampling may introduce demographic bias not fully accounted for

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Framework concept and observed behavioral patterns distinguishing suitable candidates
- **Medium Confidence:** Reported 97% precision and 94% accuracy figures based on small labeled sample
- **Low Confidence:** Exact reproduction due to underspecified model architecture and preprocessing details

## Next Checks

1. Replicate Phase 2 classification pipeline on the same dataset using multiple random seeds and different k-fold values to assess result stability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing individual game types or feature categories to quantify their contribution to prediction performance
3. Test model generalization by applying the trained classifier to an independent sample of software developers with known job performance metrics
