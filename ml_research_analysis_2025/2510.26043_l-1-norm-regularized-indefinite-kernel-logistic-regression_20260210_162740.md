# $L_1$-norm Regularized Indefinite Kernel Logistic Regression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.26043
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26043
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes an L1-norm regularized indefinite kernel logistic regression (RIKLR) model that extends the IKLR framework by incorporating an L1-norm penalty for sparsity.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces L1-norm regularized indefinite kernel logistic regression (RIKLR), a method that combines indefinite kernel learning with L1-norm regularization to achieve both accurate classification and sparse feature selection. The approach addresses the challenge of learning with indefinite kernels while promoting sparsity in the solution. A proximal linearized algorithm is developed to handle the nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods on six benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
The RIKLR model extends IKLR by adding an L1-norm penalty to encourage sparsity. The method uses a TL1 indefinite kernel with η = 0.7d and RBF kernel, with hyperparameters λ, λ₁, σ selected via 5-fold cross-validation. The optimization employs a proximal linearized algorithm (PLA) with DC decomposition, solving a convex subproblem using CVXR R package. The algorithm iterates until convergence with thresholds τ = 10⁻⁶, γₖ = 1, ε = 10⁻⁴, and sets coefficients below 10⁻¹⁰ to zero for sparsity.

## Key Results
- Achieves 2-4% accuracy improvement over KLR, L1-norm RKLR, and IKLR
- Selects 60-90% fewer features while maintaining or improving accuracy
- Validated on six UCI/Kaggle datasets with 50/50 train-test splits, 10 repetitions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by decomposing the indefinite kernel into positive and negative parts, then using proximal linearization to handle the nonconvex optimization problem. The L1-norm regularization promotes sparsity by driving small coefficients to zero, while the indefinite kernel structure allows learning from similarity measures that may not be positive semi-definite. The DC decomposition enables the use of convex optimization techniques within an iterative framework.

## Foundational Learning
- **Indefinite kernels**: Similarity measures that are not positive semi-definite, needed when working with non-metric or inconsistent similarity data
- **DC decomposition**: Difference of convex functions, used to convert nonconvex problems into solvable convex subproblems
- **Proximal linearization**: Iterative optimization technique for nonsmooth functions, needed to handle the L1-norm penalty
- **Eigenvalue decomposition**: Matrix factorization technique required to decompose the indefinite kernel into positive and negative parts
- **CVXR optimization**: Convex optimization package for solving the inner subproblems, essential for the algorithm's implementation
- **Quick check**: Verify that K⁺ and K⁻ are positive definite by checking eigenvalues after decomposition

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: TL1 kernel computation -> Eigenvalue decomposition -> K⁺/K⁻ construction -> PLA initialization -> Subproblem solving -> Convergence check
- **Critical path**: Kernel computation → Eigen decomposition → DC decomposition → PLA iterations → Sparsity thresholding
- **Design tradeoffs**: Computational cost of full eigenvalue decomposition vs. accuracy benefits of indefinite kernel learning; sparsity vs. classification accuracy
- **Failure signatures**: Non-convergence due to poor τ selection; all coefficients remain non-zero (increase λ₁); numerical instability in eigenvalue decomposition
- **First experiments**: 1) Test convergence with different τ values; 2) Verify eigenvalue decomposition produces positive definite K⁺/K⁻; 3) Check sparsity threshold sensitivity with different coefficient cutoffs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the optimization framework be extended to handle nonconvex penalty functions (e.g., SCAD, L₁/₂-norm) while maintaining convergence guarantees?
- How can the model be adapted for large-scale datasets where full eigenvalue decomposition is computationally prohibitive?
- Can global convergence be guaranteed under weaker conditions than ρ > 2L?

## Limitations
- Computational cost of full eigenvalue decomposition limits scalability to medium datasets
- Unspecified data preprocessing and initialization may affect reproducibility
- Reliance on DC decomposition and proximal linearization requires careful implementation

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical framework and algorithmic approach
- Medium confidence in experimental methodology due to unspecified details
- Medium confidence in sparsity claims requiring verification

## Next Checks
1. Implement multiple random initializations and compare convergence behavior
2. Independently implement KLR, L1-norm RKLR, and IKLR baselines for comparison
3. Test different sparsity threshold values to verify 60-90% feature selection claims
