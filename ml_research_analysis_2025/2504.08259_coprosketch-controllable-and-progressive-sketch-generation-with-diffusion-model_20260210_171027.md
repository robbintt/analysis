# CoProSketch: Controllable and Progressive Sketch Generation with Diffusion Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.08259
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08259
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces CoProSketch, a framework for controllable and progressive sketch generation using diffusion models, achieving superior semantic consistency and aesthetic quality compared to baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CoProSketch, a framework for controllable and progressive sketch generation using diffusion models. The core challenge addressed is generating high-quality, controllable sketches from text prompts, which remains underexplored despite advancements in image generation. The method represents sketches as unsigned distance fields (UDF) rather than binary images, enabling smoother and more continuous representations that are easier to decode into sketches. The pipeline generates sketches progressively: starting from a bounding box and text prompt to produce a rough sketch, allowing manual editing, and then refining into a detailed sketch. A large-scale text-sketch paired dataset with 100k samples is curated to train the model. Experiments show that CoProSketch outperforms baselines in semantic consistency (CLIP score of 0.245 vs. 0.210–0.227) and aesthetic quality (aesthetic score of 4.256 vs. 3.734–4.127), demonstrating superior controllability and practical applicability.

## Method Summary
CoProSketch leverages diffusion models to generate sketches in a progressive manner, starting from a bounding box and text prompt. The framework uses unsigned distance fields (UDF) to represent sketches, which provides a smoother and more continuous representation compared to binary images. The pipeline involves generating a rough sketch, allowing manual editing, and then refining it into a detailed sketch. The model is trained on a large-scale text-sketch paired dataset with 100k samples. The UDF representation facilitates easier decoding into sketches, and the progressive generation approach enables better control and refinement of the output.

## Key Results
- CoProSketch achieves a CLIP score of 0.245, outperforming baselines (0.210–0.227) in semantic consistency.
- The model scores an aesthetic score of 4.256, surpassing baselines (3.734–4.127) in aesthetic quality.
- The progressive generation approach, combined with UDF representation, enables superior controllability and practical applicability in sketch generation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CoProSketch works by leveraging diffusion models to generate sketches in a progressive manner, starting from a bounding box and text prompt. The use of unsigned distance fields (UDF) as a representation allows for smoother and more continuous sketches, which are easier to decode and refine. The progressive generation approach, which includes manual editing, provides better control over the output and ensures higher quality results. The large-scale text-sketch paired dataset enables effective training of the model, leading to improved semantic consistency and aesthetic quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Unsigned Distance Fields (UDF)**: UDF represents the distance from each pixel to the nearest edge in a sketch, providing a continuous representation. This is needed to enable smoother and more detailed sketches compared to binary images. Quick check: Verify that UDF representation improves the quality of generated sketches compared to binary representations.
- **Diffusion Models**: Diffusion models generate data by gradually denoising a random noise signal. This is needed to produce high-quality sketches from text prompts. Quick check: Ensure that the diffusion model effectively denoises the input to generate coherent sketches.
- **Progressive Generation**: Progressive generation involves generating sketches in stages, starting from a rough outline and refining it into a detailed sketch. This is needed to provide better control and refinement of the output. Quick check: Validate that the progressive approach improves the controllability and quality of the generated sketches.
- **Text-Sketch Paired Dataset**: A large-scale dataset with paired text and sketch samples is used to train the model. This is needed to ensure the model learns the relationship between text prompts and sketches. Quick check: Confirm that the dataset is sufficiently diverse and representative of the target sketch styles.
- **CLIP Score**: CLIP score measures the semantic consistency between the generated sketch and the text prompt. This is needed to evaluate the alignment of the output with the input. Quick check: Verify that the CLIP score accurately reflects the semantic quality of the sketches.
- **Aesthetic Score**: Aesthetic score evaluates the visual quality and appeal of the generated sketches. This is needed to assess the artistic quality of the output. Quick check: Ensure that the aesthetic score aligns with human preferences and expectations.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Text prompt + Bounding box -> Rough sketch generation -> Manual editing -> Detailed sketch refinement -> Final output
- **Critical Path**: The critical path involves the progressive generation of sketches, starting from the text prompt and bounding box, through rough sketch generation, manual editing, and detailed refinement.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The use of UDF representation and progressive generation provides better control and quality but may increase computational complexity. The reliance on manual editing in the intermediate stage could limit automation but enhances controllability.
- **Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include poor generalization to out-of-distribution prompts, challenges in real-time generation, and subjective variability in aesthetic scores.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Evaluate the model on a broader dataset to assess robustness and scalability. 2) Measure computational efficiency for real-time applications. 3) Conduct a user study to validate aesthetic scores across diverse preferences.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How well does the model generalize to out-of-distribution prompts or highly complex sketches involving multiple objects or intricate details?
- Can the progressive generation approach handle rapid or real-time sketch generation effectively?
- How does the reliance on manual editing in the intermediate stage impact the model's applicability in fully automated workflows?
- Does the CLIP-based semantic consistency metric fully capture the nuanced quality of sketches, particularly in terms of stroke-level details or artistic style?
- How subjective is the aesthetic score, and does it vary across different user preferences or cultural contexts?

## Limitations
- The scalability and robustness of the UDF representation for diverse sketch styles remain uncertain.
- The model's performance on out-of-distribution prompts and highly complex sketches is unclear.
- The progressive generation approach may face challenges in real-time or fully automated workflows.
- The reliance on manual editing could limit the model's applicability in automated scenarios.
- The CLIP-based semantic consistency metric may not fully capture stroke-level details or artistic style.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The claim that CoProSketch outperforms baseline models in semantic consistency (CLIP score of 0.245) and aesthetic quality (aesthetic score of 4.256) is supported by the reported experimental results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that the UDF representation enables smoother and more continuous sketches is plausible but requires further validation across diverse sketch types and styles.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the model to out-of-distribution prompts and its performance in real-time or fully automated workflows remain speculative without additional empirical evidence.

## Next Checks
1. **Generalization Testing**: Evaluate CoProSketch on a broader, more diverse dataset of text-sketch pairs, including prompts with multiple objects, complex scenes, and abstract concepts, to assess its robustness and scalability.
2. **Real-Time Performance**: Measure the computational efficiency of the progressive generation pipeline, particularly the time required for each stage, to determine its suitability for real-time or interactive applications.
3. **User Preference Study**: Conduct a large-scale user study to validate the aesthetic score results, incorporating diverse user preferences and cultural contexts to ensure the model’s outputs align with human expectations of quality and style.
