# Language translation, and change of accent for speech-to-speech task using diffusion model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.04639
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04639
- Reference count: 8
- This work proposes a diffusion-based framework for simultaneous language translation and accent adaptation in speech-to-speech tasks, achieving strong baseline TTS performance while identifying cascading errors as a key challenge for full S2ST pipelines.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of simultaneous language translation and accent adaptation in speech-to-speech tasks using a diffusion-based framework. The authors reformulate the problem as conditional generation, where target speech is generated from source phonemes using GradTTS, a diffusion-based TTS model. The approach leverages the high-fidelity generation capabilities of diffusion models while maintaining speaker identity and adapting to multilingual scenarios. Experimental results on LJSpeech and IndicTTS datasets demonstrate strong baseline performance but reveal cascading errors as a key challenge for the full S2ST pipeline.

## Method Summary
The method adapts GradTTS, a diffusion-based text-to-speech model, to handle simultaneous language translation and accent adaptation. The framework generates target speech conditioned on source phonemes rather than requiring source acoustic features, based on the independence assumption that target phonemes and acoustics are independent of source acoustics given source phonemes. Training uses three losses (encoder alignment, duration prediction, diffusion denoising) with iterative refinement through Monotonic Alignment Search. The model is evaluated on LJSpeech (English) and IndicTTS (Hindi) datasets, with speaker similarity measured via ASV score and word error rate via ASR.

## Key Results
- Baseline TTS on LJSpeech achieves strong performance (ASV: 0.8277, WER: 8.51%)
- Multilingual training with speaker ID control improves Hindi speaker similarity from 0.3105 to 0.6504
- Cross-lingual TTS shows significant degradation (WER: 92.49%) due to unseen Hindi tokenizers
- Full S2ST pipeline suffers from cascading errors, reducing overall quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Language translation and accent adaptation can be reformulated as conditional generation where target speech is generated from source phonemes rather than source acoustic features.
- Mechanism: Mathematical derivation shows that under the assumption (pt, at) ⊥ as | ps, the conditional distribution simplifies to P(ft | fs) = P(ft | ps), allowing generation conditioned only on phonemic content.
- Core assumption: Target phonemes and acoustic features are independent of source acoustic features given source phonemes.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "reformulates the problem as a conditional generation task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target speech features"; Section 3.1 provides full derivation using law of total probability.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Diffusion models enable high-fidelity mel-spectrogram generation by learning to reverse a gradual noising process, conditioned on aligned phoneme representations.
- Mechanism: Forward diffusion gradually adds Gaussian noise until reaching N(μ, Σ), while reverse diffusion trains a U-Net to estimate the score function sθ(Xt, μ, t) that guides denoising. Aligned phoneme representations condition the generative process.
- Core assumption: The score function can be adequately approximated by a neural network, and the noise schedule properly balances quality vs. convergence.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for high-fidelity generational capabilities"; Section 3.2.2 details score-based training objective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework adapts text-to-image diffusion strategies by treating source transcriptions as conditioning "prompts" and mel-spectrograms as the "image" output.
- Mechanism: The paper explicitly draws analogy to text-to-image models: phoneme sequences → text prompts, mel-spectrograms → images, allowing leveraging conditioning techniques from vision.
- Core assumption: Mel-spectrograms share sufficient structural properties with images that text-to-image conditioning strategies transfer effectively.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "we adapt text-to-image diffusion strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel spectrograms"; Section 4.2 explains the analogy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Score-based diffusion models and SDE formulation**: Why needed here: The entire generative mechanism rests on understanding forward/reverse SDEs, score function estimation, and how conditioning modifies the denoising trajectory. Quick check question: Can you explain why ∇ log pt(Xt) is called the "score function" and how it guides the reverse process?

- **Phoneme-to-frame alignment via duration prediction**: Why needed here: GradTTS requires expanding phoneme representations to match spectrogram frame resolution using predicted durations. Quick check question: Why does the duration predictor use log(Σ I{A*(j)=i}) rather than raw frame counts?

- **Monotonic Alignment Search (MAS)**: Why needed here: Training alternates between computing optimal alignment A* via MAS and updating model parameters. Quick check question: Why must alignment be monotonic for text-to-speech, and what would happen if it weren't?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Text → Phoneme Extraction → Encoder → μ̃ (phoneme latents) → Duration Predictor → μ (aligned latents) → Noise XT ~ N(μ, I) → U-Net Decoder (score estimation) → X0 (mel-spectrogram) → HiFi-GAN Vocoder → Audio Waveform

- Critical path: Phoneme alignment quality (MAS + duration predictor accuracy) determines temporal coherence; score function estimation quality determines spectral fidelity; vocoder quality determines final audio naturalness.

- Design tradeoffs: Pipeline vs. end-to-end (cascading errors remain a challenge); diffusion steps vs. latency (computational cost significantly higher than traditional autoregressive models); speaker ID control vs. data requirements (improves Hindi ASV but requires speaker-labeled training data).

- Failure signatures: Cross-lingual tokenizer mismatch (92.49% WER in cross-language TTS); accent-language misalignment (poor ASV when Hindi speech assigned to English speakers); pipeline error accumulation (less quality due to cascading errors).

- First 3 experiments: 1) Baseline TTS validation on LJSpeech only to confirm GradTTS implementation correctness; 2) Ablate independence assumption by testing whether source acoustic features improve accent naturalness; 3) Cross-lingual tokenizer bridge evaluation before full cross-lingual TTS.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can ASR, machine translation, and TTS be effectively combined into a single unified model to eliminate cascading errors in the S2ST pipeline?** Basis: "cascading the models leads to cascading errors. To minimize this error, we will explore methods to combine the ASR, machine translation and TTS into a single model." Unresolved because current pipeline uses separate components sequentially, compounding errors at each stage.

- **What lightweight diffusion variants or hybrid architectures can reduce inference latency while preserving speech generation quality?** Basis: "computational cost of training and inference with diffusion models is significantly higher compared to traditional autoregressive models, which may hinder real-time deployment." Unresolved because GradTTS requires iterative denoising steps, making it computationally expensive compared to alternatives.

- **How can accent transfer quality be maintained for low-resource languages and unseen accent combinations?** Basis: "quality of accent transfer can degrade for low-resource languages or unseen accents due to limited data diversity." Unresolved because model tested only on LJSpeech and IndicTTS, with poor cross-lingual TTS performance when Hindi tokenizers were unseen during training.

## Limitations

- Diffusion hyperparameter sensitivity: Critical hyperparameters including number of timesteps, noise schedule parameters, ODE solver configuration, and U-Net architecture are unspecified, significantly impacting quality and computational cost.
- Independence assumption validity: The core theoretical mechanism relies on an assumption that shows practical limitations in cross-lingual scenarios, evidenced by 92.49% WER when Hindi tokenizers were unseen during training.
- Pipeline error propagation: Full S2ST pipeline demonstrates "cascading errors remain a challenge" with significant quality degradation, indicating the diffusion-based TTS component alone performs well but integration with ASR and MT components creates substantial quality loss.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Baseline TTS performance (ASV: 0.8277, WER: 8.51%) is well-supported by experimental results, demonstrating sound GradTTS implementation for single-language, single-speaker scenarios.

**Medium confidence**: Multilingual and cross-lingual capabilities are demonstrated but with significant limitations. Speaker ID control improves Hindi ASV from 0.3105 to 0.6504, but this remains below baseline English performance. Cross-lingual WER of 92.49% indicates the approach doesn't yet solve the fundamental language transfer problem.

**Low confidence**: The claim that diffusion models enable effective simultaneous language translation and accent adaptation is supported by theoretical derivation but limited by practical implementation challenges. The independence assumption, while mathematically elegant, shows practical limitations in cross-lingual scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablate the independence assumption**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing the proposed diffusion model with and without conditioning on source acoustic features (prosody). If providing source prosody as additional conditioning improves accent naturalness or reduces cross-lingual WER, this would challenge the theoretical foundation.

2. **Cross-lingual tokenizer bridge evaluation**: Before attempting full cross-lingual TTS, implement and evaluate a comprehensive transliteration or phonetic transcription bridge between English and Hindi phoneme sets. Measure WER improvement when using a unified or expanded tokenizer that explicitly handles cross-lingual phoneme mapping.

3. **Component error analysis for S2ST pipeline**: Break down the full S2ST pipeline performance by isolating each component. Measure ASR transcription accuracy, MT translation quality (BLEU/TER scores), and TTS synthesis quality separately to quantify how much of the "cascading errors" stems from each stage.
