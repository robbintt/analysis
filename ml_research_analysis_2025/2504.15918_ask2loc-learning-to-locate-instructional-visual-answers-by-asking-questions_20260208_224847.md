# Ask2Loc: Learning to Locate Instructional Visual Answers by Asking Questions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.15918
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15918
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Ask2Loc improves mIoU by up to 14.91 over end-to-end and two-stage methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Ask2Loc, a framework that addresses the challenge of locating instructional visual answers in videos by simulating natural human-video interactions. Traditional visual answer localization methods often fail to capture user intent due to ambiguity, incomplete language, and fragmented content. Ask2Loc tackles these issues through three interactive modules: a chatting module that refines questions using multi-turn dialogue, a rewriting module that generates fluent and complete descriptions, and a searching module that expands context by identifying relevant video segments. Experiments on three reconstructed datasets show that Ask2Loc improves mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) by up to 14.91 compared to end-to-end and two-stage methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing more accurate and user-aligned visual answers.

## Method Summary
Ask2Loc is a three-stage pipeline for Interactive Visual Answer Localization (In-VAL). It first uses GPT-4o to generate 3 rounds of yes/no clarification questions to refine user intent. Then Llama3.1-8B rewrites questions and subtitles for completeness and fluency. Next, a fine-tuned BERT model retrieves top-3 context segments via cosine similarity. Finally, ModernBERT fuses visual and text features for binary classification of each segment. The framework is trained on three reconstructed datasets (In-MedVidQA, In-VehicleQA, In-CMIVQA) and evaluated using mIoU and R@1 metrics.

## Key Results
- Ask2Loc achieves 14.91 mIoU improvement over end-to-end and two-stage baselines
- The interactive chatting module provides 2.71 mIoU gain by refining ambiguous queries
- Context expansion via relevant segment retrieval improves localization accuracy by 1.28 mIoU

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Iterative Intent Refinement via Boolean Dialogue
- **Claim:** If user intent is ambiguous in the initial query, iterative yes/no questioning can progressively align the query semantics with video content, improving localization accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** The system employs an LLM (GPT-4o) to act as a questioning agent. It generates a follow-up yes/no question $Q_r$ based on the initial question $Q$, full subtitles, and dialogue history $D_{r-1}$. A second agent simulates the user response. This loop prunes irrelevant semantic paths and narrows down the specific intent before localization attempts begin.
- **Core assumption:** The "simulated user" agent (or real user in application) provides answers consistent with the ground truth visual content, and the LLM can effectively hypothesize relevant constraints based on the subtitle text.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "a chatting module to refine initial questions and uncover clear intentions"
  - [section 3.2.1] "By leveraging the content of a video, users ask themselves a series of questions to gradually clarify their intents... we prompt an LLM... as the questioning agent."
  - [corpus] While the specific Ask2Loc loop is novel, corpus neighbor [66280] supports the general principle that "Asking Clarifying Questions" is effective for preference elicitation when history is limited.
- **Break condition:** The mechanism likely fails if the initial question is technically precise but the video subtitles lack the specific vocabulary required for the LLM to generate relevant discriminatory questions, leading to circular dialogue.

### Mechanism 2: Contextual Rewriting for Semantic Completeness
- **Claim:** Fragmented subtitles can be elevated to fluent, complete descriptions if rewritten in the context of the full video transcript, reducing modality mismatch.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of using raw, often grammatically broken subtitles $S_i$, the system prompts an LLM (Llama 3.1-8B) with the specific subtitle and the *entire* video subtitle sequence. The LLM generates a "fluent and concise description" $S'_i$. This reconstructs missing linguistic context that visual features alone might not capture (e.g., "what" is happening implies "why" based on earlier steps).
- **Core assumption:** The LLM possesses sufficient domain knowledge (e.g., medical or mechanical) to infer missing context from text alone without visual input during the rewriting phase.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "a rewriting module that generates fluent and complete descriptions"
  - [section 3.2.2] "We solve the above problems by employing rewriting with an LLM... asking an LLM with 'What is being described... according to the complete video subtitles?'"
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence for this specific rewriting mechanism is weak; neighbors focus more on multimodal alignment [19508] rather than text-based reconstruction of subtitles.
- **Break condition:** The mechanism degrades if the video relies heavily on visual demonstrations (e.g., silent physical therapy) where subtitles are sparse or non-existent, leaving the text-to-text rewriting model without source material.

### Mechanism 3: Relevance-Based Context Expansion
- **Claim:** Localization accuracy improves if the model assesses a video segment not in isolation, but alongside other segments identified as semantically relevant to the query.
- **Mechanism:** A PLM (BERT) is fine-tuned to classify the relevance between subtitle pairs (one inside, one outside the answer span). During inference, for a target segment, the system retrieves the top-$k$ most similar segments ($C_i$) from the video based on cosine similarity of embeddings. These are concatenated with the current segment's features before classification.
- **Core assumption:** Visual answers tend to be semantically clustered or coherent, such that "relevant" non-adjacent segments provide signal rather than noise regarding the current segment's status.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "a searching module that expands context by identifying relevant video segments"
  - [section 3.2.3] "We aim to leverage a pre-trained language model (PLM) to identify any other segments that are similar... thereby expanding the context."
  - [corpus] Neighbor [106375] (LeAdQA) supports the general need for context-aware temporal grounding to reason over sparse critical moments.
- **Break condition:** This introduces noise if the video contains repetitive but non-answer segments (e.g., intro/outro screens repeated multiple times) that are semantically similar but irrelevant to the specific instructional step.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Visual Answer Localization (VAL) vs. Temporal Grounding**
  - **Why needed here:** Unlike standard temporal grounding which finds a moment based on a description, VAL assumes the query is a *question* and the video must provide an *answer* (often multi-step).
  - **Quick check question:** Does the model predict a single timestamp, or a duration where the user's "how-to" question is visibly resolved?

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering for Role-Playing (LLM Agents)**
  - **Why needed here:** The "Chatting" module relies on a specific Boolean QA format where the LLM must act as an "AI assistant to help a user find out his/her true intention."
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish between a prompt asking the LLM to *answer* a question vs. a prompt asking the LLM to *generate* a clarifying question?

- **Concept: Multimodal Fusion (Late Fusion)**
  - **Why needed here:** The final detection uses a PLM to fuse projected visual features (from LLaVA) and textual features (rewritten subtitles). Understanding how these vectors are concatenated is vital for debugging.
  - **Quick check question:** Are visual and textual features combined before or after the PLM encoding layer? (Here: Visual features are projected and concatenated with *encoded* text context, then processed by a second PLM).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video → LLaVA-Next-Video (Visual Embeddings) + Whisper/OCR (Subtitles) → Interactive Pipeline (Chatting: GPT-4o + Subtitles → Refined Intent (Q'); Rewriting: Llama 3.1 + Subtitles → Fluent Descriptions (S'); Searching: Fine-tuned BERT → Context (C)) → Detection: ModernBERT (Fusion → Binary Classification)

- **Critical path:** The **Rewriting Module** is the data bottleneck. If the LLM rewrites a subtitle incorrectly (hallucinates an action not in the text), the Context Expansion and Final Detection modules will propagate this error. You must verify the quality of $S'$ before training the detector.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **LLM Choice:** The paper uses GPT-4o (API) for Chatting but Llama-3.1-8B (Local) for Rewriting. This trades the superior reasoning of GPT for the privacy/cost benefits of local deployment during the heavy batch-processing of subtitles.
  - **Classification Strategy:** The framework treats localization as a **segment-level binary classification** problem (Is this segment part of the answer? Yes/No) rather than a span-regression problem. This simplifies training but relies on post-processing (min/max timestamp lookup) to merge segments.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **The "Over-asking" Loop:** The Chatting module generates 3 rounds of questions by default. If the LLM hallucinates constraints not present in the video, the generated "Refined Intent" becomes too specific to match any video segment, resulting in low recall.
  - **Fragmentation Error:** If the `Searching` module retrieves context $C$ from a completely different part of the video (e.g., the "safety warning" intro while trying to locate "engine repair"), the fusion model may classify the segment as "not an answer" due to semantic conflict.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Zero-shot):** Run only the *Rewriting* and *Detection* modules. Skip Chatting and Searching. Establish a baseline mIoU using only raw subtitles vs. rewritten subtitles to quantify the value of the LLM "polishing."
  2. **Chat Ablation:** Manually inspect the synthetic dialogues generated by the Chatting module. Verify that the "AI User" agent is not answering "Yes" to contradictory questions. If it is, the simulation is flawed.
  3. **Context Sensitivity:** Vary the `top-k` hyperparameter in the Searching module (k=1, 3, 5). Plot mIoU vs. k to determine if adding more context helps or introduces noise (fragility check).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** How can the In-VAL framework dynamically determine the optimal number of interaction rounds and context expansion size rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters?
- **Open Question 2:** To what extent do the performance gains observed with LLM-simulated user dialogues transfer to scenarios involving real human interactions?
- **Open Question 3:** How robust is the Ask2Loc framework to hallucinations or noise introduced by the LLM during the subtitle and question rewriting phase?
- **Open Question 4:** Can the framework maintain high performance with smaller, more efficient language models to reduce the computational cost of the multi-stage interaction pipeline?

## Limitations
- The simulated user agent in the chatting module may generate inconsistent responses, potentially undermining intent refinement reliability
- Subtitle rewriting quality heavily depends on LLM performance with limited text input, with no visual grounding during rewriting
- Context expansion via BERT similarity search could introduce noise if video contains repetitive non-answer segments

## Confidence
- **High:** mIoU improvement metrics (14.91 gain) are well-defined and measurable
- **Medium:** Effectiveness of iterative clarification via LLM dialogue depends on simulation quality
- **Low:** Generalizability to videos with minimal or no subtitles remains uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Test on videos with minimal subtitles to evaluate rewriting module robustness
2. Manually audit synthetic dialogue outputs for consistency and relevance
3. Vary context expansion parameters (k values) to quantify noise vs. signal tradeoff
